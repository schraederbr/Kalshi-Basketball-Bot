just about ready for the opening ship here from NC State our officials tonight Roger Ayers Bert Smith and Clarence Armstrong and this is going to be an interesting matchup Sydney Curry for Louisville 68270 we talked about Burns six nine 275 dont often have two guys that big going against one another in the post this is a guards game anymore Google starts in the mantoman turquoibian Smith got a special season 04 NC State averaging over 18 points a game theyre getting into Burns right from the start and hes done a lot of that so far this season nice soft touch but you see Burns Smith tries to get that one but knocks it out of bounds Burns he had a chance to go right to the basket but he waited and he looks for his teammates and again hes got that little spin moves and hes got some conditioning issues at 275 he cant play he cant Sprint up and down for five or six minutes at a time but when hes in there hes really good you just saw the starting five for the Cardinals the key man number three just set the screen and now has the ball L Ellis a little bit of a homecoming for him from Durham North Carolina hes better do everything guy for Louisville they work it into Sydney curry in the post curry with a Wild Runner not there rebound by Jack Clark heres your starting five for the wolf pack tonight that was good defense by Burns that time Clark swings it to the corner its more cell for three I mean you can count that one but Marcel has that much time and distance particularly from the corner he is going to miss very few of them and hes a very high percentage threepoint shooter anyway Dannys shooting 47 from threepoint Reigns this season the senior from Fort Washington Maryland makes it fivenothing NC State and Kevin Keats in his sixth season now and like you said at the top of the broadcast you know Owen two to start in conference play but its so deceiving the way this group has played theyve been right in every single game I think a very dangerous team as you get a conference play here absolutely theres no question about it I mean they feel like they had a chance to steal one of my at Miami and that would have been a great win but they didnt get it and then they didnt feel like they played very well against Pitt but Pitt is a much improved team heres James for three offensive rebound and easy bucket for Brandon Huntley Hatfield to get Louisville in the scoring column tonight thats going to frustrate Kevin Keats a little bit really good defensive job forced a very tough shot but couldnt get the rebound how about the combination here of Smith and Joyner as he was saying before we came on the air and how those two have to have solid games together driving is Marcel got a shot blocked you see Louisville coming out and trying to trap Joyner and Smith make them give up the ball make somebody else handle heres Curry Powers his way inside for the Cardinals so far weve seen both teams go inside to their big guys I know you talked about how important that matchup is going to be here tonight DJ Burns and Sid Curry for Louisville heres a long three in the way Clark not there and rebounded by Brandon Connolly Hatfield now Louisvilles not looking to push necessarily in a racehorse style but theyd like to get it down and get it something going before the defense can get set as you look at Kenny Payne taking over and when we talked to him the Louisville graduate from back in 2003 just means a little bit more right hes here for the Long Haul trying to build this program back up to you know what he remembered when he was here and the success theyve had over the years and its going to take a little bit of time its going to take a little bit now that the cloud of potential NCAA tournament ban has been lifted then theyre going to have a little bit more success Im confident in their recruiting okay one of the greats in Danny Manning on the sideline with Nolan Smith and Josh Jameson the staff youre talking about for Louisville heres Louisville showing some pressure and what theyre trying to do there is just run a little bit of time off that shotgun curry with one of two of the line but the Cardinals is tied the game now walk Inside by Mike James on the drive from Smith James is a very hard worker hes a really competitive guy and theyre thinking that he can stay in front of on Smith not all the time but he did that time I think Rogers just said just play ball lets not be talking back in the Smith jumper no rebound Withers Jalen Withers and heres Ellis to set things up Applause going there Dan right kind of jumping in midair and not knowing sometimes where they want to go with the ball heres a step out on the sideline but weve seen that a lot this year from L Ellis Well Ellis is trying to do an awful lot of things and theres a big load on his shoulders life heres what were talking about theyve uh fortunate on that occasion that NC State did not get an opportunity for a runup last game for Louisville they actually had the fewest turnovers of the season with 10 and a 7567 loss to lips and heres Burns kicks it to the corner Clark oh wow Clark no Burns rejected again inside second block of the night for James Applause has really good recovery by Louisville because Burns thats what he wants to do he gets the ball down there they basically clear the side for him and if somebody comes to help he hes a very good pass Ellis directing traffic here four minutes gone by he bumps up a three and hes got it and Louisville has the lead eight to five and theyre on an eightnothing run after trailing 50 to start on that high screen particularly when Burns is the guy whos got to help Ellis is going to have an opening jarkel Joyner for NC State Wilson Steele Smith puts up the three a little short rebounded by Curry now Smith is a guy he can miss a couple Mike but Im telling you he can make eight in a row oh yes Ellis caught by Burns and is fouled and it takes us to our first time out of the night Louisvilles on top eight to five Dan you and I were down to Florida state in the Louisville loss to the Seminole 7553 but since then theyve come on now a little bit thanks a lot to this guy Well Ellis hes their do everything guy leads him in scoring leads him in assists and that 30 points in 10 assists thats the first time anybody from Louisvilles done that since Reese Gaines did it 20 years ago and theres his mom Tasha and brother Manny in the house here tonight 20 family and friends here to watch Al Ellis whos from Durham North Carolina went to Tallahassee Community College hes coming off that 24point effort the other night so those are the numbers over the last three games after that Florida State loss in which Louisvilles now won two of the last three but Ellis is a very quick player obviously hed get himself in the lane he can make a threepoint shot he cant create for other people but theres a big load on him trying to score Louisville struggles to score hes got four points in the game now somebody played all 40 minutes in the last game too they need him out there 95 Cardinals on top and the Wolf Pack have missed their last seven shots and a steal and thats a trial yeah thats a good call over there by Bert Smith whos all over it now see thats a turnover but its not a turnover that really hurts Louisville in terms of giving up an easy opportunity it hurts them in terms of moving losing a possession I think these all the possessions they can get well thats right I mean that that could potentially be a big swing there you know you got one you gotta steal you know which has been tough sledding for them usually they are the one turning it over so Dr quavion Smith comes off a screen right here hes double team Cuts away again stolen by Brandon Huntley had Withers takes it strong and Clarks got the rebound this is where NC State if they get an outlet they like to go jumper from sharkell Joyner and thats the way they want to play theyre not going to go every single time but if they can get a good Outlet or steal they can get up to court as quickly as anybody in this league trying to run the jumper JJ Trainor tracked out by Clark and got it to Joiner he told me earlier tonight before we came on its somewhat of a misconception that thats all they want to do was run and Gun not all the time NC State another nice block inside thats the third block tonight thats the first by Ellis well and the interesting thing there is that North Carolina State they want to attack and so you see Joyner and Smith driving the ball hard he actually lost his balance didnt really get the lift that he was looking for yeah Burns has gone out and so has Clark Ernest Ross is in the first time tonight and Ebenezer Guana well neither roster of the one or the kind of offensive players that guys just went out of the game and theres Smith missing another one thats some catch just dropped it though he tried to dribble at him and Let It Go es Withers down there that time Joyner kicks it to the corner wide open a three in and out that time from Ross offensive rebound Marcel Applause weve had some chances here well I think he can live with Ross shooting at three Applause Music over nine now to your point Applause both teams have been in the mantoman Louisville is trying to double team Smith when hes coming off the screen tonights crossover from Withers stays with it blocked inside out there by duwana and its gonna be wolf pack possession I Again Louisville getting to the offensive boards theyre not noted for their ability to rebound the ball offensively Music you know on the season they are a minus 20 minus 17 really coming in for offensive rebounds but theyve done a nice job being aggressive today theyve only out rebounded four of their opponents all season and three of those four were in the first three games of the year its hard to have a lot of really good numbers in that vein directions but that doesnt mean theyre not capable its tracked out again by Marcel because thats a rebound you have to have the one is a guy is not a jump shooter so its nice job to force him to shoot the jump shot oh Samanthas hat from behind by weathers now whats going on Music thats a hard foul but see if theyre going to do anything about that yeah Clarence Armstrong kind of got right in there one of our officials in the middle said no no guys and its a hard foul by Withers foreign Smith handed him the ball right Withers handed it right back okay all right so the officials called a double technical one on taquavion Smith and the other on Withers all right and this is this is a a new rule uh this year theyre going to shoot the common foul and with the double technicals theres not going to be any shots there so one more here for Smith next Friday afternoon college basketball triple Henner beginning with this game Pittsburgh and North Carolina starts at noon Eastern Friday December 30th right here on the ACC network and on the ESPN app so lets go to the win on Tuesday at Syracuse I was there for that one and then North Carolina its not one four in a row but North Carolina theyve recovered after losing four in a row but Im telling you the pit Panthers are one of the surprise teams in the ACC they have had a solid nonconference season you know much better than theyve been having recently theyve got guys who can score theyre an interesting looking team driving to the hole is Kamari Lance and he scores it for Louisville they lead it 118 Lance he does not have any problems on the offensive end he struggles sometimes on the defensive end of the fourth quarter you got to get in front of him because hell go all the way dewana nice little hook again hes not theyre not looking for a lot of offense from Guana but they would much rather see him in there thats only his eighth shot of the season Applause Ellis slashes through trying a little alleyoop there to Roosevelt wheeler but you shoot that one then if you miss it your big guy is there in position for the rebound but I think he confused wheeler with that shot and theres oh for 10 now for the year for Ross two threes maybe he should stop Ellis wild one just inside threepoint land doesnt go its Tracked Down by NC State and Ross theres Joyner again Music NC state has shot the ball very poorly but they only Trail by one thats a thing four of 19 from the field so far Louisville is four for 11 and weve got a timeout 1111 to go in this first half one point game in this ACC back here at NC State Louisville just completed the week of giving with their 12th annual Kyles Corner toy drive led by former Cardinal star Kyle Carrick they had a food drive as well winter clothes Drive they spanned that out over three home games and the toy drive great to see collection and association with Kyles corner for kids whos the former Cardinal now playing overseas thats great that the basketball players get involved in that get involved in community activities particularly at this time of the year Cardinals by one nine minutes gone by here in the first half shot clock down to four three ball on the way count it for Louisville and Hersey Miller s a guy who hasnt played a lot recently you know he was the backup point guard early in the year thats only his third three points made on the season burns down the lane for the bucket you know most balls shot like that would bounce off but that would sort of Hit the rim and died and then trickled in hes got a really nice touch yeah hes been getting the bounces this year now hasnt he heres a foul but High gonna be on jarkel Joyner his first got a good start early and whats been going on here three of 18 since uh two percent and that three of 18 looks a lot better because it was two of 17 Burns has made that basket the game is very difficult when the balls not going in the goals its not going in the goal for North Carolina State part of it has to do with the rule of the Louisville defense though Louisvilles got four blocks in this game heres a steal LJ Thomas that gets it inside for Smith and thats the kind of turnover thats been killing more those are the things that Tom Izzo refers to his turnovers for touchdowns yep thats what were talking about right there and thats been tough for them theyve averaged 148 a game as you see last game they had 10 that was the fewest every other game 13 or more its the first half were tied at 14 trying to pick up pick up shot clock again down to three another three and that goes in again Kamari lands drains it this time now Lambs were talking about Ross for North Carolina State not being a very good threepoint shooter but lands he is a high volume guy not a very high percentage but that was a really nice job by him stepping inside away from that pressure theres a long three from Clark on the other end that doesnt go and its tapped out to Mike James now long threes early in the shot clock I think Joyner and Smith have to be taking those otherwise I need to be looking inside Brandon Huntley Hatfield over clark off the window fivepoint Louisville lead its their largest so far here the first half currently Hatfield 610 611 hes got a couple inches on Clark on the inside thats a nice job to get the ball on the low post heres Burns again paddling inside and the lefthander scores it again youre afraid to go trap him hes got six points now because hes such a good passer averages 88 a game shooting 55 from the field Applause so far three or four tonight heres Miller again shot clock is winding down theyve hit a lot the last two late threepointers can they do it again lands Clark with a good box out but its off of Thomas out of bounds gonna stay with Louisville and we got a little gift for you on Christmas morning starting at 7 AM Eastern holiday special all ACC right here on the ACC network runs every hour through two oclock coming up on Sunday at 7 AM Eastern Music Lance for curry nice again Burns went to help out defensively and he just couldnt get back to very quick enough nobody else got them seeing good energy here good teamwork by Louisville and a good start for that theyre playing very hard slashes through clocked and fouled by Curry underneath first foul of the game it takes us to a timeout Cardinals off to a great start here they lead it by five on the road 7 48 remaining first half back in a moment Music Auto Owners ensures your car because sometimes Mike Cory and Dan vonner back with you here in Raleigh North Carolina Telltale numbers here for Louisville with their record at two and ten theres your wins theres your losses and you can see why well the turnover numbers arent up there but the tone numbers havent really hurt them badly today but the shooting does when you make baskets it really helps you theyre shooting 60 from Beyond The Arc in the game so far today and that has been a big factor three of five from threepoint ranges you said 50 percent overall were tracking this here tonight with the turnovers five theyve had three runouts NC State off of those five turnovers but its led to only two points that was one of your keys and how about the rebounding as well 1510 in favor of the Cardinals here the Louisville is a team thats not a great rebounding team but they already have four Second Chance points tonight so as you as you said going to break Mike a really good start here for Louisville well and thats what they need because obviously theyre not a team thats built to be able to come back a lot from these 15 20point deficits which it kind of faced a lot so far this season thats a confidence thing too you play well the ball goes in the basket Everybody Plays Harder They tighten it up on the defensive end Brandon Huntley Hatfield looking for the cutter its lands its a nice feed and lands no foul Currys got the offensive rebound oh offensive thank you well again you get a second chance opportunity here Burns goes for the block so hes not available to block out and its called an offensive foul go on a rebound yeah there but on that rebounder isnt considered to be a secondary Defender well and this is big for Louisville because he was in he was in the restrict here but he wasnt a secondary right Defender now Currys got two fouls for Louisville and Withers has two fouls so big right there is Burns that hook is working once again here tonight Applause already at his average almost at 88 points a game hes got eight so far here on this one yeah but since hes played more with the horses being out with an injury his numbers have been much higher than that yep so hes been getting about 14 16 points a game since hes become a regular girl youre right last game he had 18 heres Ellison Drive not there and Joyner gets it up for more cell the launches a three got it that was an interesting fast break because Moselle had to wait for the ball and NC state has the lead 2221 but now if youre Louisville here you just have to be calm about things and run your stuff and attack the basket first lead since but the shot clocks running down again its happened multiple times here tonight heres the Atlantis pulls back no he burns took him too long to get into their stuff that time that was jointer and burns and kind of came down with it together heres more self a three again look out you said it about more cell Dan hes three for three from threepoint range if hes got time and he had time left on he is deadly playing as well as he has in his college career four point lead for the pass when this guy gets going to end look out right three for three nine points already here for the pack a lot of this has to do with extra opportunity more opportunity this year but he worked hard in the off season he really prepared himself for this even though its early leading the ACC in threepoint field goal percentage is an accomplishment and he continues to be a very good Defender and theyve needed his threepoint shooting tonight because neither Smith nor Joyner have really gotten untracked yet Smiths got four points joyners got two youre right its been more sell and burns nine and eight respectively 2521 NC State crucial Point here this first half really if youre Louisville right they were up 2115 its a 10nothing run that that token pressure by North Carolina State has forced some time off the clock theres seven seconds left on the shot clock and the balls in half court this is like the sixth time that the shot clock has gone down inside of three and theyve had to put something up and that time it was Brandon Huntley Hatfield and this is but its really hard to run your offense when you start with seven seconds knocked out stays with the wolf pack I said Burns is a willing pastor but hes also an adventurous passer there are sometimes where he tries to squeeze it in places where theres not very much room Big South player of the year last year at Winthrop The Rock Hill South Carolina Smith with the burns screen in front for some space messes rebound by Huntley Hatchet and you know with Smith that those are the kind of shots he makes so you dont mind that one hes one for six so far tonight Ellis back up for James and thats another travel well right at the moment youre not getting a lot of player Movement by Louisville theres a lot of drives to the basket but the person whos driving is the only person moving for the cars six turnovers with only two points off of those six turnovers by NC State Cardinals hanging right in here down four though again its a big last four minutes in the half but thats for Louisville Joyner no got his hand on the offensive rebound I just got to figure out how to get out of there he does Burns double team comes down on him quickly Withers along with Roosevelt wheeler for Louisville Burns gets it stripped oh the attack Roosevelt wheeler able to come up with it Ellis now runs Ellis fouled well that is the first time theyve elected to trap Burns and it was a great trap I thought he was gonna get half of it but no Music falzon Smith free throws when we come back with NC State up four Purcell and DJ Burns Jr so far tonight for NC State as they lead by four well the interesting thing those are the only two guys for the wolf pack who have scored more than one basket Smith only has one basket Joyner only has one basket which is as many baskets as Ebenezer dewana has right Clarks over three Ross is over two and and if youre Louisville and you end up losing this game youre going to look back on this and youre going to see this is a missed opportunity with Smith and Joyner just not really producing yet you might have missed a bit of a chance to get a big lead here Music Ellis at the free throw line hes got five Music who else is going to kind of Step Up For This Louisville team as mother Tasha looking on here you know hes the one that dominates averaging over 17 points a game but theyre going to need help Huntley Hatfield is a guy who I think can produce on the inside and we saw him operate pretty effectively against Clark earlier but they havent gone back to that now Louisvilles gone to a little Zone oh one two two Applause shot clock down to six take away Ellis behind the back what a feed James Music pretty play 25 all here thats when you get back in the game you you get going to the defense and lots of times you play a Zone because youre trying to cut down on the other guys penetration first assist of the night for Ellis trying to get into Burns wheeler knocked it away for the moment also down there was Jalen Withers thats two bad passes trying to get it inside the zone no theyre going to call it traveling violations gotta get tricked Music well they cant make the pass inside and Ellis looking the entire time thats not a fancy pass thats the only pass he can make in that situation it wasnt like a Harlem Globetrotters kind of pass because it wasnt perfect tonight but yeah youre right that was the angle that he needed to have and he used it effectively but it was good enough here were talking about North Carolina State maybe getting some run outs but Wilmore has gotten a couple of run out opportunities nice responses looked like the momentum had shifted heavily in favor of North Carolina state it was a ninenothing run yep and theyve answered it messing on the shot Clark on the rebound and he had it for the moment and got to take it away after the initial shot from LJ Thomas now Louisvilles got a chance to go back in front with two and a half to go in the first half and they throw it away but thats a missed opportunity because Joyner had a mismatch inside against Huntley Hatfield and Huntley Hatfield was desperately calling for the ball but they couldnt get it to him Kevin Keats has to be unhappy thats eight turnovers now for the pack foreign ER theres some backup for Clark and now heres Thomas Park got it thats a really good job moving the ball around the perimeter forces the zone to react and then passing it inside you cant beat a Zone just by passing around the outside it has to win but thats the first really effective interior pass the pack has made against that zone and it gives them a chance to set up that press Here and Now Louisville another turnover offensive foul but Lance just got going too fast right there Kenny Payne is up telling him you got to pass the ball earlier the pass needs to be made when he gets to the freethrow line and it needs to be a jump stop the deeper you go into that lane the bigger the risk that youre going to get a charge call and that was more cell who had positioning there for NC State to take the charge and we mentioned Marcel hes got the reputation as being an outstanding defensive player some traffic back to Clark for the three ball and we had it by wheeler Ellis works it in from Brandon Huntley Hatfield Applause and thats knocked around and burns has it and here come the wolf pack Joiner on the Run accident too strong pretty good defense getting back Ellis against Marcel Marcel got a piece of that you cant play better defense than that up to Thomas hes got Burns Thomas spinning and weve got a foul Music on Mike James from Louisville thats his first and whats more some movies feed plants his feet then goes straight up in the air and gets the block shot and they didnt get a basket here Thomas really has to give this up I think he lost control of the ball you have to drop that back for Burns and get an easy layup you said it about Marcelo right he takes the charge he holds his ground he goes straight up gets a block hes knocked down three threepointers very wellrounded game so far for him tonight well the key to that defensive play he just made was moving his feet and getting his feet established one more free throw for Thomas ACC pm with Mark Packer Trey Boston and Taylor tenenbaugh the latest from around the conference coming up tomorrow four oclock Eastern and weekdays at four Easton right here on the ACC Network and ESPN app so now heres that that pressure again one two two theyre not really looking to steal the ball as much as they are to make Louisville run time off that shot clock so they get it across they havent started their offense yet theyre half court and theres 15 seconds left on the shot clock set it and its gone down numerous times tonight late in the clock Ellis kicks it to the far Corner Brandon humbly Hatfield thats a big time three it ties the game 32 seconds remaining four second differential shot clock game clock thats a good shot then hes not a great threepoint shooter hes got to be careful there he as he was running up to court he had something to say to the NC State bench you dont want to get a technical foul there now weve had a little bit of chippiness so far throughout this first half multiple occasions heres Joyner for three thats good jarkel Joyner gets it right back for the wolf pack hes got five suddenly we have a little bit of flow to the game Ellis three on the clock takes it in hes blocked by Burns and thats going to end the half Applause we got a good one here tonight Dan thats very interesting each team has done some really good things just its a very interesting ball game NC State by three of the break Marcel leads all scorers with nine points 3128 time now for halftime report lets go to my man Dallin cup and Carlos Bruno versus the second half is underway big game for both teams here tonight third conference game both teams Owen two to start Louisville trying to get their legs underneath them theyve won two of the last three inside Curry and he scores for the Cardinals hes got seven and thats what North Carolina state has been doing to Louisville that time Louisville got the ball inside the curry they basically cleared the side curry went oneonone Joyner gets the step on Ellis Joyner just has that explosive First Step hes got seven points now he and Smith will relatively quiet in the first half Smith sat out the last couple of minutes with two fouls that combination has scored a total of 11 points so far four of 13 from the field was selling a foul as Withers took it in for Louisville whats up DJ Burns trying to help the officials suggesting that possibly that was a traveling violation he burns is not going to jump up and help on that screen and Withers really gets lucky right here because Marcel was standing right there and came very close to tying that ball up they call the foul on morsel whos got two now Smith has to for NC State at the line Withers he also has two personal fouls for Louisville they got Curry also with two they picked him up early in that first half one of two for winners weve got a twopoint game actually I think that Kevin Keats would rather have that foul Beyond Marcel in that situation thats burned Smith feeds it to a wide open Clark again Clark can make the three but hes not a high percentage threepoint shooter and if you can make if you can get Smith to give up the ball and park to shoot a three then thats okay he had an opportunity to track his own rebound down right there hes kind of stood there Mike James got it for Louisville well maybe if your shooting percentages 23 percent from three maybe you take that ball and you take and get closer to the basket Ellis working on Clark shot clock down to five thats a great job by Clark James thats a travel and NC States forced them into a couple of those tonight as well thats 10 turnovers now for Louisville but that was all created by Clark at six feet eight moving his feet very effectively and preventing a very quick guard in LLS to get around it and our caucus only scored two points tonight but hes done a nice job on the boards and that was a very good defensive play Smith trying to work by James for the wolf pack a little bit too strong on the letter the temp now again and its into the hands of Brandon Huntley Hatfield Ellis quickly on the Run and hes fouled Applause but Joyner does a nice job getting back here hes in good position he gets called for the foul because he drops that arm down if he just keeps both of his hands in the air that thats not going to be a foul Music talk to Ellis before the game here tonight his family in the stands of 20 family members friends here theres his mom Tasha on the right brother Manny said after basketball whatever that is of course he wants to get to the next level of course and wants to give back coaching mentoring training hes been around the game his whole life and thats what he wants to continue to do here tonight is tied the game at 33 on a teamhigh eight points could be a rough goal for North Carolina State unless this guy gets going and thats how he gets going Im telling you once that first one goes down he can make six in a row Smith one for four now from threepoint range seven points 3633 back to Alice nice job by Burns Curry George Burns didnt let out us get by and that allowed Smith to recover Marcel from Deep and burns gets the offensive rebound back to Smith for another threepointer what did you just say yeah hell miss a lot but he is going to be undeterred this is the largest lead of the Night by either Team Six Points this is where if youre Louisville youve got to be really tough here with the ball and get yourself a good shot shot clock running down again five to shoot Ellis is deep he recognizes it got it knocked out of his hands TAPS at the withers and its a traveling violation he tried a little up fake and the shot clock was inside one second but he traveled anyhow and turn it over well Smith is a guy you can be on him the whole game you can really make things difficult for him and hes going to make tough shots that was relatively easy and that the second one comes off an offensive rebound and that is a real great opportunity for a threepoint shooter the defense has collapsed inside to try to get the rebound and to get your guy throws it out to you have a wide open look hes been so special coming off that freshman record 96 threes an NC State freshman record last year now a nice pass inside the court and the foul where Curry was behind that play he picks up his third personal foul you just gotta let this one go a really nice job by Smith hes drawn a lot of attention Currys coming over to help hes late and if youre Curry you just let this one go everybodys gonna have to leave the game now hes got three fouls so thats big right there but how about Smith and what hes also done to improve his game the assist category right 67 last year all of last year he had 71 coming into the game here tonight has two so 73 total nice feed inside and it helps put NC State up 4233 he went through that NBA process a draft process this summer and they told him you have to bulk up we know you can score you have to show you can set up your teammates now you look at his legs you dont think hes bulked up very much but hes got a lot more muscle tone in those arms and shoulders than he did last year so hes following their advice and its been really good for the Wolfpack yeah a lot of season left to continue how he can get his teammates involved and those in the handle Brandon Huntley Hatfield out of bounds in the Baseline takes us to our first time out of the second half but NC State is on a run a nine nothing run this year Well Miamis been dynamite and everybody talks about their backcourt uh Wong and packed but Jordan Millers had an outstanding season for them so far North Carolina the Tar Heels are really good they lost four games in a row but now theyre on a fourgame winning streak in Virginia after starting the season with eight straight wins theyve lost two straight now they havent lost them to bad teams right but the Cavaliers have struggled offensively and if they dont score effectively then they are going to struggle heres what happened Tuesday you were at the Wake Forest game you were doing that one on CD I was doing the Syracuse pit game that came down to be a pretty good game there at the end well wake played very well well and Duke struggled a little bit and again weve talked about the pit Panthers before theyre theyre one of the teams that has been a surprise so far here early in this ACC season you know its funny who before the season would have predicted that youd have Clemson and 20 and pitted 20 in Miami at 30 on top of the conference right that was up by 20 at one point against Syracuse on Tuesday they held on to Win It heres the turnover and her its just going to be called the fouls Hersey Miller just took it right into him Burns just couldnt catch up he tried and thats two fouls on burns you know and again hes out there smiling hes got such a great disposition hes a competitor its not like he doesnt compete really hard but he just enjoys what hes doing he just couldnt catch Miller Applause big asset to the NC State team no doubt Miller at the line Cardinals seven for 11 now at the strike well Louisville theyve been to the line in this half and which is why theyve only got two field goal attempts but so far in this half they have one basket against three tournaments Applause geez thats not going to count as a turnover but thats like internal empty possession there more cell got the rebound here are the wolf pack Smith hes hit two threes in a row back to the Zone Mark finds Joyner wide open for three Clark tips it back Smith for the three ball looks good second timer row off an offensive rebound hes been all alone for a three that is a great tap back by Clark you and I have the best look at it right in front of us good rotation he nailed it and now phallus called on Joyner thats going to be the third on jarkel Joyner for NC State they just uh staff just told Kevin Keats that thats three thousand joining hes got LJ Thomas up off the bench shes going to check in for him with the next whistle Applause Brandon Huntley Hatfield Music knocked out its off his leg you know Im telling you you get you get top of the key and you see Burns in front you think okay Im just going to dribble past him but you cant even at his size he moves his feet very well he did a nice job staying between Huntley Hatfield and the basket got a Little Help from his teammates and the result is a turnover and a big grin better the big grin is a constant thing thats huge you still got it right now smart choir defense but he also stays on the floor too you know you cant really get them too much on the fakes I I dont think he gets off the floor very high on the offensive now and that bike was up there so softly you think its coming off but it doesnt this game was tied at 33 and its now a 14point lead for NC State the Run continues over the last three minutes and 20 seconds scoring drought of 3 45 in ticking for the Cardinals Applause foreign Applause thats a three Music and its starting to get away from Louisville time out Kenny Payne eight of 19 from threepoint range on the wolf pack and more cell four of five from Beyond The Arc Music struggled to shoot the three in the first half theyre four for seven here in the second half Smith has three of them a couple of them coming on after offensive rebounds and Casey Marcel hey hes continued his off streak and who passed him that goal it was Smith Smith you know even though hes hot hes not looking solely for his shot he pads made a nice crosscourt pass set up his teammate look at this theyre shooting plays a big factor in basketball quotes and there they started the game very slowly but since theyve been very very hot at the pack well its kind of contagious too right because you got more cell who was hot to begin the game from threepoint land and then all of a sudden as you said Smith got into the act and more cell hit it again I mean it was a nip a tough game no one had led by more than five points we had four ties and then all of a sudden here its been a 17nothing run by NC State Ellis no foulis call Sean Smith thats his third and that again thats a foul thats created Smith is in great position if he just controls his hands hes right there and he drops that arm if he doesnt drop that arm its its not going to be a foul you just move your feet keep your body in front of a player force him to take a tough shot dont bail him out follow him maybe a little bit of a push off though there too as well to Nellis but he hits the first free throw finally they get back on the scoreboard next Friday afternoon college basketball triple header for you and its going to begin with North Carolina who weve been talking about theyve won four in a row and Pittsburgh is 20 in the ACC after that win against Syracuse on Tuesday coming up Friday December 30th well have it for you here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app should be a really good one there the Peterson Event Center you were talking about it Jeff Gable really starting to get things going for Pittsburgh this season and see what happens in that one but be interesting Armando baycott is playing very very well all of a sudden not that he has been playing poorly but hes playing really well for North Carolina he will be a matchup problem for the Panthers but then again hes a matchup problem for everybody foreign Music Not only was he ready Mike but that was a great pass a crosscourt pass that dropped right into his shooting pocket he didnt have to drop down to get it and change his position thats a great team basketball by NC State recognizing where your guys are your Shooters your hot hand five of six some threepoint Rangers more cell Marcel that time theyre scrambling around on defense putting great pressure on Louisville now Marcel picks up his third personal foul so I mean weve got 12 minutes and 40 seconds left in this game Joyner has three fouls Smith has three fouls Marcel has three fouls could become a factor never know but its a sizable lead now for NC state has built up enough Goodwill here with 12 40 remaining strong Ellis fighting for to try to keep it want to get a timeout but they didnt have the ball and now Smiths got it hes foul got us a count and this crowd is been energized here tonight from PNC Arena where NC State theyve really ratcheted up the intensity on this pressure nice job by Thomas he stops Alice and then gets the ball with him of course hes trying to call the timeout as you mentioned but he didnt have the basketball Mike James with his second personal foul from Louisville Smith getting inside theres another foul JJ trainer thats just that foul is caused by good ball movement and good player movement and Smith just really finding dawana on the inside and forcing trainer to come over to back this wolf pack team has a lot of weapons and theyre confident with each others ability out there well I think the emergence of burns after the injury has really has made this a different team now theyre going to be really happy uh when they get more Orchards back in the middle of January but Burns is a guy who really gives them some stuff on the inside so I think makes that outside game even better kick to the corner of the three Thomas he follows his own shot and a block inside Devin Reed that time for Louisville theres a lot of red shirts maybe he could have found a teammate Music what about trying to get this guy back involved again Sid Curry and hes got it with a foul he has been quiet for quite some time here well hes been quiet because hes been on the bench hes been in foul trouble but again this is a situation they take the help away theres nobody to help dewana and Currys big and strong nice spin move past dawana Curry they list him at 270 pounds hes probably bigger than that looking for his 10th point of the night and hes got it 17 foul committed by NC State here so itll be free throws the rest of the way if youre Louisville and at the line though tonight at 10 of 15 Smith another kick and its Clark hes wide open and he trades it for three oh hes been talking about he doesnt have nothing very high percentage threepoint shooter but he made that one hes got eight now hes made some big contributions tonight and its four different players for NC State that have knocked down threepointers in this game six different players have taken a three and now spinning into the lane is James and he lost it more sales got it I think the one I got a hand on that ball Music NC state has hit five of their last seven from the field Clark again wide open well he made the last one but again hes a 23 shooter you got to put that up well yes you do you just made one you have to put it up your teams way ahead and then its gone by second half Ellis he puts up the three oh nice offensive rebound Brandon Huntley Hatfield count the basket and he was fouled and hell shoot the free throw when we return foreign state knocking down the three balls Clark the latest to get into the ax they are 10 from 23 back in Raleigh North Carolina lets take a look at the standings here top eight right now in the ACC in the early going well the interesting thing is we talked about the fact that its Miami Clemson and Pitt up at the top how about Florida state theyre 21 in the Atlantic Coast Conference North Carolina state of course is over too but again its very early and what youre trying to do is get get get on a little bit of a roll here everybody except Louisville from now on its strictly ACC play Louisvilles got Kentucky coming up but this is where you know you get going Louisville and two and the Wake Forest was a big win the other night the wolf pack theyve lost two we mentioned they felt they didnt play well against Pitt but tits much improved and they felt like they let them maybe slip away against Miami hes awfully good its easy to let one slip away against them I was just gonna say they are very very good and here Louisville has left some points at the freethrow line 1016 tonight Brandon Huntley Hatfield with nine points hes got a gamehigh eight rebounds and Louisvilles been to the line in the second half and so thats hurt them along with the fact that in this half North Carolina state has four offensive rebounds and they forced six turnovers so thats 10 extra possessions for the wolf pack and for the most part theyve converted them almost another three by Clark bouncing into Mike James gets by Smith and Smith has three fouls thats a smart move by Smith just back off hes much more important to his team than those two points now its got to come down to the defensive end here for Louisville have to get stops and back to back to try to get back in this thing 14point deficit well Louisvilles defense was pretty good early in the game we showed you NC State started out five for 20 and a lot of that had to do with some really aggressive defensive play by The Cars theyve got five blocks in this game shot clock is down to five heres Burns can he bail him out two to shoot Joyner no but Clark tips it back to Burns and burns lost the handle out of bounds off of Louisville well again an offensive rebound thats just were talking about thats five offensive rebounds in this half for North Carolina State 12 for the game 126 offensive rebound and advantage in favor of the wolf back and theres the box out job by Sydney Curry Smiths better be careful going in there against Curry he can he can get himself hurt Ella spins back into a road clock heres Curry working on burns there it is again I continue to be impressed with the way Burns moves his feet with curry does a nice job finding the open area and then Burns cant get back to him curry with the team High 12 points for Louisville on five of seven from the field theyre trying to claw their way back theyre Within 12 Burns hit close over Curry no and its rebounded by the Cardinals there you go heres a couple of strings back to back here on the defensive back good job good job by Curry now Ellis mismatch inside joyners trying to guard Huntley Hatfield my Hatfields got to get down on the Block gets it inside for James a little turnaround off the window 10point game as NC State won a timeout here lets see well Mike James is taking Smith down on the inside its an 80 run now for the cards and yes Applause theyre going to take time out and so Kevin Keats and Company will talk it over here the lead is down to 10 8 22 still remaining in the contest as Louisvilles on an eightnothing run have they done it now well and I think this foul trouble is an important part of it NC state has backed off a little bit on the defensive pressure because of the foul problems and Casey Marcel with four fouls thats a really important number hes got 15 points and six rebounds in the game hes been absolutely crucial for Kevin Keats and his guys tonight he leads all scorers in this contest for the 15 as you mentioned see what happens here on this possession Joyner and Clark Smith Burns and Thomas the five on the floor for the wolf back into Burns shot clock inside 10 turns against Curry its been a match up all night hes got it oh what a tough beat away off the window and 12 points tonight but a big guy Burns you just cant keep him out of there and hes trying to go to that left hand and you know hes going to that left hand but you cant stop it Music Applause Ellis thought about the three on the middle late Runner not there and burns cleans it up really good Outlet passed by Burns NC States going to slow it down but they had the opportunity to get down the court six rebounds for burns tonight ties his teammate more self in the team hi oh inside Park Watson foul just you know thats just old style backs come on right there you give and go so we talked about Burns and his ability to worm his way with wiggle around there in the post thats a perfect example and then we talked about what a good passer is catches the ball Clark cuts to the basket he finds him in there and he draws the foul two excellent plays right there highlighting his game this is just described Brandon Huntley Hatfield to foul his first heres Burns numbers tonight so hes so effective six for eight he just doesnt take bad shots on the inside again he is definitely a below the rim kind of player but hes really effective early on how do you think hes going to match up against some of the other teams in the ACC as conference play moves along and into the new year well he can match up very well you know its going to be even if youve got tremendous quickness and Agility on the inside he he has shown me tonight that he can move pretty well you know obviously hes going to have struggles everybody does but Im really impressed with him Alice Music goes up against Burns and the birds gonna call it a foul went out Burns kept Ellis away from the basket he stayed between Dallas and the basket but Ellis get down in there and Im telling you thats like bouncing off a wall but thats three fouls on burns watch Burns move his feet lose his feet he moves in to Ellis if he just kept moving laterally he would have been fine but at the last minute he moves into Ellis and that was the foul Ellis has one more hes got 11 points coming up first this morning 7 AM Eastern holiday special of all ACC right here on the ACC Network on the ESPN app Ellis knocks down both shots and weve got a 12 point game with an even seven minutes remaining tonight from PNC Arena in Raleigh North Carolina in seven minutes is a lot of time particularly with the foul trouble facing North Carolina State you dont want to get conservative here for the Wolfpack Burns against Curry what do we got here he picks up the foulas for it you know he doesnt usually go into the lane from that side if hes on the other side of the lane and hes trying to go to his left hand and Curry plays him as if hes going to go back into the lane thats just a really nice of Curry pushing him in there and finally gets called for but what a great job by Burns to keep his pivot foot and keep his balance I was just gonna say just so Im in control of his body right there and not a bunch of wild moves I mean and hes got that little fatal able to go down too six nine 275 clay ball went for it before coming here now to NC State and oh hes trying to get in front of Curry fan it goes out of bounds and Kenny Payne not having it he is hes going to get a technical if hes not careful yeah Danny Manning is going to try to contain him but its too late technical foul on Louisville head coach Kenny Payne I think what he was upset about is they gave that ball to North Carolina State and he felt like Burns got a hand on it on the block shot lets go back to it this is a really good pass up ahead but look how burns your covers burns never touched that ball now he just clanged it off the rim and it Kareem data bounds here we go again burns never touches this or is the upside one of foul you know one or the other but either way its again Burns is not gonna like rise up and swap that one away but it burns maybe you could get a small phone book underneath Applause Smith to the hole Anderson go and Brandon Huntley Hatfield has still a lot of time left Alice thats the travel Ellis is trying to do too much right now at 16 turnovers for Louisville Applause its his fourth turnover of the night and hes just trying to make it happen I agree with that I mean but it goes back to the point of view you got to get someone else out there whos going to be able to kind of step up and be a scorer I mean Curry has 12 points what a pass what a pass I dont even know how he saw that Smith throwing it up top got five assists now Curry its inside for Louisville its a nice job but Burns has some fouls you need to go at it its asking so much of this Cardinals team night in and night out it seems over the last three games theyve won through the last three but have to come back from these lofty doubledigit deficits Ellis count it and the foul thatll help see Ellis feels like hes got to make that kind of a play and that was an outstanding play but if youre going to make that kind of a play then sometimes youre going to turn it over and thats been part of his problem this is but Ellis this is what Ellis can do he is so quick he is so fast with the basketball this is a great spin I mean hes got Clark falling down I mean Clark he got the foul called on him and you know you want to get your moneys worth on a foul but Clark just stumbled into him because he was falling down he converts the threepoint play for 15 points tonight senior from Durham right up the road playing in front of a lot of family and friends here now and mobile trying to make the comeback James got it got a foul and a foul yes so Thomas if youre going to challenge that play challenge it make sure the guy doesnt get the ball up on the board and if youre not going to challenge it just get out of the way thats his second foul so Thomas throws the ball away nice recovered by Huntley Hatfield and this and now if youre Thomas you just get out of the way right theres a four on one yeah its you know I have to say Louisville has had every chance in this game to quit and they simply havent done it free throws though theyve left seven on the board 1320 and its an 11 point game another nice feed Burns avoids the pressure certainly scores it boy hes got to avoid the pressure because hes not going to go up and dunk it and so hes got to let the guys fly by so he can shoot a layup Music this is really a good pass you notice he just he lets him fly by and then up he goes were gonna have a vertical jump contest between you and DJ Burns well I tell you DJ Burns is going to win oh okay now hes able to get some UPS so 10 second violation and there wasnt that much pressure they just were too slow Applause where you climb back in and you climb back in you fight your way and then you know you turn it over you get a 10 second violation 17 turnovers its whats played Louisville this season earns at a season 9 18 versus Vanderbilt hes got 17 tonight Cardinals ripped this one away as James has it foreign Music deficit thats a good place to go with the ball yeah Curry Up and Under now theyve had a few and ones here almost got this one again hes going to be foul and thats burns Applause oh did they no or did they call that on more snow they called on Thomas wait thats thats a break thats three but Thomas but its not four on burns its not five on Rochelle damn they can extend this game a little bit you know I mean we got four players with three fouls for NC State Marcels got four crowd doing their best to distract and uh by the reason theyre getting their best to distract is they have a promotion here if an opposing player in the last eight minutes of the game misses two consecutive free throws then everybody in the place gets a biscuit from both down no its a chicken biscuit from ChickfilA and thats going to be the case because he misses the second question Applause keep so the fans have fired up you know its nice to win but they want that biscuit right land is for three no thats tipped out of bounds by Mike James of Louisville thats thats a thats a ridiculous promotion whats happened both time Sunman here so the fans Music going nuts 13 point lead for NC State well be back Applause out of owners Music welcome back heres a look at what the wolf pack stars have done here tonight but Casey Marcel is the guy who put up the big numbers in the first half DJ Burns has been consistent throughout the game it was he and Marcel that kept him in the game in the first half and then quavion Smith has gotten rolling here in a second and dont forget about Jack Clark Jack Clark has 12 points hes got six rebounds hes got six assists this was a 3128 game at the half in favor of NC State we were tied at 33 and then it was just a monster run at the wolf pack went on it went up 5033 it was a 17nothing run that has put Louisville at Bay and theyve been struggling to try to come back here and cut it into single digits as Marcel puts up another big three he gets it no rebound Louisville and Fabio basili whos in The Freshman from Orlando Florida threepoint shooting first half for NC State 412 second half now six of 14 you cant afford to fool around here Johnny get going you got to get things done quickly Ellis bounces it in James Scott thats thats really good to get him down low hes got 10 points now and you know Smith doesnt want to foul him to get that isolation down in the low post James it can be a very effective postup time what do you thinking here in this offensive set well thats what theyre gonna have to do you avoid the Trap and obviously they want to run some time but you dont want to get conservative a lot of times in these games once you take your foot off the gas its hard to get the car reengaged again silly with a foul from Louisville that is now the 17th team foul so one and one here for jarkel Joyner on defense if youre Louisville you got to do something to speed up North Carolina State but thats going to be hard with the backcourt that the wolf pack possesses now you gotta move Ellis trying to create a little too strong and the one right into the hands of Clark Applause Mark is always around the ball rebounding Music the state contempt to just run as much time as possible Kevin keeps telling Smith to the back not yet same to shoot 215 to play in the game lead is 11 Joyner takes it in strong oh man what a play that was see its awfully hard they run the clock down they got a lot of guys who can create something at the end of the shot clock thats a big one right there Brandon Huntley Hatfield hands off for curry under two minutes to go kind of Knocked Away by Burns got it back back to humbly Hatfield stripping a foul its gonna be on more cell and thats going to be it for him he has fouled out boy Joyner so fast what body control I mean Curry hit him right or he hit Curry and is still able to do it and then Marcel just reaching in what a shooting night though for more cell has possibly done enough to will NC State to victory in this one with 15 points five of nine from the field but five of seven from threepoint range for all of his field goals all of his points came from Beyond The Arc yep second leading scorer tonight behind his teammate Burns who has 17 to lead all scorers but Marcel is another guy he also had six rebounds he had a steal as well you know you had mentioned this earlier about these guys like a morsel whos the teams best defender hes worked hard on his jump shot he shoots the threepointer well he does a lot of other things to help this team as you saw tonight a guy like Smith whos worked on his assist Game and his teammates involved everybody seems to try to improve and refine their game a little bit here this is how far NC States going to go this year this is a team you just look at him you watch him play they seem to enjoy one another they seem to enjoy playing together I know its a long season they started out on two theyve got a lot of tough games obviously as they get through here to the end of the year and then in January and February you just never know how things are going to go but this is a group of guys that looks like uh theyre going to enjoy theyre going to enjoy doing it vasili with a second foul for Louisville this guys so fun to watch Smith sir quavion Smith cant hit the front half the 11 Brandon Hadley Hatfield Music in Curry got it Curry you know hes been playing very well hes got 16 points in the game now time though becoming a factor here with 125 remaining Music a lot of time well theres not a lot of time Clark yes fouled hard by Curry and thats going to be it Currys going to be done yeah Sid Curry tonight you know and he has worked so hard on his game too and especially over the last couple of weeks hes lost 10 pounds started to eat much better against body and better game shape and you know coach Kenny Payne told us and hes been Autumn and he calls him every night at 1 30 in the morning just to say youre sticking with it right just keep on it for me well now if my Coach called me at 1 30 in the morning I asked him what the heck hes doing well coach is still up I asked him that so Kenny I wouldnt be up hes still part right this is he said its one of his last calls of the night and they asked Curry Im like well are you sleeping you know sometimes yes sometimes he isnt but hes like no Im happy Im happy to get the call well the interesting thing about that whole story is Kenny Payne didnt go to Curry and say hey you need to lose weight curry went to Kenny Payne and said coach Im really struggling what do I need to do and Kenny Payne told him well I think you need to lose some weight are you willing to go on a diet and he he was and its worked out weve seen some amazing fans across the ACC we need your help this winter ACC Network wants to experience each sport from your perspective snap a peck tag a video take a video and Tackle with a hashtag all the devotion and post it to your social media you just might see it on the ACC Network Applause so now the wolf pack is going to show some pressure and this is just a try to force Louisville to run some time off the clock Applause they apparently got it over again yeah I I think its a good move I mean why let him just walk it up right heres an inside play for Brandon Huntley Hatfield hes got 12 hes got a double double now because hes got 11 rebounds as well Music solid Knight for him but it was that run by NC State in this second half a 17nothing run that put it Out Of Reach for Louisville fighting and clawing their way back into it but doesnt look like its going to be enough tonight and the interesting thing about that 170 run to me is it was keyed by turquavion Smith he hit a couple of Threes you know he hit that first and we said look out you know he can make a couple and he made two more in a row and that sort of got the ball rolling for North Carolina State and you know for Louisville the Cardinals I thought played very aggressively I thought that they were right in the game but once that snowball started down the hill it was just very hard to stop Curry on the bench with 5 000 mentioned he had 16 points a game effort by Louisville they just didnt have enough Burns gets a nice salvation from the fans here tonight as Joyner hits the free throw all five starters in double figures how about that he had Burns Leading The Way with 17 Marcel 15 14 for Joyner and Clark and uh or Clark and Smith with 14 Joyner with a letter Applause this is dynamic backboard Burns really gives him something on the inside by Hersey Miller from Louisville its a 10point game which is 288 remaining and its big for NC State as you were talking about the start of the broadcast and theres going to be a foul here on James coming up the floor you know they have played well this year I mean theyre 103 you just didnt want to start over three in conference play right it just kind of looks well its its this game was more important than that because NC State theyve again they won 10 of their 11 nonconference games the games they lost were the pit and to Miami that are both theyre decent net teams NC State is number 42 in the net today and the problem with a game like this is NC State their net is going to drop after this win because Louisville is like 340 something right and so this is a game that would have been a disaster for North Carolina state to lose you just cant lose to a team at home with the net that bad and you look here theres Pitt at 70 in the Nets and Clemson up to 78 so thats a pretty good representation for the Atlantic Coast Conference in the top hundred of the map but this is a game and everybody who plays Louisville is going to be in this situation because of the Cardinal struggles their net is like 344 you just cant if you have any NCAA tournament hopes you cant lose that thats a quad core law well and part of that too is how much you you win by as well and what youre expecting you know to win by in certain games too so that that affects that number also jumper on the way from Brandon Huntley Hatfield no good NC State gonna run it out and the wolf pack as the fans from PNC Arena rise to their feet they win it by 12 tonight 7664 Over Louisville as coach Keats and Payne Jake hands and NC State improves their record to 11 and three and one and two in the conference Louisville drops at two and 11 really impressive performance I thought by North Carolina State they went on that big run because they made some big shots in this guy how can he not be a crowd favorite no doubt about it good to see you again Dan happy Holidays happy holidays Mike
