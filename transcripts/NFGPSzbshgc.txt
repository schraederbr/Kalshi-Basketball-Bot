tight wins tonight is a big opportunity for them our officials Roger Ayers Lee Cassell and Brian OConnell were just about set to get underway the northern part of the state of New York Roger has the ball in his hand reads caleblove and Joe Gerard and hell put it in there and well be underway in Syracuse and Carolina has it first 23 zone for Syracuse Jesse Edwards in the middle North Carolinas got to get somebody to that high post area that logo area RJ Davis whos really been playing well of late knocks down the first bucket of the game last six games Reece he shot 56 percent from the threepoint line and North Carolina as a team doesnt shoot it great just 10th in the 13th in the league and percentage at 32 they got to knock some threes down today is about Syracuse the percentage is good but they dont shoot a lot of the mens driving and bacon has his first rebound of the night heels in transition Now Syracuse gets the Zone set up Applause tried to leave it with baycot Applause and high posterior what a nice bounce pass and the first block of the night I think Edwards got a hand on that one that was a good look for Nance but baycott couldnt finish over the top a little too high and Syracuse turns it over there is Hubert Davis the former Tar Heel in his second season as the head coach played under Dean Smith coached under Roy Williams took over last year and led the heels to the national championship game what a remarkable job Hubert Davis has done in first year and has North Carolina right in the middle of it again this year Applause whether we were Tar Heels 3C 3 season one as it started the way they wanted but this game certainly has his Cave of Love hes really been struggling to shoot hed been just three of his last 22 from three and the heels are up by six well if he can start seeing a big basket thatll open up that zone and pull them out a little bit and give them some driving lanes and give fake hot some real good defense by baycod against Edwards and he gets Syracuse on the board yeah you played Jesse Edwards straight up you make him make a post move he is capable of doing so Lance in the high post takes the shot I think North Carolina has multiple players that can run through that logo area high post area foul is going to be on the floor theyre going to get RJ Davis Garfield s first four on RJ again we have two of the top three scoring back courts as well as two great big men North Carolinas number two and scoring in the back court with Caleb Dave Caleb love and RJ Davis Gerard wanted the foul called theres Davidson love and Gerard and Mintz mitz is not a great shooter yet but he can penetrate hes gifted getting in the lane well the Scout is to go under everything on him you want to keep him out of the lane make him score from outside New York I watched him and shoot around I mean and I watched them in practice hes ready to to make some threes hes shooting 17 on the year two three thats a good work from Bob tobacot and Armando has a bucket Armando is so good at playing in a crowd he can catch in a crowd hes got excellent footwork hes a tremendous finisher in the paint Tar Heels are trying to beat that zone back love draws some contact for mints theyll talk about it and Andreas is no foul on the floor North Carolina as we mentioned playing to and through Armando baycod watch the how he moves off the penetration slides up the lane catches in a crowd finishes with two white jerseys around him thats a little running hook cant control it I think Armandos going to pick up a excuse me fouls thats thats just a cheap one that Armando picks up Music fine in the early going immense wow in the Crowd Andy Williams cant finish here come the heels mints has already become a crowd favorite sort of in that long line of great Syracuse ball handling guards and part of the crowd react when he went around his back drawing comparison to Johnny Flynn Tyler and his leaking black for three leaky along the Baseline and he stepped on the Baseline itll be Chiefs as well I mean leaky black is wide open he has to look to take some threes Syracuse would rather shade their Zone towards RJ Davis and Caleb love and so leakys going to be open hes going to have to make some another freshman into the lineup Debbie for Jim Boeheim is Malik Brown freshman from Culpepper Virginia we had a terrific game last time out against Georgia Tech really active guy around the rim I think he has to help him on a glass you know thats where our Syracuse needs some help Jesse Edwards has 11 rebounds a game hes one of the top rebounders in the ACC but they dont get a lot of help on the boards their guards are going to have to help today also a man after my own heart with his spectacular clock here theres Joe Girard putting one up and the following the tip in by Chris Bell leaky black has that assignment on Joe Gerard its a great Follow by Bell RJ Davis guarded Joe Gerard in this matchup last year leaky was on buddy Bay home Bell almost gets a steal Caleb love has already hit one and now hes hit two thats a great sign for North Carolina because Caleb love has not been shooting the ball very well and ACC his numbers are lower than what they are on the season average just 24 from the threepoint line in ACC play I had 16 points Saturday against North Carolina State but he was only three of 14 from the fourth mens lines one up bacon has another rebound see theyre going to go under and theyre going to give him that hes got to be ready to make that play Davis could look to Nance and its a nine point lead for North Carolina this has been a problem for Syracuse and six of their eight last eight ACC games theyve trailed in the first five to six minutes by at least seven points double figures on a few occasions and theyre already down nine theres Gerard well mince takes a bad shot it leads to a long rebound and its an easy two in transition for North Carolina Applause North Carolina and they played this Zone last year Syracuse had 21 assists in their basket one of the one of the top performances in terms of passing ball all season weve seen some good ball movement from the heels already you know what Rich theyre in the logo area and theyre ready to make a play Pete Nance is making a quick decision with a basketball North Carolina has found a big bucket I guess that Dome shooting background hasnt bothered them so far nine point Edge for the heels player of the week Armando baycott has etched his name in the Tar Heels history books by becoming the alltime leader in rebounds and double doubles when you start talking about breaking records of course your teammates and the family start coming out to celebrate you Tyler Hansbrough was there to pass the torch and of course it was great to see him celebrating with his team but the thing that stood out to me is what Tyler tweeted he said rebounding isnt easy he put the work in and its well deserved we have seen baycod go off he has 12 double doubles on the season hes been a monster on the boards someone like the guy he has tatted on his leg Dennis Rodman he got that two days before he actually broke the record guys I mean look at the angel the guys who on top of that rebound with and Billy Cunningham was the guy he passed for double doubles Debbie you were asking the Syracuse staff Adrian Aldridge day what is it that makes bacon a good rebound well he does the work first of all hes an incredible Fitness right hes got the mentality to do it and he gets excellent position so he is a student of the game in terms of reading angles and getting himself in position and if Syracuse allows North Carolina to penetrate to the paint theyre going to have to rotate and when you rotate that leaves him open to get to the boards Edwards bothered that shot and that is the one thing Armandos not an Above the Rim kind of guy Edwards has great length so hes going to make it a challenge pulls up and scores that is a much better shot for Judah mints to take hes gonna have to look to score because leaky black right now has draped all over Joe Gerard thats good look to Leaky and leak he gets a bucket himself boy Pete Nance has made some really nice passes making some really good decisions with the ball hes got size over that front line of that zone he can see and he knows that that high low game is available in this Zone Chris Bell the freshman theyre really high on his potential black hasnt spotted Away by Edwards Jesse Edwards Top Shot Blocker in the ACC look at the time and he sizes this up for North Carolina sends it into the third row I think he needs to send it into their transition game six in the country and blocked shots and a full block for game better than anyone else in the ACC deflection for mints North Carolina doing a really good job of shot faking and its an offensive foul on Cave above his mens did a tremendous job to get in position we got to referee the defense right here this is a tremendous job as you said Reese Caleb love nowhere to go I dont even know where he was going and RJ Davis fell down on that play too must have been the shock of the okay did you do you think he definitely regarding position there yes I did the legal threepoint position goes to Joe Gerard hes got five now hes struggled historically against the Tar Heels but off to a solid start fourpoint game now the Leaky Blacks not on the floor right now so North Carolina loses him glove is three for three from downtown DeMarco Don is now in the game to take over for a leaky black in that assignment with Joe Gerard you cannot make a mistake on Joe Gerard and done those fouls Gerard as he tried to get to the Baseline displayed at Miami Jim larenegger the head coach of Syracuse said that Joe Gerard might be the most experienced player smartest player in the league he understands how to play so he knows DeMarco Don is going to have to take some angles on and watch this no Gerard kept backing down the Miami guards and mayor Nega said afterwards it was not like hes 611 how does he keep doing it okay Davis good look and into the game and then with the bucket is Jalen Washington The Freshman from Gary Indiana North Carolinas pushed it back out to nine you know thats just the second field goal in the last now the start of the third game North Carolina has got it from the bench player and Gerard starting to feel it uhoh DeMarco John is 65 leaky black is 69 six nine can definitely affect your window the length see Joe Gerards getting confident now knock down a couple with triples both teams have shot the ball well from three in the opening moments here its on pocket five and Nance shot clock goes back to 20 North Carolinas fault playing Inside Out Caleb love drills his second triple of the first half and then Joe Gerard look at that little step back huge Aggressive Insurance its easy to bundle your home and car insurance at progressivecom Joe Gerard has half of Syracuses 16 points just one point off a career high against North Carolina done a good job on him defensively and In fairness he wasnt always called on to shoulder the offensive low would buddy bayheim havent been here the last few years but hes off to a good start leaky black has returned for the Tar Heels defense knocks it down and Caleb loves gotten off to a great start as well the glove was three for 22 in the last three games coming into this one hes three for three tonight Gerard how about Joe Gerard hes into double figures 10 of Syracuse is 18 coming off a 28point night against Georgia Tech continues his hot shooting good hands by Mintz in the turnover for the heels do you remember gets to the Elbow got black in the air it wouldnt fall for him RJ Davis on the push RJ trying to turn the corner Thornton recovers nicely Syracuse doing a good job getting over the top of that screening action High whoa Nance again couldnt connect with Jalen Washington giving bacon arrest Gerard curls off the screen and watching hes there to help him Edwards begging for it and Gerard cant get it to him instead Brown finds it and Nance spots It Away really good play by Jalen Washington to help on that curl thats where Joe Girard does a lot of damage its those drag screens and squirrel screens those Step Up screens and transition another offensive foul called on Cave of Love Debbie couple of fouls now in love hell take a break SEC Big 12 challenge presented by Continental Tire won a day of basketball on Saturday Auburn West Virginia the Jalen hurts we get to claim him bowl for Alabama and Oklahoma too Eastern then Arkansas and Baylor at four oclock Eastern time then the Sonic Blockbusters Texas and Tennessee Kansas and Kentucky college game day will be at both well do our morning show from Knoxville before Texas Tennessee and then make our way up the rough for The nightcap started the Sonic Blockbuster in the SEC Big 12 Challenge and Chris Bell knocks down the three and Syracuse is called back to within three comes out Edwards has the rebound so theres plenty of time on the shot clock I think North Carolina can get a better shot in that possession George feeling it a little bit Applause couldnt get free from leaky Im here towards into the game wanted him as he cut down the lane now Edwards fading back really good job by Armando baycott to hold his ground North Carolina staying home on Shooters not helping proud trying to get behind the orange peace stand up trying to get the hands in the passing away he Seth Trimble in guard for the heels good look away cut scores yeah that is a great pass by leaky black because he looked away the defender just enough to shift and open up that high post area for baykot Applause Here Comes RJ Davis working on Torrance somebody blew a shoe its Torrance he lost a wheel and the ball goes out of bounds theyre fighting inside Armando baycott doing some work in that high post leaky feeds him and the big fella puts it down heels trying to win their second of the season on the road Kevin it is and a good one here so far you see everybody Joe winardi a certified bracketologist with where the ACC teams are currently seated Syracuse is not under consideration at the moment lack of big wins this would qualify as a quad 2 win for those who keep track of such things given that its a home game but potentially by the end of the season could be a quad one and as it saw those seeds that Joe bonardi has projected how many one seeds in the country would relish a second round matchup against North Carolina no I dont think so 11 baskets for North Carolina 10 of which have been assisted assuming they hadnt done a lot of these RJ Davis steps back leaky flying in trying to tip it as a matter of fact they only average 46 percent of their baskets assisted Gerard beats him down the floor Applause they were going to break and talked a little bit about North Carolina inability to win on the road this year only one true Road win it came at Louisville and Louisvilles done a lot of losing to just about everybody this year and Tar Heels are looking for a little something thats been difficult for them and the orange looking for a closer to Marquee wind trying to get themselves into consideration as we get into the second half of the season Applause Gerard dribbled it off his foot and then RJ Daviss foul as he goes Joes showing a little frustration only the second team foul committed by the orange I mean Jose worked so hard off the ball to get open number two hes going to go over and sit down right now lifting a little hes so good in that curling action and leaky black is doing everything he can to try to keep him from Catching Justin Taylor is a very good threepoint shooter hes in the lineup see if he can get loose on the offensive end of the game of freshman early in the season against Bryant when he dropped 25 points out of Charlottesville Virginia really good shooter big future here Applause and he knocks it down how about that a little space right there for Bangkok showing a little faceup game from the high post just talked for the last couple of years about expanding his game in that area he can add that to it consistently he has improved over the years he does that be a handful you got that kind of work ethic that he has I think you can do whatever you want oh wow Edwards Bay cut he brought it down low and baycott knocked it away from it RJ Davis on the pullup how hard that is to do go full speed stop on a dime and jump straight up and score simir Torrance gets into the lane Syracuse wants to score quickly before North Carolina gets organized and then when they can score thats when they have time to get back and set this date Applause I think North Carolinas done a really good job in that high post area playing through that area of the floor and spins around a little too hard up the back towards for the rebound shoots a line drive hes watching him in practice today 40 000 points in his career at Northwestern Benny Williams a little highlight drive down the boulevard thats the kind of thing they need from him big time aggressive crowd getting behind if the qs is closed within three and getting Carolina deeper into the shot clock in recent possessions RJ Davis to beat the shot clock didnt get a thing stayed on top of the Zone too long you got to dive inside you got to get to the Baseline you got to shift that zone theyve had great success playing through the middle of it Harrys Junior Mintz working on DeMarco Dunn mens goes in and done physical defense which is really important to win this game recent Debbie in the dome thank you very much big fellow transfer from Duquesne his terrific skill as a shot blocker than the first one Rim out and you expected to see Tyler nickel into the game and hes in for Carolina and fake hot flushes more I may not think Tyler Nichol can get free with Caleb love on the bench with Caleb actually back in the game with two fouls Applause the other thing to Seths point you know North Carolina has only missed 12 shots theyve offensive rebounded two of them so they have done a good job keeping a North Carolina team that rebounds better than that percentagewise off the offensive glass Doug the other thing theyve done is they havent fouled on Saturday North Carolina made 36 free throws 36 out of 39 deep dance battles one in they get a large percentage of their points about 23 percent of their points on the freethrow line now Syracuse is one thats one of the best in the nation Syracuse is one of the best in the country a keeping team from scoring there and neither team has shot a free throw in the first half Gerard got away with a walk mints going to line up another three and he knocks one in just his seventh make of the Season okay thats what Im talking about that young mans percentage should be better based on the way he shoots the three in practice he saw him walk through today Carolina was going to make him make some before they went out to contest it I still think you make him make one love and dance tried to go in like his dad not foul and now somebody will go to the freethrow line this is an important stretch of games for the orange we mentioned needing a signature Victory North Carolina tonight then they go on the road on Saturday against Virginia Tech be on the ACC Network Syracuse and Oakies seven Eastern Time Virginia Tech coming off that winning last night against Duke somewhat controversial later today would you call the foul I would have to celebrate for those who might not have seen it gen Tech makes a big bucket throw the fist in celebration and hit govikowski right in the throat no call yeah it was inadvertent but a snow whistle it should have been a flagrant one Applause so Im glad I got that note in about nobody shooting the free throw right right yeah but still thats not many yeah I mean theres two really important things playing North Carolina keep them off the line keep them off the offensive Glass Syracuse has done both of those things very well here in the first half and Edwards is going to be called and the offensive foul trying to set a screen to get Gerard free Gerard and baycott are debating some current affairs perhaps as they come back down the court yeah that thats a foul you know I watched some Synergy all of Joe Gerards field goal attempts last year with RJ Davis guarding him he only made four out of 12 RJ did a really nice job on him man that line drives shot couldnt get it if Tyler Nichol may be in for shooting but he gets the block leaky back to bacon and Baker with the finish on the break hes trying to answer bad words up top for the jump you better run back on defense in the final minute of the first half in this one youre gonna get baptized its hard to get a two for one against the zone gotta get a good shot here Nichols got to move after he makes the entry pay cut The Zone trying to go back up now the whistles and now weve got a scrum over on the side is big tied up in there with Jesse Edwards everybody walking away and a call a tie up and the ball will belong to Syracuse look at the effort good Hustle hard play and and bacon always walks away always Angel guys I was talking to Jesse Edwards about the bay cop matchup he said I know hes strong we have very different aspects of our game hes strong and comparing him to Steven Adams on the pro level but he said he had a conversation with Giannis when he came to their game last year he said Size Doesnt Matter we have to make sure that its the heart its the will and we saw it in that last play from Jesse he fired him he was counting on the business end of a hip toss takedown there but it was a great little run of action on both sides here I mean this is fun this is what you come first the Dome four right here up and down bacon Gerard just running a little interference there and then how quickly Syracuse gets it out of the neck to the other net to the other end thats Edwards deal he runs runs to the rim having a terrific year hes a rim Runner hes a he put gets put backs and dropoffs he has really improved his footwork in the post making some moves with some counters not not 100 healthy last year but this year you see the numbers right there second in the league and rebounding behind baycott in the Top Shot Blocker in the ACC averaging the DoubleDouble rebounds up four per game and Syracuse has weathered some early storms and customary falling behind and now chance to close this to a one possession game before halftime mints all showing in everything in there maybe showed a little too much that is really good defense RJ Davis staying down guarding the ball forcing a tough two and remember Syracuse with only 14 fouls fouls to give so they do so in the back at 37 his second remaining here in the first it is Vinces second person he will not be called on to give the one more foul as Torrance returns both teams shooting over 50 in the first half RJ gets loose right to fly off the bat board its no good 20 minutes and thats how we will go to the half North Carolina with a 3834 lead Bay cop with the Dozen it has been matched by Gerard theyve done it differently Armando inside and Gerard creating shots from Oliver being out rebounded on the season Carolinas good rebounding team and the other something we mentioned in the first half only two free throws shot in the first half Carolina shot only those two typically they spend a great majority of the time at the freethrow line heat Nance working in the lane he misses the first shot we check in with Angel we talked to both coaches at the half angel I did and Ill start with UNC coach Trooper was telling me even though he was pleased with how they were sharing the ball he said number one thing we have to do better on defense we have to fly around better we let them shoot 52 from the threepoint line that is not good enough on the other side Syracuse is dealing with a high low they said its hurting them Nance making it too hard for them they have to pick their poison between baycott on the inside and Nance will see what they do they just went high and low low and baycott got it swatted out of there by Edwards Hes been a force defensively around the rim Benny Williams another acrobatic move and the foul its a great play at The Rim look at Jesse Edwards he is just dominating the paint right now on defense and then Nance if he just stayed vertical he said he reaches what a strong finish in the first free throws for Syracuse Benny Williams couldnt finish off the threepoint play thats the type of thing that youll see Benny Williams do in practice from time to time really gifted player and want a little more consistency on him didnt play a lot as a freshman last year but hes had a couple of moves tonight that show you why he was one of the top players in the country coming out of high school Nance Line Drive threes no good rebound too long for leaky black and now ahead of the field and Bell dunked it home and were tied at 38 entire 38 now the Tar Heels who are carving up that zone in the first half now finding those looks more difficult to come by back to Nance and hes fouled on his way to the basket when North Carolina plays with poise right there theyll get a good look watch this move up the floor great eyes to the rim backtoback plays in transition for Syracuse they didnt get very many easy buckets in the first half North Carolina has already given up two baskets Debbie bell was hit four of five from the floor hes got nine points he only had a couple of free throws against Georgia Tech he really struggled a bit in his last two games had a total of five points and one rebound across the two games and hes played very well tonight only has 20 20 rebounds on the whole season coming into the game and thats the thing hes got to play more aggressively I havent seen Whittier Copeland tonight for Syracuse that was a guy that uh Bayonne talked about after the Georgia Tech game was more effective than his starting forwards in terms of rebounding hes wanted those forwards Bell Betty Williams to do a little bit better job on the glass really working hard to seal Applause RJ Davis almost lost it and then he did and finally got it back now well throw it up with a left hand and its no good and weak he almost picked Gerards pocket now lets see who its off of and itll be Syracuse ball Caleb love begs to differ with Brian OConnell but I think OConnell will carry the day and bayheim will be pleased with the result Applause and RJ Davis down underneath the basket he took a shot Applause see if RJ can kind of clear the cobwebs for a moment tied at 40 again I think theyre going to take a look at this lets see if mint caught him with the elbow and now the officials maybe headed over to the monitor event see exactly what happened oh yeah on his way up so theres no whistle on this so theyre going to take a look at it I think its just a basketball play myself I dont think theres anything there yeah I dont see anything but you have to take a look at it because RJ Davis didnt look good well and that was in there attending to him now down at the end of the North Carolina bench playing the North Carolina State game for Carolina on Saturday when leaky black had the hard foul you felt like that was one of the reasons uh there was adjudicated the way it was was because of the impact it had exactly I mean he was an Airborne player they had a foul on it they had to upgrade it I wasnt sure it was going to go to it too I thought it would be a one but I think the severity with which turquavion the result of the the issue made them upgrade it to it too you know Mr gravey on Smith of North Carolina State he was back in the line tonight so were certainly glad to see that it looked as if too they were looking at uh at RJs Choppers over there is coming over and confirming what we thought basketball played going to the hoop weve got a basketball game tied at 40 Tyler Nichols in for RJ Davis Big cots using that muscle when he draws another foul on Everest I mean bacon is working youve got to get into the chest of the shot blocker Applause no crowd the crowd didnt like it much I dont think so what did you think I didnt think so for my angle but Armando who made all seven of his free throws on Saturday misses the first much improved freethrow shooter he can make one of two North Carolina will go back on top you can and they do but Syracuse can take its first lead of the game on this trip the mens who had the strong move last time working on a lot Applause Edwards now hes working on baycott good defense by Armando and Edwards scores over him anyway how about the patience the Poise the counter the bucket love kicks it out heres nickel for three thats a smart play by Caleb love thats why Tyler Nichol is on the floor hes a high percentage shooter in the corner that is an excellent play Applause W sense that in practice today asked Hubert Davis about the possibility of seeing a little more of Tyler Nichol and that was a big shot and theres Edwards again on the business and were tied at 44 leaky Blacks got to do a little bit more on Joe Gerard I mean hes got to take him out of the game some because Joe Gerard is a gamer he is a great decision maker with a ball in his hands how about Edwards coming out to block the threepointer from nickel covering some serious ground you got to show a little shot fake when you see 611 with a 74 wingspan coming at you Applause another block for Jesse Edwards Hes got four of them five times this year hes had five we got a long way to go I think hell get his hand on another one or two or four before the nights over he has been a force defensively and also contributed with eight points and six rebounds held his own against baycod inside heres Gerard who had a big first half Gerard good defense by baykot to knock it away turnover for Syracuse nickel this time will take it in love with the runner Caleb love kicking the spots making good decisions because he made a play for Tyler Nico the last time he touched the ball that is a really good shot by him to take Applause yeah I love at times you can question the shot selection but he hes played really smart basketball tonight when hes been in he did miss a little more time than normal played only 12 minutes in the first half he averages 36 minutes a game man says it knocked away but recovers shot clock at 12 now shot clock at five and Syracuse not making much progress toward the basket knocked out of bounds for the First Media timeout of the second half when you come back Syracuse will have the SEC Big 12 challenge with a couple of huge games there we will update that score for you I assure you its not 44 to nothing and Syracuse hits a shot clock violation tied at 44 heres Jim Boeheim Hall of Famer over a thousand wins hes like weve seen that look before were on the play Applause they got some Nance and Nance is fouled again they get Jesse Edward thats going to be three on him remember our conversation today with Hubert Davis about dance and about how he doesnt have to worry about feeling like hes the new guy all these guys are back stepping on somebodys toes coach Davis went into a really good conversation with us about this is a new year different team and they need Pete Mass to be aggressive and he has played that way today thats the thing Debbie Hubert said he had mentioned last year one time I think theres a feeling Ill admit I mean you see these guys we know what they did last year havent played great you know in terms of the one loss record overall the course of the season but let him get to February let him get to March theyve been around theyll be fine and you know from Huberts perspective Hubers perspective they dont want to look back you always want to look forward Applause right its all season so that youre ready to handle situations the first thing coach Huber Davis did when they came out today is worked on situations in late shot clock few to men scoring over baycott and freshman is gifted when it comes to taking the ball to the basket into double figures with 11 and its 4846 Carolina with a lead in the ball see without RJ Davis on the floor Caleb loves got to handle the playmaking responsibilities Applause love shot it well tonight leaky black the offensive rebound hell kick it back out nickel thought about it we could have closed by mints good pass from nickel into baykai got it blocked by Edwards Armandos staying with it and has swept out of there by Chris Bell Syracuse is working on the board that was a big key for them staying in this game and they have done it beautifully throughout the game so Joe Girard snakes behind that ball screen to get the matchup he wants shot it over Bay cut I like it though thats smart leaky with a good pass and baycott running the floor and hell have a chance for a threepoint play Applause Edwards look how quickly North Carolina converts from their defense to their offense a contested three and bacon Sprints and gets rewarded Debbie with 13 34 left in this game it could have been a really big foul Jesse Edwards just picked up his fourth had a flurry of him here in the second half one of them perhaps questionable that one the third the third foul the third foul was maybe not his fake hot finishes off the threepoint play well this changes everything for North Carolina now I mean bacon and Nance got to go back to that high low action I like dancing the logo and baycat behind the zone and Syracuse still has a shot blocker out there is Monir keema number 55 is him he is not quite as polished offensively as Edwards has become still a great shot blocker Carolina in transition Bay cop with a finish and bayheims gonna want a timeout and theres a little frustration right now mints showing some frustration in Bay Im trying to calm him down as he goes to the sidelines but Syracuse is felt a little Wrath of bay cut running the floor here Armando with the flush and the Tar Heels heavily points seven rebounds three boards away from another big double double and hes got the fourth foul on Jesse Edwards which could very well be a huge factor in this game before its over Armando bacon leading all scores with 18 and a number of field goal attempts Carolinas been playing better as hes touched the ball more later in the season what were they convert from defense to offense they really tilt the floor like they get running downhill the team speed is outstanding thats a tough shot coming off the ATO for Jim Bay homes team mens freshman missed and has been an occasional problem spot for him a little losing control from time to time next line drive triple and just like that with qs back in the game North Carolina has its biggest lead of the evening at 10 people Gerard and there is Hema into the game for Edwards his first basket of the night here comes the Press was wondering how long it might take Jim baham has shown some spot pressure this season they played a little more mantoman than normal but this press has been something that they use they use very effectively against Georgia Tech and they fell in a hole in the first half did it against Notre Dame as well earlier this year they didnt play any mantoman possessions against Georgia Tech but they did Play Seven against Miami Davis almost gets the threepoint play and his big bonier Hema 611 Center drawing the foul RJ will go to the line to shoot a pair North Carolina is surged Back on Top by eight we love our new home theres so much space we have a guest room now coverage Thompson Bowling Arena at seven oclock Eastern time you see the pedigree of both teams of both teams playing really well UConns won 10 in a row Tennessees 19 in a row so RJ Davis after making 1414 Charities drive against North Carolina State cant blame us we didnt mention it before the Miss oh hey missed them both RJs shooting 90 on the season that is a rarity now remember hes just returning to the game after taking taking that shot across the nose Chris Bell was before his five shots prior to that which is the best second time tonight possession theres mens on the drive now Davis with the rebound Applause has returned for the Tar Heels he has it in the corner Applause and theyll call an illegal screen on Armando baycott theres no time and distance right there Applause hes not set do you remember the hands yeah Im good Im good just standing here didnt do anything some of your Torrance has returned from bayheims Team Syracuse down eight headed toward the 11 minute Mark here Warren shot it very well in the second half and Gerard gets it going Joe Gerard he is so good in that ball screen action Debbie Elder his first points in the second half I believe Gerard now with 15 Syracuse down by 10 a moment ago they fight back again theyve cut it to five Nance from the free throw line too hard tipped out Davis corralsi hell shoot from Justin Time York RJ Davis Applause I think Syracuse go right back to that ball screen action here is the screen Brown sets it hell running fly from the corner is Chris Bell that makes Hubert Davis take his glasses off here comes the Press and what they like to do not only go for the steals but force you into a tough shot layups are dunks is what they wanted hemo with the block Here Comes Syracuse down just four from the corner back again it wont go and Babcock last to touch it itll be orange basketball well I guess in some manner of speaking its always an orange basketball but your basketball belongs to the orange I think I thought he got shoved how about this fight from Syracuse yes absolutely Ive answered all night fell behind in the first half fought back at the end took a brief lead Carolina pushed it out the double figures Now Syracuse back within four and with the ball wardrobe malfunctioned from big fella oh near hema now Gerard has him he just hit a three youre going to try another way too strong for Gerard but you dont mind everybodys going to take it its going to be him inside 10 minutes to play this has been an even game both teams have hit six threepointers almost identical in percentage Caleb love another Runner no good rebound from the oh the rebound from The Freshman Malik brownie tried to save it throwing it to his teammate Hema and it went right off his knock and Monir in no mood to talk about it for a moment Applause I will give this to Hima that one did come in hot Im trying to save it signed underneath baycod has it Davis out front looking at that zone FEMA goes for the steal now Nance has a chance in the threepoint play the bucket wont go go to the freethrow line and shoot a couple number Peters hits all six of his free throws tonight NBA Wednesday double header the Sixers with the leads leading scorer Joel embiid questionable for this one taking on the net still havent had an MB versus Simmons meeting lets see if that materializes tomorrow night and John the Grizzlies against the Warriors at Team eastern NBA countdown starts at 7 well North Carolina has done a much better job of getting to the freethrow line here in the second half they only made one trip in the first Nancys quietly at a really good night hes got 16 points Applause and now seven of nine from the freethrow line and Syracuse can get it to a one possession game with a bucket Bell working on what desperately wants to shoot it and he reigns in the three The Freshman Chris Bell thats two over Caleb love on that Baseline I would say with the degree of difficulty of those Caleb getting a little of his own medicine how about this press working Tar Heels break it Washington to a cunning match he missed the layup but Nance stole it back and Hubert Davis is begging his team to slow it down not take the quick three if they can get some control back crowd behind Syracuse trying to will the orange to their first really big victory of the season thats against Hema missed the layup Washington cant control it and Syracuse has it 15 Gerard cant find enough breathing room to Let It Go now hes got space Joe Gerard good block out by Washington The Freshman for North Carolina to get the board under eight to go what a game we have here in the ACC tonight police Davis Debbie Antonelli and Angel gray here and the Tar Heels is going to take the time out twopoint game coming down the stretch North Carolina trying to hang on on the road ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by Progressive Insurance its easy to bundle your home and car insurance at progressivescom that Sizzle early in the hotel on the way to the arena he said he was ready for Syracuse basketball I should point out I was on my way to shoot around for Carolina this morning so Charlie whos a really good player at Loyola was ready at noon when the lights came on tonight uh his son Chris has been balling hes hit three of five from three now 15 for 33 and ACC play gifted shooter hadnt really played that great the last couple of games and hes playing well tonight the Carolina running a place were selling shoot around get the easy Bucket from leaky blast good pass by Caleb love excellent execution off the timeout quench nearly a threeminute field goal crowd for the Tar Heels thats a foul on Armando Jesse Edwards back into the game playing with four and this time you know its three on Armando Vega usually he has a little bit more poise so he feels like he gets popped in the mouth right okay and then he just throws his chest right into Jesse Evans Gerard only the one field goal in the second half probably the leader forever that was a great job by Edwards to give it a chance Tyler Nichol comes up with Tar Heels getting a turnover Applause RJ Davis taking a break nickel weve got extensive run tonights hit of three I have a couple good passes that a huge block in transition played well off the bench for Huber Daviss team shot clock at five heres cable above he gets fouled by Chris Bell e of love another of North Carolinas excellent free throw shooters 78 on the season Jimmy can only Shake well you got it to the right guy in the late shot clock right hes capable of making a play guitar heels and mostly the two guys who are their best free throw shooters I missed a few so RJ Davis missed a couple Caleb love now has missed one they only missed three and 39 attempts against North Carolina State RJ Davis the best free throw shooter in the ACC uding 75 percent on the season as a team makes one out of two its a fivepoint Edge for the heels Applause Gerard gets into Bangkok forced to switch they caught still on Gerard Mintz working on RJ Davis and he scores two to one in a foul too and didnt get it and Hughes goes right into that press youd think its hard to press Carolina theyve had some success a little tentative get it into the front court now Hance will slow it up Syracuse fans wanted to travel you would think opening up the court against North Carolina would cause problems because they see the floor so well and theyve been passing it well tonight but this is the other thing the Press does get you deep in the shot clock its at five leak hes going to shoot it from the corner leaves it short here come the orange and then your fifth option takes the shot and RJ Davis fouls Judah Mintz on the way to the bucket were gonna take a look at it I thought Roger Ayers game yeah I think he did it was a hard foul but thats a play on yeah they wont they wont be over there long looking at this lets hope not personal 14 Applause Judah mint and to go to the freethrow line and we feel pretty certain its going to be play on the ball foul in the active shooting and shoot the free throws well in order to upgrade it its got to be excessive or unnecessary or avoidable I think its a play on the ball uh I I agree with you youre still looking at it over on the monitor as we go over to Angel now more on Judo Memphis well guys you can just see him in his freshman season Fearless but most would say hes Relentless he has that tattooed on his arm as well coach behind said hes one of the best freshmen hes ever had and he loves his explosiveness and change of pace going back to when he was at Oak Hill his former coach Steve Smith said hes a basketball historian he spent time looking at the history behind Jim bayheims program and more specifically the players that have been in similar positions to him Tyler Ennis Johnny Flynn and Frank Howard he watched film on them first and said how will I fit in this system him being on the floor has helped so many different players on the floor and hes just finding his place in his spot in this program guys Angel he leads the ACC and steals a comeback win that Syracuse had against Notre Dame we have 147 of them in the last seven minutes they came back finished strong and Four Freshmen on the floor and he sort of led the way for them as he hasnt shied away from the moment here tonight by the way it is a common foul they did not upgrade it as we thought theyd just come over and asked us we could have told them okay were like three for three tonight I think on fire off to a good start this season Debbie one point game crowd of just over 20 000 rising to its feet its a steal for mens Syracuse with a chance to take the lead in Manson one oh no offensive foul Id beg your pardon immense is beside himself Applause for my vantage point here I was blocked but I it looks like hes got two feet on the floor I dont know thats a tough one that is a bang bang right I thought it was a foul on Davis I did too I I dont think Ive been an M1 RJ Davis the back iron offensive rebound for Matthew he had it taken away by Brown Syracuse win another chance to take the lead in those situations there is you always referee the defense thats what youre supposed to do is referee the defense on that on those plays did he obtain legal guarding position Gerard from way downtown almost got a roll headed toward four and a half to play on an entertaining game weve had tonight baycott working on Edwards four fouls now four fouls on fake cop with the offensive foul now both Big Fellas will come down the last four and a half one foul away from fouling out he displaced the defender thats a foul that one I agree with so now baycott going to take a break remember the under four media timeout is coming so you referenced earlier Bay County got a little frustrated on the defensive end picked up one now hes got his fourth on the charge maybe just let him cool off a little bit and be back for the final moments of the game meanwhile without their star on the floor North Carolina in danger of losing a lead heres mentz gets in the paint mans on top he scores Syracuse has a lead he puts RJ Davis in jail coming off that ball screen keeps him on his hip what a creative finish now were the heels get their answer from without Bay caught on the floor Nance spinning on Edwards goes by and scores Pete Nance is having a night hes got 18 remember 14 assists on 16 baskets in the first half playing through the logo area and Nance was a big part of that I think thats where they go here at the end of the game until Bangkok comes back in Syracuse trying to answer and Mintz is causing some problems out there Debbie he is maturing even further RJ Davis called for the foul its his third were gonna come right down the gut of the game and the freshmans gonna have it in his hands can he lead the orange to victory over the Carolina veterans be able to finish the deal on the road nice work never heard you oh good one Reese Debbie Scott it has been a terrific one 329 left finishing it up for the moment Armando baycat still on the bench for North Carolina Tar Heels up by one The Freshman Jude immense for the orange who has the ball now has been brilliant late hes got 17 and he almost had 19 and Tyler nickel comes away with a rebound hes played well good d by RJ Davis Debbie one of the things the orange had to do was hold their own on the boards that only have they done that theyve out rebounded North Carolina tonight Pete Nance wild hard shot no good in Syracuse with under three minutes to go it can go back on top and Bacons waiting to return I dont think coach Davis wanted him in off the timeout because it was a defensive possession but he definitely needs him on the floor for offense no Gerard had a dozen in the first half he then we had one field goal in the second it was a big three Edwards playing with four foul hes in the lane a long time Jesse its a hand on it and he was the last one to touch it itll be Tar Heels ball and here comes baycott I mean he gets the smaller Defender all hes going to do is turn and dunk it Applause unable to get it down but Edwards is really really been a force on defense tonight hes blocked five shots for the sixth Time of the Season at eight points and not only is he blocked five hes altered other ones and made everything that bacon and Nance have gotten when hes been in the game difficult I think Pete Nance has been very very effective in that logo area in that high low Davis gets to the Elbow pull up jump shots a couple times weve seen him do that tonight Davis with just nine tonight and Jim Boeheim is going to call a timeout 207 to play threepoint game were leaving you for just 30 seconds be right back there are all kinds team thats lost three in a row into Rupp Arena to try to you know win on the road thats a tough one yeah and its so its so rare too that bill selfs team lose three in a row heres some of the Stars youre going to see weve seen some terrific freshmen here tonight theyre the best one in the countrys Brandon Miller of Alabama hes been he is must see ticket selling player Auburn is improving Auburn and Alabama have a showdown coming up in a couple of weeks first of two right now had a very important game Carolina trying to win for just the second time on the road Syracuse in desperate need of a marquee Victory here goes Mintz down the boulevard cant get it to go and the tip Man by Monique Brown one freshman got it on the rim the other put it home its a onepoint game so Jim Boeheim likes that match up Judah fence going against RJ Davis calls the timeout he runs the set for him they caught against Edwards both guys playing with four and Armando throws it away okay now Roger Ayers he indicating that the ball was deflected as we take a look at mints going in active Brown on the board Applause eight of nine from the floor against Georgia Tech last week or last Saturday largely on plays like that hustle plays and boy did Syracuse need that one now officials Roger Ayers Brian OConnell looking at the monitor to see if betcots pass which was certainly an errant one see if Syracuse happened to get a hand on it on the way out of bounds thats just the I have five offensive rebounds for Syracuse thats a big offensive rebound on that end of the floor Matel Brown has gotten his minutes this year hes a hes a hustle player and it was not deflected by the orange itll be Syracuse basketball Applause is so quick he almost got his hand on a pass it didnt look like he had a chance at it all heres Vince working on Davis Gerard to the top gets leaky black for three great set by the orange nice ball fake Gerards been quiet in the second half but boy did he make noise to get the orange Elite headed toward a minute to go heres Davis working on Bell now back out to Caleb love makes his living making shots like this shot clock is deep Caleb up to three Nance fighting for the rebound hes harassed to touch it itll be Syracuse basketball 533 to go and I think were going to make sure again that Nance was indeed the last to touch it so back to the monitor we go what a great backtoback execution by Syracuse so many options off that set last time mince drives to the bucket this looks like to me it definitely went off Nance I didnt even think they needed a roof yeah I dont think they need her to replay on but to go back to the same set and then to have this another option so Joe Gerard to come sprinting off that ball screen on the on the on the week or screen all the weeks weak side screen see he drove it last time this time he gets leaky black in the air hes got all day to knock it down four triples for Joe Gerard and he hasnt taken a bad three all night did you notice something on that shot fate I saw on social media I cant even believe Im bringing this up an old clip from Kobe Bryant hes talking about defending shot fakes and he said so many guys dropped their shooting foot back on a shot fake he goes theyre not going to shoot it Gerard dropped the shooting foot back right there but still so hard to keep the defense so hard to keep the defender on the ground watch him see hes side steps yep so hard to for the defender to maintain position there great shot by Gerard he does such a great job of getting separation foot fakes ball fakes and North Carolina is going to switch on this stuff right here up the action up front to get it right back Syracuse maybe in its best position of the night with the lead and the ball a chance to make it a two possession game just checking the clock spot throwing and they did put a couple of tents back on their 541 Applause Gerard gets it immense Applause he might very well be a human press breaker in trafficball unflappable Syracuse has had the lead for just over one minute in this entire game and they have it right now and thats when it counts mints and inside wont go RJ Davis with the rebound and about a two second differential in the shot clock and Gamecock may be close to three you got to get it into Bangkok bounce pass Lance goes up and he is fouled and thatll be it for Jesse Edwards and Pete Nance will go to the freethrow line where hes hits seven out of eight tonight this is really good execution by North Carolina catch and face drop it off inside numbers advantage in the middle of the floor there no way Edwards can get back and contest in time oh make him earn it from the freethrow line now theres no time obviously to worry about having four fouls Edwards has played his tail off defensively hell finish up the night with five blocks 87 rebounds and hes been a factor and a presence in the interior all night I mean hes always a factor in the way they defend right they their zone is best when they have a shot blocking presence on that back row and hes mobile where he has improved the most is his counters on the interior but right now you know heres what youre thinking for North Carolina you know you gotta tell Nancys gonna make these and then you got to Sprint back and youve got to make sure that you keep the ball out of Joe Gerards hands and I would keep mints out of the paint first order of business for the heels is to make these free throws theyve made a living at the freethrow lineman thats among characteristic misses tonight first looks good North Carolina does have timeouts and he cant tie the game but an offensive rebound that gets away from black but now its got you back and he puts it in and Carolina has the lead Joe Gerard saves the ball underneath North Carolinas basket Applause its hustle play and they always tell you not to lets see if he had a chance he was trying to bat it to Hima instead he basically served up an assist to Pete Nance and North Carolina as a onepoint lead with 177 to go now and Syracuses standpoint the officials are back to the monitor one more time did that ball bounce on the line before it might be trying to say out of bounds yeah lets see if inbounds nope thats thats going to be a good basket great camera work by our crew great job down there underneath the basket unless they saw something I didnt see this is going to stand up and now Syracuse plans its attack what do you expect to see from the orange here on this I like judamins here getting to the paint going strong downhill I like him driving it hard to the basket putting pressure on North Carolinas defense he has been able to get in the paint against the RJ Davis matchup lets see if RJ Davis is still on him when we come out here defensively I need some more size on it I was gonna say would you consider putting leaky black on him in on the list end of leaving RJ on Joe Gerard who guarded him last year when they met RJ did it like I said earlier I watched all of Joe Gerards field goal attempts RJ Davis guarded him last year well looks like right now leakys following Joe Gerard to the Baseline cant get beat Over the Top If Youre North Carolina you got to make Syracuse come back to the ball Applause Benny Williams Malik Brown judaments Chris Bell whos been terrific and Joe Gerard on the floor for the orange leaky black RJ Davis Caleb love Pete Nance Armando baycott final 177 Bell has it down immense freshman gets right into the paint and Roger Ayers calls an offensive foul and RJ Davis has yet to get up he takes another shot of course Applause RJs been hitting the face a couple of times Huber Davis is asking Roger Ayers to have a look at it thence picked up his fourth foul thats a tough way to pick one up on the offense wow and I mean thats what what you wanted to see Syracuse do right attack the paint defense off the bounds but when he crosses over and steps through does he clip RJ Davis with his elbow and they attend to RJ Davis were going to have another look here Mintz has really giving RJ problems defensively you see the right elbow getting him right in the face well outside the restricted area now what did you think of the call Debbie well I definitely think is this offensive foul but its an offensive foul because he runs RJ Davis over now thats a hard place to take a shot right but its a natural basketball move its not an uh with intent to try to hit him in the head with your elbow its a its a basketball play stepping over stepping over the tops you know stepping through our three officials we can sell Roger Ayers and Brian OConnell are conferencing theyre not looking at the monitor at the moment Roger Ayers the one on the far left veteran official is the one who had the call on the floor St Judah mints is mimicking with Coach behind the motion that he made Lee Cassell is coming over now after video review a flagrant one foul has been assessed against so after seeing you thought it was a basketball play but he said per the rule they upgraded it to a flagrant one they deem it to be excessive or unnecessary or avoidable and I think once again its um you know the result of the foul this is what you would call this is what you would teach a basketball play stepping over stepping through however they have to litigate the rule Roger Ayers giving a little more explanation saying that he led with the elbow to the head and that was the reason for upgrading it to a flagrant one and RJ Davis just now getting to his feet getting the claws from the crowd here in Syracuse Debbie as you mentioned here is the rule book where the play group one excessive and more unnecessary not a legitimate play on the ball its not really the case in this instance because it was a player control foul but the first one the top Criterion there is the reasons that was upgraded so that will be two free throws for North Carolina and then you go back to the point of it Interruption so by rule contact to the head or an Airborne shooter is always an F1 RJ Davis unable to shoot the free throws and Caleb love missed the first one Caleb just one of three from the freethrow line tonight came into the night the 78 shooter he hits the second twopoint lead for Carolina 107 to go Applause North Carolina so Syracuse got a hard trap foul extend the game Carolina well below its season average and free throw shooting just hit 12 with 19 tonight and you got one less ball handler on the floor Applause foul was called on that was called on mints and thats going to be it for him well the Freshman The Freshman has really played well tonight a lot of energy inspired play and the tough flagrant one for foul number four and then desperation foul there and finishes his night with 17 points watch this right here RJ love is trying to get open see he shoves mints off Syracuse North Carolina thats a tough one yeah Music thats thats a great Point Caleb love probably got away with one there always catch the second guy I think he sort of got tangled up after the shot so a threepoint lead now and this free throw is huge to make it a two possession game Applause foreign has won nine of his last 11 games but only one road game and take a giant step toward getting the second one if love can hit the second free throw and theyve brought Defenders into the game Seth tremble is checked in from North Carolina also too is DeMarco done all quickness here on the floor you make Syracuse come back to the ball you switch on everything Syracuse should get a quick two if you can trying to extend the game two possession game Syracuse season bucket quickly Gerard cant get it to go Nance with the rebound tremble coming out of there with it and with under a second to go the whistle blows and despite a valiant effort from the home standing orange North Carolina is going to sneak out of here with a win Applause what an entertaining game Applause have words to say afterwards and Seth Trimble whos scoreless in his last three games so the game might be decided this could be a very important free throw to some Applause Heartbreak Hotel still one more to go the hook will get you sometimes Debbie could be a bad beat maybe Mr Van Pelt coming up next missed them both a four point victory for North Carolina quick handshake from Hubert Davis and Jim Bayonne North Carolina wins for the 10th time in 12 games and boy they had to fight every ounce of it tonight tremendous game in a victory
