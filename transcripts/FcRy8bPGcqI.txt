about how they did not execute on the first few possessions and they had an opportunity here to make the right wrong here in the next time out Wagner handing off for flan 62 freshman out of the Bronx hes getting 16 points a game he has rarely looked like a freshman trying to get it downstairs but a quick whistle here in the opening seconds in Miami so when you watch Arkansas play John caliper has an initial set that he wants to run when it breaks down they also have action that they want to get into they didnt get the with the shot they wanted off their initial set but they got a foul on the action afterward State McCrae committed a first personal that one thrown away right back over to the Hurricanes who are actually shooting it pretty darn well so is Arkansas so for two teams that are struggling in various parts of the game they have at least been hitting their shots both of them at 50 yeah both come in playing very good on the offensive end of the floor defensively is where the struggle has been particularly for Miami even though arxa also had a let down against Illinois last time out on the defensive end ly kid out of Virginia Tech nice little move inside with the left hand for two and thats what ly kid does one of the best at leading the country and field goal percentage and gets his opportunity on the interior he is a presence in there that Miami can rely on vamir iich the 72 sophomore from Croatia for the Razer backs not starting he turned an ankle in practice well see him tonight but hes not 100 both teams battling some injuries Nigel pack number 24 for Miami he was like a practice time decision today because of a bad foot he got in there as you look at the 72 sophomore and two back to back turnovers for Arkansas on their first two offensive possessions so thats not what coach Cy wanted to see for his team in their first true Road game of the season Johnson bouncing for the big again the big for the hurricane 610 Lyn kid State McCrae has it ripped loose thats a tie up possession will keep it on this end we talk about the difference with Miami between how well theyre playing offensively and how badly theyre playing especially on the ball defensively but you look at the offensive numbers ranked 10th in the nation out of 362 schools but look at the other side of the end other end of the floor 345th out of 362 teams that has been a struggle defensively for the Hurrican ouch so trying to improve on that in a big way tonight heres the Johnson jumper that wont go thats the guy they would love to become the next Jordan Miller type from Miami you remember the Hurricanes going to the final four a couple of years ago they were a great program then they have fallen on Hard Times losing 14 out of 17 the loss of a player like that such a key part of it absolutely and and we talked with Coach larena he talked to us about the team that Jordan Miller actually his first year here that went to the Elite 8 got off to a very slow start that year also especially on the defensive end switched up the style of play defensively but with 10 newcomers things have been a little slower to adjust for The KES he do a very short shot there that would not go and for the second game in a row Arkansas a very chilly start they fall behind 11 to nothing to Illinois and never recovered in that game yeah and when youve got a lot of new faces thats often things that you can go through but Miami not making Arkansas pay for their lacks on the offensive end Davis with a hard drive banking it off the window hell draw the foul heli Davis the 64 grad out Gary Indiana whos one of the top guys available in the portal fed by Schwarz who picks up number one we were watching Arkansas today in their workout Coach Cal said I want to go go go but a lot of people hes still trying to get acquainted with he said Im doing a lot of coaching and by that he meant on the Min absolutely 13 of their 15 players are newcomers and you think about the only returning guy with minutes that had experiences Tran Bazil he was the guy that returned the other returner actually is out for the season and was at walk one not getting much time anyway for Coach Cala Perry so a brand new team for both he and Jim Lena this season its nice to see Cal in a sport code huh because a lot of guys are going with a sweatsuit look these days this is a classy look its still a classy look well thats why you and I The Odd Couple cuz Im going with the sweat I know you are any chance you can get whistle underneath you are definitely our sweatsuit King on this group this is a great look the foul will go against Boogie FL number one Cal now the leader and active wins as division one coach and a one of the its hard to call k a old school guy but yet one of the Hall of Fame coaches that we still have on the sidelines he Tom ISO Bill self a number of guys still left but weve seen a departure of many of the coaches that weve grown to know and love over the past 20 season yeah coach lneg is definitely one of those old school guys and hes got an older than normal team hes got seven seniors in grads though hes made the point the ACC is a very veteran League this year really up and down and throughout play with a bounce speed here the arrow ah beautiful there getting it downstairs to Adu Adu now returning has been injured for the majority of this season they actually sat him a couple games to allow him to get more rest but you see the first sub off the bench at the center spot for Coach C paying dividends all SEC Defender a season ago at Tennessee had surgery on that foot hes been banged up he did get 11 minutes against Illinois so its coming and he gives him a tremendous presence on the interior opening up showing that 7ot frame making himself available there with the nice find to get him to dece over the top for Brandon Johnson hes getting about 11 points but more importantly nine rebounds a game for Miami and which is an issue for the Hurricanes thats where they struggle most we talk about their defensive lapses a lot of this had to do with their inability to be able to rebound shot clock winding down Nigel pack on the money but having that guy back he missed the Charless other game having Nigel pack back in the lineup absolutely helps coach Lara they make it clear its hard to win without their senior C they really feel like they cant unless hes healthy and plays a ton of minutes the arrow underneath cant get that one to go its tapped out of play right on the Baseline with 1628 to go here in the first half in Miami Nigel pack the grad out of Indianapolis getting 15 a game and watching Nigel pack shoot with his feet on the logo nothing new here in Coral Gable weve watched it for the past three seasons now and Nigel pack happy to be back on the court after missing the last time out he scored 1700 points in his career hes been an outstanding player Davis setting it up theer very vocal guy for the Razer backs hes really their leader he do a handoff here for Davis trying to use the screen shot clock down to three there with a long one off the iron and Miami trying to push it and Nigel pack grimacing on his way up the floor dealing with a lower body injury but you can see visibly not at 100 Johnson great fake to get the open shooter but Schwarz couldnt hit it Schwarz The Freshman from conquer North Carolina getting the starts first career start here tonight yes wart with 15 points last time out and more importantly knocked down four threepoint field goal so he absolutely got the attention of Coach KY in The Scouting Report he do gets a good look but it rolls off the iron Miami on top by three in the early minutes kanes couldnt buy a win down the stretch last year they lost 10 straight and they W up the season 15 and 17 kid brand new to them cant Applause hit red transfer from Virginia Tech the kick and the steel Miami will grab it State McCrae with a hand on it Schwarz from the wing and he sticks the triple and Schwarz never even considered going inside the threepoint line Nigel pack waited for him to get into the right spot and is able to knock down a huge three to give Miami a sixpoint lead hes making 38 again hes a rookie but thats his game from Beyond that threepoint line underneath they find the big guy ad do with the slam lack of defensive rotation the Trap doing the right job for Miami but no one rotating over to take Adu away from his second easy bucket he has all the field goals made for the Razer backs hurricanes with 10 new players in the program this year expected to finish somewhere in the middle of the new look ACC with 18 teams and a kick out from way downtown it wont drop for State McCrae theyre going to try and trade threepoint attempts and that one off the back Iron by fland FL coming in averaging 16 just turned 18 years old recently but Obie look at Nigel Pat hes grimacing every time he brings the basketball up the floor you can tell hes visibly bothered by something however it has not affected his jump shot but the LMP back down the floor is concerning he is gritting his teeth in these first few minutes every single time he comes down the other end of the floor still able to hit a tough shot Wagner heres Davis to drive it has it slapped away State McCrae with a quick hands heres Schwarz again not this time rebound popped up and controlled by the Razer backs and weve gone well past our media timeout these teams starting to get a little winded right now most guys waiting for the whistle to blow however Boogie FL is able to step up and knock down a huge three for the Razer backs to make it a one possession game hes making 43 from threepoint land Cory the McDonalds AllAmerican point guard from New York City rank the number one point guard in the country on the back down kid again hook wont fall 11 eight Miami trying to cut into that with a jumper that wont go for Applause Davis encouraging to see Nigel pack looking a little better over the last couple possessions coming down the floor was very concerning to see him grimacing the way he was early State McCrae tied up hell draw the foul by Davis funny how when you make a couple of shots a little bit of the pain goes away and absolutely I know that feeling OB Ive done that time or two on my for ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by Continental Ty the smart choice in tires these two you look at the career comparison between Cal 13 of course had this place jumping each and every night and now trying to find a way to get this team back on track after losing four straight Blackman throws it away turns it over to Arkansas and fland accompanied behind 118 hell swing it to the sevenfooter and big Z is offt target with the first and dont adjust your TV he is a sevenfooter that shoots a lot of Threes actually had a game this year where he sh made six threes and blocked five shots and cant think back to many guys who ever done that step back short by Schwartz visic is actually their best threepoint man hes hitting 55 Cal Perry told him before the season no no no I dont want you shooting threes and everybody said what does that mean hes a great threepoint shooter its not a exactly what he meant what he meant was I dont want you shooting them every single time weve got a timeout with 1141 to go fou by Jaylen Blackman what a gorgeous night here in my back in Miami and the canes leading Arkansas 118 Among The Luminaries in the building tonight one pick for Cal at Kentucky and was there his first season I can remember being at the Maui Invitational with Kentucky at the time John caliper bringing his team over there in their first year actually no I take it back it was Mexico it was not it was Cancun and John Wall playing in a ballroom and you think hes fast normally wait till you see how fast he is in the ballroom cut the rug yeah a whirlwind up B shot clock down to eight here for Miami Blackman takes the hand off but hes double up trying to get out of that trap he does got that free to Cleveland Cleveland with a pull up pop got a good look but couldnt drain it and thats a guy that Miami needs to get going Cleveland whos averaging career lows this season thus far through the first seven games for the canes yes last two games two points a game Richmond got in close couldnt finish that and now Cleveland leading the break wants to do it himself hell lay it in hes been very up and down very inconsistent Tu about a fast strike on the other end Brazil will slam it down now thats hard to do give up a wide openen contested dunk after scoring a layup normally you have the opportunity to be able to get back defensively once you score but no one from Miami getting back on the defensive end also shows you how quick the Razer backs can be pick to finish fifth in the SEC by Alabama Texas AM Tennessee and Auburn how about Auburns gift for winning Maui they get to go to Cameron indor feathery touch here by Matthew Cleveland for two Matthew Clevelands come in aggressive with with his time on the court three straight attempts for him making two of them and putting Miami Back on Top by five Arkansas down five on the road and one with the whistle under 10 minutes to go and a tough drive by DJ Wagner I believe this is the Difference Maker for the Razer backs this year DJ Wagner coming off of what he felt was a disappointing season as his freshman season at Kentucky played through a number of injuries but now a veteran and of course hes a guy that also understands Coach Cal he knows how things need to be done to play for Cal and very comfortable we had a chance to talk with him pregame you were talking about how young man that seems like he should be acting in Hollywood he should go to Hollywood I think he you know hes going to have a nice long career and hes an outstanding player great family line I think as most people know but he has a lot of Charisma and I think he might wind up on stage somewhere yeah great young man to be around and you can tell hes very comfortable this year difference from what we saw from him a season ago Blackman will lift and hits it threepointer 39 for jayen Blackman out of Maran Indiana transfer from Stetson zipped underneath Brazil right there they found him again and how about tho that he has made that pass multiple times hes been the change of the floor guys when the basketball changes size of the floor but hes always looking right in the middle of the paint three times they found someone for a dunk two strong by Betha The Freshman fivestar recruit Out of Philly they love him lot of growth there still and he almost did it again Brazil this time could not finish it round the back betho with a neat move to get free long distance got it thats the way that Miami can stay in this game and also try to find a way to win it if they can have success from Beyond the three Point Arc they have a number of guys who are more than capable of knocking it down the Blackman starting to heat up certainly one of the best starts of the season for the Miami Hurricanes as they lead it 21 15 going to be interrupted nice job on the save effort that was Brandon Johnson Brandon Johnson with a great rotation after hes seen his team give up multiple dumps the oh no hes had some big scoring games this season already 24 against Baylor had 26 in the lost to Illinois Cleveland wants to attack airborne and gets it to roll in and hell be headed to the line Matthew Cleveland must have heard this when we talked about he needed to be better for this Miami team averaging career lows eight points for him and he averaged 11 as a freshman at Florida State but you see Matthew Cleveland aggressive now his third made field goal but this time he can add one to it Billy Richmond went for the reach and picks up the personal so Cleveland really up and down getting the last two games avering just two points a game and last year it was 14 points a game he was a very reliable scorer for Jim Len yeah veteran a guy that of course coming in you would expect him to have made the jump now in a different role coming off the bench for Matthew Cleveland over the last two games Jim Lena looking for whichever lineup they can be best defensively with but right now Matthew Cleveland bringing the offense seven points for him early Miami heating up theyve hit five of their last six shots to open it up Razer backs looking for an answer out of the corner way downtown too strong by Knox on the line ly kid will give it right back Carter Knox another McDonalds AllAmerican for John caliper who also first committed to Kentucky and then flipped it the Razer backs when Cal came to Arkansas Carter Knox from the state of Florida his father played football for the enemy here which would be the Florida state seal and believe me they remember the he is fouled on the drive by Matthew Cleveland who went for the reach with 759 to go in a quick moving first half here in Miami the kans like the pace we root for a great basketball game yes but you the fan I mean in November but weve turned a new month and now the ACC trying to knock off some of these SEC teams Kentucky and Clemson coming up at 915 on ESPN Tonight 2415 Miami and the basketball from the Baseline Miami a little six nothing run they got them rolling Jaylen Blackman to put it in transfer from STS and he scored about 1400 points in his career theres a lot of legit scores on the court here tonight for both sides in a whistle before the inbounds pass with 751 to go in the first half as we see the newcomers we talk about the newcomers for both these teams for Miami its been more guys who have have been veterans and played well at other places maybe a lower level as far as than concerned the ACC but yet guys who have had production for Arkansas its normally guys who most of them came from Kentucky or guys who have been you know younger play players coming in so they havent quite exhausted their eligibility have some time to be able to stick around fou one on Nelly Davis for Arkansas and now Blackman trying to get it in they have to call a timeout so Arkansas covering all the open guys and well take the timeout as well a quick one here 2415 Miami on top of Arkansas and the Second Challenge as he ACC continues tomorrow on ESPN number 20 North Carolina hosting number 10 Alabama thats a Chapel Hill at 715 and Then followed by number nine Duke taking on the number two team in the country many field of the best team in the land thats Auburn and its inside Cameron indor you got to look at them you were in Maui the entire week what are your thoughts on Auburn Auburn is the best team in the country right now and they come at you in waves you consider the way they do it they can play inside out they have shoot and of course when youre playing for Bruce Pearl you absolutely have to be able to defend P gives it up for Johnson he wants to drive the lane and the kick pack got off to a quick start hell add two more give him eight points and smart play by Nigel pack there not getting into the teeth of the defense running going to the runner Midway in not having to challenge the trees coach Lena has to be delighted with the start his team is off to offensively and defensively so far honestly OB I believe he would be even more excited about the defensive effort that hes gotten from his team and now another deflection yeah Johnson nearly stole it and thats going to hang on the rim and drop in after the foul as well Arkansas with a basket the arrow the 68 Jr got it to roll in with a soft touch and hell be shooting for a threepoint play a d there attacking the basket getting downhill the contact able to get the bucket to go OB he was 12 of of 2 one from the free throw strike against Illinois last time out so taking 21 free throws you got to be in attack mode to get there that often as we see his mom Miriam C checking out his father over to her left forgive me to her right Alam theier so both from Molly and coming to see their son here in Miami ly kid with a f officials are going to the monitor on this thats the reason for the stoppage in play Ron Gro Clarence Armstrong Eric Lewis our crew tonight we are actually our broadcast position right next to the Arkansas bench and when gr Ron grber came over to explain what was going on here to coach calip Perry we heard calip Perry go why well because he felt as though what they were going to look at possibly was an infraction on them however I dont believe its going to be anything as they make it a quick look Im not certain as to what it possibly would have been but whatever it was not much of anything the officials didnt spend much time yeah they were reviewing something involving Arkansas thats what we are being told exactly what it is we dont know 705 to go first half and Arkansas looking to get their Swagger back here trailing 26 17 on the road against a good shooting Miami team John caliper talked to us earlier today about how much coaching he was having to do with this team because once again youve got a lot of newcomers but also in a new place you got a freshman point guard for as talented as he has its as he is its different being in this scenario Boogie flam one of the best in the country at the position however its still new for him only his eighth game at the Collegiate level there at the line and drops in the first one in fact the Arkansas head coach told us at practice today they worked on a play that they were going to run a first play of the game against Illinois all week and when they ran the play When the game started everybody went in different directions and it was part of the reason why they got down so big 110 star for Illinois as you mentioned they never really recovered from that initial punch that they took from the line eye last time out were hearing this a lot from head coaches with so many new players in their program shot clock down to five Blackman that could be dangerous beyond the threepoint line hes going to fake and take a hit its this going to go the the other way its a travel so they turn it over on the travel and Blackman trying to get to the step back gets there in the air but however shuffling his feet would have been a foul if he were able to keep his feet still but unable to do so in the turnover to Miami Land The Freshman under six and a half to go in the half looking to penetrate Airborne what a nice shot that was oh hes special OB when you talk about his ability to be able to not only score but also make plays for others averaging close to five assists per game hes like several tremendous freshman in the country big drive here by pack to lay it in Nigel Packs only about 70 right now but you can see how important his 70 is in comparison to when you dont have him on the floor as the Hurricanes missed him dearly and their lost on Saturday to Charleson Southern nice Fey Touch by The Freshman Boogie flann will knock it down again hes 43 hes very confident out there he absolutely is watch this young man playing for the PSA Cardinals under my guy Terence Munch Williams growing up and Munch made it very clear we got another Pro coming as they had with Co Anthony back in the day you know I was mentioning the other freshman around the country like Jeremiah fears at Oklahoma put on a show in the Bahamas they a lot of them are ready to go right now theres no warmup period they hit the floor at the college level there stars right away and the expectation level for them to be there there when youre talking about guys who were McDonalds allamericans who were the highest level to be able to come in and of course when you think about this now hes been tutored by one of the best to ever do it Tyler uus who was an outs of the star for John caliper at Kentucky having him coaching point guards is Big Schwarz knocking down the jump shot to make it 3023 Miami off a Nifty Music fake Wagner right back down and could not be handled by Adu on the Drive Cleveland swatted away but youre going to count that thats go ending and Matthew Cleveland has gotten the head of steam going downhill multiple times in this game already now up to nine points for Cleveland and doing it by attacking in transition Carter knock sending that one into the stands however above the cylinder will count for two for Matthew Cleveland 3223 but Arkansas with the ball Wagner is that great family line of outstanding players tiptoeing inside and the kick itll be back up for Knox off the fake finds the lane hes denied off the Miss yes cter Knox getting the basketball back off his own Miss and the presence of mine to be able to get it in the air really before he even lands shows his strength and ability to be able to finish amongst the trees now freshman out of Tampa Cleveland really active and the stop an electrifying move by Matthew Cleveland right down the lane and that finish over top of Adu who was an all SEC Defender at Tennessee a season ago but having no resistance for Matthew Cleveland whos climbed the ladder Miamis made seven straight the laying on a long drive there by Wagner they just kept on coming and nobody picked him up and thats really J Wagners game attacking the basket getting downhill putting the pressure on opposing defenses packed shot barely grazing the iron big Z getting ready to check back in now for the Razer backs hes barely played here in the first half the pull up thatll be off the IR by Richmond and if Im Matthew Cleveland right now Im staying in attack mode no reason to give the basketball up hes had success every time hes put his head down trying to get to the rim hes been a different guy here in the first half than the last several games for Miami hes been the guy that weve gotten used to seeing in the ACC over the past three seasons the first two at Florida State and last year here in Miami indeed under three and a half to go in the first half Johnson will swing it and a whistle with 5 Seconds on a shot clock well go back to that dunck it is the spectacular play of the first half with authority the Finish over the top we may see that on Sports Center later ton back is better dress than everybody thats nothing do I mean outside of OB I mean hes at the top of the CH oh no no fish is way ahead of me no question about oh mishandle by Richmond he was on his way to the rack and just lost it off the body and Billy Richmond does a great job defensively coming up with the steal and then probably just got a little excited trying to figure out whe How He was going to dunk this one on the way to the rim took his eyes off of it lost it out of bounds his dad also Billy played for John caliper at Memphis Billy Richmond of course from the high which will be Camden high school in New Jersey also same high school as DJ Wagner Schwartz and a whistle with a shot going up off the iron foul here against Arkansas with 256 to go and thatll be on Richmond his Music second Billy Richmond another promising freshman for John caliper and again you know one of the things with cal cal is going to always go out and recruit the best players in the country coming out of high school that thats what he wants now if hes going to surround those guys with players from the transfer portal but hes not going to build a team with solely guys that are transfers because he wants to change peoples lives and thats what how he built his legacy by changing the lives of young men getting him out of high school guys who are often one and done who end up been able to sign contracts that support their families for a very very long time hes not going to give up on that mission the goal for Cal now is to be able to surround those talented freshmen with some veterans from the transfer Port trying to become the first coach in history to take four schools to the final four he did it at UMass Memphis and of course Kentucky Rick patino the only other coach to do it three times three different schools bottle up the kick out here for Brazil Wagner looking for room to operate working on Cleveland shot clock of factor down to five and they just lost it but it was tapped out of play off Miami with 230 to go in the first half four on the shot clock here for Arkansas Applause so Wagner averaging nine a game well check it in the sevenfooter will launch it and knock it down he a sweet touch no he absolutely has it OB and you were talking about how Coach Cal said we dont want you shooting them all the time if Im shooting 55 OB Im shooting the three ball all the time and you see big Z loves it out there a 17 for 30 for the year down the lane looking for the window and Jo Bay will draw the foul the 67 sophomore from France Music and the personal file on the Razer backs will go against trevan Brazil the big Junior from Springfield Missouri hes their lone returning scholarship player for Arkansas and two shots coming here for Joe Bay you wondered if he would have a bigger role on this years team from Miami than last year I believe that coach L was expecting for him to have a bigger role on this years team and again you always want for your guys who are returning to making the next step and so when you consider that Im sure theyre expecting more from Joe B but its a very young season Novembers over now were into a new month these coaches are still learning their teams coach L explained that to us a lot earlier today about not its not just about the players learning the system its also about how the coaches learn the best way for the players to be able to learn and adapt to their new environment and for so many of them completely new terminology across the board from their previous programs and theyre doing things with with new coaches they were never asked to do before that ones going to be out of play thrown away calip Perry jumping right in front of us on the sideline not happy at all with that turnover I believe hes not happy about the fact that there really wasnt much of an effort by Brazil to go get the basketball I mean of course the pass didnt come to him but you still dont want to allow it to just go right out of bounds and to have the turnover Clevelands been a hot hand hes feeling it great job by DJ J Wagner getting through the screen recognizing The Scouting Report to chase naigel pack and he can get to that logo and shoot it Jo Bay swatted away nisich got a hand on a shot clock out to two pack pops it up there follows his own Miss and it rolls in and once again the presence of mind not to bring it down but to get it in the air before the shot blocker can actually get a hand on it missed a couple of games but didnt make much of a try at that at all hes up top with it and and consider the fact that Arkansas has seven turnovers now Miamis scored 11 points off of those turnovers Wagner got an excellent free look but couldnt cash in and itll be Miami ball with under a minute to go in the first half Miami trying to snap a four game skid Arkansas has fallen out of the top 25 after losing to Illinois 9077 in Kansas City Nigel pack six foot grb with a very quick step downtown Schwarz off the front of the Music iron DJ Wagner Manning the point Boogie flan on the bench with two fouls here in the first half Wagner going to the point guard position denied by Joe B yes Joe B with a quick step got there deflected it with 29 seconds left in the half and this What DJ does best get downhill but Joe Bay recognizing that as DJ tries to go to the inside left hand Joe Bay over to deny it Knocking it out of bounds still 20 seconds remaining on the shot clock for the Razer Applause backs Richmond for Wagner with a pullup short rebound tipped up and in by Brazil now thats the type of effort coach Cy wants to see from Brazil going in second chance points 40 right now Advantage Arkansas however thats much better than the 224 Advantage charson Southern head over Miami last time out well the kanes with the last shot pack looks like he wants to take it he will cant drain it and thats it to end the first half but Miami and impressive first 20 minutes they they take on an SEC power in Tennessee thats December 10 in the Jimmy V one of the many SEC powers that weve seen early in this season Arkansas will have the basketball as we get the second half underway here at the watsco center Boogie fland flips this one for Wagner and a long one got it nice start to the second half for the Razer backs great execution Miami rotating over taking away the roll to the rim and which has been a dunk a number of times but Boogie flan finding DJ wag was able to knock down the three ball Applause Nel pack playing with that bad foot but at times he has played exceptionally well Miami trying to keep it rolling into the second half Lin kids been pretty quiet hell spin inside for two hes trying to get noisy here but right now Arkansas is content to allow Adu to guard ly kid one onone in the post not going to send a double team to this point trusting ad to be able to defend him Wagner whose dad played for Cal at Memphis his grandfather Wilt uh Milt Wagner played at Louisville on the 1986 National Championship team little step forward a long one downtown that wont drop for flan just underway second half in Miami 4235 the canes and the pass never got there picked off by Arkansas flan wants to run Davis lets fly and hits the triple and we talked about what happened in the first half with Miami turning Arkansas miscues into points on the other end just like that Arkansas makes it a fourpoint game by turning turnovers into a threepoint couple of early triples here for the Arkansas Razer backs pack trying to answer but cant on the run out Theo has to go for it to the Baseline and a whistle and a foul against Miami so pack will pick it up here with 1805 left in the game thatll be his first Im interested to see a do thereo walk off of this one took a hard fall you see gets tripped up goes down hard but into the stanion took him a second to stand up and walk it off and youre talking about one of the toughest guys in college basketball so Junior out of Pittsburgh on the Baseline in for Adu Wagner will call a play here kid came out to guard him had left the interior open for half a second and they nearly cashed in but ad do cant hit the little baby hook State McCrae on the drive spins in two State McCrae getting downhill and thats one of the areas where both these coaches talk to their teams about they want to take their chances in transition push off of Misses even makes when they have the opportunity Wagner knifing inside cant finish it Miami in transition Johnson back for pack hell launch it got it thats the last thing you can do is give Nigel pack that much space and that much time to find the laces hes one of the best thats done it in college basketball and when you consider giving Nigel pack this much room and this much space hes going to burn you every time Miami back to a ninepoint ob I get to my hotel last night as we see big Z stepping in another one of those opportunities right in the basket great find from Boogie fland but I get to my hotel last night and of course turn on the TV and Im watching Dicky V the documentary ESPN did on Dick Bal and I learned so much and I thought I knew everything about Dicky V I followed him of course his entire career seems like but I learned so much about Dick B I knew he was a coach I didnt know he was that good of a coach though really good coach oh great coach really good 210 at Detroit beat Marquette y youre talking about I mean getting to the Sweet 16 so when you think about Dick vital not just the personality on the sidelines which is the greatest to ever do but his ability to be able to coach it John caliper of course making a cameo in the documentary as well as my guy the notorious do as we see Coach Cal going down to see Dicky ve that was awfully sweet yeah on on September 14th and I had opportunity to see Dicky V last December and hopefully get to see him again soon on my trip to City of Palms this year yeah feel the same way obviously we love him and continues to battle cancer hes got a big cancer skin coming up in the middle of December if thats clear hes coming back to work I think and you get to hear those those great tones of the great dick by tal again the do thereo missing a point blank layup there had to get between two Defenders but now when you dont double team ly kid hes going to have success in the paint doesnt matter the size of the defender guarding him they double teamed him on the last possession but Len kid went quickly that time didnt allow the D team time to get there so Miami still in a comfort zone leading by nine Arkansas with the ball here Wagner taking the Baseline that is a tremendous move for two and hes at the line for threepoint play he was determin to get there boy Miami football frog Miami and become the second team well the no they would get in and then s you would be the second team into the playoffs yeah Miami eliminating themselves there the sevenfooter will launch from the corner what a great touch but how about big Z stepping back making sure hes behind the line but you can see hes not 100 either limping down the floor he would have much more of an impact on this game many more minutes and if he had he not turned his ankle in practice recently John caliper kind of has him on a minutes restriction right now faced his twin brother in the Illinois game over the weekend his brother thomaslob had 21 and 10 so he outplayed his big brother shot clock down to five Cleveland was the star of the first half gives it up here in the second half Arkansas with a chance to really close the gap here Boogie fland will call out of play Davis flan looking for room to operate the jumper not there and Cleveland with the rebound on the other side fourpoint game Miami has not Trail but they turn it over again Wagner going up against Jordan will lay it up in in yeah smart play by DJ Wagner as the defender was just waiting to see if he was going to give the basketball up and the cardinal rule of the game of the all three gentlemen at the McDonalds AllAmerican game two years ago and a great moment for them to be able to celebrate together well Miami has taken a shot to the solar plexus here the last couple of minutes Johnson straight on and Big Time rebound coming out of nowhere Matthew Cleveland got up high and this is the Matthew Cleveland weve grown to know and love throughout the ACC attacking the offensive glass making the energy and effort plays and not allowing for anyone to throw him the basketball to be effective he is 13 back up to a fourpoint Advantage for the Kane night number one of the challenge Arkansas what a slam oh tremendous the arrow Rising high and over his head to slam that down so maybe the second play that well see on Sports Center tonight we can see both of those maybe theyll split it just one both those plays from the same game better see them both I think youre right pack with a bounce Schwartz a long one no the rebound is tipped out itll go the other way well whether they show it on Sports CER or not we got to see it again here ad do the arrow going Baseline and with the reverse finish Obie I believe Im going to give this one a 10 my man jumping off the wrong foot the right foot and still the ability to be able to finish under the rim that may to Matthew Cleveland that might the neck and neck right now more to come here in the last 1 15 minutes Wagner great ball movement Theo down the lane look for another one hes denied great job by ly kid going vertical on that possession pack Scoops it nice little give and one as well Brandon Johnson with the finish and hell be at the line and John caliper trying to figure out how it was a foul on one end but not on the other Lyn kid does a great job watch him go vertical gets a hand on the basketball takes a little bit off of what Daryls able to do and then on the other end Js able to finish through the contact a big turnaround for Miami really a fourpoint swing now that could be five here at the free throw line Billy Davis is third foul for Arkansas Brandon Johnson who makes 72 at the line and so the six4 grad out of Gary Indiana has to hit the bench for the Razer backs Johnson a 68 senior came over from East Carolina where he was number 12 all time in rebounding cant finish that Applause off 5349 Applause Miami Boogie flan denied Wagner wants to take it in there the scoop and a block and lets see what they determine here theyre going to count that well they can go back and look at it at the next dead ball next timeout theyll go back and look at that but for right now it will be a bucket you see DJ Wagner ooh I believe theyre going to take that one off from that angle it looks as though Matthew Cleveland got it before it hits the glass right here I believe theyre going to take those two points away when we go to a break yep think youre right it looks like a good block by Matthew Cleveland he pins it to the glass those two points most likely will be removed so at the moment 5351 pressure here by Arkansas and Wagners down in the backourt but recovers yet cannot get the basket the arrow going up high on the other end Blackman oh oh stuffed in by Cleveland he got a mile over the iron okay Matthew Cleveland is back in front wow 21 Cleveland wow and he may have multiple Sports in the highlights tonight goodness gracious hes smiling right now Obie he knows he just did something special Wagner trying to recover flan from the corner got it a threepoint answer Big Time response by The Freshman DJ Wagner attacking the paint finding boogie flann in the corner a huge three to make it a onepoint Game Boy a pace of play here the last couple of minutes has been cracked up to 11 Johnson handing off for Blackman Johnson coming off 23 and a whistle there to stop play at 1119 to go honestly I couldnt wait for the whistle to blow I needed to break into action been taken off so now its a threepoint lead for the Miami Hurricanes in comparison to one when we went to break this a major change for Miami Matthew Clevelands been a very good good player but hes been scuffling this season averaging two points a game the last two contests a completely different guy and in rarified air here in his contest tonight in Miami stolen away picked up by Davis and a whistle before he could get off a shot Billy Richmond attacking the basket I heard the whistle also it was actually right over here it was in the crowd yes they trying to throw throw the Razer backs off a little bit but Billy Richmond attacked the basket able to finish through the contact and now making a onepoint game once again Johnson will hand off here for Blackman 5554 Cleveland lost the dribble John Kip Perry getting Nelly Davis back on the floor gives it up Johnson way down to of many logo territory and Miami extends it to 58 54 big bucket right there as you can see Arkansas building some momentum here on Miamis home floor but the way to get it back is knocking down a three at the shot clock bugger plan rebound tapped around controlled by Davis and thats the thing you know you look at Daviss number averaging over eight points per game over four rebounds but the Arkansas staff will tell you you dont measure his impact on the game by his numbers he does so much more for example coming up with that offensive rebound on the last possession during the break just to hit it again there was a scoring change Cleveland was given credit for the block and was originally a goal 10 so this is our accurate score at 5854 Miami and Arkansas to put it in from the sideline Davis in for Music fland and tapped away a Scramble for for it shot clock will expire without getting off a shot now this is my first Miami game of the season however that may be their best defensive play this year thus far Jim Lena has to be happy with the way that his team has approached this game with a defensive mindset and again the canes have led throughout n Jo Pac bringing the ball up a big reason why in an excellent first half State McCrae trying to take the Baseline denied tough defense by the Razer backs on the interior and numbers for Arkansas with Len kid going down in the back court but a turnover Boogie flan unable to handle it going to the rent now the second annual SEC ACC womens challenge continues on Thursday night number 18 Old Miss squaring off against NC State at 7 eastern time thats on ESPN 2 two our ESPN double header has number four Texas battling 10th ranked Notre Dame thats followed by Duke number eight South Carolina number three jumper from the wing and knocked down Miami with a fast answer from Jaylen Blackman who makes 39 great play by ndel pack cracking the paint and then finding Blackman on the interior who gives Miami some separation Davis Slams on the break and knocks down the short Jumper in the lane and Davis who is a guy that can absolutely be a score for this Razorback team has really been much more of a role player but a big buckup for him on that possession State McCrae got the start here tonight for Jim Lena ly kid backing in and a blocking foul with 835 Applause left and Arkansas about to bring Brazil and Wagner back on this picks up the foul thatll be his first John calip Perry comfortable with going nine deep with his Arkansas Razorback Squad kind of bringing back the 40 minutes of hell type of Arkansas my God Todd day Lee Mayberry corus Williamson all those guys who play for NOA richon back in the day long one here Blackman yes thatll rattle in from three Point Land but what they have not been able to do is get Miami off the threepoint line especially Blackman whos knocked down back toback threes the last couple possessions for The KES Davis lets fly and nothing but net and you see Davis now starting to assert himself a little more you and I watched him at Florida Atlantic a year ago win the ESPN events Invitational where he was the AAC co player of the year so hes a guy that absolutely can put points on the board he was their number one scorer last year if he with 18 a game under 8 minutes to Applause go pack for kid kid making 72 of his shots with a lot of them like that and John calip Perry torn between whether or not you double team ly kid you talk about 72 thats pretty much guaranteed when he catches it that close FL hit the deck no contact there Davis again back to the point guard the kick out Davis again short this Applause time Blackman pulls up rebound hell get a second chance at it another jumper on the way and that wont drop for State McCrae and Arkansas will take over with about seven to go as they continue to scrap 6659 Miami with the for 10 times thats one of the areas of concerned for Jim Lena he knows theyre not a great defensive rebounding team so theyre going to have to turn their opponents over to be successful and Jaylen Blackman another problem for Arkansas he has 12 points hes four out of six from three so hes hurt them flann way downtown no and a rebound tipped itll be Miami ball 648 to go Applause and lets see if Cleveland gets another opportunity to elevate here in these last seven minutes he has the ball ly kit he Spence gets in close went for the pass and out of play off Miami but when youre that close Len kid did everything right the footwork perfect go ahead and shoot the basketball because even if he puts that on the glass and misses it Matthew Cleveland maybe has another putb dump for Jo Bs right there in the mix also to be able to clean it up but link here doesnt miss often when hes that close to the rim 10 turnovers from Miami they had only four in the first half theier with a pull up pop knocks it down and smart play wanted to actually drive that and kick it to the corner but found himself in his sweet spot in the position to be able to get a bucket raises up over the top of the defender pack nearly lost it the arrow almost got a hand on it underneath that wont drop for kid he doesnt miss many that close Wagner on the drive Scoops it up a very acrobatic shot for two and hes been doing that since he was a freshman in high school attacking the rim going up against much bigger Defenders but the strength and the ability to score over the top never fearful of getting into the paint well to this point every time that Arkansas has made a run miams had an answer little floater here thatll fall in pack with a Nifty touch nice soft touch spot pack there but more importantly the back door the recognition as the defender tries to deny Music him the arrow very determined there and contact and a whistle with 521 to go OB spent some time with the duo this summer at the Jason Tatum Elite camp and he talked about coming to Arkansas and having a different mindset this year he wanted to do everything right for the team a year ago it got off to a great start at Kentucky had a big game against Duke in the Champions classic and then tailed off a little bit allow deferred to others allowed them to be the Stars he understands this year he has to be the star for this Arkansas Team to be successful hes been that 19 points a game six rebounds straight on Davis yeah thatll rattle in and weve seen him step up in the second half as well Nelly Davis knocking down the three ball his second three of the second half twopoint game Cleveland again with a touch going on the drive jumping inside now he needs help and thats going to be a turnover on the double dribble Matthew Cleveland had a good run to the rim unable to get it on the glass and then give Arkansass defense a lot of credit for swarming under the basket forcing the turnover and now an opportunity for the laser backs to tie or even take a lead with the Music three Wagner trying to get free instead is flan up high and thats going to go the other way another turnover and inopportune time for Arkansas as big Z gets the offensive foul have to give the defender an opportunity to get around the screen no longer can you go up and put a body on a Defender to try to free up your teammate four and a half to go and Arkansas again knocking on the door ly kid making his way toward the bay the double comes almost gave it up packed from the corner yes thats the fear of double teaming thats why John caliper has been hesitant and gone back and forth whether or not to double team Jim LGA told us lyad had three assists last time out off of double teams alone does a great job of spraying it out big Z got it big time answer twopoint game again once again if I shot the three as well as that I would shoot it every time just like shooting it everybody in America is with you on that one now Joel Pac pulls up not there for him and again Arkansas with a Chance to tie or take the lead in Miami Wagner on the drive good swing FL from the corner Matthew Cleveland hesitant right now theres in the first half he would have taken that one all the way to the rim slows it down on that possession not sure that was the best thing for his team on that Music possession going to be a block shot there by the big fella but out of Play It Goes itll go the other way Miami with the last touch 309 to go and hes hobbled big Z with that bad ankle 716 does not go out off of him out of bounds but walking back to the bench Miss time this season so a couple of stars not at 100 not Applause close there to make a move FL outside under three minutes to go Wagner on the attack Airborne no rebound tip theyll get a second effort at Applause Music it Davis up high for flan shot clock at seven shot clock down to one and a whistle with one on the shot clock and a big time bail out yeah bailed out as you see boogie flan going to the rim gets downhill and Blackman knowing that hes beat reaches in grabs that left arm of flan sending him to the free throw line didnt recognize he had Matthew Cleveland coming over to help out with only 13 remaining on the shot clock so two here with 225 to go Applause Arkansas on the verge of catching Miami here at last Miami is not trailed in the game vand makes 83 at the line the McDonalds allamerican and he has tied it up 7171 tell you what weve been treated to a ball game both these teams have played extremely hard recognizing that its the SEC ACC champ Challenge and each one of these games is going to matter when we tally it up at the end of tomorrow night Cleveland who has been a dunk show tonight hes trying to go up high and it rolls off the iron on the alop great job bra Brazil getting back defensively disrupting that would have been another highlight for Matthew Cleveland flan gave off the pass loose on the deck the arrow Scoops it up 148 to go heres the jumper got it the youngster from the corner knocks it down guys getting on the floor after the loose basketball but Arkansas starting now to make the 5050 plays that they werent making before as John well flan senior AKA Boogies dad is checking out the action happy to see his son performing here on the big stage Kevin Connors that is an8 nothing run for Arkansas they surge in front Applause now Boogie fland a young star 16 points a game playing like one he absolutely abolutely is attacking the basket unable to be able to make the play but how about ad theier with the dime to the corner right into the shooting pocket of Boogie flan who makes sure that the three ball out of the corner pocket is good and now Arkansas holding a threepoint lead after Miami has pretty much dominated this game throughout held on to a lead the entire time now Arkansas takes its first lead 142 remaining 7471 every time Miami looked like Arkansas is going to run past him they made a big play a dunk or a threepointer heres pack to launch rebound comes out High Blackman with another one Nigel Pac to drive it the scoop yes great job by Nigel Pac recognizing everyone from Arkansas knows he wants to get to the three uses his ability to play off the bounce gets the layup onepoint game it has turned into a heck of a game here in Miami tonight in the challenge just about a minute to go Davis for flan at the logo under a minute fland again pulls up he sticks it boy big time Shots by the youngster a star and making his presence felt head his his first freshman game against Illinois didnt play well only two for2 from the field but he has responded here tonight Johnson cant find the range and its Boogie flann with the rebound hes doing it on both ends and now hes communicating with John caliper what he wants to run here on what could be the final offensive possession for the Razer back Applause Music fland again over the top oh went for it and theier draws the foul we watched Arkansas run that play time and time again and shoot around today Boogie flan called this off of his rebound he knew exactly what he wanted to do it was not an opportunity for him even though hes got a couple buckets on the last two possessions it was an opportunity for him to score it was to make a play for his teammate goes up top to Theo who is unable to get the Finish but does get fouled and now a chance to make it a twopossession game at the line 112 and Miss fires on the first one you talked about the issues he had against Illinois at the line 12 of 21 he really scuffled but Arkansas by three mom looking cuz she cant even look and missed the pair threepoint game here comes Cleveland and a reach and fland will foul him from behind with 74 on the clock and I like that foul by John caliper because of course you have fouls to give in that scenario so now with two Applause timeouts John caliper is going to take one and discuss with his team what he wants to do here whether they going to foul up three and how you have to do it tonight but taking that time out I would expect to see John caliper foul but freshman Schwarz will put it in and lets see how the Razer Backs play this pack trying to get through and B speed almost stolen away itll stay on this end 55 seconds remaining and its called its called Miamis basketball but the officials will go over under 2 minutes youre allowed to be able to go to the Monitor and review to make sure you got this correct we see I believe that will stay with Miami looks as though Brazil was the last to touch it from that angle great angle here to our crew looks like the left hand of Brazil was under review for out of bounds looks like the left hand of Brazil was the last to touch it this angle shows it well as does the other angle where you see here look at the left hand of Travon Brazil the last one on the basketball that will stay with Miami and now theyll check the time to make sure theyve got the proper time on the clock yeah right now showing 55 after the deflection Arkansas with quite a comeback here on an enemy floor tonight every time they made an effort they got an answer from Miami until Boogie flann kind of took over the game and made huge shots here in the last few minutes he absolutely did that and thats been his calling card watching him growing up hes been a special offensive player but seeing him mature into the point guard that hes become in just his eighth game in college is really special to see so the official still at the monitor to review as you can do under two minutes and John caliper already expecting the basketball to go to Miami its going to be ruled Miami ball yeah has his team already on the floor set to defend and it reset call on the floor stands white ball reset the clock to 6 seconds so another half second added Miami tried to run an elevator screen on the last possession to get Blackman at the top of the key now they changed the inbounder to Nigel pack who of course the inbounder always the most dangerous guy getting it back got it in for Blackman pack on the drive and he is fouled hes going to be fouled by Davis great job defensively by Davis fouling before pack is able to get into a shooting motion thatll be his fourth but still had a foul to give and now at this point John caliper tell his team not to foul Blackman off the inbounds cant hit it and thats going to go out at the buzzer that is the ball game Miami got a great look at the end of the game just unable to get it to go Arkansas survives and wins their first road game of the season as you see Blackman get a good look a knockdown shooter just unable to get it to go
