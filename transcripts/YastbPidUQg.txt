they like to get him up they like to fly the ball up the court and NC States got to be ready for them UT Martin in blue NC State in white and we are underway the wolf pack backto back WIS looking to keep it going here in nonconference play a quick scoop to the hoop we told you both teams love to score we might not see a shot clock go under 10 tonight and take a look at the wolf pack starting five Noah yeah and Casey more sesman great and then DJ Burns right there with the basketball they play through them all night long and hes really good at that reading the digs and the double teams getting open shots for his teammates we mentioned Sears and crws lead the way for the Skyhawks those are the rest of the five and they are not shy they are going to let it fly theyve got the green light all night long from head coach Ryan Ritter and already pretty early they got two layups I mean KK Curry just missed an easy Applause one great pass Corner three its good Casey Morel the first of what youd think would be many threes tonight for NC State although theyve got it as a two right now yeah a great dish by DJ Burns who was conference Player of the Year in the Big South during his three seasons at lro and expect UT Martin to kind of change up cover on him in the post Jus as Jackson lines up a triple and hits it Casey Morel a moment ago his put on the line but theres the first three from UT Martin theyve been so explosive on the offensive end 87 points per game and number 16 in the country in Fast Break points Dennis Parker Jr a freshman whos come in and provided big minutes as of of Music late and right here heres what theyre going to try to do against Jordan Sears is pressure him throw a couple different bodies against him and try to wear him down right there he almost committed a turnover but when youre getting pressed up on thats going to really take away some of your some of your handle over the long term theres Ryan Ritter head coach of UT Martin improved 11 wins between year one and year two looking to take that next step wi the OV get into the NCAA tournament here in year three thats a deep three and its nothing but the bottom of the net Jacob Cruz unlimited range yeah we we told you about it I mean he just stared out I was like Carmelo Anthony star down the hand was down and he just launched from Deep hes got the headband too hes a big accessory guy hes got a leg sleeve an arm sleeve and a headband feels like one of those create a player on a on a basketball video game NBA Music Applause 2K defense leading to a good look second chance still no good and youre going to see both utam Martin and NC State flying into passing lanes and and right there that was a wide open three because it was a huge chance taken by UT Martin trying to just fly out and get a steal Sears couldnt connect there offensive rebound will stay with the Music Skyhawks take a look at the tail of the tape Noah both teams love to push it high Tempo teams you see that with the fast break points and the threepoint makes yeah and then the rebounds per game on the defensive end for UT Martin is is tops in the country and Coach Ritter told us that uh dont dont get too carried away with that thats thats partially because they play so many possessions but you you got to give them credit they they clean up that defensive glass and that kind of fuels their break theres a turnover until the Skyhawks are hoping to avoid tonight and it leads to points the other way thats what NC State can do theyll turn you over that time Taylor finishes it yeah but Jaden Taylor had Dennis Parker wide open they could out a much easier layup right there but thats exactly what the wolf pack want tip balls and steals need the Music transition thatll be good for for UT Martin right there they can try to draw out DJ burns into in the coverage right here this is a tough finish on three guys but his teammate was wide open underneath as well so credit him with the Finish but it could have made it a little bit easier only 7 seconds on the shot clock Sears has to hurry comes off the screen right to the rim swatted by birds theres 1 second on the shot clock and Jordan Sears trying to test out DJ Burns underneath of a little scoop layup but great job by DJ burns the big man move the feet thats a shot clock violation four minutes gone by UT Martin not shy to start and no doubt its its its much more than just a game you can Overlook if your NC State because of the threepoint shooting of that man Jacob Cruz Music rolling at am protecting what matters most to you matters most to us you got the Love youve Got The Love now youll have peace of mind for his future we get how uncertain the future is weve come of age in a complex World face to face with problems we didnt create so whats going to happen next we are because our future is the future so were going to build Bridges and hospitals in a day and feed those left in the cold were going to do all this and more because we have an appointment with Destiny this Christmas Day High time me and you was introduced the motion picture event of the holiday season arrives I thought I invite a few Music Applause Music folks its time SE

of vacations icon of the Seas arriving 2024 look at that sweet frosting and filling thats what makes PopTart such a great snack I sure hope we could eatting soon we will I made a sign its working HS crazy Music good Ryan Ritter of the UT Martin Skyhawks making the 11hour trip East from Martin Tennessee the popular just over 10000 people so you can almost fit twice the population of Martin Tennessee in PNC Arena yeah and he he kind of told us a story like when he got the job all right hes got to convince his wife lets move out to the middle of nowhere his words not mine dont kill me Martin Tennessee but uh theyre coming after you he you know just signed a big extension so he is locked in there for the long hul and hes already got this program going in the right direction and you know I think certainly Jacob Cruz has been been even better than they expected him to be that the transfer from Daytona State College they coming out of the timeout DJ horn buries a triple so EDC State leading for the first time tonight thats a turnover three already for UT Martin Dennis Parker great rotation along the base line horn couldnt connect that time from a similar spot where he buried the last one yeah youre seeing UT Martin try to slow it down a little bit because coach Ritter said he knows even for a team that likes to play fast it might not be the best solution to try to run with NC State open look those are the ones you have to make if youre going to pull the upset and so far UT Martin has the last one belongs to Sears yeah last time they stole that pass on the Baseline and then that one they missed it by an inch and gave up a three that is money from DJ burs his bread and butter hes so smooth and he hes got a great body but its really the touch I mean he shoots little pullup jumpers from 6 feet from 8 ft oh UT Martin has come to play KK Curry they are not backing down on the road big underdogs in this game yeah beautiful back door cut and then off the trampoline underneath and the Wolf Pack answer with a three back in front by one and DJ Burns again setting the table from the post risky pass deflected out of bounds from number 11 right here get overplayed by the ncate defense KK Curry back door Monster Jam the star down game has been aite from M Martin to start this game yeah hes hes a young man who coach Ritter shared with us that early on in his career he was not bought in and he pretty much came to him and said either you got to start doing what we want or youre not going to be seeing a lot of minutes and hes turned all around and as a senior hes one of his his top program guys he absolutely loves coaching KK Curry contested three hits it again Jacob Cruz his second of the night I dont know he saw the rim right there that was like you know Wilson over the fence in Home Improvement I mean that was wildly contested shot and NC State answers right back we told you there was going to be a lot of scoring well both of these teams have made their last three shots and the tempo is not slowing Applause down Jacob Cruz what Im talking about has good as adverti look at this this is about as good perimeter defense as you can play if youre o Connell and nothing you can do about it 68 he elevated knocked it down feeling himself these team shooting a combined 13 of 22 so a hot start to say the least although a misslay up Music there foul on the floor so now your NC State youve seen how good UT Martin is so that the shock of wait theyre pretty good team can kind of be over and now theyve got to find their energy and they got to start getting some deflections and playing with a little bit more energy because I think UT Martins had more energy early Music contested and blocked at The Rim UT Martin undersized at every position but battling here on the road counted plus the foul Jacob Cruz what a start for the Skyhawks and hes got one more year and he hes going to be transferring somewhere High major this is like an audition tapee right here but right there exactly what he wants to do the trailer launches it thats like a layup for him and NC State now has to go all right number 35 in blue pick him up at the NBA line Cruz a perfect three for three from three that a fourpoint play with the and one coach Ritter told us if he has 100 open shots he should take a 100 shots and so far the green light is well deserved yeah hes what we call a driller its its one level above a shooter where if hes opening in range you just expect it to go in thats a travel and States trying to get it all back at once hes got to take it one play at a time and a little bit Music rushed what an impressive start for UT Martin shooting seven of 11 from the floor theyve made their last four and we told you Sears and Cruz two big time players that have come into PNC Arena confident tonight heres Sears now and he traveled the UT Martin has built a fourpoint lead theyre giving NC State everything the wolf pack can handle Applause

go Enterprise one to beam up Im just a programmer at Pluto TV yeah how cool would it have been if I had just beamed up right now it would be very cool I know a holiday message from Jackson hu jingle bell jingle bell chle all the way oh yeah oh what fun it is to get the same Music day UI Martin on top of NC State and Jacob Cruz early not afraid to fire from Deep NBA range three for three and showing you why he leads the OBC threepointers made per contest is just under three and that one was and one but he has been lights out for UT Martin who has shown no signs of fear or nerves J yeah the Skyhawks have come out shooting 64 from the floor NC State shooting 50 which will win you a lot of games big time three Jaden Taylor delivers continues his hot shooting 50 from behind the arc this season Music Taylors got two triples tonight Kevin Keats told us Jaden Taylor the transfer from Butler has been the most consistent player on a team that is still finding its identity it was a roster overhaul six new transfers Taylor one of them one freshman comes in in eight games six different leading scorers so theyre still trying to find how they will play together early in a new season and hes embraced that role of being the best on ball Defender and you know tonight hes going to need to continue to do that and and continue to try to bother Jordan Sears and another transfer MJ rice makes his first Pucket of the night and his wolf pack debut last week scored 11 points in 10 minutes heres Cruz who stays perfect and back and forth we go punch for punch now it went in but NC State did their job at least they got him off the threepoint line but it just seems like hes comfortable and now were seeing both teams heat up it is officially a shootout here in Raleigh MJ rice backto back makes hes still got three seasons of Eligibility but he has looked really good again this just his second game of the season but he could certainly score offensive foul going the other Music way nice job number one J Taylor for the right here just going a little bit too far into the de the defense and Jaden Taylor commits the charge good de by UT Martin now D they still you can tell its a new group of guys for NY State and when you get the transfers coming in coming together you though theyre the 14th most experienced team in the country in terms of D1 minutes its still a feeling out process to get the chemistry going and get the in happening but how about MJ rice in terms of coming into a team thats already been playing together last week 11 points in 10 minutes he has seven points in three so he could score no doubt about that just still finding his rhythm lost the handle there now forti so rice early on coming that fifth double figure score for NC State and you know this is balance I mean its not only double figure but theyre theyre averaging almost the exact same amount and you know what that does when youre a player is you just real feel really invested you know you know you could go off one night your teammate could go off another night and oh hes hes hes capable of missing Jay I didnt know that guy could miss first Miss of the night for Cruz and NC State gives it Music away pull up pop no good right there they got to dump it right down to DJ burns up they got to play through this guy right on Q yeah hes so unique because he loves that little eightfooter you know that thats kind of the Lost Art thats how guys played in the 70s and he really he can just get to a spot and Elevate and that time little pick and pop found the short corner and he loves that that little jump shot Music there you would think tonight that Kevin Keats and everybody watching this game knows UT Martin doesnt have a player like DJ Burns you know they guards Sears and k k Curry they they can match up with NC States guards at times but DJ Birds theres nobody the Skyhawks can answer with for him no and and he can do it against anybody so he he doesnt even need a size Advantage but when you got a huge height and strength Advantage I think if theyre not on a bre they got to DP it down to 30 in white rice traveled took a step before the dribble now qu number 11 Dennis Parker j five turnovers in this first half for NC State a fourpoint lead though and the Wolfpack have made their last four shots where UT Martin have fallen cold theyre at a scoring drought of more than two minutes Music now after starting this game eight of 13 from the field theyve now missed five in a row yeah thats going to play right into States hands a long contested two morcel he was halfway down rattled in and out stays wolf pack ball underneath their own hoopet nice recovery inside Sebastian Mendoza with the block but you know DJ Burns I mean he was doing it against Quinton post against BC and and thats a legit sevenfooter so you know you know he when you play with someone like him whos a willing passer out of the post and youre a perimeter guy like I want him to get the ball so I can relocate and get an open three spun his way into a foul there fou number 15 Christi Music foul Music Applause heres DJ horn and now Burns decides to take it himself cant connect that time saw the double team didnt come he recognized went right over the top was going to get a 10sec B right there that was close UT Martin now more more than 3 minutes without a point and a giveaway Casey morcel the steal and the score time out Ryan Ritter NC State on a 122 run over the last 4 minutes to grab control of this Applause game I got I got it I got I got it at AA your coverage always comes

show up 3 2 1 game time get L get L pick up pick up get your hands in the air its ack up sck up shake your tamb moving quicker quier yeah Im shaking down the I got you Music baby got love Music that love this time shop Ks big holiday sale savings this big wont last Music long well its been a Hallmark under Kevin Keats here at NC State but the turnovers leading to points on the other end yeah great steal by Casey Morel but if youre UT Martin you cant just stand around against NC State I mean youre youre a Sitting Duck and youve seen the success that NC state has had on the defense end forcing turnovers has been a staple of Coach Peaks and really since hes arrived in Raleigh NC State wants to play fast on both sides of the ball and a fast pace will turn teams over more and not only that but the turnovers are are live ball so they usually go back the other way for points and so far tonight NC State 10 of their 28 points have come off UT Martin turnovers theres another turn over against the Skyhawks at least thats a dead ball one Noah so they can set their defense who wont hurt them yeah and and UT Martin was making very few mistakes in the first part of this half and now weve seen a couple mental errors in a row so theyve got to regroup here on the road wolf pack on a 12 to2 run looking for more and they get it big time three DJ horn his second triple of the night yeah DJ horn another Big Time transfer coming over from the Arizona State sundevils and he a guy who made 72 threes with them last season so he can stroke it and good things happen when the ball gets into the paint before you shoot it UT Martin LED in this game 206 but since then they have fallen into a scoring drought its allowed NC State to grab control on a 152 run yeah and Jordan Sears has been quiet I mean leads the conference in scoring and assist and and hes seeing a little bit more length and a little bit more size guarding him than he usually sees but hes got hes got to try to get a piece of that paint from Martin Dennis Parker Jr The Talented freshman all over Jacob Cruz great pass from Cruz in the dun I mean jump in the air pre to the heavens get bailed out by KK Curry I mean he Jacob Cruz had nowhere to go with that pass and you feel bad for Parker Jr who played remarkable defense on that possession talented freshman great energy especially on the defensive side of the ball you saw it there and thats just too easy for DJ burds I mean he just got so much more strength and size down low than Jacob Cruz and he smartly didnt settle for the Jay that time time got right to the cup for a layup and we have a wedgie in Raleigh right here a little better to be lucky than good as Jacob Cruz hanging the air for an eternity the cut and the flush down low second monster dunk of the game for KK Curry I was about to say thats his second slam he should just be running back doors all night long yeah and and honestly against NC State they try to deny the first pass so that cut is open but the problem is the defender on you is so good at taking away Vision that its hard to Applause see UT Maran in the danger zone shot clock under five Cruz heaves it up thats no good they have lost their offensive Rhythm yeah I think theyre theyre trying to use Jacob Cruz as the ball handler instead of getting Jordan Sears involved and letting Jacob Cruz be the beneficiary of the penetrating kick Burns hell make you pay from there usually not that time Music Corner three Skyhawks need it and get it oh a t taunting K Curry hit the three then called for the technical turned around and chirped at the one back Ben here it is and right there he cranks a three from the corner and then right in front of the official you got to be a little smarter than that and yeah thats a pretty quick te what I see all the time Jay can I get on my uh my front porch here as an old man go for a second okay theres so much of the hes too small celebration every time somebody scores in the post around the country and I wonder why thats not taunting cuz its right in front of everybody so I I dont mind this call but theres some reasonable amount of uh junk talking that is part of the game Jay as you know of course I think its time and place and that one was right in front of Clare Aubrey almost yeah she was in between yeah so it was almost directed at her I know it wasnt it was directed at the Wolfpack bench but you just have to know where you are hes like on their bench too so you got to clean it up you dont want any altercations so just just got to use use your head a little bit as a play yeah what I dont want though and youre like we should see more of those calls or I we dont I mean you could call it almost after every basket I you dont want to DET turn to that either nice drill Denis Parker Junior stayed with it I really like the Freshman Parker junor Noah youre not the only one his coach really likes him nice block inside but but he loves his energy and its plays like that tipping the ball that that really can get you a lot more playing time horn left it short up ahead Cruz acrobatic to do well not an easy layup there but he got it to go yeah Showtime below the rim alup right there thats one I could do Jay two feet below the rim that was nice Jacob Cruz has 14 of UT Martins 29 NC State a comfortable cushion though 10point lead for DJ Burns at the wolf pack at amama we know the most important part of the home is the family inside it Im so glad everyones safe so Music much okay get this right and you get my free ticket to tonights game

NC State answers right back floting it into Parker Jr under 2 minutes remaining lead at eight for the wolf pack yeah DJ horn with a great great pass and that that diagonal skip pass right to the corner of the backboard is open against zones and theres such few players that can see that and deliver that was a excellent Applause feat quick release Taylor this fires burns the Tip Drill great coordination to lay that up and in yeah its its a no no yes I mean he didnt even come down with it just tipped it to himself the little Banker cleaning up the spill on the other and KK Applause Curry wide open three hell make you pay Jaden Taylor buries another one yeah you team Mar huge breakdown you know you cant leave Jaden Taylor shooting itself well from behind the arc he was wide Music Applause open Kobe Jeff trying to answer down the lane kick out and a Music turnover right here Casey Morel sees Jaden Taylor on the opposite Wing wide open I mean look at theres no blue jerseys anywhere near him hes wide open and hes shooting 50 from downtown coming into the game and if you want to win on the road youre UT Martin you got to find the best player on the other team and locate him I that that is a huge breakdown Kevin Keats with a use it or lose it timeout and he elects to use Music it I got got got it at am your coverage always comes with compassion you got Im just glad to

assignment Noah never been you been Jay the Olympics are there coming up yes wow is that is that this summer it is wow cant believe its bekb be aart Music yeah shot clock at seven heres DJ Burns trying to extend an 11point lead that was halfway down didnt fall fou number 14 KC Morel for the one by this first foul team you got to go in your bag if youre UT Martin whats your 4C play to get it down the court situations you work on if its their ball what would your 4 second play be they got to throw long the old kickb BPO play here we go oh got a great look just couldnt connect the hot shooting for UT Martin really tailed off they started this game shooting 68 from the floor theyre now under 50 and its a during this second half make some things happen for UT Martin and its Sears and UT Martin that start with the basketball trailing by 11 heres Cruz okay thats a good start Jacob Cruz usually camping out behind the line takes it inside that time with a good move for the score Kobe Jordan The Head and Shoulders fake the fade away that was nice now hold on a second youve compared Jacob Cruz to Carmelo Anthony Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan tonight just the move not the player the move was Kobe like what was your best comp when you were playing anine Walker why was that gambling problem I was going to say not a lot of Defense but that noing deep deep three stretch four I dont knowel the St the other thing that theyve got going for them in this matchup is theyve got the size Advantage now one thing that was pointed out out to us at halftime is we have not seen the junior modara tonight and Craig Hamill the sports information director for the wolf pack d IR he is available but you can see with the sweats on that we dont anticipate him playing tonight or else we would have saw him in the first half so well have to wait till after the game to get the answer from Kevin Keats on why he has not touched the court tonight yeah thats a big loss in terms of his rebound he had an 18 rebound game earlier this season man that guy listen Jaden Taylor can flat out shoot the ball he hes been left over Time and Again by UT Martin they got they got to press up on him and make him put on the deck and both teams really starting to run right now foul called on the floor and why diara being out is or not out but has not played tonight is because UT Martin is without their big man Isa Muhammed soan Ritter told us head coach of the Skyhawks diara himself could get 20 rebounds tonight because weve got nobody with his type of rebounding prowess and I guess both guys missing their number one rebounder tonight lets call it even yeah and E muhamd in the OBC level is an elite level five I mean he he hes excellent at this level but in the OBC hes special and you know hes going to be a huge piece for UT Martin this Applause season with muhamed out thats good David Kanga some playing time ah offensive foul is the call and right there that was caused by by Jaden Taylor right here he presses up Trails hard and and I dont know not maybe a little little early roll right there caus the moving screen but when you pressure the basketball when you Trail hard and you communicate good things happen on defense both pack have just their first three shots of the second half trying and that of the new sos nobody close to him and UT Martin is overh helping on the drive and its a wide open same side three for their best shooter and UT Martin with the immediate answer this is more like the first half when we saw these two teams just going punch for punch on the offensive end two teams that love the Fast Pace High Tempo back and forth style theres Cruz that rims out no Applause Music good DJ horn settles it step back three cant connect and Parker too much effort on that rebounding attempt commits the foul 11 Parker nice physical rebound Inside by Jordan Sears moving well look at this this this looked like David Thompson in the first dunk contest that were flying in from half court and sometimes you got to just see when when you have a chance of going after the ball versus committing a foul but he he he plays with a ton of energy and thats a big reason why theyre excited about that freshman like a golden retriever yeah sometimes you got to you got to place the energy in the right place all the way to the rim scoop to the hoop for two Justice for the Justice Jackson nice little hesi scoop shot with the left hand right no double team coming so he can go DJ Burns will make you pay when you dont double yeah thats easy money give it to him down L he surveyed the court he knew it wasnt coming and you know your UT Martin even if youre not going to double you got to fake at him like youre going to double because that was just too easy for him to read Applause Jordan Sears hes had a quiet night for his standards another layup backto back scoop to the Hoops for UT Martin and Sears needed that to get going and that was great read saw DJ Burns step out knew he couldnt stay with him and just went to another gear to get all the way to the bucket MJ rice backing to the game number three in white so many guards at the disposal for Kevin Keats this season they say it went off UT Martin last so itll be wolf pack ball underneath their own hoop GE here starting to get going for UT Martin pick and roll hesi inside layup Applause nice at

out of Market games with replays highlights and more with YouTube Music TV well the one thing that NC state has this year that a lot of college basketball teams dont is depth and then that depth providing a lot of balance and Kevin keis team has proven that again tonight Noah yeah no doubt five players averaging in double figures and theyre right on Pace for that and and when you throw in kind of the way theyre able to switch on the perimeter with those guards you it makes them incredibly versatile and kind of the the the most different player is that guy DJ burns the officials blow this play dead burds you mentioned the double double 10 points 10 rebounds he is so fun to watch and one of these days he might be on Triple double watch because hes that gifted a passer yeah and and definitely willing as a passer Dennis Parker Jr continues to gain confidence in a wolf pack uniform he does not look like a freshman out there no hes hes going to gain a lot more confidence the more playing time he gets you know like one of the biggest when youre a freshman is the difference between practice and the game and a lot of times its easier to score in the game because in my experience the coaches let you foul so much in practice so so when youre a freshman and youre playing youre going man this games actually easier than the practic is and you kind of gain confidence by just getting more and more experience as the season goes on I had never heard that before that thats a great Point well the coaches want you playing hard in practice this and then on top of that you know your own teams play so it can become a slug Fest from practice for sure theres Jacob Cruz hes been the hot hand tonight that rims out no good Michael Lo Conor rips down the rebound NC State trying to push the pace turn defense into offense like theyve done all night all season and really in the seven years under Kevin Keats fou there Jaden Taylor will head to the line for two great refusal of the screen by Jaden Taylor on the side pick and mo DJ Burns said it he just went Baseline and the C opened up went for that reverse so great twoman game with those two but its like you know when you play with a guy like DJ burs you got to be able to get open I mean he can set you a big screen if you cant get open with that guy screening for you I I cant help you you can dump it to him you play handoff basketball or you can play pick and roll with him and hes comfortable in all three phases so to me if youre a perimeter guy in NC State you got to just say hey number 30 in Whites my best friend you know Im going to buy him dinner every night Im going to give him the Rock and Im just going to play through him to get my shots Etsy state has now missed four straight free throws had the chance to extend this lead to double digits but have failed to capitalize on the free throw opportunities UT Martin hanging around only down seven they were down 30 to Rice they ended up cutting it to seven so they have big time comeback Music ability great passing team a great shooting team and Wango fou there hell head to the line middle Brook try to resist inside but committed the foul thats a pretty good opportunity for an n one but he missed the little jump hook taking a deep dive on UT Martin as the Skyhawks have made it a twopossession game they are 0 and 60 in the division one era against Power five schools 0 and 60 theyve never won against against the power five team and when you can get late in a game and still one two possessions down you start thinking to yourself we can make some history yeah and I I dont think theyre going to watch you know this tape and think that they played well necessarily in the first half so if they can just keep it close and and get some more fast break points and especially some open threes I think they can feel pretty good about their chances here it burns out of the game lacking some rhythm deep three Off the Mark and nice rebound by Cruz he averages nine a Music game heres Justice Jackson shot clock ticks down to 10 in attack mode KK Curry he cant connect and now NC State off and running MJ rice hes fouled hard on his way to the rim the Kansas transfer trying to cash in in transition took a big foul there number5 and you see a big time swing there because KK curry made a great move to get into the paint he missed an easy shot even though hes good defense inside and right here great burst by jayen Taylor to throw it ahead and thats a hard foul and a little bit car for MJ rice right there but I think its a clean play he just ended up landing on his backside I think hes going after the ball and it wasnt unnecessary or extra Music contact so to be a flagrant one its got to be excessive or severe during live ball especially when a player swings an l so I I dont think he was elbowing or swinging anything and I didnt see a lot of wind up right here look he goes up with two hands tries to make a play and its just an awkward delivery you know to me to me thats a clean play its clean foul rather I would agree with you that the way rice landed made you think it was worth taking a look at and that it could be a flagrant hey you take a look at it and I think it should be a common foul now for the w p number zero TJ four BS up the line for the one so common foul is the call confirmed this is the closest UTM has been since the 918 Mark in the first half when it was 2622 and so MJ rice had has to leave the floor because the coaches came out to check if he was okay on the injury thats why Ben Middlebrooks is shooting the free throw even though it was a common foul no no no I got it and after NC State had missed four in a row middle Brook swishes two from the line thats a turnover Cruz bailed out his poor pass jump ball possession arrow remains with the wolf pack yeah and and Jay this is why when youre getting pressed youve got to look long Jordan Sears is getting double teamed by NC State and the back court and if youre a forward for UT Mark you got to help because right there that that was a pass because he was running out of time with with 5 Seconds everybodys got to help break that press but n state is overloading the front court and the long pass will be open and Morel Cashes in thats what NC State can do to you theyll turn you over and then theyll make you pay yeah beautiful midrange turnaround like cas Morel spent his first two seasons at Virginia and had to adjust a little bit to playing a faster Pace here at NC State but that was pretty talk about playing two of the most different Paces in the entire Applause country right there they got the block down low Kevin with it no they dont like it line lets see hes outside I believe the restricted area no hes got a little see it one more time he might have just been heel on that Applause restricted watch the right foot yeah he in the restricted area I think hes in you think he was in yeah you got to extend the imaginary line below Im not that imaginary Applause Music UT Martin gets the offensive rebound a chance to cut it to a two possession game Jacob Cruz the hot hand all night passes off laying it up and in David K Wanga playing some big time minutes with Isa muhamad out hes played very well has a great Flash and an even better pass by Jak Jacob Cruz pivoted away from the double and dropped it on the DME NC State answers with a big time triple DJ horn delivers that was a huge shot as UT Martin continues to hang Applause around and Cruz fouled shooting three thats the second time tonight the wolf pack have committed a foul well Cruz is shot of Music three yeah you got got to get out and contest as first we see the great offense Jaden Taylor gets it outside to DJ horn knocks it down and then right here you got to contest without hitting him on the on the midsection of his torso I mean it was the it was the body to body after the Applause contest hes tough and 68 and he shoots threes not only pick and pop but on the move transition and then flying off scen I me hes he was flying to his right thats a tough shot and if youre NC State you get a hand up and contest youve done your job on the defensive Applause end Cruz just gets one of three at the Music line step back three money DJ horn backto back triples thats 4 threes on the night for the Arizona State transfer UT Martin shows some pressure and State beats it easily and he just walks into a three and says why not he has been red hot tonight but those two threes in a row have really started to separate any C State DJ horn has taken over for Kevin kes team leading scorer with 16 and the wolf pack an 11point Applause lead at AA we know the most important part of the car is the driver you Im so glad youre okay I count on the

more share more happy for the holidays a lot of My Success was predicated on the teams Applause success anytime you can have a statute build about yourself at a great University like North Carolina State University I love its something that I I could never imagin it Im totally honest what a special day last week outside Reynolds Coliseum David Thompson now immortalized forever a statue of the man that led the Wolfpack to the schools first ever National Championship in mens basketball all the way back in 1974 he is the first player in Wolfpack history to have a statue and its a welldeserving one yeah I mean he was Michael Jordans favorite player when Jordan was growing up up and really a precursor in a lot of ways the way he soared was once the Guinness record holder for vertical jump with 42 in he scored 73 in a professional game and you know really humble beginnings he grew up playing in an unpaved Court in his backyard with bicycle wheels as the hoops and of course went on to Greatness including that 74 team that knocked off UCLA and went 30 and one UCLA stretch where they had won seven national championships in a row so really accomplished so much as a player and and you know unfortunately had some drug problems in the in the professional ranks but as since completely turned his life around and were obviously you know so happy about that for him are you a David Thompson biographer in your in your free time no I mean you know you got to know the you got to know the greats and and hes hes one that maybe some of the younger players realize how great he was well the one thing that the younger players definitely will appreciate is he is credited with inventing the Ali oop yeah and it happened in practice and his coach of the time Norman SL was was like wait what is that were adding that to the Playbook so cool a little history lesson David Thompson who obviously is a legend for any NC State fan but if youre a neutral just flipping around on a Tuesday night yeah theres a reason they dont just put a statue up for no reason he is one of the great players in the history of this game and now immortalized forever outside Reynolds Coliseum for a very very good reason Im wondering you said Michael Jordans favorite player growing up was that not used in the in the recruiting pitch could Jordan have have been a wolf pack yeah well an alltime great recruiting Miss if so feel like thats not talked about a Music l Kevin Keats team with about 10 minutes remaining in this game the lead back to 11 UT Martin continues to hang around and if they want to win this game theyve got to go on a little burst offensively and you know Jordan Sears hes got to start to look for his shot a little bit more heres Sears traveling he has been really out of rhythm for his standards tonight leads the OBC in points and assists just has really yet to get going yeah he hes really a Player of the Year type candidate in the and you know hes not going to see this type of length and athleticism at the guard spot in the OBC very Music Applause often nice given go what a finish Jaden Taylor Applause Music acrobatic step back three Off the Mark NC State firing on all cylinders right now and theyre looking for more wide open three no good offensive rebound Taylor lines it up he cant hit it another chance for the wolf pack here they got three really good looks at it Noah but couldnt cash in Jaden Taylors been a bright spot for the NC State wol back great stop and go back door cut and then David Thompson asked air reverse right there around two UT Martin Music Applause Music Applause Defenders pull up three Miss fires almost three minutes without any points for UT Martin travel called on Ben middle Music Brooks I dont know about that one was a good move but hes just trying to do a little too much I think thats what coach PS is telling Applause them you see DJ Burns back into the game the defensive pressure Relentless Jaden Taylor leads a very talented backcourt for EDC State thats going to cause a lot of teams a lot of problems as theyll speed you up theyll turn you over and then theyll take it the other way 14 fast break points tonight they average 18 a game which leads the ACC the Cru continuing to get it done for UT Martin he has been the bright spot for the Skyhawks tonight yeah tough really tough fade away to the to the

gets a lot tougher Noah Tennessee awaiting on Saturday today that game on ESPN two and the ball is looking really good right now yeah no doubt I mean theyve got the fifth best defense in the country 28th best offense and dton connect is having a monster season I mean he had a beast of a game at UNC 37 points he was just killer in that game before turning his ankle really late in that contest and you know if you havent seen him play he had the probably the dunk of the year so far against Michigan State behind the back on the fast break and and theyre team that that Im looking at with Santiago Wy back beside Jordan James Jordan gy theyre another team around you know thats just old and experienced like old in a good way and thats the thing with the fifth year that a lot of these guys are getting everybody gets rather college basketball is super deep right Applause now and its a great opportunity for Kevin Kei of this Wolfpack team to get a marquee resume win if they can pull that upset against Tennessee on Saturday that would carry a lot of weight come Music March and the threes just keep falling in Raleigh DJ horn drills is 63 of the night and another guy with a ton of experience started his career at Illinois State before going to Arizona State and you know coach Kei said he he reminds him a little bit ofan Smith and hes got that combo ability to play the one and the two well hes showing off the shooting tonight another triple Parker that is three threes in a row the last one belongs to Parker Applause and NC state has blown this game wide open with 6 minutes left in Music Applause Music it at amama we provide you with something more than Auto home or life insurance its empathy you got Music you Im soad glad youre okay thank you because at amama your coverage always comes with compassion NC State rolling and raining threes from downtown DJ horn a huge part of it getting involved in the midrange pull out game pick and roll kick bottom from the wing and then on the bre nobody picked him up knocked it down hes playing with a ton of confidence and a guy whos been good in college basketball a long time he made 72 threes at Arizona State last season shooting at about 33 from downtown but that number is going to come up hes a driller and hes going to be one of their their biggest weapons moving forward for NC State hes got a season High 22 tonight and the scoring will not stop its a 152 run for the Wolfpack to really take this game Out Of Reach UT Martin continues to just kind of back off on the break and NC State continuing to play aggressively Birds the block hes had a great night double double add in three blocks three assists big man doing it all no doubt and and UT Martin has just gone ice cold on the offensive end and come a little bit stagnant let NC State apply their pressure and thats what NC States going to want to do in ACC is just ball pressure create turnovers get the flexs and then try to create additional offense in the fast Applause break UT Martin now one of their last 11 and for as cold as theyve been the wolf packs have been equally hot Burns lines up a three cant connect crowd would have erupted at PNC if he Music Applause Music did man all smiles he cant believe it because Jacob Cruz came in and 360 midair and he looking at the rim no hes had a good game and a good showing I mean he came out red hot on Sunday you dont want to miss it Notre Dame squaring off against Purdue on the womens side it tips off noon Eastern right here on AC Network that is Sunday Purdue and Notre Applause Music Dame heres MJ rice dumps it to Burns that doesnt fall already a double double tonight for burns W pack have really shown off tonight that even without a mod diara who has not played theyve got a lot of depth and a lot of talent a total roster overhaul seven new faces six transfers one freshman and theyre getting better every game playing together and no doubt theyre definitely going to need it this season in the ACC we know coach Keats has had so much success above 500 five out of six seasons in ACCC but man it is a murderous row as usual coming up for them not only Tennessee coming up but got Notre Dame Virginia and you know Duke is back and and super loaded again even though they lost down in Arkansas they they are loaded K paly Jeremy roach been in college a long time and they are Applause Music that burns now up to five blocks to go along with his 12 rebounds and 10 points eight different scores for the wolf pack tonight UT Martin we thought wed see more threepoint shooting from the Skyhawks tonight they started off hot Noah but too little too late here yeah and you got to credit NC State shooting when when youre drilling threes its hard to startop to start the fast break and you got to get stops and get defensive rebounds you UT Martin came into the the game leading the country in that category theres another one they are red high here at NC State LJ Thomas he

college basketball and Leonard Hamilton still doing his thing in Tallahassee Florida State head coach so you probably have the the best ever to do it and I would say the most underrated to ever do it Leonard Hamilton who should absolutely be in the Hall of Fame oh no no doubt take take a look at our ACC in the net Leonard Hamiltons Florida State not in the top 100 as it stands he its an early sample size Noah but youre a numbers guy so what stands out to you well I I love Clemson you know 22nd ranked offense in the country PJ Hall is back for more in the post and Joe Gerard the Syracuse transfer shooting 45 from three Chase Hunter playing well and they beat pit and then they had a a win against Alabama on the road which is huge for your net numbers and for the for the viewers at home trying to trying to do the calculus or the geometry of of net and what it means you know your quad one and your Road wins are really important so if youre rooting for a team and theyre going out and winning on the road thats incredibly valuable for their March resume and its actually incredibly rare I mean there there are such few teams that get to double figure Road WIS that you know when you can win on the road that that goes a long way for your at large resume why is the road win weighted so heavily in the net all right Ill tell you something when youre you know playing at home in the Hoops you practice on coming out of your own locker room versus 8 to 10000 people on the road it it is incredibly hard to win in college basketball the the home court advantages are so huge that it it might have account you know its depending on where you are it might be like an 8 to 10 point swing and how hard it is to win and thats why its incredibly rare to win on the road in college basketball NC State 70 seconds away from closing out a third straight win and then all eyes will be on the Tennessee Volunteers Saturday you can watch the game on ESPN 2 10 Eastern Time the volunteers will certainly be favored in that game but NC state has shown again tonight there are just not a lot of teams in college basketball in this transfer portal era that have the depth and the scoring balance at the wolf pack to and its going to be a test Tennessee the fifth best defense in the country so theyre certainly going to have to share the basketball try to get a lot of easy shots but you know NC State took care of business here tonight and even though UT Mar was hanging around n stayed able to play their game and get each other open shots so it wasnt just the shooting it was the passing that set up the open threes for the wolf pack and nowhere you were just talking about how difficult it is to win on the road well here at PNC Arena the wolf pack 50 this season 20 and2 over the last two seasons yeah they they been fantastic night theyve been fantastic
