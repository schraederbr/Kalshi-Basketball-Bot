Notre Dame and Duke underway and the Irish get the first possession of the afternoon Duke starts off in manto man cion James is taking Marcus Burton hes got great size and strength but the Dual switch just about every screen and exchange can nipple now on Burton now malawat switches onto him and a pass off the leg of flag its a kick ball put the shot clock back to 20 for Notre Dame Notre Dame and eight on the year 1 and3 in the league Duke 132 the only losses to Kentucky and Kansas a an unblemished 5 and0 in the league and theyve won six consecutive games by 20 or more points they beat SMU by 27 and Pit by 29 in their last two games number one defensive team in the country their Rim protection is outstanding Tay Davis whos head having a terrific Junior season for the Irish a little bit strong on the runner and back come the Blue Devils seon James at the point with the ball Proctor canle flag and malawat three freshman in the starting lineup as kiple finds flag he finds malat and the three freshman connect on the first bucket of the game so difficult off that short roll the screen was set by Cooper flag hit on the short roll if you go up and guard him that opens up the Baseline for that lob de malow we asked John sh head coach of the Blue Devils yesterday how has this team grown recently he said they are much more connected on offense than they were earlier in the season and we saw evidence of that on that last trip heres James full head of steam had it knocked away though by Kei now Burton the pullup from 15 left it short every everythings contested Dan Duke does just a great job of contesting shots positional length they average about 67 one through five as canle misses the three and that length is certainly part of the reason why Duke is such a great defensive team Micah shrewbury number 11 for the Irish the coachs son and a shooter a guy who can knock down threes of Plenty this is Burton Proctor with a good defense out of bounds back to Duke now take a look at Cooper flag after he sets the screen pass on the short roll that draws two Defenders he just lobs it up thats really difficult to rotate to in malow you throw it up as high as you want hell go get it 7 to5 wingspan 98 standing reach canle back to flag whos been shooting the three better of late Proctors been shooting it well all season long and its 5 nothing D well the last two games Tyrese Proctor seven of 11 from three and anytime he gets a catch and shoot opportunity he shoots an even higher percentage you have to make him put it on the floor but Dukes ball movement is excellent 43 from three on the season Burton a tough contested turnaround wont go and its down to Duke a lot of white shirts going after those rebounds all Five Guys stand to rebound before they leave and Burton listed at 6 foot might be closer to 510 dealing with a lot of size flag for three and what a start for the Blue Devils and really Dan its been spearheaded defensively Notre Dame has found it difficult to run any clean offense even that split action that they run Duke is switching it and Notre Dam finding it hard to get an opening Duke 31 and8 all time against the Irish and up one 11 to the last 13 pass at the feet of Davis three on the shot clock trying to back down Proctor got around him but cant hit it Blue Devils in transition pass James for three and what a start for Duke as Micah Shrewsberry needs a timeout great defense at one end and crisp clean unselfish offense at the other end the Blue Devils have knocked down three threes already and have an early 11 to nothing lead Music of college basketball is brought to you by USAA proudly serving the military community and their families well Cooper flag has been a great all season long for the Blue Devils but Jay I think without question that this was his wow moment the dunk against pit this week it its really amazing he gets all the way down Court after that steal in three dribbles and obviously punched it at the end and Drew the foul the thing that Dan impressed me most about it though as impressive as this whole sequence was he had just picked up his third foul and instead of backing off defensively he gets around in front in the post makes the steal and then completes that play a lot of players and I dont care whether theyre freshman junior senior whatever they pick up their third foul at that point in the game they got of back off a little bit theres no back off in him y Duke finished the pit game on Tuesday night on an 180 run and they have started today on an 11 to nothing run so as Jay pointed out during the break theyre on a 29 to nothing run between the two games right now that was excellent math on yes it was uh awfully impressive they held pit scoreless over the last 759 and theyve held the Irish score less for more than four minutes and now Shrewsberry is out of bounds and its another Notre Dame turnover right now Notre Dame cannot run any clean offense they are more concerned about the the way theyre being guarded and the pressure theyre facing than attacking Duke and you got to give all the credit to Dukes defense pressure on the ball theyre in gaps theyre showing bodies so Notre Dame seeing bodies instead of open court a good look in the corner for flag and the fourth made three of the game already for the Blue Devils often times in basketball we talk about flow and Duke is obviously in a great flow but they establish that flow not through offense but through defense remarkable Burton being swarmed and Proctor is called for the foul Proctor saying to the official he got hooked by Burton take a look at the other the other end in the second three of the game by flag Tyrese Proctor getting a piece of the paint drawing two Defenders and then kicking it out Duke right now is hunting great they are not settling for the good shot theyre hunting for the great one and and you use the word unselfish theyre making the right play in the right pass and a little touch foul on the elbow of Burton by kiple to send a burton to the line and there are some of the Numbers number one in the nation in adjusted defensive efficiency for Ken pom and John Shire and the Duke staff had a feeling coming into the Year this could be a very good defensive team it has been that and then so yeah its blown by good to to get to Great and they they obviously have outstanding Personnel having Rim protection though is is a a big factor with Kanan malawat in the game Cooper flag blocks more shots than he does but his presence automatically means that the opponents field goal percentage is going to be lower when hes on the floor but flag protects the rim seon James actually does a really good job of Walling up and and vertical contesting boy another great look flag will miss this one look at the offensive rebound by canle Proctor misses a three and Notre Dame down with a Tay Davis and proor with a great play to anticipate that he picked it off but then he landed out of bounds often times in a game like this Dan you just want to survive the first few minutes and Notre Dame has not only been knocked back theyre a little bit Shell Shocked right now and again coming off consecutive onepoint losses at home to the Tar Heels on the road against the Wolfpack theyve been down here for a few days after the Wednesday night game against NC Applause State Shrewsberry hits the three and thats what Micah Shrewsberry can do that is his 46th three of the Season he can make him in bunches yeah thats the one thing you cannot allow Braden Shrewsberry to do and thats catch and shoot hes a player you cannot close out to youve got to be close enough to him where a close out is not necessary the coachs son averaging almost 16 a game the laying at The Rim bu Kamal thats just really smart you know throw it up there and let him go get it especially when he has a mismatch Burton will try a three and hell hit it and here come the Irish getting back into it now down by eight last two possessions Notre Dame has played through Tay Davis first with the the back down and he drew two Defenders then he was able to kick it to Shrewsberry last time ball in his hands kicks it to Marcus Burton Burton the native of Mich Indiana just a few miles from Notre Dames campus the Rookie of the Year in the ACC a season ago got a switch aako on malawat flag up top and off the fingertips of malow watch in the back comes Notre didnt execute it but the right idea and the right play to make how good of a matchup is this Davis and flag and flag got some help from canle another Notre Dame turnover Applause boy patient and unselfish what a pass this is terrific offense by the Blue Devils and flag has his third three of the game thought he was going to lob it up to malow watch that Drew the defender from the corner and then a terrific skip pass across Court to get it to Cooper flag that was beautifully done by Canon James Jay Duke has seven assists on seven to eight field goals in this game yeah when are they going to start passing it better Burton canle switch in on to him six to shoot Burton slips somehow gets it to Shrewsberry aos got to get a shot off and hits it a big three for matako the transfer from Princeton last five games matako is 13 of 20 from threepoint range 65 flag misses a three loo stepped into a much bigger role but Demarcus Burton was Alber missed about seven weeks with a knee injury this is his third game back Burton will try a three and flag down with a rebound knocked away and a foul called on Kev malalako transferred in from Notre D excuse me from Princeton but look at this play you thought he was going to lob it up and that Drew kevi off the corner and just a terrific read of the play by seon James whos an outstanding passer has really done a great job since hes come in as the starting point guard but both offensively but especially defensively with his strength and athleticism and John shy has gone to his bench now Caleb Foster whom James replaced as the starting point guard he is in Mason Gillis is in and Malik Brown also Isaiah Evans so four Subs coming in here for John Shire some veteran players and also the Freshman sharpshooter in Evans ji has gone to the bench for Notre Dame couple of Subs coming in for Michel shrewbury Garrett sundra is in the game and Sir mohamd number four for noted Dame is in as well Brown comes up with the offensive rebound brown one of the best defenders in the country James finds Foster on the wing five to Applause shoot Gillis drives lays it in with the left hand shrewbury with a nice shot fake but Evans Applause recovers mohamd strong into the paint and draws the foul The Freshman from Charlotte willll be at the line with a we come back but the other NJ Duke continues to run absolutely outstanding offense well even when they had a breakdown at the end of the shot clock the transfer for Purdue Mason Gillis just beats the shot clock for the Music layup keep an eye on Malik Brown six in white and Mason Gillis his own teammate Falls onto the right leg of brown after laying it in you can see brown reaching for his knee at a moments ago walking under his own power J but he did leave the court and head back towards the Duke locker room so they are without brown a a great defensive player very unselfish player uh one of the leaders of their second unit also seon James has two fouls for Duke so he is on the bench Browns a big loss hes got 86 deflections on the season hes seventh on the Duke roster in minutes played and he gets over six deflections a game by comparison an outstanding Defender Cooper flag has 44 deflections ninepoint lead for Duke it took the Irish more than four minutes to score in this game this is Patrick gangba into the game because Brown has gone to the locker room and Amala watch is on the bench and the Freshman from Manasses Virginia lays it in Gs got great size and length and a really good feel for the game a really good skill level you know one of the things that maybe doesnt get talked about enough about why this D team is so good is they have terrific death you bring guys like Gillis and Foster and brown and gangba and Evans Off the Bench I mean that is a terrific second five for John shine its a great mix on this roster of young talent and then older experienced players to lead that Talent gunga showing Poise in the post and Cooper flag giving some support to his fellow freshman whos working his way back into the lineup after injury Foster into gumba defended by sundra the kick back out Foster a clean look and Gillis is fouled underneath by Applause mohamd Gillis coming from Purdue of course played in the national championship game a year ago really struggled to shoot the ball at the beginning of the year it is getting better and he brings more to this team than just shooting but theyre theyre loving the fact that the balls going in the basket a little a little bit more often for him yeah hes still shooting just under 30 from three on the season but he shot 46 from three last year at Purdue playing with Zack Edy mostly catch and shoot but hes a career 40 shooter speaking of catch and shoot KH kiple The Freshman from Milwaukee and its a 14point lead hes been on a heater of late as well last four games 13 of 30 from three Burton behind the back helped by Gillis there defensively along with Foster and he banked in three by Mohamad The Freshman from Charlotte his dad Nazi Muhammad played at Kentucky in a long long NBA career and the Irish are hanging around as they have started making some shots yeah sir Muhammad went to Myers Park High School in Charlotte and his father Nazi hes coaching right now but he hits more golf balls on the Range than VJ sing sounds like you might be witnessing that you might be beside him every now and again no its all word of mouth I never do that Ive actually played with nazy when when Im the second biggest guy walking down the Fairway a little intimidating for the other golfers can nibble at the line for the Blue Devils averaging almost 13 points per game and a great threepoint shooter now 28 for 30 on the season from the line leads this team in fre free throw percentage shooting over 90 but second in scoring second in threes made and talk about a guy with a great feel for the game little back and forth between he and John shy can nipple from Wisconsin a huge Packers Fan shy from Illinois a huge Bears fan the two teams split they have pledged that each will wear the other teams Jersey on the same day in the near future not if the near future mean next 50 years Applause yeah Davis can hit the three Gillis down with the rebound and even though Davis is making more threes hes shooting 25 thats not his strength thats a shot that Dukes willing to give up to him Foster in and out and the smallest guy on the floor Marcus Burton down with a rebound for the Irish Notre Dame fortunate there they went under on that screen and gave Caleb Foster a wide open shot he just missed it Duke switching every exchange out front Burton with a burst of speed what a pass the extra look to mohamd who hits the three nice offense from the Irish motre Dame getting some penetration and Duke has to rotate excellent ball movement off the penetration thats why you want to get a piece of the paint the defense reacts and then you can play out of it and a foul away from the ball it is going against juliia Roper of day theres Marcus Burton getting into the paint kicking it out and then the Swing Swing the second pass is what gets the wide open shot and three subs for the Blue Devils including Cooper flag returning to the game Duke LED this game 14 to nothing since then it is 1814 Notre Dame they are down by 10 youre looking at a Micah shrewbury there the head coach of the Irish in his second year in South Ben and has had a really interesting coaching Journey was at Butler under Brad Stevens was at Purdue under Matt Painter as kiple knocks down another three hes got eight and shrewbury also was an assistant coach for six years with the Boston Celtics under Brad Stevens and Brads son Brady is a walk on at Notre Dame playing for Michael shrewbury so it all kind of ties together but a lot of excitement around the program Mike Bray had a tremendous run in South Ben and a Micah sh Bs got a lot of returning players has a nice class coming in next year trying to get this Notre Dame program back up near the top of the ACC theyve got their work cut out for them though here this Music afternoon championship game look at all the excitement there amongst the basketball players and a Duke Notre Dame connection of course on the football side Riley Leonard a Duke quarterback for 3 years now with the Irish helping to lead them into the national title game against Ohio State coming up on the Music 2 Malik Brown is back on the bench we will try to get more word on his situation as time allows canle the floater and malawat fouled at the Rim by chai Boy butala watch goes up and tries to to flush it good luck trying to stop it well we do have an update now lets go to Jess for the latest on Malik Brown so Dan just got the official injury update on Malik Brown he will be out for the rest of the game unfortunately with a right knee injury no specifics just yet but hoping for the best Jess thank you hoping it is nothing serious again he walked off the court and back on to the court back towards the bench under his own power power so that is encouraging this is a look there as again Gillis when he fell to the floor banged into his teammates knee and dont want to speculate more than that all we know is it is a knee injury and out for the Applause Music game when Kanan malawat sets a ball screen especially on an open side he rolls to the basket you can just throw it up as high as you want to and he can go get it what a weapon projected as a lottery pick all three freshman in the starting line of fuk projected as lottery picks the hand off to Burton guarded by kiple The Help by malawat then Good Help by Tyrese proor helping out malawat Jr kesn off the back of the iron and flag the rebound for Duke well Duke is doing a really good job on the defensive glass all five guys are staying to rebound before they go down Court the nipples short on The Three Irish Ball Benn a hold over from the Mike Bray ERA this is his fourth year did red shirt a couple of years ago so he is a fourth year junor chai nice move by malawat and fouled really good Patience by Tay Davis whos averaging Im sure yes hes averaging close to 17 points a game and his last five hes averaging 20 points and seven rebounds shooting 55 from the field but just lets a little handoff go by by and just one step got Beyond malow and there was nobody underneath the basket to come over they stayed with the cutter a little bit too long and cannot hit the first Jai coming off his first career double double 10 points 11 rebounds Wednesday night in Raleigh against the wolf pack the Irish again they stuck around for a couple of days being down in North Carolina Wednesday and Saturday they practiced at NC Central once practiced at NC State once came in here Thursday night and again yesterday one of the things ji does really well is his defensive communication Micah Shrewsberry was raving about that yesterday saying not a lot of big guys talk on the back side of the defense as well as Kevin Jai does jai out and Garrett sundra The Freshman from Ashburn to Virginia number 12 back into the game for Notre Applause Dame Duke 10 assists on 11 to made field goals round and out what a rebound by malow watch but he couldnt lay it back in just just ran a little stagger underneath and Proctor wide open after that malow watch screen and a rare transition opportunity for the Irish with the Blue Devils get back Burton a deep one comes up empty this has been a struggle on the defensive end and you can see a little bit of frustration on the face of Marcus Burman he has not been able to breathe out there with the length and athleticism thats been right in his grill from the opening tap again his third game back after missing seven games with a knee injury and he means so much to not today flag and we we have an injured Notre Dame player I believe Tate Davis is down but maybe is okay maybe just was reaching down to adjust his shoe as he wound up on the seat of his pants after trying to defend flag and now reaching down for that right ankle a little bit and yet flag stepped on his Music foot thats something you dont see that often oddl looking play Applause and now flat flag at the line for the Blue Devils and you talked about it on game day before the game leading the team in scoring rebounding assists blocks and steals that is a remarkable accomplishment for any player at any level to be as versatile as he is to lead a great team in all five of those categories so with that being the case I think were allowed to say that hes a complete player I think he is if he were a baseball player they would describe him as a 5 to0 player he he does everything is he you had seen him before but given the hype of the accolades before he even got to do has he been what you expected him to be hes been better frankly yeah hes been better the maturity level and I think the level of competitiveness that he has it honestly reminds me of the kind of competitor that Christian lner was when he was here at Duke B the kick kesn the three and right as the shot clock was expiring the Irish come up with a big bucket everybody collapsed on Marcus Burton as he was getting into the lane that opened up that shot but still you had to get it off quickly because of the recovery flag the screen to try to free Foster we got Shrewsberry Switched Off onto flag and now Shrewsberry switched on to Proctor the turnaround and down with the rebound Burton might have been better to go to flag there he had Burton ultimately switched off on him in the post no matter who Burton looks at whoevers covering him is at least 65 tough shot and itll go to make it a 10point game and John shy wants a timeout not Dame continuing to fight but still just under 5 minutes to go in the first half 24 points for Notre Dame but Marcus Burton great cross over draws two Defenders and then kicks it out and then the next Drive goes in little side step and gets the midrange jumper to go Music Applause Music Applause well Monday night its going to be the NFC match up between the Vikings and the Rams as you probably know because of the terrible wildfires in La this game has been moved to Glendale Arizona for tickets go to nflcom our Mega cast coverage begins at 8 Eastern on ABC ESPN ESPN plus and ESPN Deportes as it is tipped in by malawat and I know I speak for you and everybody on our crew extending our our thoughts to everybody dealing uh with those the terrible fires in the greater LA area everybodys got family friends or both out there and just hoping that they can get this more and more under control with each passing day agreed thats my thats my hometown I grew up in Los Angeles County in Rolling Hills and so many friends in the Pacific Palisades area uh its heartbreaking and really unimaginable whats happening and one way you can help people affected by the wildfires is to donate at redcrossorg ESPN thatll help the Red Cross respond and help people recover anything that anybody can do uh is greatly appreciated Theo inbounds to Burton flag defending him and Burton little too too quick with the feet called for steps flag able to give a little bit of space but kept his hand up and ultimately caused the turnover with Marcus Burton trying to do maybe a little bit too much to get past him Burton to the bench and as you said you can see the frustration on his face at times this day has not gone the way he has wanted it to go thus Applause far flag over Davis for the all set up just to get him a little isolation on the right side hes really got everything hes got midrange game he can really get to the basket and finish and I think hes going to really improve to be an even better threepoint shooter than he is right now and hes got 13 points and five assists already in this game theres still three and a half to go in the first half James lob malawat again they are really looking for come on malawat that is an unbelievable weapon and if you start trying to really take that away thats going to open up open threes for Duke biggest lead of the afternoon now for the Blue Devils at 16 this is a great defensive team that is really improving on the offensive end their assists are way up Braden Shrewsberry with his second three of the game Bren Shrewsberry had an outstanding freshman year but hes improved his game hes putting the ball in the deck more penetrating more really added to his bag the big three of Burton Davis and Shrewsberry they average about 50 points per game between them one of the issues for the Irish is who will step forward Beyond those three and alaka who just took a charges having a very nice year but and now a technical foul has been called on John shy he was way out on the court arguing that charge and got teed up by Jerry heer now he wanted that one theres no question John Shire ran out on the court waving his arms he wanted it so Music Applause Music 2 a Music Applause Music a good question I I mean Derrik Lively II protected the rim every bit as well if not better than come on malow its a a great shot blocker playing with the Dallas Mavericks now uh but and and he was a similar lob threat but hes built differently than malat uh unique player and hes been incredibly impactful around the rim just with his presence not necessarily blocking as he doesnt block as many shots as Dereck livley the second did but hes got a tremendous presence in the game and the lob threat hes been in this one uh its been remarkable boy how about Micah Shrewsberry who is a 91 free throw shooter 20 for 22 on the season coming into the game missed both on on the technical charge to John shy Notre Dame has one twopoint Basket in this game but theyre seven of 11 from three thats keeping them at least within distance of Duke Shrewsbury puts it on the deck the kick to kesn gets a piece of the paint trying to get a shot off over Gillis he will but he cant hit ity Dukes paint protection has been excellent and as the ball moves theyre starting to get out to threepoint Shooters a little bit better gangba back into the game for Duke malawat on the bench and again if you werent with us Malik Brown will not return today after suffering a knee injury flag is fouled and he will go to the line lets go back to the technical on John Shire and the play that got him so upset as Cooper flag was called for a charge yeah the defender matako was in legal guarding position and he was a primary Defender it wasnt like a secondary Defender coming over and flag just lowered his shoulder I tend to agree with the call obviously John didnt and flag with his 14th point of the game in his last three games Cooper flag has shot 62 from the field and has averaged better than 22 points per game Duke has really run it up on acc competition here in the early part of the conference schedule and I think thats one of the questions the league is not not good this year are there teams that can really give them a challenge if if youre John Shire you want to get punched in the mouth a little bit you want your team to have to deal with some adversity are there teams in the ACC that can do that against Duke this year I think theyll get challenges you know theyll get a challenge from North Carolina they get a challenge from Clemson uh they got a a pretty decent challenge at Louisville uh after their game against Auburn but theyre not going to face the same kind of resistance as they would see in the ACC or in a normal year that you would have in the Atlantic Coast Conference this is not a normal ACC its just not flag call for the travel Duke appears to be on a tier all by itself you can see Clemson Louisville pit wake and Carolina each with one loss right now Ken palom has Clemson Louisville pit in Carolina all in the high 20s to high 30s Joe lonardi has those same four schools in hes got the ACC with five bids right now of course its incredibly early but you dont get that many real opportunities in the League this year and thats why a game thats going on right now on ESPN 2 Louisville pit thats a big game for both of those teams you want to uh you want to get a w you dont get that many chances in this league this year Louisville leading Pit by three late in the first half on ESPN two right now for teams that may be around the bubble in the Atlantic Coast Conference it means youre going to have to knock off or at least play really well against a team like Duke and the the top teams in the league that give you quad ones and you cant lose to the teams at in the middle of the bottom right I mean it really instead of being a league where you have to win games there are certain certain teams you just cant lose you better not slip up yeah because the the league is dragging in its nonconference schedule and and the lack of success if you will that the ACC overall had in the nonconference and that is not that is not helpful and maybe I think there needs to be some adjustment uh in the way the the rankings are done like the net ranking because last year there are certain teams P Pittsburgh was one of them that I thought really improved throughout the course of ACC play but Im not sure the numbers gave him the credit for it but thats the way it goes thats the way it is and the SEC is going to benefit from it the ACC is not its one of the reasons why John Shire is very happy theyve actually got a nonconference game in February at Madison Square Garden against Illinois and hes very happy to have that caliber of a game I mean you always like playing good competition but he wants to play a big time opponent on a neutral floor later on in the season because that can kind of simulate what theyre going to have to deal with in the NCA tourament yeah and Illinois will provide that but it also gives him another quad one game they just dont have as many of them as normal Davis gets his own Miss kicks it out good pass kesn hits the three and the threepoint shooting continues to keep the Irish in this game theyre back within 10 Again Notre game has shot it extraordinarily well from the threepoint line without a lot of time to get those shots off I dont know that weve ever seen a half where a team had eight threes and only two twos yeah thats thats true it is not often shot clock turned off and with the way this game started you really have the feeling that Duke should be up by even more so give Notre Dame credit for knocking those shots down and staying within Striking Distance a block and some time shrew bit it braad and strowberry knocks it down it has been scored as a three I believe they will take a look to confirm that but either way what a way to finish the half for the Irish boy a great block and then some fight in the Fighting Irish to keep this under 10 points they go down seven into halftime Shrewsberry with a big shot after the block Notre Dames got it down to single digits lets go back to the studio now with Kevin Jay and Seth and the Jeep halime reports good ball pressure out near Mid quar by Shrewsberry can nipple handling for the Blue Devils almost like a Zone look underneath and flag with his sixth assist of the game as he finds malawan Micah Shrewsberry trying to switch some things up to show a different defensive look pesni and alako were basically playing almost a twoman Zone in the paint Mala watch is five of six from the floor you can see why all the looks have it right around the rim Burton shot off on the Baseline by Proctor somehow got the shot off and a battle for the rebound it is going to be a held ball and the possession arrow is going to give it to Notre Dame Cooper flag an excellent passer drawing a second Defender just dropping it off to Kanan malow who knows exactly what to do with it but anytime you help up malow is there either for the lob or the drop off Shrewsberry with the quick Catch and Release from the corner and a foul as well well you talk about a quick trigger that was catch and release and kiple trying to close out just a step and made contact with Shrewsberry he got caught looking at where the ball might be as he negotiated that screen and went right in you have to let the shooter land and piples did not do that and missed another free throw hes missed more free throws today than he had missed all season coming into this game otherwise Notre Dame would be right in this game but he is still having a terrific afternoon hes averaging better than four made threes per game in ACC play another Dame committing a foul there where they really didnt need to because Cooper flag was trying to split Defenders and hes headed toward the Baseline toward the corner more than toward the basket he cant foul there flag driving on Davis and scores over him he just has everything handles the ball like a guard and operate like a big guy with his back to the basket versatility personified certainly one of the guys in the running for National player with the ear and ey broom of Auburn another guy having a sensational season the layup will go for Davis just his second field goal of the afternoon for a guy averaging better than 16 points per game quick move and took advantage of malow watch playing a little more straight up and down rather than playing low Davis one year at Sean Hall his second year now in South Ben has taken a big big step forward this year he is 10th in the league in scoring as canle is fouled by Matt Music alako well first Davis was able to receive this pass but he was playing low and usually the low man wins in basketball got his shoulders past malow watch and quickly up on the rim and Cooper flag Notre Dame didnt overh help there oneonone in the post and a great pivot back to that right hand Applause AO just picked up a foul got to you got to think that the opportunities here for kiple to set a little screen for malow watch and then pop out for an open shot you got to respect malow but he could also turn and go up against Cooper get Cooper flag there it is and the lob from malawat and he is fouled at The Rim so difficult to deal with when he sets that screen for malow you have to deal with it and if you do that means that kiple is going to be able to pop out for an open three little back screen and just not a very good job by matako hes got to put his body in front of malow hatch there thats really got to be a switch Notre Dame has picked up four fouls already in less than two minutes this half three of them in the last 4 seconds of game time two on Alo and one on kesn Duke has run that same sort of out of bounds under alignment for a lot of years now and it gives them a lot of different options as to what canle could have done he can get a screen but he can also set screens for multiple players there what do you think Michael Shrewsberry has changed up his starting five here in the second half canns on the floor so Davis is the biggest guy out there Kevin Jai is not in the game right now so whoevers guarding malow watch is giving up a ton of sides yeah but they were giv up size anyway but what they really have to do is spread the floor where they can get more threes life tough on Malo to the other end Burton with the penetration the kick shrewbury does not put it up he probably should have Davis alako Burton and they dont get a shot off they turn it over yeah Shrewsberry should not have passed up that shot its just too difficult to get an open one against this Duke defense you have to take the first good open shot you get and even though that might have been contested late it was certainly better than a shot clock violation flag backing down Alo draws a foul on Shrewsberry and will head to the line just taking advantage of matchup difficulties that Notre Dame has with Alo trying to guard Cooper flag in the middle of the floor hes got to guard him one onone and flag realized it showed a little bit of poise then if youre going to bring a second Defender he can deal with it but if youre going to foul him down that low hes probably going to complete that play more often than not lag now a perfect five for five from the line today a twotime ACC player of the week a fivetime ACC rookie of the week Music you the threepoint shooting is improving over the course of of the Season John sh told us yesterday another thing he likes his flag is becoming more decisive with the ball making quicker more assertive decisions with him yeah hes not playing with the ball as much as he did early on the season which that happens with a lot of freshman Good Help by malat Burton trying to shake Proctor got by him and draws the foul tyres Proctor picked up the foul there but Proctor has had a great year for Duke hes shooting 43 from three he leads the team in threepoint field goals made such a terrific catch and shoot player but he hes been a huge factor in White Duke has been so good this year denn hit a couple of Threes in the first half for the Irish now Burton will try one and hit it and again Notre Dames got it down to eight looks like he feels a little bit more comfortable in this second half attacking seon James had his hands down and it was taken advantage of by Marcus Burton the threepoint shooting for the Irish continues to keep them in this game just on the catch and the recovery hands are down playing the drive and he just Rises up and shoots over Jay Notre Dame now 10 for 14 from three Davis left hand up and over malat and this is the closest that Notre Dame has been Duke got out to a 14 to nothing lead and Notre Dame has it down to six Tay Davis is averaging 18 points a game in ACC play you want you dont want to let him drive right but that time he drove left and completed the play and now a good battle between flag and Davis good defense by Davis it is loose and it appears to belong to the Irish it will be a held ball and it will stay at this end of the floor with Duke Tay Davis is so athletic and hes not a guy thats going to knock down jumpers on you but malow forcing him to drive to his left he not only drove to his left but finished with his left hand that that was a terrific play by Tay Davis and now Davis is heading over to the bench he may have a a cut or something on his left hand and theyre going to have a quick look at that as both teams will go to their respective benches for a moment you know Micha shrewbury told us yesterday six of his players who are playing here today played in this building last year Notre Dame brought back four starters and 85 of its scoring from a year ago so almost every key player hes got in this game today has played in this building and he said we dont want them walking in here and saying wow this is a great place its a basketball Museum he said were here to win a game today and thats why they practiced here a number of times they stayed here in this area after playing at NC State and so they practiced multiple times in this building or at least shot around had shoot arounds multiple times proor in the flag got a mismatch with Burton and Burton fouls him team foul number six on Notre Dame already in the second half Duke just taking advantage of every mismatch they get on a switch went right to Cooper flag as soon as Burton switched off on him and if Burton hadnt been called for that foul and it went a little bit further that chicken wing came out that could those kind of things can wind up as offensive fouls now canle trying to back down too when he lays it in nuk just playing Bully ball right now when they get a matchup they like theyre bigger at every spot on the floor theyre going to see a lot of that when they play Illinois Illinois loves that bully ball back down Davis rejected by Applause malawat flag for three his fourth of the game and the lead is up to 11 well you add consistent threepoint shooting Cooper flag came into this game having hit 16 threes on the year at 31 he doesnt look like a 31 threepoint shooter in this game Burton nearly had it knocked away Al loo has to kick it back out five to shoot Burton is bumped and fouled Applause well come on malow watch is such a presence on both ends of the floor but especially on the defensive end moves his feet and able to recover and block the shot by Tay Davis with the right hand the other end of the floor malch sets the screen kesn late getting up to it and Cooper flag a threepoint shooter now Music lot of really good games this season and this is among the better games that hes put out he has got 22 points in this ball game six of nine from the field hes knocked down four of his six threepoint attempts this is his eighth 20point game on the season hes also got six assists in this game and coming into this game over his last five he was averaging over 20 points per game two steals seven rebounds shooting over 50 from the field talk about a young player that is hitting a stride this has been a consistent high level and high productivity season for a young man that came in as the number one overall recruit last year and is expected to be the number one pick in the 2025 NBA draft he is everything he was advertised to be and more 5 minutes into the second half Duke by 11 Burton no and flag his fourth rebound of the afternoon cion James with a ball for Duke hes been hampered by some foul trouble today so it has not been uh the influence that he normally is on the game thatll stay with the Blue Devils as James helps canle back up yeah Duke looking to post canle against Braden Shrewsberry and a really nice job by Marcus Burton to come down and dig down in the post you can really tell Dukes looking to take advantage of matchups right now kiple drives and Burton reached in knocked it away and its Notre Dame ball good hands by Notre Dame looked like they were going to give up a layup but recovered to knock that ball away one thing you have to be impressed with Notre Dame is they fight man theres no give up in this team and coming off two brutal losses the game against North Carolina when it looked like they had the game one then fouled a threepoint shooter Elliot CAU gave him a fourpoint play yeah and then lost by one in Raleigh on Wednesday night Michael shrewbury telling us yesterday at a practice as painful as those losses have been he hopes they spur his team on that they show them hey youre in these games theyve just got to do little things better here and there to turn the Ls into Ws right down the lane for the slam hes got 24 and those were the two loudest of the Applause day Shrewsberry has to kick it out to Alo Duke doing a better job on this possession and their Gap coverage oh good play by mohamd to steal it Burtons open and hits the three gives sir Mohamed a lot of credit for that very alert after the defensive rebound thats really the only open shot is off that broken play action Burton switches on to flag flag gets into the paint and makes it look easy he has now tied his season high with 26 points he just bullied Marcus Burton into the paint and then pivoted back knowing that could shoot over Burton spinning on Proctor and picks up the foul Notre Dame was put in rotation just a great pass from cion James as Cooper flag went right down the pipe took off from outside the restricted Arc he dunks with power when did The Scream the post dunk scream come into the game you didnt do it no well I didnt dunk you didnt see Samson and dhy do it no they just laughed they just laughed after they Dunked On Me 12point lead flags got the the post dunk screened out of a science as well he getting more and more practice at it Alo nice look Mohamad and itll drop in to make it a 10point game really smart by Sir Mohammad anytime theres a Baseline Drive you want to get toward the front of the rim and that way you can take advantage make yourself available as a against the help theres the switch and flag fouled and then Burton swats the ball away after the whistle malawat says something to Burton and we got a couple of technical fouls I think malawat and Burton are each going to get a technical and remember Burton also has been called for a personal on the play Applause its also going to put Notre Dame over the limit no technical there it was after the players started talking to one another right there that a malawat and a burton were teed up I dont know why you tee up both of them I malawat came over to Burton but I dont know what was said a lot of times you know thats kind of like the double foul thing I was never a fan of the call of a double foul on possession Im not a fan of the double technical but you know talking with officials theyll say that can be a really useful tool for them you you call the double technical here and kind of puts an end to all this yeah Im kind of with you I mean malow watch definitely deserve one but maybe just speaking back to malow watch got Burton the foul so Burton gets two right a te a personal and a technical on the same play hes got three we believe right now but he has gone to the bench doesnt it seem to to you like somebody comes over and bumps you but you dont have the right to respond to that you didnt do anything on the saying yeah no Im with you on that one but I dont know what he said maybe it was yeah Tech wor worthy and a little push there on Applause Gillis and that is the seventh team foul on the Blue Devils here this half so both teams are in the bonus with better than 12 minutes to go sometimes its hard for players to remember but after the officials call technical fouls often times youll get a tighter whistle right after that so you have to adjust a little bit you see Davis Kind of loses his balance here I mean thats not a foul but the officials are hyper sensitive right now after what just happened so there will be a lot of free throws the rest of the way here in this one as Davis knocks them both down hell go to the bench ji returns so no Davis no Burton in the game right now for Notre Dame Shrewsberry is out there and given the foul situation you have to expect Duke is going to continue to attack mismatches once they get a switch Caleb Foster into the game for Duke James swings at crosscourt good look for foster left it short and Alo in transition for the that was a great screen by malat on the skip pass Notre Dame really trying to spread the floor and a lot of long possessions for the Irish taking it right down near the end of the shot clock a good switch back malaan was on alo alo nowhere to go Good Help by James Shrewsberry with a runner wont go and down with a rebound is flat crossover up over J to lay it in and hes got 28 points now in this game make it 30 now for Cooper flag as he continues to add to his huge totals here today some seemed like they should count for more than two points Cooper flag theres nothing that he cannot do do on a basketball floor and he is really showing it in this game Music Applause Music Applause go Applause Applause go Applause Applause at the next level have taken notice some of them of course have played a against Cooper flag he was part of the USA select team that played against the Olympic team before Paris he impressed uh to a tremendous extent there and he is impressing today he has a season high 30 points you can see he is putting up numbers that have rarely been put up by Duke freshman think really difficult for Notre D without Marcus Burton on the floor malow down with a rebound and by the way it has now been been updated the uh the official stats monitor had bur with three but it is four the personal and the technical the technical counts as a personal and we were wondering for a while but those were fouls three and four on Marcus Burton so Michael shrewsburys got to sit his star guard on the bench for a while Applause Music third in the nation you talk about outstanding backourt players with lipy and Gilbert and then Jones Off the Bench and hey were going to AES on Wednesday night were going to have Kansas and Iowa State Wednesday night on ESPN 2 do we have a heated garage didnt you write a book called toughness yeah but it didnt apply to me there was no chapter on cold maybe in the in the second edition the paperback edition you could add a a a chapter on cold yeah maybe if I grow up in Canada Ill bring an extra to I got plenty Marcus Burton back into the game better than 10 minutes to go playing with four fouls yeah they couldnt wait hes just going to have to show maturity on the defensive end not pick up a cheap Applause Music Applause one malawat on Burton after the switch Burtons going to drive him malawat commits the foul now Burton going to the line Marcus Burton couldnt even get a step back against malow decided to drive it and just able to get into his body enough got past him and got that contact good deceleration instead of accelerating to get to the rim faster he decelerated and got the contact malow watch the fourth different Blue double to pick up his third foul today decelerate its all about physics I find decelerating much easier than accelerating at this at this age Im definitely an object at rest one of two for Burton and as well as Notre Dame has shot the three today and they have 11 for 16 they have left some points on the line 7 for 13 Music overall flag having an enormous afternoon malat having a pretty good day himself a really good pass by Cooper flag Notre game was fronting come on malawat he just got an angle and Cooper flag just threw it right up to the basket for Applause him yuk is switching one through five that puts malow on a lot of guards but hes able to handle it Shrewsbury couldnt handle the pass mohamd is open on the wing but it missed the three and Gillis run runs it down for the Blue Devils flag with 31 points six rebounds and seven assists and a Notre Dame foul last pass that Cooper flag made just recognized that Burton was fronting malow just threw it right up and the help a little bit late getting there good job by malow to Coral that ball and not bring it down too far Music P nipple averaging almost 15 points per game in ACC play thats 12 now on the afternoon form today and another guy with a complete skill set really good driving the ball and drives close outs very well but he can really shoot the ball and now malat will go to the bench remember Malik is out for the rest of the game with a knee injury and John Shire has kind of downsized right now there there are no true fives in the game for either team at the moment flag and Davis the two biggest guys on the floor and a Duke foul Caleb Music Foster and again both teams have been over the limit for a while still one and one here on this trip for the Music Applause Irish a great womens basketball Sunday afternoon double header coming your way on ESPN in the app tahena powpow and the and number two South Carolina hosting number five Texas Texas 161 the only loss to Notre Dame then number 21 NC State at Maples Pavilion to take on Stanford should be another great afternoon of Hoops how about some of these streaks just a great coach Don Staley she was a great player at Virginia and obviously in the WNBA for years and with USA Basketball yep flag off the glass and good anything he wants right now Mom and Dad looking on proudly here Cameron Gillis is a little slow to get up and getting helped back to his feet by teammates on whatever it is trying to walk it off it is so difficult these mismatches Roper having to switch off onto Cooper flag just got his body right into his landing area the flag just so big and so skilled able to get to his spot and shoot over its been kind of an NBA second half for Duke just going at the mismatch that they like on a particular possession flag now 10 for 11 from the line 34 points in counting and Duke has stretched it out to a 17point lead Notre Dame had one point earlier this half had gotten it all the way down to six Davis Dr driving on Proctor shot altered at The Rim out of bounds Notre Dame ball really good help by Cooper flag but Dukes doing a good job theyre not able to take away the drive completely but what theyve been doing is angling the drive out so theyre not giving up a straight line drive or a blowby theyre just angling it enough that help can get there a locko to inbound for the Irish Notre Dame one and three in the league Duke 50 and a winners of nine in a row overall shrewbury nice look in the lay in for Muhammad boy what a beautiful cut by Sir Music Muhammad thats a great name it is its fantastic like I I met him for the first time this morning Notre Dame in a little two three zone now given a little switch but you know 61y old man walking up to an 18yearold kid saying hello sir its fantastic call me sir flag knocks down the 12footer from the Baseline hes got 36 F that is a new Duke freshman record 36 points Davis answers in the other end with a Applause three and theres still over 7even minutes to go in regulation 11 for 14 from the field four for six from three 10 for 11 from the line oneonone with Davis working hard and fouled and a Timeout on the floor with 703 to go Cooper flag setting another Duke record with 36 points as a freshman and its not the last one hes going to set he has done absolutely everything against the Irish Music quite the afternoon for Cooper flag here against Notre Dame a Duke freshman record 36 points remarkable efficiency from two from three from the line however hes wanted it he has gotten it here today and how about this the last Duke player with a game of 355 and five is head coach John shy back in 2009 that was John Shys senior season where Duke had an older team and went on to win the national championship beating Butler and Micah Shrewsberry was an assistant coach to Brad Stevens at that time but Cooper flag 36 points hes 11 of 14 from the field 14 shot attempts now hes taken 11 free throws and hes going to add to that total right now six rebounds seven assists just a remarkable performance by The Freshman from Maine and keep adding to his totals the most impactful export from Maine since Lobster makes him both Jay hes got 23 points in the second half yeah hes had a great game in the second half yeah his first half was pretty darn good too and our statistician John Madre the legendary John Madre telling us the three fresh flag malawat and canle have all the points that du will score here in the second half Burton surrounded has to kick it out just so much size for him to deal with a loo from the Baseline LIF it short rebound James Dukes done a much better job in this second half of really rotating to threepoint Shooters if they can make the tough two hats off to them but theyre not giving up as many threes as they did in the first half canibble finds Applause Proctor kick to the corner for James three to shoot into the paint and up no good offensive rebound malawat and hes fouled malat just went right over the top of Burton Muhammad was there on the backside but just nothing that Burton could really do when youre going up against a guy with a a standing reach of what 98 thats imposing thats intimidating that is imposing yeah tomorrow an ACC Network womens basketball quadruple header featuring three top 20s teams it starts with Duke and Virginia at noon Eastern Carolina hosting BC Georgia teer Louisville and then capping the today with Miami and Applause Syracuse Duke LED 14 to nothing Notre Dame got it down to six earlier this half but its now up to an 18point lead under six to Applause go remember Dukes won six the last six games in a row each of them by 20 or more points nine in a row overall the last 6 by 20 or more and the last time that happened was 1999 the two teams went to the national championship game losing to Yukon for Jim Calhouns first national championship for the Huskies but that team had Elton brand I mean it was ridicul TR and langon ridiculously talented flag to James back to flag five to shoot kiple will launch a three and the rebound to Alo after a really good blockout on flag mamed getting big minutes today steps into a three lefted short Amala watch the rebound but if nothing else Michael shrewbury tried to find guys who can step up in support the big three if you will and I think sir mohamd has certainly given him some things to think about here this afternoon yeah some of their freshman Mohammad among them need to give consistent productivity going forward where Notre Dame can get a reliable eightman rotation good pass Shrewsbury checked to make sure his feet were behind the line missed the three and its Duke Music ball now with 435 to Applause go John Shys record as head coach of the Blue Devils in this building is 40 and3 and on his way it certainly looks like to win number 41 John shires done such a great job with putting teams together year after year and hes stacking great recruiting classes on top of one another and I think its been really intelligent with the way hes used the transfer Applause Portal Blue Devils not in a rush and a timeout taken by John sh with 429 to go 7961 blue doubles over the Music Irish T1 here an enormous afternoon for Cooper flag The Freshman has 38 points seven assists and six rebounds he is still in the game Notre Dame in the zone back flag the Music kick James shut off by rer now back to flag at the elbow but a whistle before the shot and a 3 second call against the Blue Devils I think it was malow watch in there yeah Applause Music how do you assess Notre Dame the rest of the wig and the league is not nearly as strong as it normally is this teams going to win some games in this league I think Notre James better than their record thats in large measure because they went so many games without Marcus Burton playing at all and its tough to to judge a team just based on how theyve played against this type of Defense you know Duke is an extraordinarily good defensive team and they look what they did to pit the other day I mean this team can guard but theyre competitive and had a real chance to win against North Carolina same thing on the road against NC State its a good basketball team Dukes just a great team they will go home to play BC Monday night on the ACC Network Dukes next next game is at home to Miami on Tuesday night Alo the kick Shrewsberry the step in and it goes and one Michael Shrewsberry or BR Shrewsberry forgive me uh not just as you said not just a threepoint shooter this year much more Adept to putting the ball on the deck but the key there for Duke and for Cooper flag was to run him off that threepoint line now that was a mistake to to foul on that possession Tyrese Proctor coming over a little bit late but on the close out you know you say close out under control you got to run that guy off the threepoint line and make him take a tough two completes the threepoint play Proctor out Gillis in for the Blue Devils still 303 to go down to 13 221 34 court pressure and they get it over without much Applause Music difficulty the flag in the middle you got malow basically playing the dunker spot down low James followed by flag couldnt finish it its still live and now after the fact the whistle blows froma watch was out of bounds and that took away a transition opportunity there for Notre D if youre looking for Iowa State Texas Tech that game will begin momentarily on ESPN news and then well come here to ESPN immediately following the conclusion of Applause the two and a half to go Burton finally got a little space and knocks down the three just ran a little Zoom action and K nipple went under and got caught up and that left Marcus Burton wide open and Jay hes had to work so hard today but hes four for six from three and he scored 19 points in this game no hes done really well but its been a a difficult task to go up against this defense just a sophomore he comes down with a rebound if meah shrewbury can retain all of his key players which he did from last year and hes bringing in a top 10 class next year Notre Dame could really be on the right path and quickly Burton the runner this time wont drop and we have goal tending or is it offensive basket interference which way are they calling often times when its even close the officials are going to call it because if they dont call it they cant review it if they call it they can go look at it there was no signal for count the basket so well have to get another look whos whose hands were in the cookie jar oh yeah was thats going to count cuz malows fingers were inside the rim yeah should be a fairly quick and easy decision to Music make if this counts its down to eight thats count yeah now the officials they go to the monitor by rule all that uh and they they do a really good job of going by the rules I would love to see college basketball do what the NBA does give each coach One Challenge if youre correct on the the first challenge that you use you keep it and you get it one more time and thats it whether youre right or wrong but and this ones a go end or a basket interference they look I probably looked at both but there are way too many too many trips to the monitor college basketball confirmed defensive basketball so count the basket Notre Dame is now on a 10 run and its down to eight with still a minute 46 to go it kind of looked like Smooth Sailing for Duke into the final few minutes of this game but the Irish continuing to put up a fight yeah for a while about four minutes ago this game became about as Cooper flag going to get 40 and now theres a little bit more gain pressure on the Blue Devils coming down the stretch good Notre Dame credit man they hang in there sticking with the two3 zone Proctor James for three not there and it is saved it is loose and it is tied up and the possession arrow is going in the direction of the Irish little surprised that Shrewsberry tried to save that but you certainly dont want to save it right out right underneath the basket I mean that went right to Cooper flag just went off his leg Applause so Notre Dame ball down by eight with a minute 15 to go chai the kick to Shrewsberry hurton to drive on flag good pass Alo a corner three and its a fivepoint game all set up by the penetration of Marcus Burton Burton got the ball into the lane turned back and then the quick swing from Shrewsberry to alako look at all the Defenders he draws and then got caught in rotation a 13 to nothing run for Notre Dame Duke cant settle for a perimeter shot here can Notre Dame afford to play this possession out or do they need to foul or we got a held Ball but now the arrow is going in Dukes Direction so the blue doubles retain well no matter the arrow that saved a basket as malow was wide open underneath for a l and a Timeout on the floor 496 to go and its still a game here in Durham back in 30 Music w Applause Music Music Music Applause Kevin youre not kidding the Irish have made a game of it again on a 13 to nothing run 496 to go can they get another stop on this trip Duke ball 20 on the shot clock Music and James to inbound for the Blue Devils ticked away and Ropers got it for Notre Dame a loo for three and the rebound to James and hes got to give the foul had that gone it would have been a twopoint game and you certainly dont blame Alo for taking that shot hes an outstanding perimeter shooter Music but how about Notre Dame hanging in there just a tremendous job by rer to reach in knock that ball away and Alo stepping in had some pressure on him on the shot but just that close to really putting some heat on the Blue Devils a 48 threepoint shooter on the season so you cant blame him for for trying Burton and Davis returning now for Roper and ji for the Irish theres still plenty of time left to extend this game for Notre Dame make or Miss right here and I think Notre Dame wants to look to attack the rim as quickly as they can and then if you get if you can force help then you kick it out one of two sixpoint game Burton drives and hits fourpoint game timeout Notre Dame really smart just a few seconds coming off the clock and now you have a fourpoint game with Notre Dame able to apply some fullcourt pressure Duke needs to get its best free throw shooting five on the floor Marcus Burton up to a team High 21 now on the afternoon really smart job by Marcus Burton to attack the rim didnt draw additional Defenders but went right into the body of seon James James did not want a foul and hes able to get the quick score that can help extend this game by the way elsewhere in the ACC theyve gone Final in Pittsburgh Louisville with a big road wi they have beat hit 82 78 here today heres todays game summary including a Duke freshman record 38 points for Cooper flag but the big story right now is that bottom note a 15 to1 Run for the Irish right now its incumbent upon Notre Dame they want to try to get a quick trap quick steel and the question is if youre going to foul and play the foul game who do you who do you go after right now know look if you can get a foul quickly on cion James if he gets it you might want to foul him Music first James will inbound Proctor no foul yet kiple still no foul and there it is to send flag to the line lot of time went off the clock really what you want to do there is try to get a quick steal maybe one quick trap but after that you got you cant be choosing you got time is more important and flag with a chance to reach 40 in this game if he knocks down these two that last time out John shy put Mason Gillis back in the game whos a 80 plus free throw shooter as well Applause Music and right now make or Miss for Cooper flag Notre Dame wants to do what it did on the earlier possession get the ball to the rim and there it is a 40o game for Cooper flag the last Duke player to do that JJ ready back in 06 malawat back into the ball game for defensive purposes Burton trying to get to the glass again shot altered by malawat who runs it down and is fouled with 158 to go really smart substitutions by John shy late Mason Gillis going into the game for ball handling and free throw shooting and then after Cooper flag knocked down those two free throws putting mywatch back in to help protect the rim and secure the Applause ball well this this game did not look like it was going to come down to the end with about 5 minutes left and a sevenpoint lead now Applause malow with a big day himself how about 19 and 10 got his best game of the year Burton two more 8478 but down to 86 seconds remaining there is no quit in Marcus Burton no quit in Notre Dame Applause and finally the foul with 49 to go its all academic now other than Cooper flag continuing to add to his totals Duke will get the win to go to 142 60 in the league they had to work awfully hard full credit to the Irish for the way they just kept fighting in the second half but Dukes had just enough it looks like to get out of here with a Music W just tied the ACC freshman record 41 points sharing it with Olivier hanlin Mom and Dad looking on Cooper flag has done this on 14 field goal attempts this will be his 16th free throw a new ACC freshman record and the loudest Ovation of the day belongs to Cooper flat and that will do it Duke 86 Notre Dame 78 Cooper flag 42 points
