together he talked about it against Notre Dame and didnt do it much against pit lets see what happens tonight you saw Tyrese Proctor starting for the first time since the first meeting back on December 2nd against Georgia Tech who controls the opening tap and away we go jackets on a 4 game losing streak 87 overall 1 and3 in the ACC and the last three losses all in ACC action by Dango is the stud freshman whos been leading the way for Georgia Tech he had the big break out the first meeting against D well he had himself a game N9 of 11 from the floor in the first game and he comes out tonight hitting his first shot 21 and five had a bunch of blocks as well Damon STM said after I just came from the NBA thats what theyre supposed to look like so the four guards around filipowski including Foster gives it up to Roach post entry for filipowski who was oh so hot at the Pete misses his first one tonight heres Miles Kelly top scorer for the jackets at 152 perr and a traveling violation on Tara gari the sophomore from New Zealand and the transfer from UMass Kari started games early in the year but I think hes putting a starting lineup tonight to cter counter Dukes four guard lineup hes a 69ine guy but hes mobile hes able to move and it helps Jo Tech continue their length but able to be able to switch and vers be versatile on the defensive end of the floor on the perimeter Proctor bounces is for filipowski and Duke ranked 11th in the country 123 overall 31 in the ACC stays with the blue deves who are on a seven game winning streak hottest team in the ACC like we said and that goes back to the backtoback losses on the road to Arkansas and Georgia Tech and John shy said there was afterward I had to get better as a coach thats a good sign from Tyrese practor theres not many better in the country at catching and shooting threes the entire did Tyrese Proctor coming in when he gets his feet up under him in this building hes shooting over 40 from three got to find him and get to him early call it a two and Nate George answers with a three freshman point guard from Toronto known for his Distributing more than his scoring big sign for him I think hes been a little too unselfish at times roach drives for Applause two its an illegal screen set by Dango and his Music first great sign by both teams coming out Baseline out of bounds play great sign if your a Duke fan need to get Proctor going here and George is not known for his threepoint shooting hes only shooting 19 coming in and got to take that shot hes got to make these guards respect him from behind the line itll open up the lane for him Foster gives it up for Rose coach D coming off a 22point win at pit theyre up 25 at halftime knocked down nine threes in the first half John Shire loved the defense as well filipowski plus a foul and thats two on Dongo just over two minutes in great fer and patience I think he has a size Advantage inside couple inches inside just turns see right there donga grab Dongo grabs him around the waist and its not the way you often tell big you got to protect your early fouls and just got one on the offensive end of the floor gets this one on the defensive end and I dont know how much Damon stard is going to trust his freshman got to get him out get him rested yeah they yank him 212 into the game a guy averaging 12 points nine rebounds shooting about 60 that is a big big loss early on hes just such a big part of what they do and his ability to pass the ball after ball screens joyia Tech team is a big ball screen team and he does so many different things but the best attribute is again facilitating after that ball screen look at the pressure from Jared McCain on gari who gets bumped by McCain you had the game Tuesday for Georgia Tech when they lost in overtime to Notre Dame by a score of 75 to 68 and in that game you were talking about where does the secondary scoring come from yes now youre without Dongo a few minutes in and thats even more of a question it youre going to rely on your experience now and you saw George come in and make a play for you ear hes got to get involved and continue to create for his teammates and lets see if their veteran Miles Kelly steps up they run an action or something to get him the ball George gave it up to gari and last Touch by filipowski with five left to shoot saw Damon stanmire in his first year at the helm after the last couple of Seasons with the Celtics 5 years of course as the head coach at Pacific but then decided to join his good friend ime Oka George knew it was offt Target filipowski the rebound Duke wants to run filipowski backs down oneonone filipowski the drop step and the finish one thing we talked about as good as filipowski has been hes been really good now hes starting to dominate hes starting to impose his will on smaller guys thats a great sign theres a lot of perimeter shooting with this Duke team and not a lot of post into your scoring if he provides that look out skip for Kelly knocked down 7 threes and had 25 points against Notre Dame for a guy hasnt shot it as well as he did last year it was Big Time encouraging stuff on the flats as McCain misses yeah hes at the top of the Scouting Report now and its just so dangerous catching a shooting at his size at 66 he can Elevate over you duke definitely wants to Crow mil Miles Kelly and make him put it on the floor Proctors got him here and a switch from McCain post entry for gari and the youngsters doubled got it away to kaasi Reeves who knocks it down great pass out of a double team you want your double teams to be really aggressive and not throw a straight line pass skip not bad defense just a better pass Proctor working with filipowski in the pick and roll at two more for Kyle filipowski up to seven too easy filipowski is not settling for jump shots but e dwan out of the game and donga with two fouls filipowski knows theres not theres not much resistance hes going to get on the inside risky pass roach nearly picked it George moves it gari hoists it and hits three threes early on for Georgia Tech and thats huge star wants his guys loose and relaxed when they played Duke the first time they feel like their style of play matches up with this Duke team offensive rebound roach he equated it to boxing match he says you know what he thinks their style of play does theyre going to keep everything in front theyll give that to filipowski they dont want him on the inside hes got a three inside and outside and hes got the last 10 for the Blue Devils unfortunately for stamar in this building Philipa is also shooting over 45 from threepoint line he stood up Kelly he saved it Foster pushes McCain drives and is fouled by gari so kaasi Rees and Georgia Tech theyve knocked down three threes as a team early on theyre trying to keep up with Kyle filipowski great F there great knockdown pass and Duke coming out strong early Jord Techs not going anywhere well be

you said you thought KY Philipi maybe had his toughest game last Saturday at Notre Dame when it was just seven points on two for 12 shooting as you see and it was much different against pit early on here you used the word dominating why is it different now well I I think because we talked about it and even sh agreed with this its its time for him to dominate hes been really good all year but his talent dictates he can be dominant and he performed that he shows you that against pit hes coming out the first half hes just telling you youre too small Im too good good Im too skilled theres absolutely nothing you can do with that theres a confidence that comes with that and hes showing you why hes a preseason All American ACC player of the year right now we asked John CH could you put your finger on anything in particular Tuesday against pit that was different for him and he said you know the way filipowski is wired hes so intense and hes so competitive you never have to doubt that but he thought the C was maybe enjoying himself a little bit more Tuesday that he was a little bit more free he said that Chris Carwell longtime associate head coach has really done great work with him on that side of things mentally and emotionally yeah Chris knows the game and his experience and high level games that hes played in its just something that he can relate so much to what Philip house is going through and I think a lot of these young freshmen these young guys come in and people forget that this team is still a relatively young team outside of roach and young Reeves nearly turned it over dangos in the game of the his two fouls after sitting for about 3 minutes shot clock is at 10 for the veteran fifth year senior guard Kyle St It Off the Bench moves it for Reeves Reeves attacks oh on his head Wy Reed is not playing hes coming in he knows theres no resistance at the rim with this Duke team even with Philip psky there hes out of the game right now its just Ryan young hes not a shot blocker hes a position the defender and wasy Reeds J does not care at all sit down Ryan Applause young wow described entering the year as three inde D and athletic uh yeah this qualifies as athletic I would say do you agree I think it does okay thanks yeah I mean wow I know I cant jump that higher couldnt at any point in my life so speak for yourself roach knocks it down Jeremy roach I think has been the most consistent guard if not the most consistent player in his Duke lineup hes just been so steady taking care of the basketball scoring when needed had to roll off a career year for Jeremy roach fouryear starter for the Blue Devils hes averaging 162 per game over his last 10 and a shot at the best he ever has Coleman picked the pass from Blakes and the first turnover for Duke of the night dong goes in the game now with two fouls Styers just trying to put some trust and see what his freshman how he responds and pick and roll and he scores wheres he best offensively I think in the pick and roll Jord T loves that little slip pocket pass there getting him on the move and its great lineup because Duke puts Ryan Young on perimeter like this a lot more than throwing it inside for Philip palski McCain no young the offensive rebound back out Foster yes best time to get a threepoint shot is off of an offensive rebound Debo Coleman no on a transition Applause triple roach around the young screen roach now GES through his spot but he missed it and then the foul goes against Ryan Young on the rebounding action Ryan young just shows you a level of physicality when he plays dont watch his stats just shows the effort willingness to give it up finding his teammate Caleb Foster knocking down threes Ryan young accepts his role is more than anyone else just comes in knows hes got to throw his body around hes the enforcer with this Duke team and takes pride in that role he stays in so its a bigger lineup now for Duke as Kyle filipowski returns Dongo goes out they squeezed about 2 minutes out of him there and he didnt pick up a third foul oh they dont want him in the game with filipowski is in the game they know with that lineup theyre not going to run offense through Ryan young as much in the post but with filipowski you know you well its not worth youre in the game right now youre only down six no need to rush it a legal screen set by EB danana just in as well and oh by the way for Georgia Tech 24 in the old gold has come in as as well Amari Abram the Old Miss transfer who hasnt played since December 16th was a starter at times early on this year didnt travel with the team last weekend due to illness hes getting some run here in the first half and he he provides an ability to guard but also a decision maker in pick and roll phasi with Dongo sitting has EB danana on him filipowski spinning and it rolled off another offensive rebound for Ryan young roach met by Reeves back out Blakes can knock it Applause down so no Kelly no Dongo on the floor who steps up to score for the jackets third leading scorer is HOAs Reeves hes got five early theyre going to put filipowski in the ball screen they either going to take him or switch it tough shot flip stuck with him calls for the post up moves it for roach Strokes it boy filipowski is locked in he is hes he is L hes tied for the lead with this team doing that stretch this winning streak here and just does an unbelievable job of in assist youre saying yes he has hes just been so underrated part of his game we focus so much on the guards and hes one of the assist leaders of this team do his winning streak big answer from Kyle sturdivan vocal fifth year senior guard Who coming off the bench this year mostly a starter the last couple of seasons and thats already the fourth triple you see for Georgia Tech to hang around and theyre going to need to shoot it well from downtown if they want to stay with Duke in this building Dukes going to push pace and keep a highsc scoring game Jordan Tech doesnt want it to be in the upper 80s or 70s but theyre knocking down threes they theyll be right here Proctor got fouled on the drive you said it Jeremy roach is having his best season in year four here in Durham he is hes just there hanging around a threepoint line knocking down a three from the corner pocket Duke up six early Subways now slicing their deli meats fresh

aore magic some ruined Tonight Theres No Stopping Us Now this is just spectacular thats our move womens college hoops on ESPN and Music ABC the competitions never been better this is just spectacular the stars have never been brighter thats our move womens college hoops on ESPN and ABC at our once a year saleing clearance save up to 30 on prior year Temperpedic beds and bases Mattress Firm h second meeting between Georgia Tech and Duke and how good was the first one for the jackets they LED for all but a buck 38 of that game and we both watched back the film and you said to me they just came out hitting shots they drilled threes early and then they got the double eight but they did and they continue that they feel as they feel comfortable against him you look at the team theyve lost four straight games and and Duke comes in as hot as anyone but but they felt like their style of play matches up with Duke and that theyre going to be right there when it matters and their ability to now with Mitchell being out and Duke going to this four guard lineup I think they feel comfortable with kapari and those guys they feel like theyre mobile enough to be able to defend on the perimeter but also take advantage on the on the rebound and on the glass so winning the first try against Duke for Damon stmy said afterward yeah that was the vision a win like that but he said it wasnt the goal so at the end of the day we want to have a parade down Peach Street we were walking and talking with him on his way back to the bus after shoo around this morning and he pointed out that when you win a game like that it puts a bullseye on your back not just for this game the rematch with Duke but to everyone else as well for a team that was picked 13 third worst in the ACC yes I think what it does is it lets everyone know what youre capable of so now everyone is g to leading up to that theyre going to say hey this team just beat Duke at home and so they they cant sneak up on anybody now and theyre going to get everybodys best shot now and I think in a conference play thats just what happens Kelly got free came up short from deep and mil Kelly has missed his first two from long range Dongo in the game hes got Philip psky hes got the two fouls so hes got to go straight up and did pretty good work great job just going vertical there challenging a shot without committing a foul Abram navigating the pick and roll leads it eight for Duke TJ powers in the game as well the Freshman for Massachusetts Proctor off the glass good to see Proctor getting out there hes a guy that has so much talent its getting some consideration for preseason AllAmerican and hasnt been quite as consistent as youd like it good handoff there Stant to Dango and hes got six hes just inval invaluable to this Jordan Tech Team and shot fake Blow by and a foul thatll send Kyle filipowski to the line its a big part of no one uses the pick and roll more than this than Georgia Tech just getting in the paint and filipowski steps up thatll be easy picking for Dongo and if he doesnt stoping the ball early hell look for lobs as well and if the guard from the weak side comes theyre skipping it to three so that middle ball screen against Jord Tech how you defend that dictates how the game is going to go for these guys they are a big big ball screen team they use the pick and roll offensively more than any other team in the ACC is that an NBA influence from Damon St yes but I think what they do better than anyone else is they also execute it with their big so they hit that little pocket pass and they dont always rely on their guards to make the decisions they let their bigs make that decision and guard comes off the big helps you throw the pocket pass and that is throwing weak side threes and so the Bigs decision is whether to do the short roll or the full roll or whether there always looking for short row theyre going for a live or short row got it and and thats just predicated on theyre reading the ball screen coverage with Philip palsky theyre trying to keep him in drop coverage like theyre in now yep and watch he drops short roll move it to the corner move to the opposite corner thats far three that is what Jord Tech wants to do short row skip at the opposite corner and youre saying the big there Dongo is making the decision where to go with that ball not just the guard coming around the screen most of the time its always opposite because hes putting pressure on the big and forcing the weak side guard to come help filipowski is blocked by Kelly who then bounces it off filipowski and saves it so walk us through this the pick and roll and dangos decision hes coming up I think George gives it up a little too early and you see pow coming over because he feels as though he has to stop dong go he sprays it to the corner knocks down to three I think theyll run this all night long and this is how they play keeping the ball in the middle of the Applause floor whistle off ball and a foul goes against Kaleb Foster it has also helped lead to five made threes for George Tech theyve knocked down double digit threes in backtoback games and thats something they had only done once the first 13 games of the year they have not shot it well for the season from three but stroking it well again here tonight at Cameron good sign for the yellow jackets they under 30 on the year to have knocked down five already in the first half is a big sign Dongo tried to cross up Ryan young but he walked with it turnover number five for Georgia Tech fivepoint game we got a good one going going in the rematch in Durham between Tech and Duke cheese will do only Daisy cottage cheese will do satisfying and Fresh So creamy and Del only dizzy Chee will do only da cot cheese

off with Miami squaring off against Virginia Tech in in blackburg as Miami gets closer to full strength the Hoke looking for a big win and speaking of big games Rasheed Wallis is in the building checking this one out big Fowler coming in one thing I can guarantee you if youre looking you know hes not supporting Duke in this game but yeah if youre wondering hes here to support bonsy Wells and we spoke about that yesterday teammates in Portland and for the Trailblazers and he had no problems coming in here now I dont know how in the world hes sitting behind the bench cuz that is one of the most uncomfortable seats trying to sit down as a 611 guy can you imagine that imagine sitting behind him rashids still in great shape he looks like hes to go out there and give you a bucket or two bonsy was getting up shots at shoot around today stroke looked pretty good roach is blocks how about that from Tara gari Reeves short from three but an offensive rebound for for Tai Claude the fifth year senior transfer now at his third school and a fresh 20 for the jackets only down by five gapar off the bounce three on two foster Proctor attack Scoops cant finish another offensive rebound and a gari foul two on gari now as well joining Coleman and Dongo theyre probably showing you why hes in a lineup there Billy the guarden perimeter there gives up the middle drive and chases it down and puts that on the glass telling Roose to get that out of here lot of upside to Tara gari originally from New Zealand originally committed to the Paul as well before starting out at UMass lowski is good on the front end he started some games early but what he does is he hes his ability to defend on the perimeter but again he he can play on the perimeter you see his skill set hes very skilled for a 69ine guy Eva danana starts and star I wanted to start him because from a physical standpoint he gives by Dongo ability to rest on the per and not have to guard guys like filipowski all game because he wants to avoid the foul trouble that they got in early today no Dongo on the floor right now for George attack Kelly hits it Kelly Kellys lucky there was no contact there he kicked his leg out he did it would have been an offensive foul hes lucky there wasnt any contact Foster cant connect Kelly the rebound yeah sort of awkward looking three yeah on both the close out and then the landing Kelly attacks couldnt scoop it home past filipowski so the four guard lineup once again that started the game for Duke youre just joining us there without Mark Mitchell hes got a sprain knee roach no and cl secures it 11 of the 19 shots for Georgia techer from threepoint range they have not attempted a free throw yet in this first half with six to go b a ball screen again for the Freshman point guard Nate George turns around from the elbow gets the roll hes the guy I think his ability to create his shot not just for himself and his teammates hes so unselfish at times I think hes too unselfish hes a big fan of Steve Nash and he had 11 assists Tuesday against nerame the most by a yellow jacket in about 15 years the lapowski face up spin move rolled out got his own Miss and gets foul and a line up at the front court for Jord te is so small right now seven footer filipowski is going to have his way inside you talked about George a second ago do you know the other freshman that had more assist than him in the joria tech history that would be Iman Shumpert freshman year you did your homework huh I did I did really well done third foul by the way on tfar gari so hes got three Bongo got two and again the front Court dealing with some issues here and foul trouble Debo Colemans coming back hes got to and so EB danana has got to come into the game for Damon Applause stanmire first meting between these teams rebounding was exactly even it was Duke has done a better job of that they had a few games early I think the Arizona game where they would just crushed on the glass A little bit and since then has been an emphasis for this group theyve been challenged if they if theyre going to play with three guards let alone four they know they got a rebound just three right now as young comes in for Proctor Duke extends and picks up full court on Miles Kelly George Kelly Coleman danana and Reeves the five for Damon stanmire Kelly a step back his second three I think its a night and day with him when he he shoots shots and hes on balance his percentages will go way up at times I think he just drifts a little bit and off balance and it hurts his percentages spun out on McCain when he gets hot he can be as electric a long distance score as maybe youll find in this conference long to no off balance well hes floating on it if you watch him and see and and thats not a strength of his hes you can see hes taking those shots hes only shooting 20 off the dribble hes 66 if he takes his time theres not a guard on the floor right now aside from Foster that would even bother his shot that was something John CH said to his team at the start of shoot around today he said Force Kelly to dribble because when he does hes 20 shooting from the floor off the bounds hes got another Rebound with the score locked at 31 coming up on four to go until halim here at Cameron in the middle game of our ACC and triple header alongside Randolph childr Mike Monaco with you our entire crew behind the scenes that last possession there by Duke filipowski Bell Dongo out pick and roll again and danana missed it Dukes oit last nine trying to find a bucket here and the foul goes

Kelly oh that was pretty magic some ruined Tonight Theres No Stopping Us Now this is just SP Happ thats our moon womens college hoops on ESPN and ABC again no team offensively is in the pick and roll more than Georgia Tech just a great job just coming off little pocket passes Dongo so great in the middle eie danana all their bigs are so good at catching it and passing or finishing in the paint its one of the most difficult plays to guard is the middle ball screen because because what it does is it it puts your weak side defense that you dont know you go from strong side to weak side in one dribble and thats really difficult for your rotation so you got to try to commit early and when you do they spray it to the corner for threes and they feel comfortable with they said that they like this matchup and this is the team that shoots 30 from three coming in and then youre kind of like all right were going to concede some of those shots and then now they knocking those shots down theyre shooting 58 theyre 7 of 12 and we got ourselves a game why does this match you think fit Georgia Tech well they feel comfortable with it because they you know I think coming in they were planning on saying hey they thought Mitchell would start and they were going to be able to Sag off Mitchell and sit in the paint and clog up the lane and thats been taken away with the for lineup but that lineup is new and Duke hadnt committed to this lineup much theyre already you see Ryan young playing right now and they went back to their bigger lineup I think Shy expected the foreg guard lineup to be and thats you know to be more effective on the offensive end of the floor and it just quite hasnt happened yet and thats something that you just got to practice and play in games a little bit more the team had five minutes of that starting lineup prior to tonights game so foster sits right now young Zen hes coming off one of his most used games of the Season John CH said it was one of his best games of the year George got bumped and will shoot a couple with a chance to put Georgia Tech in front for the first time since it was 54 Nate George has been really impressive as a freshman not just this game he handles all the pressure as a starting freshman and star just trust him and hes really unselfish and get to the basket I think he needs to be a little bit more aggressive and trying to score like he did here and draw a free thr hey our gymnastics coverage here on acc Network continues tonight at 9 Eastern the third of three quad meets final one has NC State BYU Cal and Michigan State in Action a warm welcome to ACC gymnastics yeah when you talk about pick and roll Georgia Tech is a team tops in the ACC Nate George highest rate of pick and roll usage of anyone in the ACC he does a really good job of taking care of the basketball I mean his first game against Duke with all the pressures and the different bodies that they can put at him he had nine Music assists filipowski drives and forced one up lot of contact there Philip psky was looking for the call Coleman Banks one in and Georgia teex got the lead Debo Coleman getting an early hours banking hours here putting the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets up three Junior from Memphis whos basically been the six starter this year for George Tech and has played big minutes in his career when Josh passner was the head coach and he played stter minutes he does start the game but he sure finishes and St Mar is comfortable having him on the floor he needs it to balance out some of the youth in his back court and newness when even with his transfers by the way second foul on Miles Kelly so now four guys for the jackets with at least two tomorrow afternoon a womens basketall ball triple header hit squares off against BC at noon then number 15 Louisville host wake for us and in the afternoon is capped off in Chapel Hill with Virginia and number 20 Carolina every Sunday womens hoops right here accn and the ESPN app hey man I need a little bit more enthusiasm when you say my lady deakes now a little bit more you know make for I thought that was pretty good its okay I mean I just wanted you to put a little bit more emphasis on that quick men with a win today over Virginia over on ESPN 2 earlier this afternoon Georgia Tech by one and its a Duke foul goes on Jeremy roach and thats two on roach great job by Miles Kelly just showing his experience there drawing a foul check that theyre going to give it a proctor yeah Proctor got tangled up with Applause mouse George Kelly danana Reeves and Coleman the five for Georgia Applause Tech and the foul away from the ball on the lob entry just seeing that pass by George it looks like a little thing but postfeeding is like a lost art Georgia seems to have mastered it already in his career run a ball screen with Philip housei now Duke is switching the ball screen and instead of trying to drive him on the perimeter he realizes Dongo has the size Advantage inside four to5 was called perfect lob Reeves tough shot filipowski the rebound hes got 14 and seven and took a shot to the back of the head roach good move to get to the rim Dongo got to be careful with that a freshman mistake reaching in on the perimeter just fight under the rebound fighting for the glass there I dont think theres anything intentional going go right elbow caught him across the head there I think hes all right 14 and seven I think hes fine yeah Duke 15 three free throws theyve knocked down 10 of them and roach is good on the first Tai clauds going to come back and replace danana so Dan Ds out dangos on the bench as well for Damon stanmire with 217 to go until half time yeah two minutes to go you can rest some of your guys and just long as you dont turn it over there wont be a ton of possessions left in the game or you can rest your guys and get them ready and not pick up that that third foul here in the first Applause half Damon STM with us earlier today expressed a lot of confidence in his group going into this mat CCH up even though theyre on the four game losing streak George little floater rolls around and down his aggressiveness alone elevates the play of the yellow Applause jackets McCain off the screen sticks it Kane showing you its not just a catch and shoot threepoints I think thats one of the adjustments hes made doing his winning streak since hes been asserted in the lineup is his ability to tack you off the bounc finishing the rim in that midrange Jay like he showed you there seven straight in double figures George drives a foul on Jaylen Blakes George just getting in the paint finishing over Philip palsky with the running layup there its a great job McCain coming back taking the midrange not challenging the trees inside saw the opening area and both guards are doing that with this smaller lineup when you play with this four guard lineup both teams are trying to play in drops meaning theyre trying to keep their big on big so the guards are just turning the corner taking the midrange shots and its itll be there all night youve seem to really like what youve seen from Nate George true fresman from Toronto you said it to me this morning even before the game started tonight and he like Marcus Burton at Notre Dame has a lot of responsibility and George reclassified so he he could effectively still be in high school and I told you because I watched him and I saw him on film how much he he handles a pressure even in the first game at home against Duke every team goes after him he takes care of the basketball he finds his teammates you know that being unselfish is not a flaw and he seems to be sometimes hes so unselfish he gets some unnecessary turnovers trying to find his teammates if he can mix it has he gain experience to get better at that mixing when to be aggressive and when to find teammates as hes showing you hes found it down the lane and it roll off George Springs to it blemish for him tonight hes one of four at the free throw line te down one Coleman at the elbow puts the jackets back in front John shy wants a timeout 106 to go first half we step aside for 30 and right back to durl this new year make a resolution to save that Toyota of Rock Hill resolved to take advantage of Toyota of of Rock Hills real zero deal zero down zero payments for 3 months and zero cost maintenance all back by our Rock Solid guarantee and we honor all dealers ads this year make a New Years resolution youll want to keep save with the real zero deal at Toyota of Rock Hill located minutes from uptown at exit 79 month and a half ago in the ACC opener Georgia Tech won 7268 against Duke on the flats and now got a onepoint game late first half this team is defense and we talked about it early in the year teams like Notre Dame and Jordan Tech wasnt much expected to these guys they were picked near bottom of the league and but when we watched them we were impressed with them on the defensive end of the floor these teams are playing really hard for their coaches and start I mean STM has just done a great job this group and theyre continuing to buy in and hes giving these guys confidence and he felt comfortable coming in here where a lot of people may have written him off and Applause Proctor drives on Reeves Proctor had it roll out off the window 20 seconds separate the game in the shot clock George with the back door cut for cloud he couldnt handle it and it belongs to Duke after turnover number six from the yellow jackets see George just telling him hey keep cutting Ill find Applause you Duke has done a great job off year not turning the basketball over and Georgia Tech doesnt turn it over a lot they just their turnovers just seem to be theres never a good time to have a turnover great pass there they just seem to have at the wrong time in critical Applause Music possessions roach got fouled its on Kyle Sturman and thats his first Jerry Road stock that it should have been goal tending as well John sh is insisting the same now theyre going to come together and chat about this they didnt seem to call it early and they have I believe said that theyre going to go over and have a look yeah well hes missed that I mean I know he touches it after the glass but thats thats off hes missing thats just a Mis layup thats just a Mis layup and it didnt seem that there was anything unw about the touch of the rim that altered the shot in any way so expect it to stand as called yeah and no bucket no goal tending but judging by stars reaction to it he wasnt happy no yeah good call Two Shots 287 to go in this first half Duke the hottest team in the ACC riding a seven game winning streak that goes back to loss against Dam damire and Georgia Tech and that may be something thats surprised by this score Youre Expecting Duke to kind of run away with it but the one thing you can say is dont you know you look at youre starting to see the importance of how much Mark Mitchell means to this team because when you Ser him in the lineup hes your most versatile Defender hes big hes F physical hes athletic he doesnt provide much in shooting but he started to figure out how teams were playing him to make himself effective and you didnt have to run plays for him to get himself involved in the game and you know youre going to miss a player like that with just from on the defensive end of the floor alone roach splits jackets can hold for the final shot of the half yeah Mitchell had just been starting to play his best basketball of the season season we saw him against Notre Dame with his first career double double and now unable to go today John sh came over to US during shootter out he said smallest lineup in Duke basketball history he did a great job watch what Dukes doing right now theyre going to try to ghost the screen and great job encountering George comes up empty to close the first half Foster got it off and that does it for the first half at Cameron here in the first half so my concern with filipowski is just will he wear down and some of these guards are you know Jordan I mean for the Blue Devils have to get themselves going and I think it starts with number five Proctor is the guy that we know has got all American consideration in theres filipowski part of that starting five he scores on the Block and you see it is those five that started the game out there to begin the second half they logged about 9 and 1 half minutes together and the scoring margin like the actual first half score exactly even while they were on the floor this for guard lineup needs to get their your self going defensively too pressuring the ball theyre going to switch one through four with everything by Dango turning around on filipowski and a little bit too strong seven game winning streak for Duke hangs in the balance in the second meeting of the Season between these teams hand off for practor yeah even that possession there no one stopped the ball and boster is just not as aggressive as it needs to be because theyre trying to give everything to Philip howski and thats fine sometimes you just got to play big block by tafara gari on filipowski Kelly was the trailer down the lane and he got fouled by Kyle filipowski is first and you as you asked me a second ago and filipowski gets it inside thats just a great block with the left hand he didnt bite no he didnt at all he stayed down and you tell you def you tell your guys to be the second guy to jump did a great job and and as skilled as filipowski is hes not an Above the Rim guy so if you have length and athleticism you can bother him when hes in the post as thear did just there and you got to if youre Duke you got to be concerned because I think theyre theyre not attacking with they for this lineup pushing in transition theyre just slowing down waiting on filipowski to play inside and theyre playing as if Mark Mitch was there and need with the four guard lineup your advantage is just we got four guys lets attack off the dribble play with each other switching on the defense there should be more aggressiveness on both ends of the floor from the four guard lineup Kelly ties it does it surprise you theyre not playing faster because it is a faster Tempo this year than it was last year in year one of John Shire and its been faster since the Proctor injury a month and a half ago well thats what they prided themselves on and just spraying the ball around and moving it not ice from Deep for filipowski and youve seen the last few possessions its been pH filipowski filipowski filipowski and thats great but other guys have got to get themsel involved and you cant just slow down and wait on them Foster nearly picked it we asked John sh today what do you want the identity to be of this five together the the four around one with this lineup and he said offensively its got to be sharing it you got to be content if you go a few minutes without getting a shot one thing young guys got to realize is the defense is going to dictate who gets the ball who gets the shot because they want to take you out of it theyre going to take you out of it Reeves down the lane two more he was attacking and kaasi Reeves is up to seven Tex in front by two been really impressed with him just overall his ability to knock down open shots get to the rim chase down blocks hes been doing it all you didnt see a lot of this in Florida and theyve seen to unlock something here and foul something in Jo DET Tech with him hes lurking top right of your screen Kari made the defensive play now he moves it Reeves cant knock it down Dango battles on the boards and he draws a Duke foul theres Lon athleticism with this group and just catches it off the curl screen and Duke doesnt want to switch and and the Philip psky that possession he didnt switch and then hes you know and then gave up the layup then he switches and then Don go gets the offensive rebound so they trying to play him in drops to keep him big on big and as well see Itll be this middle ball screen Foster commits a foul uh Kelly second on Foster after the third uh Jeremy roach stays out there just about two and A2 minutes out of halftime now they cannot lose roach I mean we talked so much about filipowski and roach has 13 points and again hes the guy that settles this group down hes a leader of this group and he goes under so he got switched on the Dango made the catch and scores in traffic above Proctor and roach these freshman are really good I I mean George is so impressive again comes off the ball screen and again lobs it over the top he knows theyre going to switch hes hes so far advanced in what he sees and it helps that your point your your coach is a great point guard gari another block on Philip palowski and the lob Dukes going to have to burn one here I think coming across chy does as large as the lead has been for the yellow jackets at Cameron head by a half dozen just great weak side block by gar just gets out the block gets down chases it down and runs up and catches the L yellow jacket is in control here and caming crazy dont like it if you love to travel Capital 1 has a rewards credit card

teams the games brightest stars I got on it half court we shootting shots like we wide open NBA Wednesday on ABC Home of the NBA Music Finals fire my CH Gott feeling reason pop Music top all right okay I did it my Music way the competitions never been better this is just spectacular the stars have never been brighter thats our moood womens college hoops on ESP Damon sts Yellow Jackets B score Duke 82 to begin this the second half theyre on an 880 run its still the small lineup for Duke Randolph chers I ask you this how is Georgia Tech maximizing itself right now against that lineup for the Blue Devils well like we talked about George in the ball screen theyre running a middle ball screen so when duas in drop coverage meaning theyre keeping Philip Housey in the lane the guards are turning the corner either getting to the rim or shooting the midrange and when he comes up and he switches now George has a great ability to throw it over the top and Dongo and these guards are just too small to to defend that shouldnt drop coverage prevent the lob or no it does when you got a guy like Durk Lively back got it again we talked about it is good as Philip palsky is and all the great attributes he has hes not an Above the Rim guy hes not a l guy a pick and roll at this end for Duke offensively again sticking with that same five out of the timeout and Jared McCain Scoops to the cup hes got five thats what you got to do if you got four guards Essen on the floor and literally four point guards at that then needs to be more dribble Drive penetration put pressure on the rim spray the ball out shoot the read and continue to drive like this so filipowski in drop coverage here and that short roll is there because hes dropping yes hes backed off and even if he comes up thats just thats a difficult pass to guards a pocket pass and again Dongo is comfortable catching it on the move and finishing at in an ACC area he just catches it 8 to 10f footer floater Drive lobs and he underrated passer and thats just a difficult thing to defend really nice touch as well from the Fresh from senagal hes got now A Team High 10 filipowski moves it for foster and the rebound down to Kelly jackets by six Dongo sets the screen for Kelly another pocket pass and Dango scores again so so what do you do if youre Duke against ball screens now thats the thing now theyre caught into they only done they only do two things so are you willing to try something on the Fly theyre going to play in drops or theyre going to switch right now Jo detek is destroying either so now you just got to challenge your guys step up and knock down shots like this but you got to step up and guard there got to be a level of toughness now with your group gari wraparound pass Dango couldnt Corral it and this is the possession I mean there Fosters not trying to attack theyre just moving it around look now there you go thats it he draws a foul uh to far gari and that is four on gari with still 15 minutes to go jackets by eight on the road havent won in this building in 20 years pop yeah thats it do Music iack thats my flavor chips aoy here for happy Subways now slicing their deli meats fresh

biggest teams the games brightest stars we I got two hands on it half court we shooting shots like we wide open NBA Wednesday on ABC Home of the NBA Finals the most passion the most intensity this is the way basketball supposed to Applause be Music lets go back to one of these pick and rolles Duke is in drop coverage explain that and then also the choice of the screen Setter by Dongo so right now we stop we see Philip Pos laying off hes in drop coverage there miles Kellys coming off and most the time they over dribble with their guards what Jordan Tech does is they play this pocket pass and they reading this corner Defender here if he comes over they kick it to the corner for three which is why they have eight threes in this game already if he doesnt come over their Bigs like d go is so effective in getting the ball in here and finishing right in that ACC area and thats it so when they come over and help and its just that middle ball screen is tough and people wondering what else you can do it keeps it in the middle of the floor and its just the the ball moves from weak side to strong side so quickly thats why people are always pushing the ball out of the middle of the Court roach misses out of the timeout dangos got the rebound and because of that pick and roll offense Georgia teken 8 s on the season 1 and three in the ACC theyve got an eightpoint lead here Duke same thing again here so you think just going to keep the ball in the middle of the floor and thats it I mean its just its its I know people are watching saying hey you just chop what do you you switch then you got dong go on a you got a filipowski on the guard filipowski steps out hits his second three hes got 19 and they just got to play this Duke team just got to play dont try to force feed filipowski just go out and play theres a block for Blakes on Kelly Duke runs roaches the catch and the finish and a foul camming crazy theres no one turn defense and the offense as quick as duke does great job of rebounding there finding a loose ball kicking it up the roach jayen Blakes is letting you know thats what hes in the game to do turn defense and the offense and sensing this sense of urgency there from this new crowd getting in this game as well crazies have been quiet prior to now now theyre in the game there the third foul on Debo Coleman who stays in the game remember Tara gapar has got four so hes been sitting for Georgia Tech and its a different looking lineup for Duke out of the timeout as well with young into the game as well as Blakes Dongo the stud freshman sets the screen for Sturman pipasi the pick filipowski Euro to the cup this is how the four guard line up needs to play it starts with the defensive end of the floor Applause its bow time get fired up tonight because Bojangles has your dinner covered southbound scratch made not one of these but one of these thats more home cooking for your money or as we like to say cha ching its bow time Im here Courtside watch this you have got to watch this replay folks watch this watch this oh watch me watch me watch me do 80 run for two in the last minute and just like that trailing by 10 this thing has changed they flipped it the defense flipped and we talked about it the pressure defense they created turnovers turned it in the offense got out in transition big fell Philip psky even showing you the Euro Step and if theyre going to play small the intensity level on the defensive end for the Blue Devils has to stay high at a high level how does Damon STM stabilize this thing he just needs to get back to doing what theyre doing you know you going to expect its not going to change middle ball screen pocket pass or George getting in and shooting the layup a bounce for Claude and now Reeves mcain then bite tough shot kaasi Reeves you see just using his size getting to the middle of the floor pivoting off two feet elevating over the smaller guard hes a tough guard he really is shoots the three puts it on the deck playing with a ton of confidence they had 14 in the first meeting knocked down four threes filipowski wide open hits love the decision by Blakes turned down a good shot for even a better R feeding a hot hand KY filipowski has got 24 with 12 12 minutes to go now Blakes is in a game and they get look at Duke now now theyre getting physical into the ball creating turnovers another one roach blocked by Raves but followed by Young and Duke lead look at the defense now talking and communicating look at look at the ball screen defense getting through the screens cant go under Dongo good cut Claude second effort draws a foul thats you see roach is a little bit upset with that roach knows he made a mistake going under that screen just turns the corner there sprays it in the corner extra pass there to Philip psky feet hot hand and this is what theyve done this is how they got back in this game pressuring the ball creating turnovers look at the Hustle by Ryan young cleaning up the loose ball and on this last possession then roach gets goes under the screen and it allows Joe DET Tech to kind of get into their options of reading the ball screen coverage and ended up drawing a foul Cloud ties this up at 56 with 1203 to go Jaylen Blakes is plus 12 and the Duke starting lineup tonight that small ball group was minus8 together yeah and that last run before the Duke timeout was a big part of that when they took the lead and the pressure has changed now and now you see them getting it done you see Blakes in the game and he knows his role in doing that I think roaches we talk about him on the offensive end his ability to pressure the ball when he wants to do that hes as good as any roach and thats a kick on Miles Kelly sends us to a timeout about 12 minutes to go this has

five of the last six and short Tech six of the last eight the cameras didnt come here for defense man they came to B some buckets what a game offense is heating up its been a good one still 1149 to go alongside Randolph childis on Mike Monaco this game produced by Will black and directed by K Caleb Waters McCain roach filipowski young Blakes still the five for John shy out of the timeout they run McCain into the midrange no Dongo the rebound good play coming out of timeout trying to get McCain Applause going they sag off a cloud so he goes hand off with Kelly in the corner Blakes dogging the top scorer for Georgia Tech Kelly tough floater great job there Blakes did a good job getting through the first ball screen unable to get through the second one Applause and Miles Kelly just saying the heck with those percentages Im Im making this pull up off the bounce hes got 10 Roach The Drive By on Kelly missed it Reaves the rebound George attack we told you is not one in this building since 2004 illegal screen on Dongo his third Dongo doesnt like to call and really good job by Blake heating up the basketball he comes in he knows his role on his team is to be a really good on ball Defender and he takes pride in it and his defensive pressure tonight is got the Blue Devils back in his game Proctor in for Blakes Proctor six points in 21 minutes hes got to be the guy I think to kind of step up and play with it the level his talent shows he has McCain too strong yeah John sh told us earlier this morning about tyres practor its time yeah Kelly risky pass its off of filipowski now youre seeing with that middle ball screen theyre so theyre playing for that pocket pass the guards are starting to turn the corner get a little a little Music Applause deeper turned over on the inbounds by Kelly roach weighs it in great job by Jeremy Ro there coming off his Music Defender creating a steel in running down and using his body to Shield off Dongo and finish the layup for second half turnovers plus a block all over the just these last few minutes for Georgia Tech George had a roll off offensive rebound for Claude in the fresh 20 moves it for Coleman sticks it great job we talked about it now because of that penetration of getting to the rim Duke bigs rotate over cant get off cant clean up the glass and we talked about it the best time to get a three is off an offensive rebound because if you dont have it right away youre catching the defense in the mmch young with a head fake and he scores thats really impressive by Young because hes usually a left shoulder guy going to his right hand that time he finished off the right shoulder jackets by two Georgia Tech trying to get into its offense here heres Kelly 10 points 10 rebounds scores another one theyre just putting them in it again we were going to say it till till Duke stops it but again another middle ball screen and Duke now doesnt know what to do they backed off guards and turned the corner when they rotate over theyve laid it off of the big or theyve kicked it out for three Proctor got free hits his first three tonight man what a game guys are making plays and making shots tyres Proctor scored just three points total his last two games Claude met at the rim by Philip palski and now roach is hobbled up court so he slows things down and Jeremy roach is grabbing at his right Applause leg duks two time captain senior starter veteran on this team whos been the most consistent player for the Blue Devils this season and has drawn so much praise from John shy hes grabbing out his right leg sh comes down to check on him lets hope hes okay its not something you want to see lets hope he can shake it off and get back out here so its Proctor McCain Foster young and filipowski illegal screen from Applause Young third foul on Ryan young Fishers have been consistent with that call making sure the bigs hold it ground Ryan young is he knows hes in the game to to be physical that time a little too physical only the third Duke turnover in this game 8 minutes to go second meeting between these teams this year Georgia Tech won by four on the flats in the ACC opener Nate George for three hes got that in his bag too confidence is growing by the day with Nate George and and hes such a really good facilitator those shots from three and midrange will be there for him anytime he wants filipowski answers back and forth we go wow sometimes when you makeing shots you think of just poor defense these guys are just making plays stepping up in big moments and making shots 27 for Kyle filipowski hes hit four of five from Deep Kelly has a response boy those Runners here in the second half have been huge you tell bigs in that situation to stay below their man and theyre doing that and now the adjustment was before we talked about the pocket pass theyre not stopping the ball now you see the difference in there J Tech defense he stopped the Applause ball Foster Kelly reaches in and commits a foul and thats three on Miles Kelly Damon stanm did not like that one bit as we trade threes at Cameron got a game of horse going on here Georgia TCH says knock one down from this spot

of the NBA Music Finals the competitions never been better this is just spectacular the stars have never been brighter thats our move womens college hoops on ESP youre looking live at a Duke cuddle that right now does not include Jeremy roach he went back to the locker room down the tunnel after we think this is is where it happened you saw him grabbing at his right knee he just comes down awkwardly on that right leg nothing he doesnt go down just comes back that same possession just grimison and lets hope he comes back just didnt look like much there but well heres a great sign he has just returned to the bench area seated beside Mark Mitchell whos out with a sprain knee look like cheing notes like hes trying to tell Mark Mitchell this how I HT mine and Marks like nah Proctor right out of the timeout ties it Baseline out of bounds it was just right to him second three in a row hes knocked down with roach out he needs to step up John shy told us last weekend we want Tyrese Proctor to be a cocky shooter yes Kelly uses Coleman and another Georgia Tech turnover now Proctors all always been a big time defender on ball Defender with his size and length but if he can pick up the slack on the offensive end of the floor I think this takes his Duke team to another level not just this game but finishing off the ACCC season weve had nine ties weve had 10 lead changes no leads been larger than 10 for either side in this game young high low denied by reeds Kelly accelerates in transition met by Young yeah I think miles would like to have that back hes been doing a really good job of shooting his float and everything else he just ran into young there and lost that battle filipowski wants it drives on Reeds kicks for Proctor hes got another the a sophomore is showing you starting to elevate his play traveling the call on gapar great job by Philip py getting in the paint finding his teammate who just knocked down two threes knocking now its third in a row Proctors getting it done on both ends of the floor when his teammates and his team need him the most John CH said there was last weekend stop teasing us they know what hes capable of guy who was projected as a lottery pick by many entering this year shat fake dish young tyes Brock just taking over this game he is spearheaded in 80 r and Damon stanmire needs a Music Applause timeout go back a month and a half tyres practor got injured in the first meeting against Georgia Tech have been coming off the bench since before tonight and now in this second half as you said hes taking over he has and that time hes knocked down three threes prior to that here you know that play there just Contin to be unselfish the only thing I would like for him to add to his game is doing it more off the bounce I think he settles too much hes got to catch a shoot threes defensively know hes Elite I think just putting pressure on you off the dribble finding teammates getting deeper in in the paint and his 65 Frame I think at that point makes him unguardable the message to him has been its time cple ofes quiet tonight foror I think saying is I dont care what your personality is off the court I need you vocal I need you aggressive I need you passionate and I need you to be a dude and I think hes showing us right now that he can be that dude five to go fivepoint game and George had it swirl out on him jackets need to stop big time get him a ball screen give him a ball screen around the filipowski screen Proctor keeps it Jacks another came up short battle on the boards Proctor young is foul filipowski kept it alive and Proctor made another good decision great job there another offensive rebound Proctor not settling like as I said Dont Settle behind the threepoint line you shot one you missed and got another chance getting the teeth of the defense and make plays for yourself yourself with your teammates he misses it just a great job by flip fighting for Applause it Youngs good on the first tomorrow afternoon womens basketball at triple header starts at noon pit and BC then its number 15 Louisville against Wake Forest then the afternoons capped off with Virginia and number 20

well hes got a double double 14 and 10 rebounds and more impressively hes been doing it off the dribble yep 16 foul on Duke so its George Claud Dango Reeves and Kelly the five for the jackets Kelly thought about a deep one yeah that was a mix up in the defense Claud with the shot clock winding down back to Kelly hawked by Foster who fouls Applause him miles using his experience he did it early in the first half getting the young back quarter Duke off the ground Caleb Foster chasing him here and you see him you know the defense is behind him hes trying to use his legs I dont even know if he was attempting to make the shot he just leaned his elbow in knew there was contact just Applause experience talk about the ups and downs shooting wise for the junior Miles Kelly from lurn Georgia coming off seven made thre on 15 threepoint tries Tuesday against nerd a and Miles Kelly has said the thing with me is I have a shortterm memory hes had a really good second half here at Cameron well as we get to the the me of the ACC season he is starting to play his best basketball look at Jeremy roach getting ready to Applause return good on the second of three as roach does return great sign

for Miles Kelly fivepoint Duke lead with the basketball with four minutes to go now Duke has more guys involved proor had his moments flips had his moments filipowski banging with Dongo backs it out for Proctor kicks McCain off the catch and shoot no weak side offensive rebound to Young Kelly might have just jumped too soon he did Young is doing the job that Mitchell always does just clean up the glass you dont have to run offense for him you just look at this move here finding ways brocker with a fallway that rolls off Tech with numbers George failing it knocks it down how about the Freshman Nate George Nate George been solid all night Applause long ball screen reads have been there hes knocked down a couple of Threes And now roach hobbles off to the bench and the officials blow it dead

from top to bottom theyre just no easy games roach sits he was on the court for 59 seconds after returning filipowski got his own Miss had it blocked but a tip is down for Philip palowski hes up to 29 and might have got poked in the face both guys caught one there Dongo got caught earlier on the first shot attempt with one of filipowski elbows just there kind of jumped into him he goes down and flip gets hit there by wasy coming down on this rebound here him swiping with that left elbow there catches filipowski across the face the officials head to the monitor I dont think theres anything on either of the two guys getting hit by that its two its too big of a game and its too good of a game all of those plays were unintentional in the play of the Music game well the put back for Philip psky we said has him up to 29 matching a career high now you see what we talked about early hes starting to dominate and thats what his talent hes capable of doing this night in and night out whether it equals 30 points or not but 20 plus points double digit rebounds and couple of assists is just something that he should set as his Benchmark every game see the note at the bottom first Duke player with 25 and 10 and consecutive games since Vernon Cary Jr back in 2020 just another NBA guy I mean they just one out the another here yeah two players who have done it backtoback games over the last 40 Seasons filipowski kry Zion a couple of times Marvin Bagley a couple of times Christian lner twice and Danny Ferry thats the company Kyle filipowski is in with his production these last two games and I dont think its over I think with his size and skill set its different I mean he doesnt have you dont need the athleticism at 7 feet with everything that he does because theres just not a lot of seeven footage to do what he does as far as being able to knock down threes he four five from behind the threepoint line here tonight does a really good job of creating angles for himself too lets see what the call is I dont think its much much hope is nothing lets get out play let these guys let the players decide this last 2 minutes 55 seconds s Damon STM last time an unranked team in the AP pole handed du consecutive losses was back in 1987 88 Georgia Tech is the last team to beat Duke back on December 2nd and theyre right here within this game if turnovers have hurt georia Tech at some point critical turnovers during the season and lets see if we can get this middle ball screen going and read the weak side with this lineup and they got Shooters in the corners now young in the drop coverage George gets it to go and the foul guard play is a must in the ACC in particular point guard play and I think yellow jackers you have got your point guard of the future with this young man Nate George the true freshman from Toronto who classified which means he very well should be a senior in high school right now loves the game of Steve Nash hes done so much work Distributing this year but tonight at Cameron playing here for the first time hes got a new season high with 17 points and hes made it a onepoint game this is a gym Where Stars Are Made not just for Duke for visiting teams as well gives you a confidence boost when you can come in here and get a w filipowski going to work on Tango Philip Kowski is fouled by Dongo and that is four on the star freshman for Georgia Tech its great job by Philip psky just trying to draw contact and get an angle I thought D go did a great job of moving his feet being physical these guys have been battling all night Philip hsky with the 29 Points five of nine at the free throw line by the way if youre looking for Miami Virginia Tech we will get get you to that as soon as we are done here still to follow and our triple header filipowski misses another one at the free throw line this season 71 thats about the only thing hes done wrong tonight is miss those free throws other than that hes been downright dominant splits twopoint game 219 to go one timeout remaining for Georgia Tech whatever they do here Jord DET Tex Becks offense is putting George in the ball screen they do it again short from three rebound Proctor they went under on him youd like to see Applause him put some pressure on the rim there but the way hes played you cant be upset about the look practor initiates with Jeremy roach the captain still sideline filipowski for young underneath mistake defensively there trying to double you never want to double when your offensive player is facing you he saw it coming Ryan young did a great job putting his head underneath the rim and one of the best passing bigs finds him in the paint hes got a season High 10 Kelly turns it over need to stop if youre George attch and Duke will be content to soak seconds big defensive possession here by the yellow jackets Kapowski creeps up sets the screen for proactor Pick and pop driveing on Dango the pass for young and hes swatted by B Dango jackets down four inside of a minute Coleman for Dango and now George Dango tough shot altered by filipowski got a foul got a foul if youre Georgia Tech two two possession game you got a foul bench is signaling for it they havent to this point so now they sag off I mean with 10 seconds separating the game clock in the shot clock yeah you had to you had to foul early there just not enough time time to wait they were trying to try and get the ball out of hands but theres just not enough time to pick and choose they were trying to get the ball to one of the Freshman a foul and Proctor just wouldnt give up the ball forcing you to put him at the line where hes a 77 free throw shooter and 85 for his career in two years with Duke well you think about the last capitle of Saturdays for Duke in the ACC taking some punches at Notre Dame yeah home today against George Tech and trying to get to the Finish Line Miles Kelly by the way is fouled out he was the one to commit the foul on practor exits after a double double of 16 and 11 to go along with four assists I think that was part of what they the strategy was too you didnt want to have to foul with him cuz he would foul out but as the time ran on it didnt matter anymore you had to commit the foul youd love to have him on the floor and his threepoint ability to make shots you need a couple threes here big free throw here making it a six sixpoint game Proctors good on both a massive second half Awakening for tyres practor has spurred dke sixpoint game 15 seconds to go George for Doo the finish with 103 left down to a fourpoint game and a timeout the final one for Damon STM and George Tech weve seen crazier things happen if youre Georgia Tech now you got to set your full court pressure ideally you want to get a 5sec count create some type of turnover its not enough time to trap try to do anything like that so if the ball gets in play you got to immediately foul doesnt matter who has it Blue Devils here you just want to get it in balance with one of your your guards one of your better free throw shooters Music can John shy talking things over in the huddle up by four with the 10 seconds to go again if youre just joining us theyre playing without one of their starters Mark Mitchell sprained his knee and dont think its anything serious different knee from his issues at the end of last season but unable to go duke has juggled lineups trying to find answers the guy whos been the constant really from Jump Street in this one is Kyle filipowski with 30 and 13 if you got to have one thats the one you want to have the most skilled SF footer in the country and hes been very good all year hes becoming dominant here as we meet as we as we are at the Midway point of the Season 30 and 13 Big Time numbers by big time Applause player and this teams been struggling I mean roach had segments and until Proctor got going no one else really got it going for him tonight McCain struggled Blake has done things defensively but hes put this team on his back on the offensive end of the floor and its its what you expect from your all americ flip side for George Tech what Damon stamy say to us this morning we got to finish gam they were in every game I mean we talk about it in the league play I dont care who youre playing and you just saw in this league even Louisville going into Miami and getting a win on the road is if you compete hard enough and you defend you give yourself a chance you dont know what your offense is going to bring every night for Georgia Tech you want a foul Foster got a foul they go into McCain and three and 1 half seconds come off before they foul a guy whos only missed twice the free throw line all season you see they cleared out that entire side of the floor allowing him to get oneonone coverage to get open and he did and no need to dribble there just hold it 10 seconds with dribble a clock out he didnt need to dribble it this is what they should have done the first time thought earlier when before he let the clock run out first couple of possessions ago and thats what it comes down to when you talk about and Damon STM says finishing games and learning to win as a young group in his first year at the helm you think back to three possessions in a row the George three good look but he missed it then they had a turnover on a Kelly pass and then Dongo a tough shot with his left hand yeah you know its one of those things where coaching changes are happen for a reason programs are down theyre not winning and learning how to win is a step its a process it isnt an overnight thing even in the transfer portal era ahead to Raves at the horn and that does it Duke survives Georgia Tech at Cameron and the winning streak is now eight for the Blue Devils great job there keeping it up Philip psky showed you why hes an AllAmerican but nothing for the yellow jackers to hold their hairs now theyve competed and play well 847
