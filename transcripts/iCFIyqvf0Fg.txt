And we are ready Georgia Tech and West Georgia a rematch from last seasons season opener Yellow Jackets a comfortable win as Moila true freshman wins the tip against Ken Shime And away we go Yellow Jackets in their sixth game of the season Cam Craft an early three Halfway down and out Put the put back from Dongo also short A couple of good looks for the Yellow Jackets on their opening possession Meanwhile for West Georgia as we said theyve won three straight four2 on the year This is the same starting lineup they used Friday night Josh Smith getting his second start Freddy Hardawig their normal starting guard is out with an ankle injury Hes expecting to come off the bench though possibly this afternoon The threepointer gets West Georgia started Smith can really fill it up He had a 26point outing a couple weeks ago Uh just just coming off the bench uh in that effort Now hes his second consecutive start Same starting lineup for the Yellow Jackets each of the last five games Early turnover and after that threepointer from Josh Smith Georgia with the basketball Shelton Williams tried their leading scoreer buries a three Now he does most of his damage while inside the paint but hes really worked on his shooting in the offseason He can stretch the floor Yeah hes only taken six three point shots this year but now hes hit four of them Kesi Reeves fifthear senior Cash from the elbow Tough shot One dribble he just elevated above the defender High release for the senior Hes had a great year Hes you know hit some big shots Percentages are not up where he wants them but hes hit some timely buckets in Georgia Techs wins this season Williams driving gives it off to Colton Griffin his fourth year at West Georgia the longest tenure Wolf Smith looking for G instead Hes blocked from behind by Mustaf Mustaf at the point for Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets still trying to figure that position out here in the first month of the season Kesi Ree steps into a three knocks it down Nice job holding the follow through Unselfish play from the interior The inside out three They should have a lot of success They can collapse the defense and kick out that inside out attack today Chaz Lulus a transfer from San Diego takes his first shot And we got a foul coming here against Kenneth Chime An offensive foul against the Wolves And for West Georgia John you look at some of their numbers this year They lead the Atlantic Sun in threepoint shooting but they dont take many threes Like you mentioned theyve relied pretty heavily on Shelton Williams to ride him A throw up towards Mo Seal It might be an alleyoop thought from Jaden Mustaf Instead its a turnover and a three from Josh Smith A long board Reeves has got it Georgia did a nice job in transition defense stopping the ball protecting the paint Donko baseline drive and its knocked out of bounds by Colton Griffin So John were about 3 minutes into this one What are your keys tonight for both sides Well I think for West Georgia early offensive attack uh weve seen a couple threes already from the Wolves If they can find shooters in transition they shoot at a high percentage when their feet are set Team rebounding is going to be crucial for the Wolves And then Georgia Tech theyve got to defend that three Theyve already given up two in this one Jime with the hook Hes got it A red shirt freshman from Nigeria out of the Macaulay school in Chattanooga Tennessee He red shirted last year as craft fade away jumper wont go Cila with the size but cant finish Another threepoint shot That ones way off the mark there from Colton Griffin One of the questions for West Georgia coming in is how can they handle Georgia Tech size We got another foul coming here on Chime and John Thats two early fouls on the West Georgia fiveman Yeah that certainly hurts them Two fouls Chime will go to the bench But here you see uh interior attack Great hands by Williams Dryen Hes also going to have to be conscious of not picking up fouls now with Chime Savile with two Uh Dongo and Cila one of them can be effective Whoever draws the smaller defender right now looks like Dongo has got the size advantage as Mustaf ready to inbound cheering Floated into Lamar Washington whos checked in off the bench and he lays it in Lamar Washington transfer from Pacific a senior He had a tough night in that win over Georgia Southern Georgia Tech needs him to get to where they want to go this year That was a nice ISO play off the baseline out of bounds They isolated Lulus and just posted him up High percentage shot Anytime a shot goes up on the defensive end theres a high percentage chance that Moa gets the rebound Thats two for him laughter Guy Fleming wing three off the mark Dango offensive board Theres two Yeah both Cila and Dongo will put a ton of pressure on the Wolves to box out keep them off the glass Cila averaging a double double as a freshman 11 points 10 boards on the season per game And while West Georgia they have faced a couple of power five teams including Nebraska and top 20 UCLA they have not seen two big men on one power four roster like what theyre going to face against CILA and Dongo today No youre right about that You know they had UCLA in a fivepoint game at the half Played them really tough on the road at Poly Pavilion And thatll be goending Another couple of points for Bango And thatll take us to our first timeout Yellow Jackets an 112 run as they take their first lead of the afternoon Their second year in division one but you can see three NCAA Division 2 tournament appearances in their final four years before moving up to Division One last year But checking in for Georgia Tech is Eric Chatfield Jr Did not play in either of the last two games for Georgia Tech but hes taken the floor here early in the first half Also wins Malcolm Noel with the ball now for West Georgia and nearly throws it away Georgia Tech basketball Last touch by Daniel Tech will have a chance to capitalize Pton Marshall Dongo will work the high post Yeah Marshall and Dongo half of that front court quartet if you will with Cole Kiraak and then Moila whos just headed to the bench Shatfield zips it inside Marshall cant handle the pass and a break for West Georgia Fed back Daniel goes up and itll go to the line Theyre going to get Dongo Nice pace there by the Wolves uh forcing the turnover Defense to offensive transition Get out and the pitch ahead Here we see the forced turnover One pass two dribbles three and theyre going to the line Nice job getting down the court trying to make Georgia Tech pay for the turnover Daniel spent last season the last two seasons in fact at Austin Beach transferring to West Georgia as Xavier Sheag comes in Colton Griffin to the bench And we talked about the double double that cheering Shelton Williams Dryden put up Javar Daniel He had 10 and 11 in that Friday night win over USC Upstate as well Yeah he brings uh an element of rim protection too just with his wingspan Yeah Daniel third in the Atlantic Sun in blocks early on in the year Dongo underneath going up against Daniel Cant finish and will Noel push pace Josh Smith with a mismatch on Marshall Find some space Cant hit the three and a rebound for a Kai Fleming True freshman out of Marietta Georgia Jonesboro High School by way of OT Hangs late pass Marshall spins in Tied up underneath and before the balls knocked loose hes fouled Nice job Strong hands by Pton Marshall putting the foul on Shego Just kind of ripped right through the arm of Shego Really powerful hands Very easily could have been deflected and lost it there Takes the foul So Marshall at the free throw line where hes seven of nine this year We talked about it earlier but the front court for Georgia Tech the front quartet if you will Payton Marshall listed third there coming off the bench at 7 300 lb I mean those are a lot of quality options for Damon Statamire And that will serve them well come ACC schedule play Theyre going to need size up front and got to play fresh A lot of the ACC teams played fast and they got a nice rotation Marshall didnt play too much on Tuesday night that win over Georgia Southern a season low just 11 minutes But part of that was how effective by Dongo was and Moila as well and one Shelton Williams tried You see right there why hes preeason all a son He just finds a way Hes a scoring machine inside at 12 ft Big hands big shoulders shooting over the smaller defender Coach Moore does a nice job isolating him in scoring situations An offensive rebound for West Georgia They cant take advantage But to your point with Shelton Williams right third in the Atlantic Sun last year in scoring Hes averaging 18 again this year The difference is hes now at the four and not the five as Marshalls going to go to the line for a couple more And he already dropped a triple today Hes added an element to his game where he can stretch the floor The pick and pop trail three Hes looks like he has a lot of confidence this year in shooting that shot shooting it at a high percentage Coach Moore described him as our Charles Barkley Its nice to have a Chuck Barkley on your team You know hes got the round mound of rebound especially once you know against a guy like Marshall right here the 300 pounder youre going to need some muscle to bang him around Second free throw coming for the sophomore out of Kell High School by way of OTE And a rebound there for Brady Hardawig He did not play Friday night with a bum ankle but he is back out on the floor today wearing number one in blue Marshalls left two points at the free throw line He was shooting 78 coming into the night Yeah that led the team Noel tries a three Got it and West Georgia back in front Now that was one of the keys to the game for Georgia Tech locating shooters And right there they got caught standing still Thats where West Georgia can be effective They can move the ball get good player movement ball movement spacing and let their offense work for them Theyll get SHOTS AND CAM CRAFT RISING through the lane A pretty cut Payton Marshall finds him Flush huh I mean is that regulation right there Damn Craft two hand bang down the middle I love it He can bounce a little bit Hes just a shooter He just goes up and flushes it Yes he does And its funny you see Payton Marshall there with the assist You know that was something I think cheering that Damon Statamire felt like was underappreciated by Marshalls You see that three from Malcolm Noel Thats his first threepointer of the year Yeah that was a nice inside out three but Cam Craft had something for that Were not sleeping on your craft I like it Well he was quiet again against Georgia Southern Just nine minutes played but coach Adamar said not an indictment on him They just struggled getting him in good positions as Marshall is blocked from behind by Daniel Noel again Oh yeah there it is Early offense find the shooter Its now four threes for West Georgia And Marshall cant handle the offensive rebound And thatll bring us to a break Well the West Georgia Wolves shooting over 40 this season from three Theyre at 50 in the early going tonight One more look behind Daniel smothering Payton Marshall Noel on the other end percent on those threepoint tries music but threepoint rate again thanks to Ken Pom Thats a number that tells you how often are you taking threes as opposed to twos Less than 30 of their shots have been threepoint rates Thats among the lowest in all division one basketball Yeah And I think the story behind that is you got a guy like Williams Dryden youre going to play through him A lot of his damage is done on the interior They make a concerted effort to get high quality shots on every possession And Daniel got a high quality shot and left it short Georgia Tech meanwhile one of five from threepoint land Craft weaving in lays over to Cela Cant finish it and then it drops Thats where Cila does his damage Long arms can finish both left and right And hes an animal Plays with a high motor always attacking the Wolves shooting 47 from the field on the season So you know going back to high percentage shots delivered on the offensive tack You mentioned that coach Moore coached at St Bonaventure under Mark Schmidt whos had a lot of success in the A10 and a tough job Bonnies is a tough job and and they did it exactly the way West Georgia is doing it Recruiting and high quality offense That offensive rebound from Shelton Williams dried it An interesting match up too You mentioned how you know how high the percentage are that West Georgia is shooting this year Georgia Tech is among the top 10 nationally in defending opponent shots Lowest field goal percentage allowed Yeah their defense has been just awesome I mean theyre trying to go four uh four0 on the home court today and theyre going to win on the defensive end for sure if they get it done down the left side Shagg tremendous athlete And Cilas got another rebound Thats now five for him already And Mustaf travels Fourth turnover for Georgia Tech so far today West Georgia throwing fresh bodies Three substitutions come in Reeves comes in for the Yellow Jackets Williams Dryen the leading scorer on the floor right now with seven points Seems like he can score on anyone I mean youre looking at Bongo and Cila one of the better front lines in the ACC And Williams Dry just finds a way to put the ball in the hole Originally from Milwaukee he spent a couple years at Milwaukee Tech a junior college where they won a national championship Now in his second year at West Georgia Williams Dryden again finds space on Dongo He hits the three level score He just put Dongo on his heels and uh hes a superior athlete and hes chiseled and he just needs a little bit of space cuz hes got the high release got great elevation on the shot Lot of passes on the perimeter here for Georgia Tech recently Reeves a long tough two and he drills it Again when Georgia Tech needs a bucket this season the senior has stepped up That was a huge shot right there Just towed the line Would have had three but a deep two for Reeves His third year at Georgia Tech as Williams Dryen tries to take on Dongo and that falls Hes got tremendous touch Yeah Georgia Techs having problems right now on that matchup may have to switch uh throw a little zone keep this West Georgia team off balance if they cant find an answer for Williams Dryen 11 points for Williams Dryen Reeves looking for an alley and thats swatted down by Javar Daniel Transition three Lulless cant hit it Mustaf with the rebound Here comes Mustaf and he will draw the foul before taking the shot Thats Mustaf where hes at his strongest playing downhill in transition Hes one of the better Yellow Jackets going off the bounce putting fouls on opponents Washington will give Mustaf a break Must another guy rebounds from the guard position too I mean hes playing point guard whos averaging four rebounds per game so hes a do it all guy And while Georgia Techs point guards have struggled to take care of the ball at times this year you cant question their physicality between Mustaf and Lamar Washington as Dongo lines up a three Crafts got the offensive rebound right back up Thats an easy two on the offensive glass Craft doing damage on the interior Weve seen him do damage uh from beyond the arc this season but hes got two buckets big buckets inside the paint Spent last year at Miami of Ohio where he shot over 40 from three top 15 nationally Williams tried and spins and cant lay it in Draft hit five triples in the jacket sole loss of the season at UG Uh one of the better shooters Again you said the transfer from Miami Ohio Little heat check When I ask Style about that he mentioned he felt like Crafts success at UG was built upon his defensive effort he had against Southeastern Louisiana That was one of the ways they got him going Hoping to see some more of that today from Hes drawn a tough assignment here on Williams Dryen Yeah it looks like theyre switching everything on the perimeter Trident with the left No screaming And another rebound for Lamar Washington Swings it outside Reeves Yes Credit Washington the assist That was a great find Driving right Little hook pass behind the action Finds his teammate wide open for three Jackets Wolves kned up at 24 Now takes a leading score for Reeves on the season Already in double figures today Josh Smith gets Reeves in the air penetrates long board and Smiths got his own miss up again There it is Hes got a knack for scoring the basketball Hes a guy that can go off the bounce Hes really good going to his right picking up fouls Hes got threepoint range And West Georgia clinging to a twopoint lead 624 remaining in the first half Jackets will regroup Well be back on ACC Network Georgia Tech trailing by two on Kremans court music in Atlanta Yeah hes getting his first rest of the day Uh shoots from the field at a high percentage Hes dropped a triple today and then four rebounds to go with it Hes just a gamer He shows up you know what youre going to get And a Kai Fleming out of the timeout Good move Well go to the line Kai one of the better looking freshman early on this season across the entire ACC Hes hes a guy thats scoring almost double figures just short of uh hes got nine points per game and limited minutes played and hes a guy that you see the minutes creeping up each game hes out there Theres more confidence from coach startm to play the freshman Fleming Thats the third foul on Sheime by the way So hell head back to the bench Drops his head Javar Daniels going to have to step up these next six plus minutes for West Georgia Hits the second Georgia Tech now three of six Hold on Theyve changed the foul call on that Theyre actually going to say it was on Shes only two on Sheime That helps cuz she this season first in the ANO in blocks with 14 and he had five blocks against UCLA Thats a big break for West Georgia Meanwhile Moil picks up his first right there This Georgia Tech teams at its best offensively when they manufactured here on the defensive side of the ball And thus far tonight Georgia Tech zero points off turnovers force They havent been able to force any turnovers They havent scored any on the fast break either Yeah 50 West Georgia leading the fast break points 70 West Georgia leads on points off of turnovers Georgia Tech strength has been points in the paint Here we see loose ball Bodies down Getting after it Cila not afraid to get dirty down there West Georgia doing a nice job of coming in Theyre forcing the jump ball So its Wolves basketball having trouble getting it in Theres Daniel Good contest from Cila And Lamar Washington secures it for the Yellow Jackets Not only does Cal the freshman give you a double double every night hes a you know lunch pale type of guy Hes got floor burns on his knees after every game Hes on the floor Hes hustling Hes blocking shots One of the better freshman in the ACC this year Second chance opportunity for Georgia Tech Reeves has 10 He floats it down to Cale with three Back out Reeves from distance wont drop Loose ball on the floor and Josh Smiths got it for West Georgia Dangerous pass but Chaz Lulas has got it Which opponent can win those 5050 balls Wy thats where the separation in this game will be created team that hustles get an offensive rebound force a turnover get those live ball steals Speaking of a live ball steal right there created by Cam Craft West Georgia wanted the foul call instead Washington leaning into the lane What a move with the left and a little English on it Switched it right to left Took off on the right side of the basket Finished on the way down You said it with the English Spun it up there Beautiful Georgia Tech back in front West George has mixed six of their last seven shots Long three Lulis off the mark Reeves saw a little daylight Flipped to Cila He cant finish from point blank There was a beautiful pass by Reeves Drew the defender Cila just couldnt finish Rhythm three and Chicago rattles it in You said it rhythm three And what is that Its you know feet are set theres spacing youve got time to gather Thats why West Georgia shoots 41 from beyond the arc They take high percentage shots on every possession Thats just the second threepoint attempt for Chicago this year Georgia Tech reverses floor Fleming baseline and itll stay with Georgia Tech in six seconds to shoot So well step aside West Georgia still with the lead as we approach halftime in Midtown Atlanta The Wolves their minds on a historic win Long way to go on this Sunday afternoon inside McCamus Pavilion A big transfer edition from UT Martin You saw his numbers briefly He shot close to 40 from three last year He is out dayto day with an upper body injury When they get him back theyre going to be even more dangerous cuz hes a 67 stretch forward Yeah And averaging you know just shy of eight points per game and 24 starts So valuable experience sitting out on the bench right now for West Georgia Theyll be happy when they get him back The Wolves without him though today theyve got a twopoint lead And no more Payton Marshall flushes it on the pass from Rust Were tied at 29 Coach Stomire drew up a nice one coming out of that dead ball situation Mustaf gets the assist Williams Dryen already with 11 points four in blue They get it back to him with 12 to shoot able to check us to nine penetration BUT THROUGH THE BACK DOOR OH AND Daniel lost control of it Nobodys getting him in the basket Couldnt finish That was automatic too If he could have uh just regrouped and put it in the bucket Georgia Tech a nice job doing the law pass right now Theyre clearing the weak side eliminating all help defense and throwing the ball high towards the rim with nice touch no one to come from the backside defensively Thats going to be something Georgia Tech has to lean on throughout the season even against ACC opponents Theyre going to have an advantage most nights with their depth and their size And a little bit of a fall from Josh Smith looking for a foul call instead Crab driving goes up No Dongo follows back with the offensive rebound Under two to play in the first half a twopoint lead for Georgia Tech Craft flashes open off the window He called Bank right Yes the Wool Yeah thats a generous give Well take it off the glass Banks open but a penetrating pass right into the heart of the defense The Wolves have been good tonight not letting the ball into the high post But you got to give Craft credit He made a nice cut right across the paint and the kiss A 6 run for Georgia Tech Malcolm Noel His three wont go but Williams Dryen soarses in for the offensive rebound Short corner jumper He can knock that down Yeah Bs got to get a hand on that You know although he gets and secures the offensive rebound Georgia Tech slow to recover And that was an easy 10ft baseline jumper Dongo on Williams Dryen attacks Daniel with the help Knocks it free Josh Smith in the left wing It will not drop Rust steps on the accelerator An acrobatic finish again in transition Noel bullseye We see it Transition threes That was a key to the game Georgia Tech cheering and applause is going to have to defend the three in transition That early offense again it was a turnover that the Wolves forced now have 10 points off of turnovers today and Georgia Tech has not been able to force a turnover Zero points off turnovers in this one Oh and another turnover with the moving screen Momentum has shifted West Georgia with a onepoint lead here 21 seconds to play in the first half Wy a different Wolves team than we saw a year ago That much is for sure So we got a timeout ACC home court and youre winning against an instate program But I think I like them get something going to the basket or an isolation with Williams Dryen And here he is Williams Dryen in the far corner Its Lulis with it to Williams Dry and he jacks a three No Mustaf heave And that will end the first half West Georgia with the lead after 20 minutes here in Midtown Atlanta Just their second year as a division one Big win for his program Georgia Tech with the basketball as we get underway here in the second half Jaden Mustaf point for the Yellow Jackets And in that locker room for Damon Statamire and Georgia Tech what do you think his message was uh continue to throw the ball inside but I think transition defense will throw it inside unless Crafts open for a three then kick it to Craft and let him bomb away That was a nice start right there for the Jackets They they went into the dongo I mean they did throw it inside but second half of that play they find Craft the shooter I think you got to locate shooters in transition West Georgia knocked down six triples in the first half there Just the extra pass by Mustaf Another assist and Craft getting after it Thats what hes known for shooting the three He had a couple of buckets early in the game finishing at the basket Well and to your point too John I mean you did get that paint touch on that possession That was something that coach Datamar was disappointed he did not see more of in those final 10 minutes against Georgia that even if youre not getting the shot up from the paint youve got to get it in there when youve got guys like MoSila and Bongo as CILA creates a turnover there Yeah Georgia Tech took uh you know 35 shots in the first half or 34 shots in the first half 12 of those shots were taken by the front line So maybe a more conservative effort to throw it in the paint They are at a 20 to4 advantage on paint points coming into the second half And it was a 22 to4 advantage in that second half against Georgia Southern when they rallied to win Craft just inside the free throw line His touch is on to begin second half So good things happen while you throw it inside Defense has to you know give some help for Dongo and then you create a poor closeout situation on Craft who just bangs a triple and hes allowed to take the poor close out and make a play in the paint Coach Satomire described those as horse shots and he got them wide open Georgia Tech needs some more of those Offbalance too But Chaz Lulis bangs it Nice job probing the defense Found the space And let me tell you something for Chaz Lulis In that win over Tennessee Tech on Tuesday he had 19 points John Since then he had not scored in the last three halves He had really been struggling That was big to see him see the ball go through the hoop Chime with the rebound Hes been limited by foul trouble so far tonight And Williams riding just a corner Thats a tough assignment for Dongo uh you know guarding 23 feet from the basket Dribble containment the lateral movement against the much stronger and quicker Williams Dryen 15 points on 12 shots for Williams Dryen Craft will go to the line applause Concerted effort to get Cam Craft involved That was something coach Datamire wanted to make an emphasis on this afternoon is getting him back in the offense Meanwhile Williams Dryen hes an emphasis almost every possession Yeah absolutely especially when youre switching sides of the court on a ball reversal He gets the rip through Uh hes going to be at the advantage whether its Dongo or Caler guarding him out on the perimeter So it was nicely executed And Craft gets fouled shooting a three because hes mixed it up today Hes finished inside Hes gone off the bounce Hes knocked down a couple triples Hes having a good game These are his first free throws of the season And for Craft weve talked about it a couple of times but originally from Chicago his father was a college baseball player or college basketball player rather and baseball player but he was a big man down low and he actually taught Cam Craft his shot So he got a shooting stroke from a a guy who couldnt shoot the three At least did it Long three applause and cheering and a foul here on the floor Going to be on Mo C You know when I played I I didnt have a threepoint shot So I really couldnt follow like the logic behind what you were saying Wy because I just never been in that scenario of what what makes a great shooter as youre coming up through the ranks They laughter they they paired you with the wrong guy today then John cuz I cant help you Fed down low CHIME IS BLOCKED by Dongo Millie did a split on the way down Craft got Williams Trident in the air AND THE PUT BACK FROM DONO Craft with a nice pass off the glass Dono finishes it just like they drew it up Georgia Tech matches its largest lead of the day Ball tapped loose Here comes Mustaf Hell take it in off the glass He gets it the ball Tempo and pace of play starts on the defensive side of the ball They win the 5050 ball Georgia Tech playing with a little sense of urgency early on in the second half Theyve outscored West Georgia 11 to4 in this second half 6 in the last minute And a foul on Kaci Reeves Williams tried and shooting Come on Coen Senior Tough foul Stop the momentum Jackets up six Were four minutes into the second half Yellow Jackets in control early in the second half Today second half action alone he has seven points just in four minutes of second half play Gives him 13 in the game And the Wolves will have to you know Id say find him in in transition you know find them rotating out of those double teams Thats what Georgia Tes doing Theyre throwing it into Calop and Dongo And theyre forcing some poor throws Williams Dryen one for two at the line Dongo the upper classman gets credit for that rebound Washington feathers it inside to Dongo who polishes it off with the left Largest lead of the afternoon for Georgia Tech And the ability of Dongo to catch on the move in traffic with the left hand and finish So skilled Aggressive cut from Colton Griffin and off the top of the class His first points today Cila up Hell go to the line right now Pace of play is picking up here Well take a look at the Jackets threading the needle Washington the dongo Nice catch and finish And then boom right back at you No time to rest on your heels Georgia Tech The Wolves coming right back down the heart of the defense in the paint We saw Zela showcase his shooting stroke against Georgia Southern on Tuesday John that might have been the biggest shot of the night that three he hit in the corner And you know Coach Dimemer was asked about that after the game what his thoughts were when Cila put the shot up He said Did I want him to show it Heck no But it went in Well take it And he did give CIA some credit saying he didnt hesitate There wasnt a second thought about it He cut it loose He works on it Its just not something were super comfortable on doing on a regular basis And it is the highest percentage three in the game the corner three Little bit of a finger roll there from Chaz Lul Had his season cut short last year by injury in mid November and transferring from San Diego to West Georgia Originally out of Detroit then all over So hes a playmaker Hes averaging four and a half assists per game Thats good for fifth in the entire Ace Sun this screaming season Washington to Fleming who drives inside Hes trapped underneath Washington has to hoist a three Josh Smith on the other end Oh short Pace is picking up John Yeah Smith hasnt been able to get it going tonight Tim Craft Oh it looked true A bit too strong And a live ball turnover Four one Williams dried him Hes been doing that for a long time What a finish High off the glass with the left hand That Fleming right there Flemings a leaper Put it right down in his face So the Wolves have whittleled it down to three Fleming short corner jumper The tap in from Cila and Josh Smiths got it Still one on five Yeah On the OTHER WAY gets it Josh Smith Looking like Jay Smoo out there man Runaway train one on five legit He went through the entire Georgia Tech defense was running after him What a finish just changed gears and exploded with the left hand Dongo on Williams Dryen Double team CEO the big the big pass He couldnt get it to go but he does draw the foul Nice pass from Dongo on the inside But lets take another look 1 2 3 4 five Yellow Jackets trying to hunt him down Lefty high off the glass Smith manufacturing his own offense Coach Moore giving Ron Groover his opinion of the foul call Meanwhile CE misses the first free throw West Georgia substitution number 12 Smith will get a breather Hes got seven points three assists to go along with it and three rebounds as well And Eric Baldesari has come in Red shirt freshman from Lancaster Pennsylvania First time he has taken the floor tonight Sila hits the second Georgia Tech at the free throw line today Now eight of 13 Williams Dryen spins lost control of the basketball Reeves dives for it Three yellow jackets all over Williams Dryen and its a jump ball So West Georgia will retain possession A nice job by Reeves collapsing defensively Dry Williams Drys had success on those isolation plays on the ball reversal just ripping it and going lefts Reeves was there with great help defense for the Yellow Jackets Long pass into Daniel Five to shoot Noels got to go and ripped away by Reeves The Inai Fleming Alioop denied by Williams Dryen screaming What a defensive stand by West Georgia Now the chance to tie it and oo Daniel goes down hard He does draw the foul on CEO Yeah he hit the ground hard but I think its just the momentum of the play Cila got him not flagrant nothing dirty there but it certainly hit the court hard on the way down So Daniel has two points in the game Hes two of two from the free throw line 17 minutes of play today cheering Heres the first free throw West Georgia substitution number three substitution number five Payton Marshall coming in for CILA and Xavier Chicago replaces Colton Griffin for West Georgia and we are tied again for the sixth time Mustaf finds some oxygen and buries it Oh sorry This first look Mustaf Oh a piouette in the paint Pace of play picking up Thats going to favor Mustafs game Marshall got a clean block West Georgia with it Chicago high jumper cheering Good hands by Basari Marshall flashes open on Daniel spins goes up and he gets the foul call So Payton Marshall will head to the line Still no separation between Georgia Tech and West Georgia Yellow Jackets trying to hang on here at home where you can compete at the division one level but you cannot participate in the postseason Yeah nice location the campus for recruiting uh fertile recruiting grounds here in Georgia Uh and you know the transfers whether its SEC ACC that whole Southeast region you know the high majors mid majors theyre not getting playing time They could look at a West Georgia You know its located close to Atlanta recruiting main airport hub Uh so I like you know how theyre set up to recruit the Southeast whether its transfers or the high school players that have just fallen through the cracks and fertile grounds here in Georgia But a win over Georgia Tech would go a long way adding to that recruiting pitch Williams tried in the offensive rebound rips it down and he earns a trip to the foul line Payton Marshall called for the foul Washington Oh big part Theyre going to get Washington on it Smiths been quiet in this one Two points just one of three from the field Here we have some action Push in the back cheering Talk about the advantage that Georgia Tech has in the paint John where theyre outscoring West Georgia by 18 points The Wolves have made up for that in the points off turnovers and the fast break cheering Georgia Tech is doing a nice job defending the three this half West Georgia 0 for three from beyond the arc They had six triples in the first half Reeves straight away It goes Kesi Reeves Three big points for Reeves Thats the first bucket hes had since 7 minutes remaining in the first half Georgia Tech up seven now I believe thats their largest lead in this one Its been back and forth Noel Hes been hot from three Gives it off to Josh Smith Washington goes for the steel lunges for it and itll be Georgia Tech basketball And coach Kell Miller is contending that it went off of Josh Smiths foot Yep And coach Moore wants to challenge it New rule in college basketball This is a play you can challenge And out of their challenge two Marshall down low bangs goes up Theres two and its a ninepoint advantage for Georgia Tech The intent of Georgia Tech to throw it inside the paint in the interior coming out of those dead ball situations Coach Stomire has drawn up some nice plays coming out of timeouts today Williams Dryen is fouled 14 Thats now six fouls on Georgia Tech here John So the rest of the way West Georgia shooting free throws Georgia Tech foul trouble Cila has three Reeds two and Washington two So Sila is the one that has to just under 10 to play Hes got to be careful Hes actually on the bench right now The Wolves of their last four from the field And a foul called here on Jaden Mustaf Well theyll have a chance to get to the free throw line here now John despite struggling from the floor so far Sometimes when youre in a slump thats where you can find the groove right here at the stripe cheering Missed the front end of the one and one She with the rebound though for the Wolves They needed that Yeah Williams dried just two of six now from the free throw line He was 83 from the line coming into tonight One of the better free throw shooters on the team You could see him practicing his stroke midplay a moment ago And a three for Chaz Lulas And now Ken Shime reaching up towards his eyes and hes got his and he was showing that he had been elbowed and he nearly elbowed Ron Guber right in the chops And we might have a review for a flagrant foul here yet Were going to take a look at it I believe theyll be looking at Marshall Players safe Hes making a point Didnt think like he was doing anything too wrong Either way Kenneth Shime is going to be at the free throw line here where hes just four of nine on the season But this is quite an opportunity here for West Georgia Theyve already got three points on this possession applause Sheen is a guy that red shirted last year playing meaningful meaningful cheering minutes for the Wolves early on this season He had five blocks at UCLA early this year Seven points at Nebraska So hes having an opportunity to play against some of the heavyweights in high major college basketball UCLA Georgia Tech Nebraska and hes performing well And coach Moore was very deliberate about that choice to red shirt as the Wolves nearly had a back court violation as Gay lost the handle on it But he felt like guys like Kenneth Chime and others like Eric Baldesari as well as Xavier She were guys who could help them last year but with no postseason available they didnt want to burn one year of eligibility so they red shirt And were not getting to look at Hardwig much because hes coming off an injury as well Hes had some success early on this season too cheering So a turnover on Georgia Tech That is the fourth of the half for the Yellow Jackets 12th of the game And now the Yellow Jackets bringing in their bigs again Dango and Caleum West Georgia in this game has converted 12 points off Georgia Techs turnovers Lets see if they can do it again here Holton Griffin gives it off to Lulus Ca playing with three fouls for Georgia Tech Griffins got to get it up at the end of the clock Just got rid of it Halfway down an out by Dongo with the rebound Thats now a double double for Dongo Craft a three Georgia Techs really been locking in defensively in the second half Wolves are seven of 16 from the field Georgia Tech 25 field percentage defense here after the intermission Another missed three Dongo the extra pass the side and theres Moila Thats one thing you got to love about Bongo the unselfish play Always helping his teammates Preseason second team all ACC selection Hes already got good rapport with the freshman seal out there You mentioned the 20 and 10 that he put up against Georgia Southern on Tuesday night He also led the Yellow Jackets in assists with four Yeah hes bringing up the ball right here leading the break and then right there four four out one in Those lob passes are there all day Craft cuts into the lane and hell get continue quick and one can craft with 15 for the Yellow Jackets and the lead is up to nine Hes crafty and the Yellow Jackets showing some thunder as well by Dongo to Mosila and Georgia Tech their largest lead of the night But only 12 with a little over seven minutes left to go here in the second half and and more importantly only four here in the second half Yeah if youre not giving it to the other team you have more opportunities to score And right now Georgia Tech 11 of 17 from the field in the second half Thats 64 and theyve gotten to the line 10 times as well So theyre just you know take care of the basketball Youre going to get more opportunities to score and Georgia Techs taking advantage of that Carving in Theres Josh Smith Thats a big answer for West Georgia They hadnt scored in over two minutes Hes really tough going to his right with a little momentum Hes got great size and athleticism Can finish mathematically in the paint Mustaf got a little contact there Turnover We jenst chance know as Colton Griffin rose up but Chime ends up with it Now Lulas tries a three Oh it wont drop and it is still with West George as the Yellow Jackets cannot secure the rebound Thats the value of just hustling and going after the offensive rebound Griffin got in on the action just enough to tip the ball put some spin on it Georgia Tech could not secure it Hustle play by Griffin Long inbound to Williams Dryen Hes got 19 points and eight rebounds applause And a foul called here against Mustaf Thats going to be three on the sophomore And Josh Smith a little slow getting up Gets some help from his teammates Washington in Mustaf out Hes got five rebounds five assists to go along with his six points So balanced attack by Mustaf today Josh So Josh Smith now in his first year at West Georgia Spent last season at NC Central before that playing some junior college ball in Kansas Weve talked about that Pretty good league They actually played a prep year at OT before going to junior college The Skills Factory cheering And before that he played in Culver City California after beginning his high school career in Chicago So he has been a lot of different places Yeah And he could fill it up I mean November 14th against the Citadel he went nine of 15 from the floor Three triples for 27 points in that one Just one for two at the free throw line there Lulus went down That created a five on four situation and Moila with two Hes now got nine points and seven rebounds Cila trying to create THE TURNOVER HES GOT IT AND HES GOT THE LUNCH CODES Moila from the Raptors cheering And for the first time tonight weve got a double digit lead at favor Georgia Tech Step back Smith No seal of the rebound Georgia Tech beginning to seize control Washington downhill and he is fouled One more look at this play by Mo See right there nose for the basketball and one dribble two dribbles from half court He creates space and separation The outstanding fab freshman for the Yellow Jackets getting it done Hes got 11 points eight boards Hes averaging a double double on the season coming into this one So hes knocking on the door again Wy two more two more rebounds hell be there Like by Dongo he is also from Sagal In fact their towns just 70 m apart and I think thats one of the reasons Moila felt comfortable at Georgia Tech In fact he said so having Bongo here in their relationship their familiarity Yeah I think Georgia Tech as well Just being in a a global city a global school international students all over the resources its a great institute to recruit to for coach Dontomire and his staff You can see by those numbers its been a global type impact for Moila in his first month of college basketball Williams Trident with the runner James Dryen now with 21 in this game Nine of 14 from the field He has eight rebounds Dongo thought about a three and put it ON THE DECK OH YOURE STEPPED TO CEO THAT was beautiful Big time play right there by Dongo The change of pace Finds his teammate wide open Yeah B to B I just like the change of pace change of direction and the court mission And Dongo saves it Reeves dials up a three Craft earns Georgia Tech a fresh shot clock Dongo displayed the unselfish play there the court vision leads the Jackets an assist with five today Mustaf also with five for the yellow jackets Dongo soft around the rim and hes now got 12 points One of four Yellow Jackets in double figures Under four minutes to play a 14point lead Williams Dryen doing all he can CEA snatches another rebound Tell you what hes need one more board for another double double John as Lamar Washington coasts right in and a timeout called by West a great supporter of the program and just a rock solid human being I remember I was athletic director at a local private school and had to host a region tournament Roger was co coaching at the time at Life University and he gave me his gym to run our conference tournament didnt even charge me He was just just a great Georgia Tech man and a good good human being Youre not going to find a better ambassador for basketball in the state of Georgia Hes Indiana guy who from Indiana you know you got to you got to love hoops if youre from that state Came down to Georgia to play at Georgia Tech and said You know what Its a pretty good spot too And Smith misses the front end And for the past decade or so in the Georgia Tech Lettermans game when the former Letterman come back its usually coach Bobby Kremans against Coach Kaiser And theres a lot of friendly banter I cant share the words that coach Kreman says but they talk some trash I thought you said it was friendly John Not family friendly Both competitors Yes that Smith and couldnt get that and one opportunity has knocked loose Well few changes here in this second half but none bigger than the way Georgia Tech has defended for three compared to where they were in the first half John Thats one of the reasons it looks like Georgia Tech can get out of here with a win Yeah we felt like that was going to be the key for Georgia Tech coming out of the half Can they defend the three And theyve held the Wolves to one of seven from beyond the arc So not only are they defending it theyre not allowing those shots to get off And the bunny wont go for Daniel Dango with the rebound Fly now with 12 points and 13 boards His last two games John I mean this week he has been playing at an extremely high level and they will need him to do that throughout the season Yeah I mean Cila Dongo thats two backtoback games with the front line posting double doubles Theres only so many rebounds to go around 23 of them been secured by Sila and Dongo today You look at Dongo 12 points 13 boards The five assists really stands out Hes had a tremendous day And Reeves Oh that was graceful So the Yellow Jackets in firm control with less than two minutes remaining And hot shooting has carried them to the finish Williams Dryen cant buy one And now foul with that miss West Georgia 37 from the field in this game So the common denominator for Georgia Tech on the season is theyre one of the best in the country at field goal percentage defense And that leads to great offense The Tech Yellow Jackets The bench is up Theyre at it Excited rooting on their teammates This will be a one and one for Moila You mentioned defense leading to offense Thats going to be a blueprint for just about any Georgia Tech victory this year particularly inside the league Georgia Tech will go on the road next right To sunny Florida Yes they will Season tournament action headed down to Dest where they will face Depal on Friday night That is a 700 Eastern 6 local start And then you see theyll face Drake or LSU Then they come home and its the ACC SEC challenge hosting Mississippi State cheering So with a 15point lead here in a minute and a half left looks like the Yellow Jackets will have an undefeated month of November inside their gym cheering which John that hasnt always been the case The Yellow Jackets dropped a game at home against North Florida last year the year before that UMass LOL And you know theyve been in a couple of dog fights here inside MCAS Pavilion but they so far have not dropped one That lone loss coming on the road against Georgia I think thats a step in the right direction Skip pass Reeves Yes he ended the day the way he started 18 points for Kesi Reeves Its his fourth triple Four of seven from beyond the arc Hes got three boards two assists to go along with the 18 points Malcolm Noel who had just two points on the season entering tonight Hes now got 11 Thatll be a bright spot for West Georgia Thats going to add two points to your season average Im a math guy Wally I graduated from the Institute of Georgia Tech Hes averaging one point coming into this one Yeah hes in a good place Final 30 seconds and what is a kick ball West Georgia meanwhile a onepoint lead at the half and ultimately just couldnt slow down Georgia Tech offensively enough in the second half Back to Noel with 11 points for the Wolves Hes a guy that was one of the better point guards in the ASON last year in terms of assist to turnover ratio So he adds the element of knocking down a couple open shots Thats a sharp inp Thats what West Georgia has coming up after playing three games in the last seven days They will not play again until a week from tomorrow night against Troy Dongo finishing off his night 14 points 14 rebounds and five dimes And the passing on display by Washington Hes got seven assists to his two turnovers Noel drops another deuce But the Yellow Jackets will get the W 8266 Oddly similar to last years final score of 85 to 62 as the Yellow Jackets pull away with a 49point second half to improve to 5 one on the season Theyve won two straight
