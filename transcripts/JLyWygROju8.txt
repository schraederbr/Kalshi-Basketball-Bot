offensive player lets see who stabilizes the paint for the team middle Brooks at NC State in red and potit in the home team hokes in white its Virginia Tech that starts with the Music basketball Virginia Tech back at home after a West Coast trip over the weekend Brandon Rex Steiner starts the game off with a three race time for Rex Steiner knocking down that first look take look at the wolf pack starting five you mentioned still without Brandon Huntley Hatfield tonight for NC State heres Jaden Taylor off to Marcus Hill three seconds to shoot fires Off the Mark no good good first possession for the hes on the offensive end and a defensive end to the floor Rex Steiner has gotten back into the lineup tees up Jaden Young Who drills the three backto back triples in the opening minute great start for the hokes that have their ability to get in the pain and force rotation one of the things coach ke was concerned about was containing the dribble keeping the ball out of the paint Taylor answers with a triple of his own Jaden Taylor nothing but the bottom of the net and the threes are F flying early in blackburg Jaden Taylors shooting the lights out the last six games hes over 52 from behind the threepoint line and comes out and laces up the first one lets you know hes hes in a Groove from behind the threepoint Music line potit passing out of the matchup with middle Brooks and thats a turnover so Mike young still without his freshman point guard Ben Hammond who was sidelined in the west coast trip due to a foot injury third straight game without him but Brandon Reiner has come back into the starting lineup and looked terrific so far just two minutes in and you would think Ben Hammond hes really fast quick with the ball in his hands his ability to break the defense down is missed but so far Rex ner has been doing a great job just taking care of the basketball getting Hokies in offense Taylor connects on a three again backto back threes for Jaden Taylor hes got all six for the Music pack so four made baskets in the opening two and 12 minutes theyve all been from three lack of communication on NC State theyre not talking on the switches and theyve been punished by threes that time they got lucky long read rebound and Hill takes it Coast to Coast Marcus Hill scooped to the hoop and its an 8 nothing NC State run thats a familiar sight with NC State getting in transition the rebound they push averaging over 16 points a game in the ACC fast break points and wont get much easier than that we mentioned the contrasting Styles Randolph and right now the pace favoring Virginia Tech though they want to play in the 80s whereas NC they wants it in the 60s and the threes continue to fall that one belongs to Toby low when you knock the first one out and it just gives you confidence right now they both teams are hedging on the ball screens when you do that someone has to help that big thats rolling theyre doing a great job of skipping it to the weak side lets see the adjustments thatll be made in how they defend these Music balls middle Brooks through contact no good even with that Miss these teams a red hot start six of their first nine shots have gone in L on the drive draws the Music Applause foul theres Kevin Keats who told us during shootter around that feels like his team is finally dialed in defensively for the first time this season backtoback games played in the 60s and its a team that Prides themselves on setting the tone defensively well he didnt know his team was going to come out red hot from behind a threepoint line for a team thats been struggling to score and Rex Steiners had the hot hand early finds potit trying to spin his way free musling no good offensive rebound Tyler Johnson hes coming off his first career double double and he picks up where he left off in California big physical freshman attacks the offensive glass you got to get a body on him hes playing with a lot of confidence right now only 6 five but he rebounds like 68 wide shoulders and for a wing you dont want to have to guard a guy like that boxing him out middle Brooks stke down the lane for an easy two thats where middle Brooks at is best on the perimeter facing you faking that dribble hand off there there a big youre worried about the guards coming off scoring and that time he kept it turn to Dr It Down the Lane Johnson picked up his dribble in trouble almost a 5sec count there Rex Steiner nobody home intercepted by Hill went for the slam dunk missed it and luckily there to clean up the spill Dennis Parker Jr tapped it home turnovers and we talked about it thats just a careless turnover you know you want Rex SN just to keep that its not you know its not his fault ball was overthrown and just take it go out of bounds set your defense potit with a head of steam through contact gets to go both of these teams do a really good job of hitting their bigs on the road its going to test that weak side coverage and when theyve come over a couple of times now but since theyve skipped it in the corner and knocked down a couple of Threes heide do want to come over as much and bigs are getting a roll now shot clock down to seven ring away Virginia tack 13 points all five of their starters have scored already Michael oconnell great defense there to denyo wow oconnell excellent pass everything but the finish and a foul call great start six minutes in 25 points combined both teams have started well offensively Rand shooting from behind the three ball Baseline Corner Lac L up the wall comes back says I got one of my own close one here Music early from three yeah and theyre doing it a different ways I I think Virginia Tech and theyre moving and their half court execution is creating some confusion with NC State theyre not communicating on the switches and an NC State creating turnovers on the other end theyre creating some ball movement themselves and knock it down thre both teams combining five of six and Forin State this isnt what they usually do they want to attack the paint put pressure in the rim and get paint points and right now theyre shooting well from behind the arc and really that guy Taylor there hes started out two for two they can get perimeter scoring with their ability to pressure and three turnovers Mike he would be really happy he just talked about how how much their defense has improved right now their offense has improved yeah here we are thinking okay its going to be in the 60s Kevin Keat saying we want to keep teams low scoring and instead its an offensive explosion 6 minutes into this one he cant be happy with his defense right now theres been some breakdowns on his defense in the floor he wants to keep the Virginia Tech on on one side he do want the ball reversal as you can see now when they score they get to extend their pressure like theyre doing here Kesler comes up to create ball pressure I mean help relieve some of the ball I think Jaden Taylors is good as there he is in college basketball at pressuring the ball I think him and Chucky hurn are two of the better on ball defenders in the ACC and I think just in the country those two guys are Elite ball own ball pressure a very good defensive sequence there although its ripped away the Freshman Tyler Johnson and then Toby laow flies in for the flush plus the Applause foul he jump out of the gym give up on the play just great job by the Freshman but still there and he goes up and he didnt get up high enough as I like to see I want to see that 492 in vertical but catching it giving you a glimpse of how athletic he is Mike young is said Toby laow one of if not the most athletic player hes ever had the pleasure to coach complete the threepoint play that checks out hes fit in perfectly there hes a lot threat hes giving you positional flexibility played him a little bit at small ball play him at five his athleticism allows him to defend smaller guards Brion pass it into the game number four in red passing it off going down low for two and NC state has had the answer offensively now can they string together some stops defensively the pressure has been good I I think the breakdown keeping the ball out of the middle of the floor they trying to keep this reversal here you see the switch Applause there Jaden shoot step back three and he buries it Jaden shoot you cannot go under the ball screen on him shooting 34 on a year and starting to play with a little more confidence and you cant give him a look like that thats just what he does he gets his feet up under him hes lights out Corner three its good everything going down Dennis Parker Jr drills one from the corner lets see whos the first team that makes the adjustment in their defensive coverage right now there both teams shooting seven of 11 from the floor we expected the hot shooting from attch wasnt surprised Id say but NC State right now is lacing the L Nets with that threepoint shooting and even with Virginia Tech a team goes out to the West Coast for a week you just dont know how theyre going to return or they going to have that offensive flow and they certainly have we talked about that earlier youre concerned about it you spent a week out in the west coast and Mike young said there no excuses for his guys he said they came in Monday when they got back practice a little bit get their legs up under him he not allowing his guys to have any excuse at all the way theyre shooting it they need to go to Cali maybe a couple times we take the private jet out a battle underneath the hoop and a foul called Patrick wesler Tangled Up weve got a good one Virginia tack up by a point ACC play on a Wednesday night in blackburg they a in Blast they they they junk the game up and Kentucky showed a toughness that they hadnt always shown in every game this year but they responded really well and I think it was the best win theyve had so far you mentioned Old Miss knocking off Alabama how about Shawn padulla a year ago playing for the hokes now making things happen for Old Miss he is and hes playing really well they have missed him here in blackburg coming out of the timeout they go right back down to Dennis Parker Jr he is feasted right under the hoop well theres so much Healy guard and stuff in no mans land because theyre so long in that ball screen defense petite Middlebrook are doing a really good job of guarding the ball but theyre being stretched out so far and once that ball comes out theyve got to be sprinting out of there both teams are getting up a lot of baskets because of Music that Rodney Brown Jr into the game for Virginia Tech finds Jaden shoot the floater Falls Jaden shoot hes been terrific Off the Bench tonight now whats happening now is both bigs were doing a really good job of staying in front of the basketball but theyve given up baskets and the coaches been yelling at him to get back that time Middlebrook didnt show as well and shoot just turned the corner and shot the shot it Flo Dennis Parker Jrs been the Catalyst he has eight of States last 10 Marcus Hill on the drive no good Music un turn over there yeah no reason to leave your feet Rodney Brown there jumped in the air with no one expecting the pass to come then just stay on your feet I thought he could have had driven it to the basket get his feet in the paint just checked in the games was trying to get himself loose get a feel for the game hes not even sweating yet thats where if youre Virginia Tech and Mike young you miss your freshman point guard Ben Hammond whos out for a third straight game foul called yeah it was forced to call a foul it was either going to be a foul or back court violation by Brion pass there coming off the ball screen and thats what youre told about as a guard you come off the ball screen you attack The Bigs here Force the officials to make a play got to force the officials to make a blow the whist will come off attack that hip you see him stepping the back court there so its either a turnover or fouling and its potit second so he has to head to the sideline temporarily tough way to get your foul I thought he did a really good job of getting out stopping the ball this is where middle Brooks got to take over with his size his physicality pass out of the double Team Wave off the made three Applause the heel was on the end line for the Frenchman Paul mcneel there opportunity for Paul Paul mcneel just is a freshman was expecting him to come in and knock down shots and comes in with the reputation of being a shooter and that rolls in Jaden young all the way to the rim for two speaking of freshman this young man is really really talented that Virginia Tech theyre young right so this were a few years ago youre thinking okay they theyll stay in the system theyll stay here four years you just never know just never know you hope so because the talent is here theyre gaining experience you can see how much better theyre getting each and every game these fresh boted sophomores are playing Music together wideopen three its good Rodney Brown Jr and its a 7 nothing Hokes run timeout NC State Music Music Applause Music Music Music Music s nothing run in the last minute 42 for Virginia Tech ties their largest lead of the game seven different scorers for the hes tonight there been a lot of miscommunication theyre not matching up theyre not communicating you know for the wol pack you see the guys are throwing a hand Im like what are we doing theyve given up at least three threes just by not communicating and not matching up on defensively and Kevin ke is not happy with that when your teams identity is on the defensive end of the floor got to get back and match up in in transition Kevin Keats told us earlier the biggest concern is offense can you score enough to generate your fullcourt pressure theyve scored plenty but the defense has not been dialed in in this first half yeah hes got to be concerned with that because right now theyre shooting the lights out in the basketball but theyre not defending well they forced a few turnovers early but their lack of communication on the defensive end the floor has been hurting them and youve got to be disruptive with the Hocus you cant let them run their offense theyre just too good too many counters to it you got to pressure the basketball and stay in front Ben Burnham rejected by the Music rim Jaden Taylor had the hot hand early pulled off after his backto back threes to start the game inside middle Brooks finds mcneel who puts it up and in for two you expect Middlebrook to touch it every time down the floor with this lineup in he has a size Advantage with potin on the bench with two Music fouls shot clock down to 10 Burnham lines up a three and hits it Ben Burnham catches and shoots it in Rhythm he adds a a balance with this team he can score it inside and out you he playing a four you when you ball screens if if you switch with him he can post your guards up inside and really effective facing up knocking down threes and Virginia Tech six of seven from three after the last one from Ben burner stepped into it with rhythm here you got to get to him got to find all the shooters close out again late slowing in the close out Ben buron knocking down another three threes are falling here in Music blackberg he doesnt realize he has a low man there that was his help Easy Pass knocking down the top three the top of the key and hes shooting the ball well wow is shooting over 40 from three and even with meijel poti in foul trouble of this first half Virginia tack making things happen and when you shoot the ball as well as they have good things will happen theyve opened up a sevenpoint lead Taylor triggers a three cant connect offensive rebound keeps it alive both teams are struggling yeah keeping the basketball out of the paint its getting wherever it wants to get to and both teams are chasing on defensive end of the floor and theyre getting open looks L NC state has answered offensively in this first half but they failed to string together stops they have been few and far between good anticipation there by Brion pass to knock it away both teams right now with the ball screen defense these bigs are spending a lot of energy theyre extending their pressure theyre sprinting back in the paint its forcing that weak side guard to hang in the paint lets see if either team makes the adjustment now youve said it a few times in this first half whos going to be the first team to adjust itll probably be the winner of this game Applause oconnell who just made the three drives Baseline tees up another triple and Jaden Taylor delivers thats his third made three of this first half if you notice the ball is just getting to the corner because that low guy has to help that big whos hedging on his ball look how far the W Middlebrook is out heding on that ball screen Taylor picks the pocket up ahead Styles draws the foul a chance to take the lead from the foul line its starting there starting with the ball screen you close out another Baseline Drive and theyre just taking hor shots right now those are easy shots I mean look no one is there hes no one he catches this ball just laid closing out that Balls gone before anyone can get there and both teams are just shooting it at a hot clip right now yeah Taylor nine points all through threes hes got three of them and hes shooting it well right now in the last six games we talked about him shooting over 50 hes keeping that hot hand Music Applause and stays tied at 29 7 nothing run for NC State out of the timeout though Rodney Brown Jr turned it over thats the ball pressure it its didnt turn it over but thats what Jaden Taylor does pressure the basketball Rodney Brown just no pass just came up sped up forced to Music Applause turnover laow working on Middlebrook stolen away Music again ball screen action skip it to the corner thats the game plan and its working there no reason to change it just getting the ball screen forc the big to help guard has to tag spray it to the corner youre going to get a three or drive a closeup thats the seventh lead change of this first half and a 10 nothing run for EDC state to move in front the wow follows his own Miss count it plus the foul a chance to tie it at 32 from the line his quickness is a problem in the perimeter just couple of possessions ago hes already knocked down a three just catches it and drives it shoots it quickly gets the rebound there and okons like man hes got two fouls just being in the wrong place at the wrong time now he has to sit for the neutral what a fun first half this is back and forth we go and blackburg feels like every time one team makes a run the opponent has that counter punch and we talked about it I think the surprising thing is just how well State shooting you from the threepoint line you know and and theyre not a great threepoint shoo thats not their strength they they win by getting the ball in the paint getting paint touches not coming off skipping it to the corner for three This Is How They want to play step back jumper its good dant Tes Styles back to back baskets to put the Wolfpack back in front now they get to set their full CT pressure and Rodney Brown just got to beat him you cant play with the basketball Taylors really good acting with his hands you just got to beat him getting get your team in their half quote offense this is what I meant about wook as well you see how far out these guys were helping shot clock down to eight DED shoot to wesler puts it up and ties it at 34 you set a screen as a big like wesler just did there but the way both teams are shooting now youre going to start getting that rooll because the guards dont want to help them rotate Styles hes redot three in a row Dantes Styles same thing just all they got to do is a run of ball screen Music here wolf pack scorching from three seven of 10 in this first half they only average six on the year mean per game on a season and they already has seven that rattled in and out no good halfway down for Jaden shoot that would have been the Hokey 7eventh made three of this first half Taylor in attack mode into the double team fade away and hits it Jaden Taylor and Virginia Tech forced to take a timeout come to blackberg watch a game of horse if you can do it I can do it one teams knock it down three you come back hey you can do it I can do it Don Tre Styles gets in the a Leed by seven but now its a 17 to5 NC State run started with the pressure there by Jaden Taylor just freeding still here speeding Rodney Brown up there creating another turnover and and the nine wins for NC State theyve averaged 19 points a game off turnovers and they have 10 already in the first half just creating turnovers is a critical part of for NC State to win and you you know you combine that with their ability to knock down shots its why they have the lead here in the first half and the Hokies have been plagued by turnovers throughout this season that is probably number one on Mike Youngs list is whats piled up the losses this year and thats another possession there and sometimes turnovers are quick shot and that right there possession comes down its no pass no ball reversal quick shot and equates a quick turnover and got to get shot attempts against NC Applause Music State now the wolf pack with the momentum right now theyve erased a sevenpoint deficit now they lead by five a foul called there Kevin Keats in the Wolfpack bench thought that was clean I think Browns turning down shots hes coming off that ball screen and no one stopped him and hes elevating and hes passing he needs to be a little bit more aggressive theyre pressuring him andan hes sped up a little bit but I he has an opportunity there punishing C state with the ball pressure Applause Burnham lines up a three missed it you cant ask for a better look those were the ones that were falling for much of this first half for Virginia Tech offensive rebound keeps it alive tapped around Middlebrooks gathers good spin move and a foul call yeah Ben midbrook has an advantage te on the bench with two fouls when they dont have transition opportunities play through him inside and loves the spin Baseline kind of the way DJ Burns is accustomed to doing in the past feel you lean on him and he spin that Baseline spinner our womens basketball Sunday showcase begins Stanford and Duke one pm Eastern Time on ESPN 2 and then its Oklahoma at South Carolina 3 Eastern on ESPN theres not much size in depth right now even with you know we talk we talked about this with Hatley huntfield I mean Huntley Hatfield is out for NC State Ben Middlebrook has been spending a lot of energy not just on the offensive and also defensively hes really showing and active in his ball Music screen nice move no finish though rolled around did not drop for Rodney Brown Jr got to get back in transition Music though the foul called the wow reaching in trying to deny Middlebrooks and thats his second foul its a bad foul B wild hes got to know hes got one and Middlebrook had his back turn he did a really good job making him catch it behind the threepoint line and a little too aggressive now he picks up his second foul and has to sit Music down Conor serving checks in for Virginia Tech shows you how Limited they are with front court options I was at practice yesterday and he played really well and Coach young told him he said I got to reward you the effort he was playing so it doesnt surprise me that hes comfortable putting him in a game in this situation when coaches will tell you all of them will say hey you got to force me to play Applause you and after those made free throws in8 nothing NC State run in the wolf Packs largest lead of the night theyve gone from down down seven to up eight in this first half and theyre looking for offense here and with this lineup where do you Music go another turnover those are starting to pile up at the end of this first half Hal time cant come soon enough for the hokes right now offensively they dont have a guy they can run their offense through right now and theyre UND deiz and defensively theyre struggling as well wideopen three in the fres been Bryce herd knocks it down and its dangerous because you got so many young guys and new guys on the floor they struggle to communicate didnt talk on the D the post double there didnt rotate out of it and gave up another three no points in the last three minutes for Virginia T its an allowed an 11 nothing Run for the pack Rex Steiners got to get the basketball in his hands pressure was really getting the brown someones got to get this team settled and get them in the Applause offense this is where Ben Hammond being out with that foot injury kills Virginia Tech hes a Difference Maker because hes so fast so quick its really difficult to pressure him he would definitely be able to handle the pressure get them in the offense and there cant wait to get him back but this is the guy thats got to do its got to be ready Rex ner hes got to be the guy to gets him in the offense someone has to take this ball to try to make an effort put it in the basket right now shot clock under Applause 10 inside Jaden shoot shot clock violation yeah I mean its just difficult right now with this lineup I think its got to be Rex SN hes got to put the ball in his hands and hes got to come off and either shoot it or make a play for someone else right now the pressure is really bothering the hokes the officials have to reset the clock here to 59 well it has been a ferocious finish to this first half by Kevin Keats and NC State and 119 nothing run and a chance to add to it here hoks got to pick up the basketball theres no need to yeah you got to make him pick it up theres only 59 seconds left and you allow him to roll it up now he got a chance to take it all the way to the rim wow and a foul called on the screens going to give the ball back to Virginia Tech here with a chance to score before break you can tell that was a late shot clock play where hes expecting to pick up full court I thought dff was standing there and its giving hokus an opportunity here plenty of time over four seconds you got to know you can get up to four dribbles with 4 seconds youre inbounding the ball here at half court I just run a ball screen until Rex noted to go make a play the follow flush no good after the buzzer sounded and Kevin keatss team will head into halftime where they are 8 and one on Ball and an 11point lead is they average six made threes per game yes per 40 minutes they hit eight threes in the first half and Mike young is going to make his group just do a better job of executing their ball screen coverage Taylor shoots over it cant connect offensive rebound pulled down by Marcus Hill and thats a different kind of shot there by Jaden young the other ones they did a better job of attacking in the ball screen forcing Virginia Tech to hold their backside coverage that looked like Jaden Taylor Just predetermined he was going to shoot that one oconnell lines up the three and its another offensive rebound backto back offensive rebounds on this opening possession for the wolf pack Marcus Hill pull up pop got it thats what happens when they give up two offensive rebounds I thought Inc State took two bad shots they got offensive rebounds and better execution on the third attempt and thats what happens when you give up multiple offensive rebounds in one possession the basketball guard rewards you malijah potit back into the game to start this second half he only played seven minutes due to foul trouble in the first half midd Brooks assessed a foul there its a bad foul there by middle Brook youre often tell guys you pressure the basketball let them give it to you you dont try to take it got his hand stuck in the cookie jar there and picked up his second foul and hes got to be careful because if he picks up another one here he may have to sit down and as we talked about it theres not a lot of front court size and help for the wolf pack Virginia Tech was terrific the first 16 minutes of the first half but then a 4minute scoring drought put them 11 points behind and NC State starts with a made basket and a defensive stop you cant let the wolf packs separate early in this second half if youre the Music hokes Le poti oneonone here once again Virginia Tech cant get the defensive rebound will give another opportunity to the pack got to secure rebounds he got to go after with two hands if if youve been Middlebrook there against poti you got to turn and face use your quickness I dont know if theres a stronger big in the ACC you have no chance of backing him down inside you got to turn and face and use your quickness and keep putting them in ball screens here attack him in the ball Music Applause Music screen hell tease up nid Brooks Brooks yeah its its just the same thing theres no answer to it right now its they just got into the same action differently didnt have a ball screen dribble handoff Johnson drills the three and that is the first made basket its six minutes for Virginia Tech if you go back to the end of the first half just needs something positive to happen for the Music hokes this G this game is a long way from over now Virginia TCH hoping the Freshman Tyler Johnsons 3 can ignite a second half surge I I agree with you Randolph this game feels a lot closer than the scoreboard indicates and it was back and forth tied at 34 with four minutes to go in the first half NC State goes on an 11 nothing run to kind of tip the scales foul called against Jaden young struggling to defend Jaden Taylor and NC State is starting to come out and attack off the dribble this is how they usually play making eight threes in one half is not the way the Wolfpack I know the Wolfpack fans are watching like wheres this team been and face up and tacking you up the dribble is what this teams accustomed to doing and another offensive rebound Marcus Hill trying to muscle it home cant do it Virginia Tech got to start rebounding they have allowed four offensive rebounds in this second half alone poti cant cash in on the Block laid on the ball screen here and got to turn in face hes not going to be able to back him down midd Brooks getting the better of that matchup right Applause now te reaches there picks up his third foul Mike Youngs got decisions he has to make with his group this team struggled when he went out of the lineup in the first half when things start falling apart and this wesler comes in and looks like matis going to the Applause bench only played 7 and 12 minutes of that first half checks out here 3 minutes into the second Saturday noon eastern time do not miss a top 10 matchup in the SEC its Alabama and Kentucky noon Eastern Time Saturday on ESPN full court pressure for menc State 14o lead on the road here in Applause Music blackburg SC State just being completely disruptive look where the hul is running her offense foul on the floor pass Mike young talking with official Brent Hampton over on the Hokey sideline I think hes explaining to Mike Mike coach young that he thinks this player may have flared his arm and caught one of the NC State players offal the officials are going to look at this at the monitor well step away State up by 14 previous plays under review you all having a good time Applause Applause Applause fans its now time for the US Navy SC get up and show us your bestx POS Applause she Applause Applause bir Applause Music now the officials AJ desde Brian oconnell Brent Hampton were in deep discussion for the entire media time out huddled up over at the monitor they just broke seconds before we were back from break they were taking a long look at Jaden young and Michael oconnell were explaining now to the coaches the foul called on the floor was a reach in on oconnell we took a couple of looks during the break Randolph and I think its likely that they reverse this decision and one after review the call on the floor the foul on number 12 red STS one shot for white three in addition theres a dead ball contact technical foul on white three red will shoot two shots Reds ball on the Baseline Applause yeah I think they got it Applause right even though I dont see the foul I dont see the foul on okono though I would have just had the flagrant yeah on young I dont see the foul there I I and the other thing is I thought the foul on oconnell was on the floor I did too I dont think Young is in the act of shooting there unless which is an NBA game and you didnt tell me so a bizarre swing cuz even though oconnell gets the two free throws Virginia Tech still comes away plus one cuz this results at a threepoint play when really all oconnell did was get elbowed in the in the face yeah I mean he picks his dribble up there so yeah the fouls yeah I I dont know why its a foul on okono so NC State ball a 13point lead oconnell a three no good thought thats a really good defensive possession there for the hokes Music can they cash in on the offensive end Rex striner been quiet tees up young he cant connect on a three poked away kept alive low on a rack attack Toby low he can throw it down you know you can jump and dunk when you dont even have to throw it down hard he just gets up there puts his head at the rim and just drops it Music nbrooks feasting inside that time there a lack of communication with the hokes Lew was in the ball screen there and there was a four five ball screen he usually want to communicate and switch those no communication Ben Middlebrook gets an uncontested layup The Freshman Johnson misfires from three wesler keeps it back in with luow young steps in missed it wesler cleans up the spill plus the foul Patrick wesler in perfect position Virginia Tech a chance to make it a 10point game at the line when we come back Music Applause w Applause all right the officials said it was not the media timeout Patrick wesler was at the foul line completed the threepoint play so 10point lead for EDC State Hill scooped to the hoop Marcus Hill Marcus Hill is the wolf packs leading score doesnt shoot a ton of Threes you got to know hes hes a driver cant give up the middle drive and gives up an unconsented layup to the wolf pack lead Music Applause Music score going back to the media timeout confusion the stoppage in play was at the 1633 Mark so thats outside of that 1630 or below window so theyll play to the Under 12 now kept Alive by Johnson who then threw it away the Freshman hustles hes coming off that first career double double played a careerhigh 34 minutes in the win against Cal a lot to like about him his motor physicality in which he plays with and hes going to be heck of a player when the game slows down for him Marcus Hill that rims out no good hes starting to take over though thought he should have used the glass on that one had a chance there had an angle little bit of contact there threw him off Applause Music Applause balance splits the double team Brown Jr flying to the rim and he was rejected by the rim Taylor gives up the three takes it inside fighting through traffic count it plus the foul Jaden Taylor been so impressive tonight hes knocked down a couple of Threes so he just gave a shot fake at threepoint line you got to go for it you close out late here just drive plays off too love to see GS when he do that he pivots take the contact kisses it off the glass last Jen Taylors having himself a ball game tonight leads the wolf pack tonight with 13 youve talked all night Randol how impressed you are with his defense this season if he adds this type of offense to his Arsenal on a consistent basis he becomes such a weapon in the ACC well an ACC plays comes around he started you know he started knocking down threes and we talked about it shooting over 50 the last six games and shooting even in the higher clip now youve got to help the ball pressure there is really bothering Brown hes initiating the offense so far away hes just got to beat his Defender cant keep playing with his food on the outside for as good as Virginia Tech was in the first half executing their half court sets led to some brilliant offensive work they have struggled in this second second half they have not found a flow in these seven minutes no he hasnt and Rex is on the bench now and I thought hed be the guy and he had seemed to get himself going Rodney Browns a 66 guard and he has to play that with his size he doesnt need to jump in the air just put those guys on his hip beat him off the dribble and initiate the offense for your team Ben Burnham spinning his way free and a chance Fernand one this is what coach young saw in the ability to bring him over from college at Charleston I mean hes a guy that can face up knock down with threes did in the first half he can put it on the deck and drive uses that 67 frame his body spins and finishes takes the contact and got a chance at an and one here and when youre struggling for offense hes a versal enough scorer that can you can lean on him a couple minutes until someone else steps up Applause but this is the end of the floor where the Hokes got to got to get back in his game cant allow your offense to Def to dictate your defensive Music effort crosscourt pass finds Brion pass and now Marcus Hill Marcus Hill he has heated up in this second half thats his game hes a midrange shooter quick hes driving close outs he plays with a chip on the shoulder right now staks just really Music aggressive Rodney Brown Jr forcing that three Off the Mark NC State they like to run get in transition in the fast break going a little too fast that time but they get to extend their pressure here The Bigs of the Hokies will come down and they feel like they too much ball pressure theyll set the ball screen that time was no need this game was tied at 34 with four minutes remaining in the first half since then it has been all NC State the hokes out of rhythm offensively shot clock down to four lwow heaves it and hits it Toby lewow with the shot clock winding down lewow with his second three of the Applause Night Big Shot hogi struggling on the offensive end of the floor and got to find ways to put the ball in his Applause Music hands shot clocked down to four four Brion pass nice move and leow blocks Applause it Corner three Jaden shoot got it that started with the wild making plays knock down a three to previous possession that time comes over and helps with the block sets up the hogies with another opportunity the offensive end time out Kevin Keats backto back threes have the hokes back within eight this I feel the exact same way my my football analyst at ESPN all season long Notre Dame Captain Rocky boyman and I got to let him down I got the bucke eyes we got a good one here on a Wednesday night in the ACC at of the timeout good look Jaden Taylor cant knock it down though Virginia Tech Randol they are back at in this game they were down by 15 that lead is cut in half weve got to step aside again just as Virginia Tech was finding a rhythm Mike young his team trailing by eight pack have come out second half they had made it three but if you look here this is what theyve been doing to get their threes they run the ball screen shoots the low guy he has to come over over leaving Jadon Taylor weak side unable to knock it down and Ben midbrook gets CS with the foul there and thats his third and thats interesting because usually sometimes they penalize the guard you got to make an effort to go for the rebound and get it I didnt think shoot made an effort to get it but both of our players we talked about in the open have three fouls now and good thing for state that allows them to extend pressure so even though the wolf pack getting good looks from three like you just Illustrated first half eight made threes zero in the second half this is a team that only averages six made threes per game so the eight in the first half a huge surprise they have yet to hit one in this second its allowed Virginia Tech to get back in this game yeah I thought the first two they took the rushed as Benn Middlebrook picks up his fourth foul here hes going to have to come out thats a thats a big foul there hes got to know you can thought L shuffled his feet a little bit got away with maybe a travel but thats a big foul I think both teams have struggled without their bigs being on the floor in foul trouble potit I dont know if hes played 10 minutes tonight with his foul trouble and its affected the hokei offense and middle Brooks motor in activity when hes out of the game is hurt the wolfback do you think about putting potit back in with Middlebrooks bench could be an option for the hokes goow knocks him both down an 8 nothing Virginia Tech run and just like that its a two possession game but Laws been active now without without a true big on the floor physically you allow his activity and athleticism here Applause both teams have been very aggressive in this second half NC state has committed seven fouls Virginia Tech six so shooting one and one the rest of the way wolf pack likes to put a lot of pressure on the rim now driving it getting in the paint getting paint touches Marcus Hill down the lane side a credit Virginia Tech The Hokey Trail by 15 60 to 45 they are right back in it only down six and theres no Rim protection here so for the Hoke you dont have to settle Burnham into a double team low offensive rebound puts it up no good Applause good possession I think by both teams on the end you got the shots you want youre driving to the rim and bagel potit is checking into the game for Toby L I think its a big opportunity now when he comes in give him a couple of possessions to get himself going but with Ben Middlebrook having four and Huntley Hatfield not being available I think it allows poti to kind of put his stamp on his game Hill goes inside potit was late on the screen and its an easy two for NC State theyre really taking advantage of ball screen coverage Music here first made basket for the wolf pack in nearly four minutes potit trying to answer draws the foul I think he thought Ben burnam was going up cutting like look what I found gets rewarded with the free throw he was cutting in yeah he gets the left arm there the contact there its good call potit has been the most consistent scorer in the last three games for Virginia Tech he had 25 points in the win against Miami and then backto back 12point performances on the west coast only two points tonight hes been dealing with foul trouble but hes in the game now its his time to make his presence known absolutely there hes big opportunity with Ben midbrook being out of the game right now and he only has three fouls right now theyre having trouble defending this ball screen here Jaden Taylor been aggressive tonight gets shoot up in the air muscles it home plus the foul he been shooting so well from behind the threepoint line theyre running the same action theyre just getting to a ball screen it doesnt matter just running into a different play and driv that close out what bad defense by shoot he just had to go for the hesi went for the hesitation move Applause and Taylors been terrific tonight completes the and one 17 points to lead all scores and its back to a 10point NC State Applause lead struggling right now hoki doesnt know who to go to and this is where petite has to help him out double team comes in poti spins through it puts it up couldnt Music connect and NC State getting everything they want inside they keep going down low and it keeps paying off a remarkable astounding week for the North Carolina State wol pack an ACC tournament Championship that will never be forgot and now theyre going dancing too so last year the March Madness began with NCA winning the ACC tournament I go back to 2022 with Virginia Tech wanted even Georgia Tech in 21 lately in the ACC if you get hot at the right time NC State of Virginia Tech have showed it you can cut down those Nets make your way into March Madness so even though the records may not show it now or the standings may not indicate it you never know when a teams going to get hot and both of these teams know we talked about NC State but this Tech Hoke program when Darius Maddox hit a big shot against Clemson to elevate them to a win and they go on and win the ACC tournament and if Duke has a slip up in the ACC tournament this year this could be another year where someone comes out from the you know the middle of the conference and stills a bid you mentioned that madx shot how similar even where he was on the court to Michael OK connells thrilling shot you need a little bit of that yeah sometimes its better to be lucky than good both teams shooting one and one Toby lewall makes the front end I guess we share that because as you sit here in the middle of January you look at the records and go okay were in the middle of the ACC both of these programs but these are the two programs that have Illustrated in the last three years anything is possible theyre your example your team right now was still early in conference play a lot of teams are starting to get healthy you can see there ACC has five teams in SMU being the next for out a lot of basketball left to play and I thought one of the stories with the ACC that people didnt talk about early was just the injuries that everyone is NC State is dealing with injuries here but Mike James had played this year and was the leader of this NC State Wolfpack team and Huntley Hatfield being out so I think in the month of November that was a big part of the story that that from a league perspective I dont think a lot of people discussed and its unlikely they well see Mike James the rest of the season for Kevin Keats program and he hes still got two years of Eligibility if he gets this year back hes hes a really talented player Saturday triple header on acc Network tips off Wake Forest right here at Castle colum at two Notre Dame in Syracuse at four and then your night cap Cal will be at NC State the wolf pack hoping that they can finish the final seven minutes here and leave with a road Conference win 10point lead theyve controlled the second half Marcus Hill theyve been playing through who draws the foul here Mike young changes ball screen defense there the roll kept hurting him and the skip for three that time they switch five J young just laid on the close out gets the foul see if they continue with that ball screen defense but got a string stops together and their issue also is on the other end of the field they got to figure out a way get the ball in the basket Marcus Hill makes the front end of the one and one you just talked about Mike james injury I think its Marcus Hill whos probably benefited from that the most out of Kevin Keats guards he stepped up and played a big role for this Wolfpack team hes leading them in scoring and its its he plays with a chip on his shoulder and if youre a guard and you want to play college basketball youre going to love playing for Kevin keeps I mean gives you a lot of freedom youre going to play in a ton of ball screens you can see here tonight and Hill has just come in really aggressive and looking to attack down hill and hes having heck of an impression on Coach Keats a short period of time Hoke desperate for a made basket they havent scored other than free throws in the last 4 minutes and 40 seconds shot clock down to four Burnham cant hit it you can see the pressure just bothering the hokes they cant get anything they dont have anybody that can beat you off the dribble right now and the only guy on the floor that you can see consistently doing that is brown and he struggled with the pressure himself stolen away Burnham picked the pocket of Hill all the way to the rim he misses the layup lewow finishes it finally for Virginia Tech their first field goal in more than 5 minutes after seven straight misses great job creating a turnover this in hog this game there still a lot of time in this game but this is the end of the floor they got to pick it up here how you going to guard this ball screen are you going to switch it like whats what your defensive coverage here you got a secure rebound styles step back jumper cant hit it the door is cracked open in the Final 5 Music minutes Burnham in trouble finds lewow for a three its good Toby laow breathing life into Virginia Tech down the stretch time out Mike young his team back within seven should be a fun finish in the ACC on a Wednesday night Music Music Applause NC state has controlled this game in the second half led by as many as 15 but Randol Mike Youngs team right back in it theyre starting to get stops on the other end here you see the penetration the back dirt cut by Ben Burnham and wow by La wow hes knocking down threes his activity inside Round The Rim finishing in the paint I think hes been active on the defensive end of the floor as well double double for Toby low tonight 22 points 11 Applause rebounds and he is made backto back shots after 5 minutes with no ma baskets for Virginia Tech to get the hokes back within this game ke is seen enough he ke come out of the timeout with Ben Middlebrook who has to be careful four foul playing with four fouls tangled up here with L jump ball and the possession arrow with Virginia Music Applause Tech three consecutive stops here by the hokes theyre turning up their defensive pressure creating another turnover someone has to step up here and help Lo and the offensive end of the floor or do you just keep feeding oh you do but he still needs help you got to run a ball screen action or something to get him to Music basketball Burnham going right at middle Brooks who was not aggressive playing with four fouls and the hokes have made it a fivepoint game with four minutes to play need to get the ball out of the middle of the floor heres Marcus Hill shot clock at eight oconnell has to hurry finds Middlebrooks two seconds right to the rim Ben Middlebrooks lays it up and in thats why you need him on the floor middle he can he can just do so many different things on the off offensive end before he anchors your defense we talked about him leading the ACC and shot blocks but hes really good on the offensive end at driving creating angles and finishing F foul called a Ben Middlebrooks layup that ended a 7 nothing run for Virginia Tech he needed there he catches it with 4 seconds on the shot clock just fak left spins back the other way lays it well much needed bag by NC State coming down the stretch got a great one players Michael Strahan just getting in Steve Slayton he was so fun to watch for West Virginia congratulations to Michael Vic and everybody in the 2025 College Football Hall of Fame Class A lot of great players on that list Michael Vick is so deserving of it I mean wow and speaking at Sho around with Kevin NC State head coach he said when he was coaching hardgrave Military Academy he would take his players on the road to Lane Stadium to watch Michael Vick play and the highlight of the team was stopping at uh whats the rest around he said golden car golden KRA can you imagine trying to tell your players that now in the ACC hold on its a fourpoint game with 3 minutes to play this is the closest Virginia Tech has been since it was 37 34 in the first half tassle Coliseum roaring the defense on Hill off the window and and Marcus Hill delivers Marcus Hill has been quiet for the most most of the game and just steps up right there in a critical moment no hesitation just catches it and goes He clears out a side on the iris cut form him theres no doubt he was going up with that one still a twopossession game shoot down the lane he answers were seeing the Hokies now everybodys more aggressive theyre more aggressive on the defensive end of the floor more importantly theyre getting stops now you get to the twominute Mark of this game its about execution for both teams Jaden Taylor hands it off for Styles and now OK conell 8 seconds left on the shot clock back to Marcus Hill spinning into traffic missed it rebound Ben Burnham tangled up with Marcus Hill and with a minute 53 Virginia Tech will have the basketball trailing by Applause Music four so the call on the floor was out of bounds off NC State so Virginia Tech Will have to inbound this basketball you see Hill he had his foot on the Baseline as he was touching that ball so a minute 53 to play Virginia Tech trailing by four with the basketball each team with two timeouts remaining great job there by Brown handling the pressure on the wild just getting them in the offense being impressed with release guy jaded shoot for three got it its a onepoint game and Virginia Tech has made six straight they are roaring to the finish time out Kevin Keats Applause got ourselves a ball game now Virginia Tech now more importantly they scored six straight shots but they doing it on the defensive end of the floor here you canot make the mistake and go under on Jon shoot hadnt shot the ball great tonight but hes dangerous anytime the balls in his hands gets his feet up under him hes as good of a shooter as anyone a former top 50 recruit showing you why he was such a highly recruited player coming out of high school before he signed his in intent to go to Duke and now Kevin ke has to figure out what is he doing Applause now 11 made threes for the hokes tonight Jen Shu who scored Virginia Techs last seven points and a 15point NC State lead is down to one PS cant be happy with his guys thats a mental error hes one guy you cant go under a ball screen on him you got to chase over Dennis Parker Jr cant make that Applause mistake I think theyre going to go for hill by the elbow ISO here Hill LEL got a piece of it Virginia Tech with the ball trailing by Applause one states on the heels right now and Virginia techs redot they have made their last six shots under a minute to go tried to get it to low knocked Away by Middlebrooks itll stay Hokes basketball 7 seconds on the shot clock lot of options right now shoots knocked down a three the previous possession took one to the basket now and Mike young brings in Jaden young Mike young has two timeouts would you use one now I think he is he is and I think thats a smart decision in a onepoint game you cant take the timeouts with you the bed tonight talk things over with 7 Seconds to work on the shot clock how about the hokes they were down 60 to 45 in this second half they were ice cold and they found a way to chip away and the wolf packs lead and here we are talking about Michael Vic joining the College Football Hall of Fame class and how Kevin Keats would bring his high school team to watch him play and Virginia Tech saying were not done here they have roared to the finish and they might steal it in this final minute Michael Vic motivated him but the its the defensive end to the floor and I think L being you know playing small ball and putting him at the five it allowed them to be able to defend the ball screen better they were able to switch his activity was was able to recover and then in the offensive end hes knocked down a couple of Threes And then hes facing the Music floor I mean just shoot just turns the corner here finish the and one and here you go under the screen you just cant do that hes seeing the ball go through the basket hes been clutched for the Hokies here as theyre coming down the stretch so Jaden shoot in the last five games just five of 22 from three well he is three of four tonight combined with Toby Ls double double 22 points to go along with 11 rebounds a career high for L we talked about your a guard you want to play for Kevin Keat if youre a shooter you definitely want to play for Mike young both of these coaches require you to defend but they allow you a ton of freedom on the offensive end 7 seconds on the shot clock so the hes have to hurry right Anne Brown Jr with it off to shoot steps in from the logo no Applause good NC State clinging to a onepoint lead under 40 seconds to Applause play trying to escape castle Coliseum with a critical Conference win on the road Jaden Taylor picked up his dribble in trouble finds Marcus Hill 4 seconds to shoot off to Taylor Hees a three cant connect whos got the rebound its still loose Jaden shoot off to Brown Jr 10 seconds shoot for three missed it bounces out shoot three gathers and a foul called with 23 seconds and Virginia Tech is in the double bonus so shoot will shoot two a chance to take the lead from the foul line what a hectic sequence here by both Music teams can Sho comms nerves see here at the free throw line with a chance to put the hokes up one what could cap an incredible comeback win Music Applause jayed shoot a 73 foul shooter on the season the weight of this game on his shoulders we are tied at 76 right guyss on the line too hes had it going his last couple of possessions Mike young you want to have him in his PE Burns a timeout trying to freeze Applause him interesting that you would use your final timeout now cuz on the off chance he makes it wouldnt you want to well set it up hes going to set up a play if he makes it youre trying to freeze him give him something to think about if he misses it are you okay with going in there overtime right but if he makes it youre going hes going to drop his play now letting his guys knows 23 seconds hes going to try to inbound of basketball near half court giving him two dribbles cross your fingers and hope for a miracle if youre celebrating hoping a wol pack pull mean wol pack can pull it out Applause wow and if your NC State you didnt think youd find yourselves in this position you led this game 60 Music 45 and its been a 31 16 run by Virginia tet a chance for Jaden shot to deliver the first lead for Virginia Tech Wow since it was 2928 wow they have stormed back in the last three or four minutes of this game I mean it it was 10point lead State the pressure was bothering the hokes and they stepped it up on the offensive end and balls down to the little things too you course you stop there youre unable to secure the rebound and commit a foul 23 3 seconds left thats a tough call to make and tough way to lose a game Jaden Shu can knock down his free throw coming up next ACC basketball on a Wednesday night continues Pittsburgh and Florida State but first Jaden shoot for the lead got it great substitution by Mike young there allowing him to set his bench allows you time to identify the lineup little confusion Mike young saying I want to use my final timeout the officials not giving it to him Kevin Keats giving an earf to Bret Hampton and finally Mike young does get the timeout he wanted to call so doesnt like the call the foul that was called there hes still upset about that you obviously dont want a game to to end to be affected by the whistle so both teams out of timeouts Virginia Tech has stormed back from down 15 to up one they are 23 seconds away from stealing this game Jay did shoot down the stretch who scored Virginia Techs last nine points to put them in front what do you do here for your NC statement 23 seconds well I think hes going to try to inbound the basketball getting it on a move trying to throw it directly to half court if you could telling your players you got two dribbles he doesnt have a timeout telling you guys which side of the floor you want the inbound play on I look to see if Jaden Taylor is catching it on the Move hes going to try to inbound the ball got to be careful here Middlebrook is unguarded he may try to heave it I think theyre going to back screen Middlebrook and heave at the length of the Court into Middlebrook stolen away Ben Burnham finishes it with a flush and Virginia Tech wins it
