race yeah this kid a Jim rat he was here 2 and 1 half hours before the game getting up shots Ive seen him in practice a couple night times hes a vocal supportive leader and what has got a violation for stealing the jump ball so Stanfords going to get the basketball to start this one ly kid the big man from Miami took it way too literally we need to get off to a quick start that was a little too quick so the Cardinal will have the ball first and jayen Blakes handles the ball part of this Stanford starting five Jaylen coming off the game winning buzzer beater in Carolina against the Tar Applause Heels Kyle Smith the first year head coach here with the Cardinal really likes his starting five they play a lot of minutes Rayo gets up a shot on the first possession comes up short no doubt go inside to the big man get him activated down there on that like where block where he likes his left shoulder turned to his right hand hook couple changes Miami starting lineup has varied here uh looked to me like a travel and it was yeah ly kid down there banging with r No thats going to be the match up to watch these two Brahma Bulls banging each other all night long down on Long the the post yeah Lyn kids been around a long time started his career at Clemson played at Virginia Tech now here at Miami hes got some athletic skills maybe he can hang with one of the best big men in the country R now Another Touch on the second Stanford possession of the night going oneonone against kid and kid defended him well pass almost stolen away agar wall finds a teammate in the corner the shot did he get it off in time no and it was an air ball thats a shot clock violation well already you can see coach Courtneys defensive scheme is not to double rain no to leave the shooters open going to try to let Lin kid handle him one onone down on that block little better start defensively for the Hurricanes last time out was hard to believe regulation non overtime they gave up 117 points to SMU yeah they were buried in that first half and never got their footing they gave up seven threepoint field goals right at the beginning of the game fell behind by 20 25 plus uh and then they just you know ran out of gas they play a little bit better in the second half shot 50 in the second half but there they get a good block and this is where they got to live in transition see if they can get some easy buckets against his Stanford defense Cleveland with the block shot three right side that way off the mark for Brandon Johnson who just has struggled big time from the outside yeah and really hasnt been able to find his range he made his first three of the season on Saturday but for the most part just hasnt been able to be consistent from the outside to loosen up the inside for kid he able to operate not a good pass Johnson in transition that is a blocking foul so they call the block Blakes thought he had position but foul against stford I thought he had position too Dave seemed like he was down there with a donut and a cup of coffee waiting for this contact doesnt take it quite Square in the chest I beg your pardon he took it pretty much right between the the two and the one so officials giving Miami a favorable whistle on that one you know its one thing the Cardinal prided themselves in practice yesterday is when a guy was stepp to a drive L take charge thats a staple of Coach Smith coach basketball team theres Kyle Smith the reigning Pack 12 Coach of the Year cour Stanford not in the Pack 12 anymore he was in Washington state last year Stanford hired him and I think the people around here are really feeling like for the first time in a long time there is some true optimism about this proud program that has struggled the last many years I I to I totally agree with everything that just said that the culture is starting to take fruit and grow bles makes a good move and the point guard on the low block a bucket plus a foul how often do you see the point guard go down there on the right block and post up they they tried to close R now a couple times he came up with nothing so okay well take our Mighty little man and throw him down on that block he throws that right shoulder right into the chest of the defender gets that contact and finishes the play very rare Miss free throw man Stanford has been making free throws at an incredibly High clip in conference play but no threepoint play Miami on offense now a little fumble the point guard Huga chuku thats State McCrae jump shot no good and a rebound for ROV yeah right now all he does is gobble rebounds when they come off the defense of glass so try to get out and run when he gets a clean look in a board nice pass to sers for three Blakes found him well the unselfishness of this basketball team will be on display for 40 minutes tonight they really have a high comaraderie love playing with one another love sharing the ball making the extra pass s McCrae making his move sellers no good R just rips down the defensive board he he can Rebound in his own position but he can also go out of his position cross the lane and and grab rebounds look hes posted up on that block he loves so much squares and faces Raina a little spin move b line draws a foul yeah and thats where kids going to struggle its the one its the one ability to cut off the first move bareno so good on that block with his footwork hes got a variety of moves to counter any defense that he first faces in that time getting Baseline is where he likes to live he can operate so well between between that Baseline and the backboard with those long limbs that he has 71 senior from Paris France who has gotten better and better and better as his career has gone on stuck around to play Under Kyle Smith and hes having a monster year look at this one right here now see he has a chance to to survey the defense realizing that hes got no help on the kids got no help down on that Baseline and he just spins Baseline and operates I had a chance to talk to his folks uh last week in North Carolina after the weight came and hes a a fine young man he I interviewed him yesterday and he is well spoken articulate just wants to win loves playing for the Cardinal kid kind of off balance but Chucks that one in theres the first basket from the floor for Miami you dont normally teach that job hook fading away from the basket you like to get your momentum going to the basket but kit still found a way to to get that one in the hole great pass and adall lays it in there is a Smith staple give the ball to your big guy and play through him nice caught by Ryan back door for the easy juice I love AR agal when hes going to the basket somewhere Pete gorilla is smiling that was the old school give and go yeah that thats thats definitely Princeton basketball 90s basketball plac that youre big either in the low post or the high post agar wall feeling it in and out raino offensive rebound now hell pop out thought about the three hell take the three go yeah ly kid not wanted to come that far out hes going to have to make some adjustments he knows that Reno can beat him off the dribble drive so he doesnt want to give up too much ground to get too close to him but you know he let him that much time to lace up the laces hes going to knock it down he made in their last game at Carolina little package you showed to start the game he showing it and now he gets the block shot Maxim REO doing it on both ends Music Blakes will reset Jaylen Blakes down the lane all the way flips it up and in well he rejected r no stream caught the defense trying to play towards the screen side and had a straight line to the basket that will not make coach 4 happen Johnson down the lane a block called against Reno no shot but a foul against Stanford so were going to keep it here Miami get the first point of the game since then Maxine Reno has sort of Taken charge hasnt he yeah doing a nice job here in his first five and a half minutes obviously a defensive stopper in that painted area and can he pass the ball great Court Vision love that one there slip it between two Defenders and then step outside knock down one of your threepoint shots that you get a clean look at hes got five points to go along with three rebounds and an assist and a block shot to start this basketball game just a stat cheat stuffer thats a good five minutes to start the game for maxim Reno thats a week that was like a weeks worth of work from when I played in the pros so one of the best players in the country leading the way for this Stanford team trying to have a a building year under their first your head coach you see Miamis record its been ugly Jim Lena resigns things have gone downhill since then you cant blame the interrupt coach Bill Courtney its just sort of falling apart for the Hurricanes but you know it feels like a big game for Stanford to try to take advantage get a home game against a team thats struggling lets build on that big win in Chapel Hill I think thats been the rallying cide yeah and I had a chance to talk to the coaching staff and they said that their big Focus was hey its easier to handle adversity than it is to handle sucess so trying to get these guys locked in dont look at the opponent lets just keep doing what were doing to get victories like the the one that they had in Chapel Hill and the dean doome and I got to be honest watching them in practice yesterday this is a team thats fired up and hungry for a little bit more of that success yeah look I I know Carolina this isnt a classic youre youre AAR heel this maybe isnt one of their alltime great teams thats not a stretch but for for a Stanford team thats looking for Signature wins looking to build some confidence not just internally but at this school where basketball has been such a big deal over the years you beat Carolina in Carolina you come back home and people are talking about you 100 And you know thats like going into Kentucky and getting a win at rep Arena or Indiana and get one there this one right here the inbounder always the most dangerous one the floor and Blakes who played at Duke I asked him yesterday was that personal little Duke Carolina thing that you had there he said no I just wanted to get the win for my teammate but he absolutely loved it came up big with the hero shot now Stanford started their conference play against their longtime Pack 12 Rivals Cal with a road win its been a tough schedule Road games at Clemson at pit at wake at Carolina they took care of business at home the only two home games Tech and Virginia Stanford won both of those yeah theyre theyre theyre doing a nice job and I and I like that you know the team is focused Music and we welcome those of you joining us from K State and Baylor Dave Fleming Scott Williams here at Maples Pavilion the home of the Stanford Cardinal coming off a win against the Carolina Tar Heels over the weekend back home finally Miami A Long Way from Home struggling and its been a struggle in these first few minutes for the Hurricanes 143 is Stanfords lead quick shot left side in and out no good REO on the bench after a very productive first 5 minutes Maxim Reno Stanfords star player not on the court at the moment yeah he does a little bit of everything you know 15 double doubles leads the nation already five and three and they go inside theyre just tearing up Miami with the back door action from the top of the floor thats oiah sers so Jaylen Blakes transfer from duke oiah sers transfer from USC big reason why Stanfords taken a step forward this year thats been a Difference Maker for the Cardinals transfers have been hard to come by with admissions here at Stanford they finally sort of have permission to go out and recruit maybe one or two a year and its made a huge impact on this particular Stanford team yeah one right now goes out at Sailors and sellers and Blakes time they know that they got to produce they had 26 points on the road in Wake in the first half because know was in foul trouble what pass young missed it went back to dunk it after his offensive rebound and got blocked on that one well you know what you cant fa against RI no block of the rim how about that an answer for the Stanford defense well nothings coming easy tonight for Miami you got to get Cleveland going hes their best player their top dog and hes stuck on the launch pad right now you got to find a way to get him isolated on the left wing where he likes to sers tough pullup shot beautiful well on balance on time so you get that one two dribbles left thats a rhythm shot that he has shot hundreds if not a thousand times he is very efficient has been especially in conference play really shooting the ball well Cleveland totally out of control kid offensive rebound on the Miss and trying to pass out of the double team passed it to the Stanford bench you can see Cleveland The Savvy senior wanted to try to get himself going by get to the basket but look at Sellers just that hesitation move surveys the defense the defender got to go with the roll guy gave him six feet free to operate to get a clean look at the front of the rim sers checks out of the game sers shooting 52 in ACC play 50 from threepoint land thats getting it done aara chis aakar the transfer from Harvard takes it to the basket scores with a foul just came in the game and an immediate chance for a threepoint play well you can roll a red com uh red carpet with a big S down there in the middle of the paint cuz every Stanford basketball player has received the message from Cod Smith to attack in the interior of this Hurricanes defense right now and they are just getting gutted inside its 21 to3 this is the the canes needed to keep this close early to give them themselves a chance Stanford has a tough time closing out games cuz theyre o not that deep but if get a 20point lead at a halftime I dont think the canes can recover Austin Schwarz passes to his fellow freshman Jalil Betha two very talented young players who just havent really put it together in Long stretches for Miami be a big time recruit got his defender in the air and draws foul well there you go right young freshman threw him for uh Cleveland was trying to do draw that contact get to the line visualize that ball going through the basket watching the ACC on ESPN this beautiful Northern California night were south of San Francisco on the campus of Stanford University Cardinal with a 213 lead yeah you see that right Dave Fleming Scott Williams great to have you with us tonight Stanford trying to build off a big win against Carolina and their star has come to play so far yeah theyre off to a great start right now doing it with the D of course just one of 11 shooting right now for The KES but Maxine Reno absolutely fantastic high efficiency loves playing basketball hes a gym rat he was here two and a half hours before the game and look at those numbers it really shows why the hard work pays off nobody in the country more double doubles than raino free throw spins out hes third in the country this is everybody in college hoops in rebounding top 15 scorer and in the first 5 minutes of this game Five Points three rebound an assist a block give him another rebound as Miami goes empty from the free throw line yeah they come out with a little trap here try to just combobulate this Stanford attack a little chaos here camon did he step out no he called a timeout so the big man kind of got pinned on the sideline and instead of turning it over Stanford uses is a timeout well coach Courtney surprised coach Smith with that full cordt press and Stanford want to talk about it Miami is going to need more of that well be back right after this Miami struggling big time coming into this game and struggling in the first eight minutes here at Maples Pavilion oara attacks got cut off whipped a pass to his big man teammate camon who missed the shot from the free throw line yeah but you got to like that pass though right low to high high to low Stanford Cardinal sharing that basketball real well thats why theyre shooting over 50 in this game meanwhile Miami has made one shot from the field and thats their second a much needed basket Paul Jo B well when youre struggling to find the baskets you do two things you get to the free throw line for some points or you intact the interior and so that was a smart play getting it side away from the big guy Rayo for an easy bucket Mii trying to amp up the pressure on this end of the floor their defense has been so porous in conference play especially now a bounce pass down low good look from oara yeah Oar uh take this time when he got in that paint sometimes bigs get in that painted area and then they rush or theyll travel theyll turn the ball over but he really understood how much time he had to operate Applause Music that one just didnt have much of a shot at all well the big guy came over and shut that down for his sixth rebound Kyrie huy just kind of flung one up there now REO against huie on this end oneonone Miami really not double teaming Maxim REO with the left hand hes got everything he he hell show you every tool in that box if theyre not going to double team him hes got that right shoulder turn turn left hand hook that is not a fluke that is in his repertoire 20po lead that was a beautiful little leftand touch shot from Reno in the corner passing up the three now a three from the left side no good Ager wall took a rebound away from his teammate well Agra Walls an aggressive player hell get on that glass hell run some pick and roll some pick and pop with him he can stretch it all the way out the threepoint range hes their second leading rebounder Rayo that one was off the mark out of his hand hes made one three so far in this first half not that time now Miami air good hustle though to save it in bounds and that turns into a bucket extra hustle extra possession extra points so Miami is bad as they played in this first half theyre swing some life over these last couple minutes couple buckets inside and a midrange jumper and now theyre uh feeling a little bit better about themselves got to get some stops on this end this is where theyve had so many problems gave up 117 points last time out against SMU r on the basine I like that a little up fake to get the defender kind of up on his toes then he comes back crab dribble between his legs into that right hand hook you see the left hand hook time before and he show the righthanded hook I guess some Pro Scouts here theyre paying attention to what hes doing here in this first half there are a bunch of Scouts here tonight they have to like what theyve seen buta misses the jumper so Stanford up 20 with the ball just over halfway through the first half playing with purpose Stanford playing hard drive to the basket aara had it knocked away as he went up for the dunk yeah got to shut down that Baseline and and stop the interior attack has been giving the canes problems but look at this one more time by Reno he just surveys that defense realizing no ones going to come double teaming I take set him up by taking a couple dribbles bill will come back Baseline same thing on this side show the ball up get the defender too high and then just come back through with a little contact with that left shoulder right hand hook so R now does on both sides of the basket I mean that was not a layup that first one you just showed that was like a 9 foot little leftand kind of hook hybrid shot hes got that that was not easy now he he hes got hes got that hes just so on balance I we talked about his footwork it propels his offense he got great Court Vision he can pass the ball extremely well but his footwork down around that low block right or left side is really what makes this kid go go sit down and take a breather Maxim well keep talking about you 297 both free throws good for Stanford with 820 to go here in the first half down low kid back in the game against the young backup big man who doesnt play a whole lot on the basket for kid right over top Talis Tay yeah I love tay but thats right there thats a mismatch kid that veteran know how down there against the young fellow the freshman and he just gives them two much size and linked to to Lin kid L kid will make 65 of those little hooks within six feet of the basket agall they laid off him so he hits the three yeah AER wall can stroke that three and he knows he can stroke it and I think sometimes he falls in love with the three no one cares if he shoots a three where youre up 20 when youre in tight ball games hes at his best when hes attacking a basket look at him get down in a defensive stance hes got a real good assist to turnover ratio hes their second leading rebounder Jo B lays it in the Frenchman trying to show off in front of Maxim REO yeah went scooped it like up underneath his armpit for the bucket that was crafty and got it around agall before he had a chance to come over and try to block the shot another hard screen set by Tay aara tries to find the big man who fumbled it and lost it thats a turnover Cleveland has been quiet so far draws the foul thats where Matthew Cleveland is at his best in transition going down the middle of the lane but look at Hager wall just sits out here Lin kid out twice sagging off the big guys and hes got that threepoint shot right in the face oh e e e e all right so were were through the college football national championship I know for a lot of people the college hoop Seasons really starts now and we got a heck of a day on Saturday a quadruple header Kentucky Vander buil Duke Wake Forest and Cooper Flags just been awesome 430 Eastern on ESPN then flip it over to the night time Houston Kansas at fall gallon thats going to be a great game and then Tennessee all to finish it out in the SEC just a terrific day of college hoops on Saturday on ESPN yeah I Love College basketballs my favorite and I how about Matthew cler boy you want to talk about you kept 31 points your last game out you cant wait to get to the to the court for your next action and he just cannot buy a basket zero points Blakes tough shot came up short jayen blaks back in the game is going to feed kid Down Low T ray still in the game and kid just spun right past it still working to get a shot off it does took him a while we talk about the footwork of Ray no kid says hey watch me uh flash my footwork theres that full court press again uh it does a nice job taking get it to the young freshman so a little life from the hurricane still down big here in this first half raino at the scores table getting ready to check back in hes been Unstoppable when hes been on the court tonight looking for a screen Blakes sers knows hes got to get a shot off Blakes will shoot the three contested and its off the mark you see when Reno is out of the game they do not have that big to play through its either either sellers or Blakes but either one of them got anything going theres Matthew Cleveland welcome to the party pal nice move to get inside for an easy floater a little full court pressure again from the Hurricanes pass was deflected and Bea steals it away that jump shot way too strong and now Stanford may have some numbers well young kind of waited for that ball to get to him instead of going and attacking the ball and allowed Miami to go in there and snatch that coach Smith not liking what hes seeing out of his guys are losing some of their aggressiveness and their energy he going to get a quick timeout talk to his team hey were only up 17 in the first half we got to talk this thing over all right back here Maples Pavilion Stanford timeout the pressure from Miami had Stanford a little discombobulated I think you identified it Scott Kyle Smith wasnt real happy with the last sequence so quick timeout Reno comes back in the game and Sanfords a different team with him out there yeah theyre real good after timeouts drawing up and getting high percentage shots sers passed up a three now gets it back from Reno gets it back from Blakes three no good follow had it sort of deflected I think so the shot Off the Mark yeah he thought he had an easy foot back but somebody got that from behind and pushed it out of his uh hands a little harder he he would have wanted would have been better serf coming down with the rebound and going up with more power foul against agrawal trying to defend the much bigger Lyn kid on the low block so Stanford foul under five minutes to go first half well we had a chance to talk to coach Courtney at the shoot around this morning he said he had a very productive practice guys had High Spirits even after you know the shellacking they took 117 points they gave up to SM you said this guys were focused and so theres no quit in this Miami Hurricanes team theyre up against it right now sure theyre down by 17 but I like the way theyre fighting even though theyre not having a whole lot of success Evan Stinson comes in theres Bill cordney and not an easy spot for for Bill who takes over on an interim basis nice play that was the Freshman Donovan Young from behind just stealing it away he said enough of you backing me down up underneath this Rim let me see you just put that ball out there with one hand Im going to try slap it away Stanford probably would not have beaten the tar Hills on the road this last weekend without Donovan young hes missed a lot of the year with injury they love his upside hes got a chance to be the next really great Stanford player his three though was blocked so another jump shot blocked quickly into the front Court Cleveland on the attack Cleveland no young goes up and grabs the defensive board well thats what you like to see you get your shot blocked you dont hang your head you come back and you make a good defensive play for your teammate he got a mismatch trying to find Reno down low instead its sellers who got cut off Miami playing a little better on defense here these last few possessions certainly have picked it up only five to shoot Blakes three contested no rebound tapped to kid this is where Miamis got to attack this is a transition try to get attack before Stanford has a chance to really lock in defensively dead attack he had a nice pick by Lyn kid he took that ball all the way from the right side of the floor and took it to the left side its an8 nothing Miami run little something positive for the Hurricanes yeah you dont have to have the lead you have a little momentum and you got to be feeling a little bit better about yourself going to the locker room and they sure they would love to get this thing down to single digits before the break raino open three in and out no good so Stanfords going going a little cold on offense Hurricanes trying to take advantage and get Music closer under three minutes to go first half Cleveland cut off by young but draws a foul I think Young did a nice job initially playing defense but just kind of at the end came down with his arms so Miami will be at the free throw line on a little run when we come back to Stanford I think its been a while since Stanfords had a win like they got this past weekend on the road at the dean doome Chapel Hill final second Stanford down one Jaylen Blakes the Duke transferred doing it against the Tar Heels almost literally a true buzzer beater the gamewinning shot for Stanford on the road its got people talking here on the farm Stanford basket its look Scott its been a a a decade where Stanford has struggled first year head coach Kyle Smith 126 91 at home winning record in the ACC lot of home games lined up you got one of the best players in the country on your side Stanfords feeling optimistic oh yeah that stock stock is rising most definitely youre going to the D getting that win showing that you can win on the road out on their East Coast getting their first W in the ACC out on the the east coast and yeah theyre feeling good about themselves yeah come out here jump on the canes early now can they get this momentum back that the canes have stolen in this first half in this next 245 its a 10 nothing run and thats 4 and a half minutes without a point for Stanford which was getting everything it wanted offensively shot right side that one deflected thats I think the third jump shot thats been blocked by Miami in this first half Schwarz trailing three too strong rebound and the touch pass pass was deflected yeah maybe a little too aggressive there with that touch pass trying to get it underneath the Lyn kid could have Ben serve better serve getting a higher percentage shot Reno passes up the three so Stanford run some half court offense Blakes was double teamed and tried to find his teammate with a crosscourt pass and that was knocked out of bounds hey can we give a little credit to this Kanes defense they found themselves down by 20 points and he didnt hang their head they have come out here and deflected passes this disrupt this uh Cardinal attack and they also you blocked a bunch of shots theyre playing a lot harder nice move that time Evan Stinson who hadnt played a whole lot lately getting some minutes here in the first half how about that coach SM realizing hey I got to get some guys who want to play hard out there and get this momentum back he went to the end of his bench and found him Stinson who was committed to Washington State and Kyle Smith before Kyle took this job kid nice move how about that I understand Ry no not want to pick up a second foul but L kid absolutely went to work used his off hand really well had the rim protecting his shot look at that back oh great pass blanks had his shot blocked though Reno passes up the three bles along the basine travel hey you mentioned during our break that the Cardinal are passing up some open looks there m might be an example R know had a shot didnt get it he throws it over Cross Court and then going Baseline here just stepped out of bounds with the basketball so yeah here we are with 117 to play in Miami is looking a lot better than they were at the 10minute Mark yeah Blake steals it away and a Miami Hurricane what a weekend for the Blakes family wasnt it so Jaylen we showed you the buzzer beater against Carolina jaylens younger sister plays for vanderville Michaela is just a freshman vanderville played the very next day Sunday so Jaylen and Stanford at Carolina Saturday Michaela and Vanderbilt at home against Tennessee theyre instate Rivals great womens power program and Michaela hits a buzzer beater the day after her brother does r lay up no good excellent offensive rebound from stensson who came flying in there a rare Miss at The Rim from raino oiah sers meanwhile trying to find an opening he misses that shot raino another offensive rebound B his seventh Board of the first half sers for three Second Chance points just absolutely kill you when youre in a big hole youre trying to claw back especially when it comes out there from behind the arc so nice hard fought basket by the Cardinal they needed one they did theyve gone cold in the second half of this first half final 30 seconds Cleveland working his way in against Blakes tough shot off the rim no good rain no rebound and now Stanford is going to hold for one more look garage garage yeah they like this High pick and roll with raino these final moments pick and roll pick and pop Blakes hits Reno extra pass in the corner open three no good rebound Miami and the heave is going to come up short Stanford will go to the locker room with a 16point lead yeah Stanford did with the basketball game kids leading him in scoring Clevelands only got four points so you know hes got about 14 more in him hurricanes have the ball to start the second half chuku finds Cleveland that three goes down so theres the first one well you got to love that right there right you go inside all the Defenders is shrink down below that free throw line and then you find one of your best players with a wide open look wow hard foul Blakes got decked I you know thats one of those ones you got two young men fighting real hard for the ball and he get knocked down but you got to love that right there get Cleveland going this half he really struggled in the first half couldnt get anything to go then then goes Blakes he posted up big in that first half I think that Miami Heat excuse me the Hurricanes were determined not to let him operate on that low block again R his first shot of the second half came up short Here Comes Miami out on the Move Clevelands going to attack with the left hand nice finish how good is he at just going right at that shot Blocker in transition and then at the last minute after youve gotten some contact you switch it to that left hand and get it away from the shot blocker tell you what this games not over Miami on a 5 nothing run to start the half leads down to 11 wild shot somehow Blake spun it in he really did spin that in I mean he put a lot of English on that ball and hit out by the American flag on the backboard and swung all the way back into the hoop that was like a trick shot from Jaylen Blakes call that one in horse dont you yeah you you have to call it kid no good rebound REO look at Reno attacking that glass once again now give nine points nine boards big big time rebounder third in the country in rebounds Blakes finds Rayo little off balance so he caught got kid in the air and scores he got offensive rebound in the first half where he tried to go up with it he got poked away from behind this time he got that ball down low gathered went up with more power around the basket theres number 10 well again 16th double double uh on the uh season leading everybody in college basketball wide open sellers three no good rebound who the call against its on stample this was the trick shot we were talking about seriously he drives the ball hard to the basket hes got long arm kid coming over and another Defender and somehow he squirted between two of them but he had very little room to get the ball up so he had to use the side of the backboard and like you said he just spun it real hard like youd spin a top and it spun right into the hole trying to go back door I mean that that thing was watch that Replay that wasnt anywhere near the square I mean that was that was oh man I I dont know when the last time I saw one that spun that much no I I used to see Michael Jordan do some phenomenal things up and around and over the rim but that was every but as good as anything I saw him do yeah hear that MJ try that offensive rebound put back no good and Johnson fighting hard his shot rejected just cant finish around the basket theyre really struggling shooting under 30 in this game and youre getting some high percentage looks but you give a card a lot of credit they dont give up anything easy underneath R hands off to Applause sellers R posting up against kid banging down low no good I love to see the old school big guys banging on the Block quickly into the front court that shot misses ball knocked out of bounds off of Miami I can watch that on all night you know just kid on one block at one end Rayo on another block at the other end and Coach Courtney he not real happy right now with the score but hes got to be happy with the way his team has come out of the locker room and has fought here in these first three minutes I mean way better effort we we dont want to bager the point and belabor it but they gave up 117 in a nonovertime game last timeout against SMU three on Two and a bad pass Blakes did not see state McCrae coming from behind he stole it away heres Schwarz on the move and that was not a good pass on this end getting a little sloppy out here guys got to take care of and value that basketball Reno skips it young got fouled when you go to a and you went to Stanford practice yesterday when you watch Kyle Smith run a practice when Stanford turns the ball over hes not shy about telling his team how he feels about it not real happy about that at all and he he want he Harps another thing he harps on is rebounding the basketball when his guys get on that glass especially offensive glass hes quick to run over and give somebody a pat on the backside like good job R three good Ray no is doing a little bit of everything tonight inside buckets he stroked a couple triples now hes got himself a double double hes sharing the basketball with his teammate for some easy back door layups this kids a total package grew up in Paris playing with Victor wanyama as a kid played a lot of basketball together Cleveland little midrange jumper so Cleveland starting to get himself going now right four points in the first half hes got seven here already in the second basketball in France for French basketball the national teams excellent lays it in that his work early he got kid on his back great entry from his teammate all he had to do was catch and finish he might be on his way to one another one of those 25o Music efforts kid down low trying to spin around raino ball knocked out of bounds Stanford Applause ball that takes us to the timeout well we told you he played well in the first half and hes kept it going here in the second have well I love this right here right just a little pick let me pop back out here you take my Defender with you and give me a clean look at the threepoint line and then ples what a circus shot that thing hit at the very top right corner of the backboard and spot in the bucket stford on a roll well this is definitely one of the biggest games of the year in womens college basketball and because of all the winter weather its been

see it there in big script one of the alltime great coaches mens or womens college basketball agar wall shoots the three good agall patient threepointer nice swing of basketball move that ball from side to side your percentages go up drastically I mean you see him shoot like that and then you think hows he shooting 25 for the year hes known as a shooter when he gets on balance hes much better I think sometimes hes rushing his shot trying to make sure he gets one up but that one that thats perfectly Im already on balance you gave me a great bounce pass just a bit outside my shooting pocket but he grabs it pulls it in gets in that shooting Pockets got plenty of time no time for the defense to close out because the ball has been swung from side to side and he knocks it down I like Ryan agall this kid can play yeah and you pointed it out in the first half hes not just a shooter he defends different positions hes Stanfords second leading rebounder good assist to turnover ratio just a good allaround player yeah High basketball like he was the kind of guy you want on your squad almost played none at all under the last head coach here so Jed has didnt give him a lot of minutes and Kyle Smith has come in and made him a featured player and hes Blossom whips a pass in the corner thats Chisum oara the Harford transfer made some nice plays in the first half finds REO three again its hard not to be impressed by the way this Stanford team shares the basketball and they got Shooters one through five that can space the floor left side jumper that ones good just a two along long two raino said something to Joe Bay maybe a little French uh talk on the court think those guys have hooked up in some summertime action I mean we asked Paul job at didit play against raino a three it is raining raino threepoint shots here in Palo Alto you know what I was saying it smells better on this campus than most universities Ive ever been to you explain it wi to me I forgot why but its R Sweden right here inside this arena for know as hes dropping threes left and right come on the California Redwoods in the wintertime rain the eucalyptus trees I love it I tell you what I give you a little spot up here it just smells good you live some place in the desert you dont got these kind of smells hard to beat being here on the farm Benny geler agar wall goes Baseline and dumps it off nice pass car VES again the sharing of the basketball is a pretty thing to watch you know I got to do the the FSU Stanford game on Friday Im so excited to watch this team again because they play the right way look at the big man using his wheels and transition running the floor and he tried to dunk it home got fouled well I said he might be at one of those 25 Point nights and sure enough but you come out and you start finding the basket from the threepoint line like Ray no had has tonight and his teammates realizing hey hes got it stuck on automatic lets get the big 42 the basketball he has knocked out what is that four triples for this young man shoot shooting it running the floor rebounding hes got his Nation leading 16th double double leading the conference in points and rebounds per game I mean look there is an interesting discussion Cooper flag has been just fantastic and its hard to argue with how great hes played youd have to say hes the favorite to be the conference player of the year yeah and his numbers arent as good as Ros because he plays less minutes sometimes theyre up by 25 or 30 points and hes not even playing the final 10 12 minutes of a basketball game so I understand Cooper flag as the player of the year in the ACC but it wasnt for flag you got to give it to this guy right now he doesnt want yeah and as as great as flag has been you can still make a pretty decent argument that this kid has just been better than everybody yeah you know he got 24 points hes got the 10 boards he just checked out dont know if were going to see him again tonight still a lot of time left in this one but up by 25 I think not Smith will take a long hard thought before he puts him back in his basketball game there are a lot of pro Scouts to see him tonight though he might get a little more ac they may have seen what they needed to see shot fake and the ball knocked away saved in bounds agar wall way outside for three oh I guess hes feeling a little confidence I guess its contagious you know when one big guy steps out of the game the other big guy comes in he St shooting triples ball knocked out of bounds itll stay with Miami and send us to a timeout burans made a little push but Stanford has answered in a big way and the outside shots have been a part of it Ryan Ager wall showing off the range Music Stanford up big second half well see if we see Maxim Reno in the game again he and his assistant coach Eric reveno one of the best big man coaches in college basketball having a laugh on the sidelines 24 points 10 rebounds one thing that reveno didnt do in his great Stanford career he wasnt making four or six from threepoint range well a lot to smile about when your big man stroking like you said stroking from the outside and youre up by 28 points and the Warriors general manager at front row seat hes been watching raino knocked down those threes I look you played a long time in the NBA part of being a big man in that League these days is making outside shots being able to to go outside and score what do you think Maxim raino have a have a spot at the next level I cant believe Mike would not have be impressed by what he has seen tonight he he shot he was a big in the NBA that like to shootter from the outside and hes got one of the best threepoint Shooters in the history of the game on his Club so in Steph Curry so hes got to be impressed with what he saw not only did he knock down triples he showed great ability on both blocks with both hands he had great Port vision and he attacked the glass Tim boards Steve Curry your old teammate from the Chicago Bulls has talked at times this year Warriors have been struggling lately one thing Kur talked about is the Warriors dont have that sort of traditional big man who can stretch the floor who can go outside cavon Looney is not that kind of player Trace Jackson Davis as good as hes been is not that kind of player the Warriors are sort of looking for a big man who can knock down shots from the outside they got one right down the road here and r no i would be uh if you got they have a late mid the late early second if hes still available I I think hes an absolute no brainer cant miss in that position all right done lefy that ones on us for free Im going to that Warrior Im going bu my old team the pools are playing The Warriors tomorrow I got to go check it out you got to see your old Club Cleveland on the break LS it in you know something about Matthew Cleveland he had a poor first half but he has really shown his ability here in the second half he got 13 points uh in under 10 minutes here in the second half so good from me outside so good in transition just always on balance three missed but the young big man The Freshman Aiden camman went for the offensive rebound and draws a foul 10 and a half minutes to go and Kyle Smith is not going to ice his star player for the rest of the game REO coming back in well you know they dont play again till Saturday afternoon so theyll probably take tomorrow off so hes figuring hey I might as well get another five minutes out four or five minutes out of this young fellow tonight and then and then go have him go ice down his knees after that or if hes going to try to shoot another three hes got three threes from this left side see if he gets up another shot from behind the arc on that left side gives it up sets a screen and gets it back little midrange well he hadnt shown that one yet right he could have taken one power dribble and dunked him he said hey I Haven showed him my little mini floater from the right side here from the third block yeah see I like thats smart play cuz dun Les on that side so he went over to Dun Le side yeah you want to get a good look at this how about this one I love it this is the guy I like Benny Keller he plays so hard in practice like hes not like the sixth guy he was a walk on he was he he walked on and they gave him a scholarship he plays so hard yeah and hes good shooter hes a little undersized and hes a scrapper though he is you know every team needs a Benny on their squad right like this dude just goes and hell take a charge hell hell put his nose down go for a steal he doesnt care if he gets cracked upside the nogget he plays every possession like its his lap one thing about playing for Kyle Smith if youre not a starter youre not guaranteed a lot of minutes Kyle Smith runs a pretty tight shift leans on those starting five pass down low for the layup theres some good sharing in the basketball was singing praises of these uh Stanford team its Miami team sharing the basketball here late in a game where theyre finding themselves trailing big that was Kyrie huy who laid it in R against his fellow countrymen had it knocked out of bounds yeah one the first time a few times that theyve actually double teed raino they waited for him to dribble at once then they went down and tried to double him and and they almost got that turnover geler checks out of the game sellers back in for Stanford hes played well tonight shot clock winding down Blakes down low R pushed off they call the offensive foul yeah down there I think I I dont know if it was Lynn excuse me Cleveland Matt Cleveland on him down there but giv up a lot of inches yeah Clevelands down here trying to bang with the big F goes oh no Im in a bad way but r no Panic just a little bit ball wasnt as high as he would have liked it so he had to use that off left forearm to push Cleveland out of the way when you throw that one to the big guy you got to throw up by the square and let it come down where only he can get it in and out no good rebound Stanford has it you know Stanford they did a hor job they tried to throw it again inside they try to feed him noriz and hes only got a few more minutes on the court and but but Stanford did a better job I think here in this second half really Limited in Miami to just one shot and choked off the middle when they got on that 10 run they were able to get to the middle they were able to get to the free throw line they were able to get some offensive rebounds they they have tightened all that up here in the second half chuku had it knocked away thats a turnover EV Stinson back in for Stanford so Stanford using its depth a little more than usual with the big lead back door nice pass Reno found Jaylen Blakes well Blakes moves good without the basketball this kid is so improved from when he was at Duke and his three years at Duke only 166 shots hes already over 175 shots here on the season for Miami in only a half a year excellent effort defensively numbers ston with the left hand got rewarded and a timeout Miami yeah Miami a good time timeout this thing is getting real ugly now the lead is balloon the largest of the of the game at 30 points 6838 Stanford trying to build on its momentum a big at home so much great college hoops on Saturday at quadruple header on ESPN number nine Kentucky and Vanderbilt at 230 Eastern number two Duke been spectacular lately Wake Forest good team thats at 430 Eastern Houston Kansas big game in the Big 12 630 and Tennessee Auburn two top 10 teams in the SEC to finish it off number one Auburn Bruce Pearl who many years ago was an assistant here at Stanford at the very beginning of his career thatll be a fun one Im really looking forward to the AC mat ACC match up between Duke and wake that a hunter Salis hes worth the price of ad and of course Cooper flag my goodness I dont like to give those du guys a lot of credit but he can play yeah speaking of Cooper I think he cemented his status as the number one overall pick in the upcoming NBA draft he has been great so Duke and wake this weekend ACC game here tonight in Maples timeout well be back to paloalto after this Music for Music yeah well Monday huddle crew reveals this seasons ACC football schedule breaking down every team coverage of the twohour special begins at 9 Eastern over on acc Network and the ESPN app and look whos here the now General manager of the Stanford football program the great Andrew Luck one of the alltime Andrews in the second row there in the red and the glasses heve been around campus we see him a lot when we come to to paloalto but now officially in a GM role sort of a pioneering role that was created for him I loved watching him quarterback in the NFL he was so good well Sanford obviously a great history here of football and quarterback in particular sellers for three no Reno gets a rebound and a bucket all in one well just so good at using his length right I mean gu when you train with Wim Yama uh in the all season and playing against the guys 74 you going to pick up a few things right yeah hes picked up a few that shot is no good ball tipped around Miami comes away with it Joe Bay whos from lay France not Paris more like northern France you got that French tongue you said that your pronunciation was excellent just rolls right off I I I I got to get to France I I I think Im one of the only people in America that has not been to Paris yeah do do you like food and culture and wine look at the size of me you you think I would me miss a good meal so you got to get to Paris Andrew so Stanford talk a little more about Maxim REO just how good well look where he starts right so he does his work early he gets the smaller Defender kind of clamps him down on that left side so he realizes I got anything middle into the right side hes got 28 and 12 lets see if Stanford tries to get him one more bucket get to that 30 point threshold and then maybe take the rest of the night off yeah he has scored 30 points points twice uh 30 plus points twice this this season so yeah maybe they would try to get him one more bucket here in the final six minutes shot clock winding down good little pass to find an open shooter and aara knocks down the three from Stinson listen uh this is a fun team to watch you got the big guy down there that really does a great job leading his Squad not only with his play but with his vocal leadership and here goes another one by blank oh boy jayen Blakes wow that was a heck of a finish well whatever he got a taste of with that game winner in North Carolina he really likes because this kid has a good ability hes got and he he might do it again oh my goodness nobody spins it off the backboard like jayen Blakes whos had three spectacular plays in this game well that even got a Andrew Luck out of his chair because this one right here he knew he had the defender closing on him and he was only going to be able to put one hand on I know about that touchdown celeration but we got to work on that but then this one of here he knows how to float from one side underneath the ribon to the other then spin that thing off the glass boy they have busted this thing open in the last 3 minutes if it wasnt already broke before I hope I hope his sisters watching tonight its late night back in Tennessee if uh the vanderbild womens team is at home but uh we were talking to Jaylen we told the story about how he hit the buzzer beater in Chapel Hill on Saturday his sister the very next day against Tennessee a buzzer beater of her own Michaela Blakes who might end up being the Freshman of the year in the SEC shes been big time hustle play literally at the buzzer to win the game for Vanderbilt thats a good weekend for the Blakes family well it sure is you always got to defend the def the person taking the ball out of bounds but she went for 24 points with the game winner to knockoff number 15 Tennessee the instate Rivals I mean just a freshman playing in the SEC Jaylen told us he was in the training room watching the game and saw it live as it happened and was very proud of his little sister yeah yeah thats a proud family obviously uh his father Monroe was at the game jayen good move nice entry pass and the layup for Stanford Jaylen said his sister was a dancer early on and kind of came late to basketball I dont know how late but wasnt always a basketball player but took to it pretty naturally kid with the catch and score well I would think that dancing would help help you with your foot right help you with your Mobility your flexibility be able to get the different areas on the court and shes certainly ended up getting to the front of the rim where her team needed her be in that final second to throw that thing in the basket ball knocked out of bounds Timeout on the floor with under four minutes to go all Stanford here at Maples Pavilion at jail and Blakes man what a great story hes been his sister dad Monroe the Blakes have had a lot to smile about havent they love it doesnt get much better than Music that well it has been maximum raino tonight here in paloalto this kid has done it absolute everything the Up and Under moves using his length around the basket stepping out behind the threepoint Arc and knocking down shots and did he get on the glass hes got 12 rebounds three on the offensive end to go along with 28 points Cardinal shooting 68 in the second half because R know is doing his darn thing here in this basketball game two assists two steals two blocks the double double pretty impressive night for one of the best players in college basketball that not enough folks talk about geler misses the three and if you werent as impressed enough with Maxim reos basketball game he will graduate this spring from Stanford with a degree in mathematics and computer science yeah theres another good look at his numbers all put together there the 10is 17 we talked about the four triples the 12 boards 16 double doubles leading all of college basketball just an impressive stat line uh this this evening I had a chance to talk to him after practice yesterday he even plays chess he and wiim Bama were playing chess this summer getting wiim Bama ready for the Olympics I want to challenge them to a game I got a chess boort really Im not too Im not too good I play on chesscom I to play with all these people all around the world uh and I but I I love to play it relaxes me and I think you know thats what so good about Chess youre always thinking a couple moves ahead and I think thats what Ray no does out here on the basketball court Applause another Miss three from Benny geler whos not happy hes usually a very good shooter Cleveland gets it back and dumps it home with a foul how about that move I told you Clevelands got bunnies he aint just a threepoint shooter againsts a slasher and he can finish at the rim for his 21st point of the evening so coming off of that 31point game right here says hey I know were getting beat Im going to show everybody in this building that can take it to the rack and finish overhand a lot of work to do for this Miami program look they have had plenty of recent success theyve been to a final four in the last couple of years but their coach resigns midseason you know Hall of Fame caliber coach Jim Lenas one of the greats oh yeah coach Al Sure Fire Hall of Famer but but quits in the middle of the Year this team is going to be 0 and8 in ACC play and it just seems like a much longer time ago that they were in the final four this programs got some work to do yeah and you know whether its coach Courtney or or somebody else at the helm next year uh they theyre going to have to do what coach Smith has done with this scanr program start to develop a culture uh of playing hard playing defense rebounding the ball and and taking care of the basketball too many turnovers too many easy buckets inside for the Cardinals tonight Anthony Batson in for the first time for Stanford Cameron Grant getting a chance to play he hadnt got many minutes this year number 24 Jaylen Thompson also a rare appearance thats an attacks missed the shot Thompson tried to get the offensive rebound its batted around and out of bounds off of Miami well Batson wasted no time he put it in attack mode soon as he stepped on the court he drove that Baseline hard had it Rim out on him but I love the kids energy you s on that bench for a long time you can get stiff this kid came in ready to perform Cleveland checks out final 218 here Stanfords going to be 5 and three in ACC play this is the start of a stretch where they get five of six conference games at home yeah they had a very Road heavy and a difficult schedule to start conference play you start to look around the ACC Stanford has a chance to work its way up close to the top of the league standings yes they sitting in that seventh hole right now in the standings they got Florida State coming in here uh team that lost at at Cal tonight first free throw camon is good Australia in open coverage continuing down under tonight at 330 am eastern of course if youre out here on the West Coast its only 1230 not that late on ESPN ESPN plus you get the womens semis s Linka and Bosa and then Madison Keys and EA spon semis tonight starting in what less than three hours Cameron Grant grabs a rebound maybe some of his uh fellow fraternity members are standing behind us its possible certainly a fan favorite to be sure hell shoot the three about that it never surprises me when you see somebody do something good on the defensive end get a steal get a block grab a boord and how all a sudden their next trip down to the offensive end they find a ball in their hand and they knock down a shot I love I love the reaction from the bench when a walkon gets a chance to play and does something like that well thats when you know you got good team come rery right like every you know how hard these guys work on a scout team preparing them uh in practice to Pro come out and perform like this so theyre happy for him when they do something positive Thompson three no good Grant rebound he sticks it in hes doing a little bit of everything hes two for two hes got four points in a board how about this young man A 1 two 3 4 five says Maxim REO a career first for Cameron Grant final 45 seconds that three goes down from Joe Bay Music and now substitutions Stanford will get the young big man back in the game T ray and Cole cner will also check in how about Cameron gr pretty cool yeah I love that one right there I I only got gave him credit for two he knocked down a triple over there on that left side and look at thats what I love about rain now first guy off that bench cheering on the uh the walk on Cameron Grant had played 10 total minutes all year before this little Outburst this is a game he will never forget he going to go home and rewatch this one as soon as he gets back to the dormatory yeah were talking about you Cameron Batson at the free throw line makes the first hey do these guys even stay in dormitories any anym are they get like some off campus you know uh lost style uh crib at Stanford you probably more likely than at most places to be still in the dorms they had us in dormitories back in the 80s I guys probably got great Applause Apartments wow did he 360 that he did Ive said reverse it was a 360 he went full 360 on him there at the end of the game could they oh did they tee him up oh it might have teed him up for hanging on the rim but look at that one more time the young man spunt it all the way around wow and then hung on the board hung on the rim a little too long the officials werent having any of it go let them have some fun yeah they dont like fun the 360 dunk from Anthony Batson well someone this kid came in he was ready to go right like he already had it in high gear on that first drive and then getting this one in transition he thre his arm up like hey hit me down here let me show the fans what I can do Above the Rim this is the most exciting minute of a blowout game you could
