CCC scoring leader and we are set to go Carolina had 15 and3 the Demon Deacons at 135 opening tip batted out weve got a good crew here Roger AES Ron Gro and Bert Smith thats a final four level crew officiating this game it absolutely is and for a big game when you consider these two teams right at the top of the ACC going at it on our first big Monday of the Season what else will we have here other than this crew exactly right North Carolina will get their first track at it number three in the country the tar Hills moving up one spot in the AP pole late this afternoon and is behind both Yukon and Purdue Ryan will kick heres Davis with the first one on the way and two strong great execution Hubert Davis talked about what they wanted on their first look in two round today they got the best player and RJ Davis with a wide open look just unable to knock it down big guy Reed will hand off to bopy Miller Salis handling it here 18 points a game and hell knock down the first one and he is a legit scorer when you talk about the ACC scoring leaders Hunter Sal is right at the top in North Carolina their starting lineup itll be Davis and Bott leading the way experienced focused team this North Carolina group Harrison Ingram is the glue guy on a team that really plays well together they really do great chemistry from this North Carolina team even Steve Forbes talked about thats what the first thing that he saw watching film with Carolina is how great these guys play together and get along all backing down going in strong bayai came over to harass him and its going to be out of play off the Demon Deacons and look at their starting lineup that includes Salis Miller and hildra they can all make threepointers so can Carr all 38 or better Reed is a sevenfooter with a lot of energy his Ingram straight on but that wont drop itll be 80 of the Wake fource Dema starting lineup transfers only Cameron Hilder started his career as wake Steve for has done a great job identifying guys on the quarter that fit into their system you said I I think part of it is people like you Ive been coaching for a long time I know a lot of guys I know a lot of coaches a lot of people in the game and I havent made a lot of enemies 8 seconds left on the clock HTH on the drive kind of a wild shot off balance shot clock was winding Applause down Ingram kicks it out Ryan off the fake a twopointer coming and knocks that down North Carolina on the board smart play by corac Ryan did a great job running him off the line but the wable pullup to get to his spot to see the basketball go through for the first time for the heels Ryan get about 11 points a game 25y old we talk about an experienced team North Carolina oozes that heres car he can make 40 beyond the threepoint line back out for Miller shot clock to five ly Miller trying to make a move heres a triple and rebounded by cor M Ryan one of the things you dont see is anyone from Wake four is going to the glass thats how much they fear North Carolina in transition Davis with a quick step on the Music reverse talk about a quick step yeah and too easy to allow the accs leading score to get a easy bucket like that to get his confidence going you want to make RJ Davis work for everything Salis working hard in the paint hes got four quick points steady score he had 20 against Utah and Virginia Tech 21 against Virginia BC on the drive the Freshman Kau cant finish it and itll be knocked out of play by North Carolina were talking about Steve Forbes fourth year at the helm for the Demon Deacons 19 wins last season was not enough to reach the NCAA tournament Huber Davis year number three for the Tar Heels team getting 83 points a game theyve been one of the top offensive teams in the country most of the season and OB both these coaches surprising ly very relaxed in their shoot arounds today had a lot of conversation with us talking but of course the tensions raised once you get to this point we on bot hooks it short with the board its a match up willll be watching all night both guys from Richmond Virginia have a pass in history with each other know each other very well so seeing the two of them going at it here today making a lot of people in the 804 proud Davis back out for B way down thats certainly not his game tied at four in the early minutes Salis 40 out there but no theyre coming off making 18 threes against Louisville 18 but Steve for has made it clear we cannot fall in love with that especially against North Carolina simply because those long misses lead the fast break opportunity Bott batted toward the lane Bott had it for a moment got it free heres Davis whos great on the fake but cant connect thats what what Fon Reed has brought to this Wake Forest team averaging close to nine rebounds per game on the season and they are a much better team since he became eligible December 5th because he mans the glass and mans the paint for that gives him Rim protection also a guy that can knock down a jumper as well at 14 rebounds against ruers 14 against Boston College he attacks the glass hes going to shoot a long one here A B Teams chilly beyond that threepoint line early on North Carolina defends that line so well Ingram really went into Reed who commits the personal foul he attacked the sevenfooter he absolutely did went to the sevenfooter chest is a great job being aggressive in transition as Harrison Eng so a 44 Titar Hills toughening up on defense they are playing D more on that when we come back 44 game after the first timeout as we bring in Angel grey Angel for years it was rebound and go that fast break for North Carolina absolutely well right now the tar Hills are on an eight game win streak and its mainly because not just their effectiveness on the offensive in but their connectedness on the defensive end and thats something that was instilled in them before the season actually coach Davis had his team watch a documentary that was titled excuse me that was titled a journey to a title and Doc Rivers talked about what that needed to be in the Playbook there Kevin Garnett stated I was where I was supposed to be because someone was where they needed to be if were going to win thats how we have to win with the fourth best defensive efficiency in the country guys it really does look like the tar Hills are bought in how about this last two games North Carolina has not allowed a fast break point and and thats really just paying attention to the scouting report but also the effort in the energy thats required to be a great defensive team R David is Davis is getting that from his group right now and these guys are locked in defensively theyve heard enough about how you dont play defense at North Carolina these guys have set out to to change that narrative on how they look like theyre cold shooting it Andys first five thats for sure nearly thrown away tremble there on the Baseline looked to save it and it was over the line so itll be Wes ball and heres just a little bit of evidence of how great they are defensively you see cor M Ryan fighting under the screen getting back in front of his Defender great individual oneonone defense but this is where it gets better RJ Davis stays in the passing Lane the switch pass Ingam not even allowing an easy look on that possession and R Carr working on Applause Bott right for prson into the ball game now hell get it up a shot clock expires well that was on Q talking about the D it absolutely is and again there was no one from Wake for even knew that they were low on the shot clock but North Carolina was still in the stance down I mean Steve Forbes knew hes not happy about that but no one else was paying attention to it but North Carolina was locked in defensively will continue of guarded past the shot clock seven opponents ACC play 70 points or fewer heres Ryan got a good look but that clangs away still having trouble with the threepoint shot 29 beyond the threepoint line Carolina oh for six from threepoint land so far it is a little chilly in the building though its a little colder in here they not knew they were expecting a big crowd often times in todays day I guess you dont turn the heat up when you know youre going to have a big crowd 20000 people sure in the dean Dome watch this one and off for Hildreth 6port Jr from Worthing England gets into the painted area got it downstairs and a late whistle no basket a foul on the play as we take a look at how wake is doing on the road brought to you by Hampton by Hilton as Carr gets to the line and one thing they do be at home or on the road is make their foul shots look at that 80 at home 84 on the road they are the number one fou shooting team in the conference number two in the country and thats such a luxury to have as a coach with Steve fors you look at this graphic you know W force is 110 on the season at home and so you look at the ability to be able to go to free throw line of course we talk about it Andrew car misses one Im going to blame that on you OB Im not going to take the responsibility Davis pulls up midrange no right away RJ Davis with a cold start buth looking to get a pass off and its tipped away stolen by Carolina that was great Hands by amondo deot stripping the basketball and then being able to chase it down after Ryan loses it but thats just an example once again of the and effort paid on the defensive end of the floor J Davis shoveling that one up there and hes got four now North Carolina in front by Applause one on a high post car Salis trying to get into it offensively and cant sink that jump shot with the difference with Sal getting into the painted area that time hes going up against Seth Trimble whos a much larger Defender so it makes it more difficult for him to make that shot on the line there and draws the foul jayen Withers gets hit 69ine grad whos really been playing well particularly the last three games hes averaging 11 points per game coming off the bench draws the foul from Carr thatll be his first and and jayen Withers was a absolute Difference Maker against his former team the Louisville Cardinals on this floor two games to go you see the numbers 113 points per game only three 36 but one of the things that Hubert Davis has talked about is hes fit in from a personality standpoint doesnt complain about minutes he doesnt get this does the best with what he can Ryan gets another good look it wont fall for him Miller wants to push it Tu about fast and Ryan was equal to the task and batted it away to prevent fast break points yeah corack Ryan did a great job getting back defensively but got a good look on the offensive end a shot that he would normally make unable to get it going and for Ryan you know this is a six year in college hes an experienced player hes going to continue to work hard on the defensive end of the floor do all the other things to help his team win and eventually shots will fall hes 25 years old Salas finds the lane to the left hand for two I was looking forward to Hunter you know giving me a little bit more but but jayen Washington actually steps on the line and turns it over so give Hunter Sal a lot of credit for after getting the layup he ran back on the floor denying the basketball coming in you see Salis I was waiting for the Highlight he doesnt dunk it but he does a great job here coming back in denying RJ Davis forcing Jaylen Washington to step on the line a turnover for the tar run gr right there to make the call 1246 to go here the first half at Chapel Hill Miller looking to get it in and they do get a timeout see a difficulty finding somebody open so well take the break for 30 Wake Forest by a point here in Chapel Hill next season we talked earli about the relationship between amondo Bott and Fon Reed the third and youre talking about two big guys from the city of Richmond going at it Bott winning that battle forcing the stop but you get the opportunity to see these two guys on the floor way back in the day where Armondo was a 17 and under player as well as Fon 15 and under even though Fon was taller and still is at the time but these two guys had an opportunity to work a lot with each other a lot of talent coming out of the Richmond Virginia area and these are just two of the examples of those guys on the FL hit him as you know very well freericks into the paint Davis sticking right on his hip I hesitated to say looking at that photo back when they were little that never happened Sal going in strong but thats going to be a travel on Hunter Salis thats three turnovers for them already yeah absolutely back when they were little these two guys never little to say the least Fon at 611 now probably 69 then Armondo at 610 now maybe 68 at that time but these two guys are special talents Davis beautiful pass and the Slam by Washington so thatll help the shooting percentages Obie thats where RJ Davis is much improved this year everybody talks about the scoring numbers hes always been able to score hes much better playmaker this season than hes been in the past showing a lot of leadership too this Carolina group Miller gets himself an open look and swishes it in comes in averaging 17 and also four assists per game first name Kevin likes to go by bopy which is a family nickname that passed down through the ages Davis going in strong and it rolls in not high made that impressive very impressive concentration by RJ Daves attacking the bass another Loston got it Applause back good there on the side by Monsanto Monsanto they just got him back hes a very dangerous threepoint guy pcks tough shot and hits it from threepoint distance and thats one of those ones all you can do is look at him and say good shot had him on the back and keep going that was good defense by Taylor Withers Just great offense Davis off the window oh very sweetly he uses the BL so effect he does but what were seeing right now wake for is playing drop coverage and pick and roll action and and when you got a guy like RJ Davis whos great in the midrange hes going to take advantage of that the maning the cfd for sticks with that the entire games harassing Miller stops de help gets it back outside here for forson Forbes has called him hes out of Oklahoma maybe the best shooter hes ever recruited now North Carolina trying to grab the lead Davis full head of steam will draw the foul K reaching it 10 43 to go here in the first half and Ed to te dog on the farm explain that when we come Music back cant reconcile tea dog with Tara Vander having covered her for years as much as I admire her but one of the great coaches of all time Ingram gets it downstairs and tied up on the play possession arrow will go to the other end Angel as a player did you have a victory against the great Tara MAV we did so one of those wins is in against us we actually had a really big upset in the NCAA tournament to go to the programs first sweet 16 so we upset them on their floor however we Revere her so let me just say congrats our in order its so awesome to not only witness history but to to know that you have a story that connects us with her as well how about angel the conate team player the first thing she said was we did cuz you I say yeah I beat her I won that game yeah personal win Angel immediately yes we did we did teammates Florida State Sal leaning in drops in another one a junior from Omaha Nebraska McDonalds AllAmerican then went to Gonzaga and on to Wake Forest another one of those transfers that Steve Forbes has identified perfectly to fit into their program at at Wake Forest and one of the things that coach Forbes talked to us about I mean again you know at Wake Forest you dont have the same pool as everyone else because of the academic restrictions to get into W for to start with that but also in Winston Salem they dont have online classes so if youve taken online classes and you want to transfer and youre not getting those credits and when you look at it from that standpoint that limits a lot of the pool of potential players that he could have coming in but he needs guys that will come in are willing to do the work academically and can and can do the work and and also into that program sure Withers makes the first and coming up next on ESPN itll be Kansas hosting Cincinnati and Allen Fieldhouse Kansas at the moment number seven North Carolina has jumped up a KN to number three this one tied at 14 Willer will bring it up the point guard from Chicago a lot of people in the building rec recognizing this is a scary game for them simply because they understand what Wake Forest can do from an offensive standpoint this young man Hunter Sol is four of six from the field the rest of the team only two for nine hes been the guy this far seven footer Reed bodyto body with Bop but Applause no he could the Freshman point guard no one tipped out a play hes been so steady they had a bad mistake against Kentucky at the end since then more maturity game by game and really a calm influence out there for one so young yeah and wasnt a starter to begin the season but you look at his last four games averaging s and a half points per game but more importantly its the 43 assist per game hes the guy that gets North Carolina into the offense gets the guys the basketball when they need it and in the right SPX Ingram wants to work got himself somewhere Elan banked it in thats a pretty play his first bucket and here comes the crowd really for the first time tonight as North Carolina starts to make some shots Miller going around the back working on the rookie flips it up tough angle no good wants to push it I think Ingram likes this matchup kicks it out for Withers Withers draws the foul with eight and a half minutes to go in the first half here at the Smith Center Carl will pick up his second foul right now Ken palom ranking Carolina number seven nationally in the all important net and you look at the teams that Hubert Daviss team has been up against Tennessee Yukon Kentucky Oklahoma Clemson remember they faced Oklahoma when they were unbeaten and on a first loss on them I believe thats the game that started the winning streak for North Carolina now in the midst of an eight game winning streak had their biggest win over Charleston Southern in the Huber Davis era 45point win here on the home four and then getting in the ACC play w three straight road games not allowing over 60 points in either of those games and thats really what started whats been a great beginning of the ACC season for the Target nice hand for jayen Withers coming off the floor Four Points he comes in he has an impact and hes doing a great job with the minutes that he getsic will reach around and commit the Music foul so 819 to go here in the half and wake to check it in from the side Pax and W it getting some minutes early thats another one of the things with this North Carolina team is different Huber Davis going much deeper into his rotation playing nine to 10 guys on a normal basis Kido on him Slams on the brakes leans in great job by Kido to stay home and not commit a foul and now turns it into a fast break bucket its an eight nothing run Carolina opening up at 20 to 14 advantage Demon Deacons can answer quickly offensively but not here big rebound by Ingram hes been great on the glass particularly in ACC play a leaner and a banker by kadoo and wait needs a timeout kadoo with backto back buckets and Wake Forest got to stop the bleeding the time out how do you get the attention of your guys when its loud in the building ration assistant coach hes got the whistle to get their attention up with the Stop and turning his defense and offense attacking the body of Andrew car for the finish and on the next possession once again attacking the 10 Soft off the glass able to finish it in the midst of a 10 Road 10 run for North Carolina North Carolinas hit six shots in a row freshman out of West irons New Jersey reclassified so he could play ACC preseason Rookie of the Year as we mentioned the Improvement is so noticeable when I called a bunch of Carolina games and every time he plays he does something better than he did the game before so well see if weit has an answer they have had an answer against most people this season coming in 13 and Applause five and scoring 81 points a g game H Salas has been the top scorer hell kick it here for Reed in the corner much too strong you talk about wake Force coming in scoring 81 points per game right now with 14 oh nice Five O on a baseline but blocked and HTH comes away with it Demon Deacons will run when they get the opportunity but North Carolinas been getting back so effectively not just tonight yeah they absolutely have and the interstate is clogged up C nicely done it would have to be Im not sure if its I 40 or its 85 which one it is but whichever one gets you to the dean doome from Winston Salem its been clogged thus far coach Steve Forbes likes to refer to the open space as the interstate once you get him that that threepoint line no speed limit right yeah left that one have B short Applause Salis roic bumping with him no whistle there and thatll fall thats Elite level scoring right there from Salis and one thing that he didnt do even through the contact he never said okay Im guilty youre going to call the foul one way or the other he said hey Ive got an opportunity to get a bucket let me do it backto back baskets for the demon deas coming out the timeout Sal with 10 Davis Le in no and a whistle another go the other way thats going to be on North Carolina look at that Interstate no no speed limit there there for a while absolutely no speed limit at all when you catch it youre driving down the floor however Steve Forbes wants his team once they get into the city that Urban driving area where 35 mph you got to slow it down a little bit and then of course once you get in the school zone because OB kids are playing you got to make sure that you take your time and you see once they get into the urban Zone Hunter S is able to make a play off the bounce and finish it with the E bu kids are playing wji just picked up a second foul thatll be batted away Ingram trying to deny on Andrew Carr and hell pick up number one 228 North Carolina 541 to go in the first half North Carolina has clogged up the interstate in this game however over the last couple of possessions youve seen beautiful the Demon Deacons be able to operate very well in the school zone so Steve Forbes has to be happy with the way his team has come out to timeout coaches go to work too there Davis no too strong just like that demon Dias with the opportunity to to take a lead on this possession s gives it up here for Miller hes 38 beyond the threepoint line not many of those made yet tonight by either side out is Ingram Ryan to drive it swo Ming in and a Follow by B but that may as well be an assist because when You got both big guys coming over to block your shot your goal is to get it high enough on the glass so that your teammate Armando Bott one of the best offensive rebounders the ACC has ever seen is able to clean it up best rebounder at least in terms of the stats that Carolinas ever had hes a 2000 Point scorer shock lock down to 11 hild getting inside and Bs it in he can be a tough cover abely can if there is one draw back to this North Carolina team defensively theyre small in the back court with Davis and coo on the floor together and we have seen Hunter Sol and now C they just both take advantage of keeps on driving and will lay it in that open up beautifully for H has half a dozen well thats thats the way kadoo gets back again if you post me up thats fine but Im going to go past you on this other end of the Applause floor withth averaging 15 points a game at 25 against Florida State so he can fill it heres Miller shot clock at seven now down to five long one by Carr but short and a whistle and a foul on the play in the act of shooting a three that ones on Applause kadoo 2622 the Demon Deacons have been a different team since the timeout immediate reaction from the crowd here at the dean Dome as you see cormack Ryan getting it high off the glass that was just a pass OB and Elliot kadoo this a little bit of Road running right here beep beep as he gets it h the Music rim hold up Jay now again between the two of us between me and and Jay Williams who didnt play defense he is definitely winning that battle but coach Greenberg is right this is the way Carolina played when they were nasted champions in 1993 the last time that a Carolina team won this many games by double digit digits is what were seeing right now from these Carolina Tar Hills but giveway force a lot of credit for the way that they have hung around in this first half Nei team has shot the basketball very well well we mentioned it early I mean put them at the line they make them Carr hit in the act of attempting a three makes them all so its a onepoint game neither side is making any threes have been one made three and that was by North Carolina W Forest the team that really relies on it offens times they roll for seven OB I cant believe my God J will try to go at me like that knowing that he played zero defense but Jay will talking about RJ Davis as one of the best players in the country and you have to give wake force a lot of credit theyve kind of held RJ in check throughout this one hes been able to play in in space through that drop coverage that Steve Forbes told us but he said pregame hes going to make some shots but we rather him have to make tough twos in comparison to giving him those threes in North Carolina yet to make a three in this game eight points for him so far the super Tuesday matchups both at s Easter six Central number 15 Oklahoma and Texas and in the ACC its FSU squaring off against Syracuse and always watchs them on the ESPN app as well how about the job Leonard Hamilton his sta have done thats been said before it has been said before but I tell you what its different this year after their nonconference I dont think anyone would be expecting them to be 5 two in the ACC right now especially with the wins that theyve gotten thus far Reed looking inside the sevenfooter gives it up here for Applause Salis making a move here and he is held up in fouled per Ryan trying to stay with him not an easy task on Salis and its time for a one and one hes averaging 18 points a game one of the better scores in the conference 65 Jr with 10 points its absolutely a slap in the face thats what you have to do when a guys going go get a bucket on you make sure you slow him down one way to do it and another one coming for a guy who hits 80 exactly what wig forest does as a team 80 at the line they have losses to Florida State in NC State in conference play ACC wins over Miami Virginia Tech BC Virginia and Louisville Carolina by two Ryan under three minutes to go in half number one Davis off for bot well see if he can get more involved couldnt get that one to drop he only has two points on Santo great job by for M Ryan getting out there not allowing L Santo to get a three hes a knock down shoot of 46 in his return against Louisville last time out ly Miller kicks outside Salis again long one coming and too Applause strong RJ trying to work right through that defense down it goes hes made a living in the paint thus far North Carolina with the advantage and points in the paint RJ Davis has been the main culprit crowd back in it Hubert Davis slapping his hands loudly on the sideline to get them up again heres Monsanto yes sir a threepointer we talked about his shooting prowess his first game played this season after tearing his patella attendant at NC State a year ago first game out four of six from Beyond the threepoint Arc against Lille on Saturday little floater here and thatll drop J Davis still really getting on his back lot of the other Shooters not been able to hit yet but his b design in Steve forbs wants to play Drop coverage against RJ Davis to force him to score in the twopoint range and not allow for their Shooters to get going and for those guys to get open m RJ with 12 Salis a Reach In by David nearly pucked it free heres Monsanto again and another one he stares into the crowd here at Chap Hill like you you guys cant stop me no and when he gets looks like that you can pretty much count them for the Demon Deacons and that three ties the game at 32 so were under a minute whipped here for Withers and now Wake Forest with an opportunity to gain the lead here and deari Monsanto just came back his first first game in almost a year coming back from a really bad knee injury has hit a couple of big frees Miller going around the back ands see if they find him again H with a pull up sinks it our 10th lead change here in the first half but Wake Forest in front at Chapel Applause Hill Davis top score in the ACC shot clock inside 10 down to seven Davis on the drive going in strong and denied by Reed and a whistle on the play deari Monsanto knocking down backto back threes as he turns and just has a little glance nothing said just a little look to the Tar Hill faithful here in the building back to back threes to tie the score and then Cameron Hills getting in the midrange to take the lead RJ Davis with a chance to tie it back up with 56 and OB this is a time where RJ Davis cant get board with scoring twos as you see RJ getting into the painted area but thats what wake force is going to give him so he cant get bored with scoring twos if thats what theyre going to give you if if you have to shoot it every time then thats what he needs to do to help his team win there certain games where hes going to have to make passes he had a 10 assist game to be successful but this one he may have to score 30 points and do the majority of it in that Carolina blue boy he just doesnt miss at the foul line he just missed the front end and gets that one 56 chance for a heave here from Miller across mid Court going to get a look here but cant hit it and thats it first half comes to an end with Wake Forest looking to Spring the upset tonight 30 plus for his team to be able to win when you see how wake force is guarding him the drop ball coverage on the on the screen to roll hes going to have to continue to shoot the basketball as many times as he can turns it over on the first possession Miller trying to drive it past Kad with a little turnaround not there and with a big rebound he has seven already M Ryan leans in lot of iron and it pops outs heres the issue with if RJ Davis has to take things into his own hands to make plays other guys feel like they get left out and for North Carolina theyve got to understand that hey this may be a game that he has to do that and you cant just go take uncharacteristic shots because youre not getting the basketball Reed banging away and hook goes over the head of Armando bot he only has two points but thats also the case with bot and and they allow both these guys to play one1 throughout the entire game no help in the post just allowing them to go at each other and neithers had much success on the offensive end thus far Miller up top for hilr Salis on the spin Reed will swing it he to the Baseline Slams on the brakes thats a shot he can hit but not this time Davis wants to Sprint RJ all the way through one of the quickest guys in college basketball is 15 but thats too easy thats one thing Steve Forbes is not want to allow RJ Davis to get easy looks in transition he cant believe he was called for a foul there but when you know when youre playing against North Carolina they run off of misses and they run off of makes and this is too easy for the a cccs lead score to be able to get to the rim and Aton Reed with the free throw we was me with the rebound helping his guy out cam Hilder a little falling out of bounds a little off balance right there Eon just helping hand to his brother right there taking care of him zis makes 80 at the line has 12 points proud howling they did not think that Davis committed a foul thought that was a clean pick Ingram with the rebound GRE Forest looking for an upset tonight OB W for six of nine from the free throw line we mentioned earlier 84 on the road for them leaning in off the window harison Ingram who comes in up 13 and eight four points so far tonight had a 19 rebound earlier this season against ncy State on the road therell be one thing that you talk about on many North Carolina games is how Harrison Ingram makes a play offensively or defensively that time he picks up the foul but how Ingram normally makes a play when his team needs him most we saw that on the last possession on the offensive end of the floor weve talked about how Steve fores has brought guys in that fit so well into their program how about Harrison Ingram and what hes brought to this North Carolina program Ingram is second foul North Carolina Top Dog in the conference of perfect s and0 but wake Force quietly has moved up to that number two wrong a threeway tie with NC State and Florida State all at 5 and2 and I would say that Wake Forest and Florida State both surprising to be in this Music group Music Applause 3937 looking for space and yes sir theyll lay it in give him eight but you can see that North Carolina is intent on attacking the basket making plays at The Rim not selling on the perer for long jump shots when this is what way force is trying to force him to take nice feed there s cant finish it rebound tipped out High here comes too look at this just a blur to lay it in freshman with 10 what a quick strike Miller with a kick heres Carr no from threepoint L long for Bob bed away from h and a loose ball thatll be scooped up by the Demon Deacons there a great play by H getting back in transition Salis with a jumper way short Rebound stoed in by Reed came right to him and its tied at 41 offensive rebounding thats something that you rarely see against North Carolina that time Reed able to get inside position as bot was on the other end of the floor trying to get back Music a frenetic start to this second half Ingram out of the double Ryan will swing it heres Davis for a triple and finally say the North Carolina fans he has 18 a hand off for Salis pull up jumper air M it good off finding Davis another three on the way well they couldnt buy one in the first half different story in the second Miller and they whistle on the play Ryan thought he had played tight defense and maybe forced to travel but its a whistle for a falance but this is exactly what Steve G did not want North Carolina playing in transition Elliot finding his way to the rim and then rotating to the wrong guys leaving the right guy with an opportunity to knock down not one but two threes back to back for the acccs leading Applause score a chance to watch basketball and Dicky Vs own home as Wake Forest comes out of timeout hildor with the bucket 47 to 43 Carolinas caught fire the made the last six shots yeah and Dicky V of course on the call as Marcus Paige was able to go high off the glass against Louisville in the shout out to the late great Stewart Scott University of North Carolina alone representing the booya Davis going down after making the shot with 1508 to go here in the second half get a look at Marcus pagee who has now joined the North Carolina staff this season and Marcus Paige a great player now director of team and Player Development at UNC made 299 threepoint field goals but Marcus pige and Joel Barry in the back court together is what made Hubert Davis fall in love with playing two point guards at the same time so now when you look at RJ Davis and Elliot CAD that originated with Roy Williams going with Marcus Paige and Joel Barry that team of course went to the national championship game lost to Villanova won it the next year in Applause 2017 16 consecutive game with bable threepointers for Davis you said a couple of times in the first half he may have to get 30 tonight he has 24 well and when you see that whos record he broke that actually was part of that same team Justin Jackson in 2017 that was a national championship team made two I mean multiple threes in a game 15 times so RJ Davis breaking the record here with those last two threes they got strong and hell draw the foul having called that number number five for Carolina very often tonight he hasnt been very involved offensively North Carolina by five 50 to 45 as they try to win their ninth consecutive game last one nine in a row in 2017 six of those came in the NCA tournament on route to winning the national title and Bott will sink number one second annual NBA Rivals week begins Wednesday ktie and the Suns taking on Luca and the Mavs at 830 thats on ABC and the Spurs

Kevin Durant with 40 last night the big three of the sun starting to take shape Bradley Bill back on the floor then of course get a chance to see Victor wi who has been as good as adverti by the way you know that jersey number one that he wears San Antonio I wore that first oh you did Big seller yeah big now nine on a shot clock and a foul here against North Carolina and theyre howling at that personal thatll go against jayen Withers number two Applause one 1414 to play lowscoring game thats unlike both of these teams but a lowscoring game for these two teams is a regular scoring game for many teams throughout college basketball that all to the shot when he got Airborne heres Davis once again the drop coverage theyre going to allow Davis to be able to penetrate that time he pulled it back out instead of trying to attack and blocked great job there by Carr to stay away from the foul heres Miller way down to picked off by Withers M course who made 18 threepoint field goals on Saturday versus Louisville only three main field goals in this game Davis getting his own shot no k way to rebound but thats the spot for RJ if theyre going to allow you to get to there take that shot he shoots 95 from the free throw line well take his chances with shooting right there Salis ping away hadit one foot on the line cant stick it Davis up ahead got a runner Withers hes fou on the play by Salis that would have been some slam that would have rocked this building and itll be foul number one on Salis RJ DAV once again getting to his spot youre talking about a 95 free throw shooter hell take his chances there he wanted a foul want some contact on that possession but that is the design of Steve Forbes of how theyre going to guard RJ Davis you see how dangerous he is and the way this this building reacts when he knocked down at three they dont react the same way when he gets those tough twos Jaylen Withers the transfer from Louisville graduate Hometown Charlotte in and out good foul SHO Music 79 deari Monsanto coming back on the floor of the threepoint Bombadier for the Demon Deacons a couple of big ones in the first half when he got hurt last year just about a year ago was in February when he blew out the knee he was leading the ACC in made three was 13 points a game he was becoming more and more dangerous and he had actually torn his Ailes the year PRI so was coming back had dropped a lot of weight from the Achilles tear now you can see trying to get back into that type of conditioning but I tell you what the jump shot has not gone anywhere elor will locked up a long one and theyre just not there tonight for the Demon Deacons as a team they hit 39 Withers one dribble down inside for Washington to finish it thats another example of how this North Carolina team has grown D Washington giving the T Hills great minutes here Off the Bench Santo around and out whos inside the cylinder North Carolina looking for a hammer strike its Davis again and draws the foul RJ to the line he stunned Everybody by actually missing one in the first half makes 95 on the foul on Keller tell you what you cant do any more than this if youre deari Monsanto this pretty much goes in and finds his way back out but for a guy that shoots it with his level of confidence hes counting that as a make OB hes already hot hes shooting the ne Davis already with 11 points in the second act in 12 thats in about 7 and2 Applause minutes so check this out North Carolina tonights with that backourt at work anybody else 20 points and six out of 19 but Cad and Davis have done a great job attacking the paint they havent settled theyve been able to get to the rim finish through contact often at times but never allowing the size and its two big guys always on the floor the away Force but never allowing that size to DET turn Crow rising up here out the Smith Center Frederickson cant get Applause inside HRI trying to penetrate Washington will commit the foul stops the clock with 1203 there was nine to shoot it check in with Angel gr hey guys well I was able to catch up with Steve Forbes at halftime and despite RJ Davis having double figures I asked him how did he feel about his teams ability to defend him in the first half he said listen even though those are twos we cant we cant take everything away two to three of those shots were Big Time shots thats just thats the type of player that he is hes leading the league in scoring for a reason but coming out of halftime he has blitzed him on so many different levels this season guys he absolutely has and if anyone knows about God leading the ACC and scoring it would be Steve for because hes actually had players do the last two seasons when you think of Lis Williams as well as Tyree app so he had two guys BEC can score the ball as cback Ryan knocks down a huge three right in front of his bench Applause WG Forest has been able to buy one beyond that line thats a big part of their offense it absolutely is but I will be absolutely locked in on Thursday watching that I can remember watching the match up a season ago between South Carolina and LSU when you look at this match up tonight wa for 0 of four from the threepoint line in this second half north Carina start out 0 for eight has been perfect here in the second standing and news going down on his back and the officials looking at each other here Bert Smith and Roger SS and its a Applause travel so thats what they figured on the end 1122 to go and we have another timeout here North Carolina with a 5945 lead on week Applause an alltime Tar Hill and theres one right there Tyler hansbro number one alltime and scoring do some radio work for North Carolina actually stepping in for building the seat of our beloved brother Eric montros who was lost in December Tyler HB one of the greatest careers in ACC history the leading score in ACC history four time all americ unreal four time first time all ACC 3000 points yes amazing Salis in the paint and a foul by trle went for the block Seth trle with number two and the acted taking a shot so Salis will be back to the line where Wake Forest has not been great tonight great foul shooting team he has 12 there eight out of 11 which for them isnt terrific but Salis to shoot two and their issues continue we showed the num earlier they actually shoot a higher percentage from the free throw line at 84 than they do at home at 80 but 8 of 12 tonight I can figure that one out Obie thats 667 thats easy math to be able to figure out Virginia guys 5946 theyre going to press a little bit Davis and now they pull it away Davis working on a 26point game you said a couple of times in the first half he might have to get 30 hes on his way hes done it before yes this time though its tipped out itll stay on this s RJ Davis career high 30 points done it twice once against Baylor in the NCAA tournament two years ago and then earlier this season versus Arkansas in the Bahamas went for 30 we could definitely see him create a new career high here this evening and for Ryan catches fires no C comes away with a rebound to 610 senior Demon Deacons have gone flat offensively that has not been said very many times this season in the conference or out of it I think we got to get credit for both cols defense one thing you talked about with them even the offense hasnt been great theyve done the job defensively and once again doing it here tonight still yet to give up any fast break points so this is the third game in a row coming into this game the last two games zero fast break points for their opponents and W Force has yet to score a fast break point hell get RJ Davis for second foul and again Salis to Music shoots he got Gonzaga transfer its an area where Steve forbs I think could give lessons he could give a master class on getting transfers to come to W for highend guys highend kid and and young men that fit into the system but if again if you start thinking about point guards after alandis Williams after Tyree A alandis Williams ACC Player of the Year Tyree Aly First Team all ACC why would you not want to come play for Steve G when you understand hes been a put your basketball in your hands hes going to allow you to play free thats one of the reasons he was able to get Hunter silus he let him know Hey listen Im going to allow you to come here and do what you do best which is score the basketball and play with confidence and you see how its worked out for Hunter Ingram lines up a long one not there Bott with a rebound a very quiet night for Armond Bott but not for a fellow star in RJ Davis Kow on the penetration and wave that one off interference on the cylinder 5947 bot just hanging in the air waiting for this one to come off and it looks like it may have gone through as he grabs the rim taking away that basket great Forest has missed their last seven shots Cory coming up on 10 minutes to go here ly Miller using the body left it short I love that no call on that because it was Miller that created all the contact that though did a great job defensively holding his ground with the foul before the shot so no basket there I think the other aspect of the North Carolina personality that we should talk about is their ability to grind opponents down and grind out wins thats beginning to happen here at this stage of the game and thats what happened for them at Boston College on Saturday it wasnt a pretty win however every win is effective when you think about the fact the team undefeated ACC play as RJ Davis once again attacks the paint and is able to finish amongst the trees get Applause 28 wake had a onepoint lead at the break without a field goal in over five minutes against this Carolina defense Miller to the Baseline the Trav and a turnover here for the demon d and thats been the thing that is hampered the Demon Deacons in their Road losses an ACC play 17 turnovers against Florida State 20 against NC State and their only two losses this year on the road turn it over five times nothing outrageous there but every one of them the rest of the way given the score is going to hurt yeah thats a number that Steve PS would be happy with right now if they were making shots the struggle has been from Beyond the threepoint on Davis BLS it up another one hes got a bag of tricks he absolutely does and thats 30 so now we see where hes going tonight will there be a new career high for RJ DAV lost it got it back and itll spin around and roll in H with a basket he has 10 points tonight 6349 North Carolina Carolina unbeaten at home at 8 and0 number three team in the country behind Yukon and foro Davis and he looking for new career high would have gotten with that basket they again Reed out front and a block its Bon against his old teammate swings it McAn to the paint with a turnaround sticks it thats nice great foot footwork for corack Ryan getting into the paint allowing the defender to go by then shooting the fade away you can see the experience showing of North Carolina down the stretch now a foul with 801 on the clock and Chom Ryans down foul on H weve seen that a number of times this season cormack Ryan down on the ground with a turned ankle missed a game earlier in the season Music take a look at that foot Ryan sliding his feet doing a great job defensively but you see the right ankle roll as he steps on Cameron hildr foot yeah 6549 Carolina more moment Wendys breakfast two for three take those ankles absolutely RJ Davis going into his back getting into his midrange looks the cross the cross again the hands up a little bit of hesi and then of course as much as I hate to say it floater even though he has made a living in the paint tonight to the tune of 30 points tying his career high and I got the feeling that he is not done yet Obie got 8 minutes to get the new career high 12 to 20 shooting it two out of five from the threepoint line North Carolina leading at 6 5 to 49 came in expecting a really good test from Wake Forest at 135 go all the way through to lay that one in and when he sees just a little sliver of an opening he is all over it and Steve for talked about how fast Elliot Kad was and shoot around earlier today and Kad playing a very mature floor game but finding the time to pick his spot to be a score and a facilitate Salis Ingram on him and BR Carr trying to lean inside to his left that was well done and 10 points for the 610 senior a great move by car on that possession however at this point twos arent going to get you back into the game against nor line especially when you cant do anything with Harrison Ingram on the Block North Carolina playing big now with Ingram at the three and hes going to have an advantage regardless of whos guarding him down there t h is trying to go to 16 and three 8 and0 in the ACC only undefeated team in the Atlantic Coast Conference Frederickson off the dribble gives it up here for sou shot clock is down to five for Wake hes got to get it in the air around Bott will spin it in Great individual move by Salis on that possession but give Amo bacock credit stepping out and guarding Sal step step Mak even have to take a tough shot to beat MC ran went down dripping that lower leg is now ready to check back in for Hubert Davis Ham on the back down the one hander too easy it just looks over to the bench and just gives the he too small signal to his bench and again we saw Hunter salz do that earlier so its one for one right now and theyre too small they cant guard me OB W for is just trading baskets right now and they cant do that under 6 minutes to go here at Chapel Hill Carr again strong move but hes denied bot comes over going to be off of North Carolina but shot clock of factor not 43 you talked about twoo small yeah Obie this is your guy right here you Rave about Harrison Ingram and all that he brings to this team and he just runs back letting his teammates know hes too small and then in case you didnt believe me on the first time Ill show you again hes too small Frederickson off the inbounds well short Ingrams been such a great fit you talk about moves made you know out of the portal he might be number one in college basketball this season Bott with the tip hits it to go but thats the second time cuz though recognizes he cant drop it off to Bott just get it as high as you can off the glass if you dont make the shot botts going to clean it up and North Carolina moving into blowout mode here the shut from by Bott trying to slow down Fon Reed his first foul and a 20point lead for the T Hills they look Unstoppable Wednesday the hudle crew will reveal this seasons ACC football schedule theyll break down each team including new members Cal Stanford and SMU and look at Key weeks and big matchups are coverage of a twohour special beginning at 5 Eastern on acc Network ESPN 2 and ESPN I am looking forward to Cal to Stanford to SMU joining the ACC oh you think we going to be making some cross cross country trips well you are already the miles king the people at Delta are like here he comes again here comes Cory one more time across the country unbelievable yeah but you know my people though youre my people they love you at Delta Reed on the line makes it 7355 Davis into the offensive zone he has been a huge start tonight RJ Davis father Rob with a 2000 Point score in college RJs pass producer Ked up today could he really play asking about his own B could he really play cuz he tells me all the time about how good he was but RJ is one of those guys who can walk away from the University of North Carolina as a 2000 Point score also has the ability to be able to come back next year 4 fth season sento and off the iron almost got that Shooters roll 7355 Carolina trying to rip off a n consecutive Victory heres Davis Davis 30 points he is tied his career high tonight shot clock to nine B Ingram lines it up and hes hits fouled by par and the act of shooting a threepointer so three shots coming here for Harrison Music Ingram fou by Carr picks up number three and Harrison a little bit shaken up former McDonalds AllAmerican coming from Stanford he provide so much versatility for this North Carolina team ability to play the three to play the four strong enough to rebound double double against Boston College 1113 rebounds last time out but hes that guy that just does whatever you need him to do to win a game Hubert Davis loves having Harrison Ingram in the lineup as well as a guy like cor M Ryan the experienced and jayen Withers the experience that you get with these guys being on the floor has been tremendous coming in this year he said its almost like these guys have been here for four years give him 11 points actually its going to be a lane violation so he want up a two but Harrison Smiles about it no big deal he does play that way plays with a lot of Joy has a great time out there always has a smile on his face speaking of joy Angel gay brings the joy to our Angel you got something for I have a few things but I do want to settle on Cormac Ryan and what he brings to you andc huper David said he is the toughness that this squad needed and the only negative about him is that they can only have him for one year I was talking to a couple of the players including RJ Davis and he said this guy has two personalities hes smiling at you one minute and hes challenging you on the other end defensively he is the communicator he holds everyone accountable and he is much needed for them this season thats kind of how Angel is for us right oh no doubt shes yelling at us get in the car thats okay you know I came downstairs a couple minutes late today she was yelling at me all the way more a couple but we okay we got here I thought me and you were on the same team Obie Im just holding us accountable guys I want us to be great you know the wi thats it its always the Wii with Angel respect that Salis at the line with 406 remaining 17 points so just about at his average if he sinks this one will be there 18 and he does and Salis has been impressive in this game hes really the only one thats been able to get anything going offensively for the Demon Deacons ly Miller who averages over 17 points per game also only four points for him so give North Carolina a lot of credit defensively for doing the job once again make fourth with 57 points looking to be that next contest do that does not score over 70 points shot clock at five Davis lost up a three rebound tipped a couple of times by Ingram and itll stay right here that was when Ingram was asking Ron Gro as it tipped out by way foreston he makes another play 7557 North Carolina Music Roland this new show Jay will top of the hour Hunter Dickinson number seven Kansas hosting Cincinnati look for Cincinnati to utilize him in ball screens lets see if hes still in drop coverage SE oo I think hell be in drop coverage he better put a body on some of them because Ill tell you one Cincinnati theyre going to get to the glass theyre going to get to the class this is what we do OB as a team all three of us chiming in on a tease bump back to you Jens thank you very much 337 to go Davis has had a big big night with 30 points to lead number three North Carolina they were down by a point at halftime no trouble in the second half though for the heels Im shocked RJ Davis is still in the game I dont expect to see him in there much longer which means that he needs to get to business here illegal screen here a theyll go on Ingram and youre talking about the connection these guys have with each other and this is something that Steve Forbes talked about at his practice today he said you can tell they like each other they really get along well and not only that Obie the guys at Harrison Ingram is dapping up on the sidelines those are guys that would be getting minut if he werent here so when you see Zaden High you see J Watch standing up and those guys dapping him up you can tell that its about the team its not about me its about we and youre seeing these guys right now Harrison engram takes minutes away from everyone sitting on that bench but they love what hes doing for their team on the four for m r popped in the mouth by bopy Miller he picks up a foul his first so itll be Ryan to the line another excellent foul shooter for North Carolina 91 for the 25yearold now well have another one coming had a chance to meet cor M Ryans parents at our last game here talked to him told him how Cormac did me when we were doing our fast breaks at media day he gave me a p on the rear which kind of threw me off little surprising I just had to cut the break I was done at that point had to regroup good interview though great interview I I mean young man is unbelievable to talk to Angel had a chance to talk with him earlier today and again as as his teammate said he smiles hes hes mannerable hes polite but when he gets on that Court hes as tough as they get different guy obviously exceedingly bright Stanford Notre Dame North Carolina yeah and hes hes got lets see hes got his NBA and his underg grab from not today in the courses hes taking here he doesnt feel like he will be able to finish in one year but hes such a smart guy he may actually come back to school as we see RJ with the 33 now the new career high knocking down the three ball but I would not be surprised if pmac comes back to North Carina gets another degree well its been RJ Davis is night with 33 Reed will hook it and a whistle and a foul to 11 to go North Carolina getting to familiar ground 80 points thanks to number four Davis with the triple here and thats the second time weve seen the double cross over this time we dont see the double cross over to the hesi to get to the rim for the floater we see the pullup game from Beyond the threepoint Arc RJ knocking down another big bucket in a new career high for RJ Davis 33 points we had a feeling he was going to have to have a big scoring night Steve forb simply said hey we cant allow these guys to stand around and make threes we got to force them to take tough twos which they did in the first half however RJ exploded in this second half 21 second half points for him so be a to abely missed a couple of shots early I mean right away but like all great players kept on shooting he sensed he was going to have a night like this or needed to nearly stolen away K comes away with it approaching the twominute Mark at all North Carolina and again against a Demon Deacons team that was hopeful of giving them a test and had the lead at halftime great course by the way their season low is 66 points 61 right now no penetrating cant lay Applause down Salis will swing from Miller its going to be a big story they justs K he will lay it out thats all right well give him a break hes play hard hes had to spend a lot of energy guarding boy Miller in this one so Ill give him a break on not dunking thatas EAS and North Carolina really enjoying themselves in this second half it was tight at the break North Carolina ran away in the second half against the team playing really good basketball inside the ACC but nobody at the moment is playing the caliber of basketball in this conference than North Carolina is well RJ Davis a 33 points OB but how about Harrison wait a minute 36 for RJ forgive me 36 for RJ Harrison ingr with 10 points and 14 rebounds second double double in the last two games backto back double doubl for Harrison engram and you talk about running away in the second half still 44 seconds to go but North Carolina has outscored Wake Forest since halftime 52 27 and RJ Davis just catching shoot knocking it down jayen Washington will check in as the crowd chance RJ it has the sound awfully sweet to the senior from White Plains New York well we got to get somebody to the table we need a we need a sub for RJ we need to hear this Ovation to set trle comes to the table there he goes well he was phenomenal tonight and a new career high 36 points 23 of them coming in the second half when they really needed them because they were down by one at half time 85 points for the heels and theyre going to hold another opponent below 70 points and during the course of this winning streak which will now reach nine consecutive games nobody scored more than seven against Carolina 23 seconds to go an awardwinning performance a rewarding performance from Capital One and its been RJ Davis from the beginning attacking the paint picking his spots in transition and in the half court the handles the midrange game and of course adding four threes throughout this one to be the back breaker of the Demon Deacons to start this second half and Kad will have another one not have another one coming heres Miller out front and fouled from behind 36 points new career high for RJ Davis with 20 seconds to go and weve still got Cincinnati at Kansas to come we taken it to Lawrence in just a moment Miller at the line hell be shooting two 86 for the sophomore out of Chicago and makes the first North Carolina to improve to 16 and three and 8 and0 in the Applause ACC and heres poopy Millers Applause Music Applause second North Carolina can run it out here and they run their way to an impressive Victory from down a point at halftime and they will knock off W forest and knock the demon deons to five and three in the ACC as North Carolina stays perfect inside conference play and they are rocking and rolling rightfully so an impressive performance
