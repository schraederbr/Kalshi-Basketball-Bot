games played Reno and Stanford in black yigu and SMU in white itll start with Stanford basketball Chuck Harris touched it off the tip now I wonder thats the first time iGo lose life that he lost the tip at 72 being a Freshman you might be right you take a look at the Cardinal starting by missing from action Jaylen Blakes hes been ruled out with a head injury how does that change the way Stanfords going to play tonight Rand well hes their primary ball handle hes the leader of this team he brings a level of toughness hes familiar with the league and against this SMU when they defend and they turn up pressure well see how the rest of these guards handle Reno going right to work comes up empty on the opening possession but they will play through 42 early and often take a look at the SMU starting five Matt cross with it now he missfires cross plays that stretch four which allows three guards for SMU thats been a terrific combo it has been but cross usually has a physical Advantage a lot of times when hes facing up on guys andig against come on he has a physicality in the length about his 610 frame but cross doesnt have an advantage inside r no hell make you pay Yu a little late closing out and the Frenchman opens a scoring and Yu is usually inside playing drop coverage you cannot do that against raino you have to extend your defense and lets see what that does to smus defense when youre guarding on the perimeter youre accustomed to your big being inside and protecting the rim cross nobody picked him up and he goes off the window and in really many ways he can attack stretch four shoots the three can put on the deck as you saw there and if you switch on the fourman switch a guard on he will take you inside the post and punish your guards Music Ryan Ager wall going to handle a lot more of the ball with Jaylen Blakes out right now pum fake drives the lane lost the handle off his knee and its SMU Applause ball I think SMU is really lucky right now when the way raino is getting to his spots getting on the perimeter there because theyre showing and theyre going to come back late to him so hes going to have that jump shotu continues to go for that shot fake looks like the wings of Stanford Stanford to get open threes and theyre going to need other guys to step up they defend is whether they going to score enough points thats what you miss the most with J Blakes being out as well shot clock down to seven stolen away Ry Miller deny the back door cut this Cardinal team really get defend tough to play with a level of physicality as well poopy Miller answers with good defense of his own to deny Benny geler a clear Lane big opportunity for geler making the start in place of Jaylen Blakes yeah I dont think coach Smith is happy with that possession he doesnt need giler trying to score and make up for Blake 16 points just let the game come to him know more for a threepoint shooter 25 of his 36 field goals come from behind a threepoint line U offensive rebound kick out Edwards a three Miss fires good job defensively by Stanford here early controlling the pace is big for these guys SMU unable to score early and often but they want to get up and down if you really watchu they want to scor in the first8 seconds of the shot clock stolen away SMU trying to get something in transition Edwards misses the layup jump ball and cross goes crashing down with Ryan agarwall possession arrow keeps the ball with SMU both teams are playing really hard they know whats at stake good thing about playing late in the afternoon you get to see how everything happens in the league and you put yourself in position now wak and pit went at it earlier get a chance here to TI Dees for four place in the lead Miller pull up pop Music short both teams struggling to find their offensive Rhythm early in this one and that favored Stanford youre absolutely right Randolph and both of these teams are still looking for a level of confidence obviously St Stanford missing a ke offensive player in this lineup but SMU has struggled against some of the better teams in the league we welcome those on acc Network that just watch Virginia Tech hold on to beat Virginia Matt cross drills the three a slow start offensively cross changes that with a big time triple Matt cross has all five of smus points here early and his ability to score insiding out Max Reno answers with a three of his own the Frenchman who leads the ACC in points and rebounds showing his stuff earlier this one well he has all five for Stanford so w we just let everybody else go home and those two can play oneonone Edwards everything but the Finish EO cant clean up the spill two Miss layups there for the Mustangs foul called on the floor so five a piece 4 and a half minutes into this one at Moody Coliseum we welcome those that just watched Virginia Tech hang on to beat Virginia and this is a a critical game Stanford and SMU Rand Stanford has won four in a row six of their last seven and now an opportunity to come on the road and pick up a quality win this would put them even more on the bubble both teams very much on the NC AA tournament bubble as we start February good pass from rno a Mis layup though couldnt finish on the inside just the adjustment they made out of that timeout they realizing that when raino pops the weak side guard was able to come over and affect the shot they cut him on a weak side there boopy Miller comes off the ball screen and attacks Rayo who stays inside and knocks down a three five minutes gone by SMU a big three for poopy Miller r no passes off another Miss from Stanford offensive rebound keeps it alive for the Cardinal oiah salers fires he cant hit it Sanford has missed their last five shots boy Miller comes off here not ice ice in the ball screen Rayo is not coming out and youre thinking hey boy Miller is not known for his threepoint shooting you go under the screen good sign for the Mustangs hes able to stop and pop knock down his first three Stanford still forcing SMU to play in the half court set though this is a Mustangs team that leads the ACC in scoring they want to play at a high Tempo they want to turn this into a track meet Randolph but so far Stanford winning the pace game they are and you want you have to I dont think this game SMU averages an ACC leading 82 points a game sford doesnt want the game to get that high they want to control it this game can go in 60s and theyll be in it because they get to control the pace of that here s cross fires the three got it Matt cross hes got eight points early that cross has done a great job of mixing it up going to the offensive glass and driving the basketball but make no mistake he wants to pick and pop shooting nearly 38 behind the threepoint line you got to know that as he knocked down his second three here R know hands off for sers Galer a three missed it cleaning up the spill Ryan agall attacking the glass great job by agrial there going to the glass getting the tip kick to the corner at three rims in K quendo Off the Bench and into the box score we talk about them scoring but theyre third in the ACC as a team the Mustang so they their best quality their dribble drive and ability to attack the paint but in doing so it opens up a lot of opportunities behind the threepoint line SMU four for five from three to start this one and the Mustangs whose football team made the college football playoff up a football score 147 touch yeah he cant hit it a little heat check from the team whos been shooting well for threee to start this one the game plan for the Mustangs is they want to make theyre going to guard everyone else and make and guard Maxine raino 101 and forced him to score and scored an efficient level to beat him a first year head coach for SMU Andy edfield told us we are right where we need to be when it comes to making the NCAA tournament 16 and5 7 and3 in the ACC his offense for a long stretch of the season was a lot farther along than his defense but the defense has come on strong as of late and thats what makes this team tournament quality well theyve shown flashes of how good they can be defensively offensively we see it there so many weapons so many different ways they can attack you with their depth and guard play aara Deni jump ball possession arrow will keep the ball with Stanford there was akara who poked it free and drove on Miller boy mil able to tie him up and if youre Stanford thats one of those opportunities there in transition you at least want to come away with a foul its not an and one great defense there by booy Miller right no Tangled Up Geral colber giving him everything he can handle right in front of that SMU bench who loves the defensive intensity now this is the adjustment that I think raino has to make now when they go to the bin everyone else that comes in and guard him is much smaller I think he can go inside and take advantage of it that keer did not reestablish himself before touching that ball and its a turnover were seeing right now what theyre missing in jayen Blakes their leader at God being able to settle them down as they pick up the third turn over here now youre seeing the effect of what jayen lakes brings to this team scrambled for the ball and a foul called on the Freshman Anthony Baston Applause JR this is where he miss jayen Blakes when your team is struggling to find a flow on the road you look at what he did at North Carolina for this team just that that veteran whos been in these ACC battles on the road settles your team down settles your team down he knows hes been hes been through the battles he knows the leag well but more importantly youre on a road against the soldout arena gives you a chance to just settle the group now early on you can get a little bit more aggressive in his scoring set his teammates up make the game easier for them Miller trying to pick out Colbert on the roll SWAT it away and well step aside SMU in front 14 to7 theyve done well to deny Maxim Reno only five points so unfortunately for Max Max raino he just had to type of year here this year that guy group with his coach found it hard to make the argument for him today he did aen cin the red sht freshman for Massachusetts much needed bucket for Stanford they only made one of their last seven before that make heres BJ Edwards driving right in on geler kicks it out OC Cario 5 Second to shoot hes in attack mode and draws the foul sers reaching in there I thought they really good snap was really good at that possession defensively staying in front of the basketball he didnt reach in and slap his arm down I think they I dont think they would have called the foul Cardinals are very physical defensive team so we were just talking about Cooper flag you got a chance to watch him right here on acc Network Wednesday February 12 with the second rank Blue Devils host Cal and this Stanford team will be in Atlanta to get things started at 7 eastern time how about a good win for Georgia Tech upset special the day knocking off Louisville there are no guaranteed wins in this league or any league for that matter and you go on the road got to be prepared to play little had a great stretch great run think many still believe theyre the second best team in this league but that Jord Tech team is really talented they battled ton of injuries they only played six players today in the win tough take and it falls off the rim no Music good poopy Miller the blow by kick to the corner the extra pass heres Edwards flying to the rim for two thats the difference I think in these two teams its multiple guards for SMU can beat you off the bounds create for others stord guys are more comfortable maybe they can beat you off the bouns but theyre looking to score and again thats what were talking about when theyre missing Jaylen Blakes six in the league and averaging over five assists a game he had the ability to break the defense down and score not only score create opportunities for his teammates great defense totally locked up on Ambrose Hilton Off the Bench providing quality minutes okendo count it plus the foul for Kio o quendo Thats the tempo in Pace the Mustangs want to play Push It In transition you dont force anything you dont get in front of the basketball quendo drives takes the contact goes up strong goes to the line here with a chance for an n one SMU has such quality depth at the guard spot Caro o quendo joins BJ Edwards booy Miller and Chuck Harris and when you can get three of them on the floor at the same time it creates such a mismatch offensively I think one of the adjustments to why their defense is much better now they started the season they were they were starting yigu at the five Trey or at the four and Matt cross is playing the three now theyre going to the three guard lineup the spacing is better the basketball is moving a lot better and I think its help improve them on the defensive end of the floor o quendo a chance for a fourpoint play its a 10 nothing SMU run and Cario o quendo has scored the last six hes going on his own run right now again we just talked about them spacing you out when they do that you help on dribble penetration got him friendly roll around the rim there but it goes in chance for a fourpoint play got it you dont often see that you dont see a personal 70 run this game is getting away from snord really early and again we talked about it theyre missing a playmaker theyre missing a leader Co Smith was thinking his team was beginning to play better on the road Stanford is shot four of 17 and they turn it over its all SM right now 110 run and endos got the last seven cannot turn the basketball over the lob easy finish tapped in yigu in perfect position time out Applause Music Stanford on your defense but right now with the defense have been to the floor where we talked about where SMU has taking a step this lineup has been really beneficial for theyre smaller theyre quicker r no into the lane for SMU Defenders on Maxim R now still gets it to go again e to in that 72 you want to pick and pop against him but when hes out of the game I think he has to go inside but the other guys got to find a way to get in this game but thats part of the Gap game plan that smus having right now theyre trying to leave raino oneonone and force the other guys to create offense wow onehanded Hammer Sam mat Applause yigu and again its the same thing its penetration you help theyre throwing it up Stanfords inability to guard the basketball off the bounce is creating Music issues REO stolen away Edwards endos the trailer and he draws the foul well Maxim REO has seven of Stanfords 11 but it has not been enough yeah he shot fakes there you can see the crowd that hes drawn hes able to finish here but this dribble penetration it just cant stay in front of the basketball and as a guard you see him in the rear view mirror right there nothing you can do with yigu standing in a rim and you got to rotate as a big so you want to stay home but against a dribble penetration he just cant Ambrose Hilton fouled hell get two at the line underrated passer I think as well this is a freshman that his future is really bright more skilled for 7 foot hes more skilled than you think he is at 72 Applause Stanford guys are barking out instructions trying to clean up some defensive rotation now before Ambrose Hilton was fouled SMU had made their last five shots so at least make him ear than the line right you cant stop them foul Sunday ACC Network right tomorrow right here top 25 gymnastics meet for you Cal in Ry to take on NC State that is tomorrow right here on acc Network so Stanford has dug themselves into a 19point hole what do you want to see from them offensively Randol well they got to stay within himself you cant panic but you got to meet the level of intensity and you right now youre turning the basketball over got to settle down get good shots only 11 points scored of the first 12 minutes its all SMU in this first half Music and there is no answer right now for setet yigu the Freshman from Istanbul Turkey who missed Wednesdays win against C was suffering through a shoulder injury but he looks A okay tonight if he didnt you needed him out there you going to make sure he was okay today you needed that big body but no he what he brings to this team you see the in the dunker spot with the dribble penetration that these guards have Matt cross ability to punish mismatch score inside and out all the pieces are here for the SMU Mustangs to make a run to the NCA and Stanford shooting five of 19 from the floor and only 20 from three stolen away Reno cant even catch it denying him the basketball and BJ Edwards Cashes in on the other end I been suffocating defensively yeah you can see it now Chuck Harris pressure in the basketball and with this match up they have small ball lineup its just been so tough they create turnover is getting out Edwards there with the finish with the left as you can see theyre going right to their full cour pressure and this is why I think the adjustment to the smaller lineup has just been so good its offensively theyve been good all year long but its only defensive end the floor theyre able to extend their defense pressure they played more Zone earlier in the year when Matt cross was playing it for three now hes on at the four hes more comfortable guarding on the Music perimeter much needed basket goes begging offensive rebound no good as well great job getting the offensive rebound there what you got to know is ref freshman want to pull it out get a better shot theres no 22point basket in college basketball or any basketball for that matter just get a good shot and Chip Away to give yourself a chance to make a run in the second half but you cant take shots like that if you dont this thing will get up above 30 before you know it now this is an extended stretch that SMU has dominated they are on a 192 run over the last 5 minutes Stanford has fallen into another scoring drown of more than 2 minutes and 30 seconds they just need to see the ball go through the hoop yeah theres no let up right now these are difficult shots for taking mat cross rips it away and a travel in transition Chuck Harris defensive defensively smus been Music suffocating but thats where I say lack of point guard play there erga wal drives needs to kick that to the corner didnt see the corner Defender Matt cross come down and take it away from him got to find another way to create offense for someone else you cant force shots SMU has forced four steals in this first half some of the best defense theyve played all season and Stanford continues to struggle still cant get anything r no now with it tapped away you can see the experience he gets the offensive rebound could have gone up he dribbles it out trying to s shettle this group down theyre spending so much time on their heels because theyre not scoring in the offensive end and SMU is just coming downhill attacking them off the bounce getting to the rim just got to find a way to get a basket here and someone needs to attack the rim to get to the foul line well Stanford has missed six in a row and one of their last 10 REO trying to change that comes up empty and its SMU ball I think now again with this lineup tius out raino can slip on that ball screen catch it on the roll for rotation theyre going to let him take the shot and he he can knock down that shot again hes shooting 35 but for the rest of his teammates if he drives he forces rotation they need to get open looks to get some confidence right now hes going to have to make that adjustment and identify he can score whenever he wants but his teammates need help right now and usually thats jayen Blakes job but hes Edwards lobbing in colber couldnt bring it Music in great job there Maxim Reno runs the floor boy Miller has to guard him and he goes the post up and draws the foul oh Reno has 13 in on boopy Miller so I think that was a good foul used by the Wake Forest transfer he was trying to foul him 5 Seconds early a frustrating first half for Stanford the offense yet to get going on the road in Dallas they are shooting under 20 five of 26 from the Music floor Chuck Harris top take rolls off the rim and a foul called on the rebound will stay SMU Basketball and the Mustangs are in the bonus so shooting one and one just frustrated right Music now for the Cardinals theyre just super frustrated they cant get anything going to the offensive end when you cant score it puts so much pressure on your defense and when theyve been able to set their defense as they did early they were really effective tonight after our game finishes stick with us on AC Network nothing but net the crew will tell you everything you need to know about a busy day in the ACC including North Carolina and Duke theyll have that recap and much much more right here on acc Network who who there another game going on uh SMU on a 202 run dominant first half and the defense has been as good if not better than the offense in this first half see I think he needs to roll on his ball screen to get the ball inside every time he touches it SMU just throws three or four white jerseys at him draws the foul that time as long as he picks and pop theyre going to allow him to take that shot but if he rolls hes going to force rotation and its going to open up an opportunity for someone else and and when he rolls he tried to post up there he got the ball hes drawing a crowd whats most amazing to me about Maxim R now is he just doesnt have many games like this hes so consistent 21 games played 17 double doubles and this isnt just on him I mean he started out early hes still their most productive player they just cant score and credit the game plane that they have theyre going to allow him to score its just everyone else without jayen Blakes being available to him just puts added pressure in respon ility on him you see that season by seon progression for Rayo now in his senior year getting a major in mathematics and a minor in computer science played himself up in draft boards with his overall skill set again passes it well Milly to stretch the defense again super for three and 35 put it on the floor I think hes a guy you draft to kind of plug and come in and ass some type of way back cross muscles it home 67230 and he has been given it to Stanford in this first half he has Music 10 Stanford is not made a baset in five minutes right no trying to change that draws another foul so hell be at the foul line would we get back team and which is why you see this 23point lead here in the first half and theyre starting to come in for at the right time and theyre making a push to get into the tournament and I know its just one half of basketball but when you use the eye test and you watch this team play theyre an NCAA tournament team they are and and theyre theyre playing their best basketball right now and theyre getting ready theyre improving on the defensive end of the floor when youre this efficient offensively every team has parts of parts of their game that thats ahead of the other but right now they are really good on one then theyre really improving on the other they can put these two things together theres no question some tournament time this team has what it takes they had the Personnel when you see it theres no question about that they got to go out and earn it a lot of basketball left to play yeah as we tip off February our bracketologist Joe lardy has SMU next four outs so right on the bubble so this would be a big statement win if they can hold on a lot of basketball left to be played 330 remaining in the first half Matt cross hes been a great aggressive all night long 12 points in the first half for cross theres no answer for him and because of his ability to stretch the defense hes knocked down a three hes gone to the glass again another Drive take for granted how physical he is hes using his body well tell hes in a groove right now feeling as though he can score whenever he wants Stanford has missed their last eight shots Reno trying to change that into the lane Maxim Reno individually hes been good 13 of 17 points for Stanford just no help around him wide openen three how about it cement igu showing off the range hes show Max right now oh you want to stay inside oh I can shoot the three Applause too stolen away Chuck Harris lobs it up he get to rocks the rim and Moody Coliseum is on Music fire and runs the floor to the very next possession and gets the dunp again as we talked about he has M better Mobility than you give him credit for and hes been defending r no whos been the lone bright spot for Stanford he has 15 of the Cardinal 19 in this first half kick to the corner Edwards thats just the biggest issue right now theyre having it just cant stop dribble penetration out of Mustangs coming up on the auto owners insurance halftime show youll be in studio Taylor tanom Luke Hancock Joel bar and Carlos Boozer theyll catch you up on whats been a busy Saturday in the ACC probably the most surprising result is that Georgia Tech win against Louisville it is you wonder if those guys got a friendly bet going on in the studio today on uh USC duer and Barry yeah why not I want I want to be on boozers side how many points you give him Joe uh I give him 10 Ill give him 10 but thats a win that if North Carolina can pull it off on the they they would boost their resume after a disappointing start to their campaign it can all change in a game right it absolutely can and credit to Jord detch cany to fight I mean no one has been paying better than Louisville both ends of the Floor Tech to get a win thats impressive Stanford continues to struggle particularly from 31 of eight from deep in this first half meanwhile smus knocked down six threes Applause Music smus got to be careful here too last two possessions werent great the basketballs been moving him and taking the right shot Matt cross previous possession shot it from the logo early in the shot clock there and they want to play Fast want to take smart shots through the lob created threw threw it away and hes too experienced for that this team is playing too well let the offense just come osiah sers is a very quiet first half for the junior he actually spent his first two years playing college basketball for Andy anfield at USC now in field the coach of SMU and sellers playing for Stanford and he told us he said he when hes recruited just it was he knew his junor year hed be ready the skill set was there he just needed time to mature gain a level of physicality you see his improvement from one point his freshman year to five last year to up to 14 this year he was that third scorer with this team with Reno Blakes and himself which made this team really really good and put them offensively in the position theyre in right now as they come out try a little wrinkle with their 131 playing his former coach and down 20 on the road Edwards looking for more offensive rebound coralled by Ambrose Hilton and he puts it back off the Glasser two against that 131 if you can clean up the glass youre usually a against a smaller defender on the back line that time it was sers he didnt have a chance against Hilton on the glass s starting to get going hes got four in a row for Stanford and a timeout called by Andy Enfield use it or lose match ups because they get out so fast and when they get you in Cross Match up they attack you with so many different guys Matt crw being so steady being consistent shooter from the threepoint line his ability to punish switches its an added factor to this guard FL a logo three Harris left it short and a foul called with 55 remaining in the first half theyre shooting lowo threes and no one is 10t in front of them there and I think theyre settling for these shots and this this is what happens sometimes you get a big lead you get comfortable the ball is just going through the through the basket so easily for you theyre starting to take shots thats going to break their Rhythm if they continue doing so in the second half and Stanford for as bad as theyve been in this first half shooting the ball just nine of 31 theyve actually made four of their last five so getting a couple stops in the last two minutes has improved Kyle Smiths offensive performance theyve be gaining some momentum theyve been able to get stopped and I think some of it is SMU just settled taking some bad shots raino posts It Off the Mark GE W bush here and yet the biggest cheer the biggest star has been for C yigu hitting the three in the first half his first three of the season and uh hes had a phenomenal game for SMU its the Mustangs that start with the ball and a 20point lead theres Chuck Harris he hits the three and SMU picks up where they left off just settled down better offensive execution against the 131 that time and see the ball movement went to the second and third side and Chuck Harris knocks down a three and Sanford struggled from three they only hit one in the first half one of eight theyve had a lot more success going inside and they do that to get on the board in this second half Music Edwards feeds it in twohanded flush s yigu freshman is just starting to he he knows his rooll hes playing those guys hes just get to that dunker spot in that 72 hes just a load he grabs the rebound on the other end hes doing it all for SMU Sanford shooting one of 10 from three U backing down Music Reno great move but it rolls off the rim no good everything but the finish for the Freshman L his balance there Renault pulled a chair on him even though hes bigger pulled a shair there look at the ball movement there and just doesnt even have to leave do have to jump from his Tippy Toe he just dunp from his Tippy Toe doesnt have to jump got to find a way to get him out of the Applause paint but the challenge is there so many handlers so many guys they got four guys on their thats some utos on the floor at all times that can attack you off the bounce that can get to the rim and then and added bonus now theyre playing through yigu hes throwing the foul there I think raino hooked his arm and got away with one its interesting that theyre clearly coming out at this second half saying lets get it to yigu and let him go oneonone with Reno that left arm there got caught inside CH didnt call it but they have been intentionally the last two possessions of getting him give me the ball in the post yeah the first half it was more the guards and Matt cross initiated and he has the ability to score inside with turnover either shoulder big its physical he wants to F your body and then spin the other way cross a corner three got it not the guy you want to leave opening again the balls moving faster than stampage defense can rotate theyre getting open looks against the Zone coach Smith doesnt know what to do theyre carving him up manto man nice Cut oiah sers to finish at The Rim hes had enough of that 131 theyre going to go back to their manto man now why not left it short eatu who had not made a three All Season hit one of the first half and does that is that considered a heat check well thats right no considered a heat CH I already know the way hes playing offensively but you can to we talked about it multiple H its just not a lot offensively that the SMU Mustangs dont have and when theyre defending like theyre defending today they is going to be a tough off for anybody now SMU still up by 19 but their head coach Andy edfield took a timeout Stanford has made their last three shots making a mini run here five seconds to shoot carel quendo goes to work off the glass and in and they can do that all game long theres a physicality and the way they attack the paint their problem is when they got the lead they just started taking quick shot their offense their offense struggled and then when their offense struggled is led to some defensive struggles by not being able to get back and set their defense REO lined up the three missed it Music and we step aside again Stanford battling but SMU and you know whats funny so President Bush and first lady Laura Bush so personable they come up to me theyre like hey where you from youre calling the game I said Im from Connecticut Laura says you know George was born in Connecticut I did not know that I didnt either I knew he went to Yale but born in Connecticut very very fun chatting with them for side and and W did say this is the best half of SMU Basketball hes seen in 20 years watching the Mustang he he would know cuz hes Faithfully pretending SMU game that that first half was really impressive because both ends of the floor but Stanford has come out with some energy and a big three oiah salers knocks it down lot of basketball left to be played still more than 15 minutes left in it very activity on the defensive end is picked up if they could string together some stops the door might Creek open here in the second half for Stanford again smus have their moments of struggle big opportunity there thought you Tulu theyre doubling R know in the post come off the ball screen throw it back to him let the double team come and let him find the teammate shot clock down to two Galler Hees it Way Off the Music Mark boy Miller pull up pop got it thats his strength his threepoint percentages arent great but hes a really good midrange jump shooter you play him in drop coverage that guard has got to get back in front of the basketball his percentages started go to the roof at that point Matt cross rips down the rebound yeah hes turned into a double double machine since moving from the three to the four that stretch for six double doubles on the season as poopy Miller buries another one just so much foul power the tiger for the Mustangs just everyones inv Bol they got Five Guys averaging double figures quendo is averaging nine a game and hes having himself a really good Applause game REO goes crashing down jell Colbert got a piece of him on the Music rebound hes trying to box him out and caught him in the head but its with his Music hand and the officials do not have to go to the monitor at times this is when those examples where theyll tell a player was incidental Reno doesnt like Music it obviously the official didnt think it was malicious and which most times its not but really Graz him with his hand sers hes been the hot hand misses that one boy Miller steals it away SMU has hit nine threes in this game shooting better than 50 from Deep poy going inside this time Big Time finish s igu what a game hes having really doing a good job there even pushing raino off the block makes the block on the other end everything coming up Yu right now the carry o quendo rocks the rim one of those four guards are capable of giving you 20 or controlling the game and and theyre doing this without Trey R out of the game today whos a 34 shooter shoot 48 from the field with his level of experience also missed three out of the timeout Ryan agarwall that goes begging coming into this game seven and three and seven and three in ACCC play a battle for fourth in the league poopy Miller so crafty so he thought itd be a close competitive game instead it is all Mustangs and Miller is the conductor right now he is I call that the Steve Smith the the fake has he spin the fake hzy had he spins and has SE and goes and righto got left looking I dont know if he wants to make that switch Applause Music again fading away sers that rattles home s is a player he really really good Music player we talked about before when they get Jaylen Blake back and he gets to slide more in his wing position then they can attack you in every in all three phases from the wing from inside and from the point guard spot and theyre missing their leader here tonight ni show but theyre still fighting they competing settled down here in the second half and a lot more aggressive now boopy Miller 10 points nine assists on the night here is this oh reverse no going this way Max rain no shaking his head boopy Mill is having his way on his way to a double bu double Music double back door open for sers he misses the layup but cleans up the spill great job there by sers but just not enough help its just been played this game off defensively two on Five yeah sers in Reno have 35 of Stanfords 41 just not getting any help Harrison three nothing but the bottom of the Applause net SMU is showing why they lead the ACC in scoring and I think we expected the offense Randolph but the defense ensive performance has been particularly telling for this team that has really improved on that side of the ball it has and thats thats the only thing thats holding this team back if they can just they are a very theyre are theyre not just leading in scoring theyre leading in field goal percentage theyre doing it in an efficient way theyre third in in threepoint percentage they second in assist theyre second in offensive rebound and those numbers are going up shooting over 50 5 here so far the tonight and they got nine M threes Music already SMU has made six of their last Music seven shot clock down to eight yigu going at Reno and a foul called Renault pulled the chair again but think caught Yus leg and brought him down with him yeah he got away with it in the first half with yigu just losing his balance this time he tried to pull the chair and didnt get out of the way in time and tri the big fella up next Wednesday right here on acc Network a big double header tipping off 700 Stanford will be in Atlanta taking on Georgia Tech and then cow at number two Duke is anyone going to knock off the Blue Devils or are they going to go through the ACC undefeated in conference play I think the best Chance is at Clemson I think theyre the one team that that could present some problems because of the level of experience their guard flight I mean people arent talking about Hunter enough for me youre talking about a guy thats thats chasing 50 40 90 field goal percentage and its definitely an all conference guard but the balance of their team if if llin can step up and give them some consistency inside and play one of his better games theyre a tough defensive team theyre very good offensively as well outside of that I dont know if anyone else in the Le can score enough to beat that team that team that Duke team I think is Elite defensively and one of the top two or three defenses in college basketball right now at halftime theyre up on North Carolina by 22 4725 wow not many times in that rivalry its lopsided like that no its not it shows you one the state that car that Carolinas in right now but also how dominant through Blue Devil on and I didnt think this game would be that lopsided Vegas had it as a twopossession game in favor of SMU and they lead by 30 well when you lose a player like jayen Blakes who I think is probably the most improved player it would shock me if he gets that award you lose a lot its not like hes been gone and you got enough time to practice Charles Smith sitting there going were down 30 can we hit the fast forward Buton get on the plane so I can get back home and I think this is one where SMU knew they really needed it right on that NCAA tournament bubble Joe lardy has them next for out theyre at home and they have played possessed stolen away again Edwards right to the rim for two another turnover another pick six turnover in bucket for SMU they have been outstanding on the defensive V to the floor with another turnover nine steals tonight the defense has been phenomenal this is a statement performance by SMU Harris how about it why not why not thats the type of night it has been for SMU time out Stanford a 35point lead for the Mustangs Applause Music nonconference schedule as his team tried to come together I dont know if he knew it to come together this quickly now if they hang on to this 35point win and looks like they will as raino comes up empty theyll be 17 and five 8 and3 in ACC play you the three losses are Duke Carolina and Louisville so they dont have a bad loss no and thats why theyre considered in the tournament because they dont have a bad loss they remind me at wake for that theyve won some good games against good teams and so that game on February 15th is going to be huge both teams on the bubble yes and the pit pit because pit had a stronger nonconference schedule the metrics loves them and they got a stretch right there where that that stretch of these next five games will decide which side of the bubble that thats someu T Mustangs I want to call them the Tigers what am I doing well the Clemson Tigers around for the Mustang next five games I think if SMU plays like they did tonight they will win at least two of those three pit wake Clemson all here at Moody Coliseum if they get two of those three theyre going to be it I I I agree with you they got him continue to avoid some bad losses but what happens is theres teams at the bottom of the league I think one of the things that happened in this league early was there was a lot of injuries to a lot of key players those guys are starting to come back we saw Georgia Tech with a big win today thats the decimated with injuries and theyre still fighting through him Damian done with pitch still trying to figure his way back wake with Omaha Belo Louisville case Pryor I mean there just been so many injuries Marcus Burton would know the Dame now theyre playing better and a lot of those teams will play spoiler but SMU was playing really well and again this is against a Stanford team that had won four in a row six of the last seven so Stanford they were as hot as any team in the ACC coming into this game andu has put it on him Stanford took care of business at home they had to win at Carolina in the next were home this was a big test to try to get one on the road but again we cant undervalue how important were seeing how important Jaylen Blakes is to this group and and know hes not 33 Point difference but I dont think they this game gets out of control the way it does if hes there he just has an ability to help control Tempo and Pace this game got away from him early just didnt have anybody to settle the group down with some pushing and shoving for this rebound yigu going over the back and Music then the officials did a nice job sorting that out quickly Doug Surman and Trey Stein along with Ted Valentine our officiating crew Music tonight yeah I think this game does show you the value of jayen Blakes shows you how important he is Music to this team and hes taken advantage of his opportunity to have a larger role he transferred from duke showing you so much in his offensive package you said earlier tonight you think hes the ACC most improved player I do those numbers would certainly back that up they talking with head coach Kyle Smith he said he wanted somebody that knew the league and was competitive and I said John Shys former head coach used the word stubborn Kyle Smith said thatll work I can work with stubborn well and because hes his role in Duke was to come off and be a defensive guy with the guard rotations that theyve always had and credit to him hes showing you I had more of an offensive game to me if Im giv the opportunity to play that way and hes shown that thus far this year is still just under 6 minutes left in this one smus already scored 79 three shy of their season average 82 and Harris hits it right on Q how do you stop this Mustangs offense when theyre playing like this one you got to guarder you cant leave a 44 threepoint shooter like Chuck Harris but there its difficult because offensively again they have so many guards that can attack you if theyre competing like this I think the one player that they can ill afford to lose that they need on the floor its a you to what he brings they just dont have anybody else on a roster with him they they have the guard rotation but his ability on a guard rotation you your big cannot rotate over if he does weve seen the lobs its just difficult just difficult to ask and this is a different team since first year head coach Andy Enfield made the shift to M cross playing the four and playing three guards since that SMU has been a Jugger not offensively so tough to stop tomorrow right here on acc Network top 25 gymnastics meet for you live from Reynolds Coliseum and and Riley its Cal and NC State tomorrow 4 eastern time on AC Network see coach infield there heres hes in his coaching mode theyre up 34 and he 35 now and hes still going to find an excuse theres going to be something wrong with film CU they on P the score at 100 here but the one thing he is instill taking over this program is were going to play uptempo were going to just try and outscore him we asked a question to him about defense today and he goes ah look raino hes going to get his we just have to out score him well he said that but credit to him he did say raino was the guy he was going to allow shoot the rest of the guys he was going to lock in on and I think he did they did a great job in doing so where theyre like hey he just said hey Im not going to try to stop raino from getting this points hes a talented player I think an NBA first round draft pick hes going to get his double double hes going to get his 20 and 10 but everyone else were going to slow down make it difficult for him and with jayen Blakes being out it just made that game plan even more effective kick to the corner thats the type of shooting night it has been for Stanford they are five of 23 from three Music youre going to start to see some of the younger guys on the benches come in and play Music and looks like coach Smith is already tapped into the depth of his Music bench Mustangs are doing the same Yu and Matt crosss kns most likely over with a little bit more than four minutes left to this one and SMU up by more than 30 I think that showed is fine oh yeah he missed Wednesdays game against Cal with a shoulder injury and boom did he bounce back in a big way and its not just the points and the rebounding but his blocks of steals what he did against Reno tonight impressive you hear it as a player as a competitor you know you hear someone talk about a big a guy in your position and how good he is and he came out tonight from the very first possession played really solid defense against raino and showed hes a player developing himself now the defense has been there and the ACC leading scoring team on the season has 83 up Music big up by in the ACC tournament and itll be a close race going down the stretch and so many getting Road wins in in this league and and you can say this about any league but definitely in the ACC theyre difficult to get saw that today Partners found out a Lille going into Georgia TCH and taking an l and Tech playing with six guys and even Stanford youll lose this one but youre still very much in the mix oh yes you didnt have Jaylen Blakes youre going to fall to seven and four look at that upcoming schedule Wake Forest on Wednesday and then at Georgia Tech at Duke if they can put together a 32 or 4 one stretch over those next five Kyle Smiths team will be right at top the ACC battling for that top four top five as well that weight game is Big because wake is already won in Winston Salem so you need to split to give yourself a chance that if you you know youre right there with them for a tie break give yourself a chance if the decks sweep that series starting to run out of games thatll make it more difficult for Cardinals to play themselves in the question becomes how many teams get from the ACC and thats thats the I think right now its safe to say theres three for sure is it four or is it five to me it should be five cuz I think Pittsburgh did enough in the nonconference that even though they arent in the top seven why you cant go by the rankers absolutely Carolina is still right there even though this lost to Duke as bad as it is I dont know what the five are going to be I just think the number is five and I think SMU is one of them I wont argue that right now I I think but they but they have work to do because of the lack of quat one wins right now thats why theyre theyre going to need to take care of business here coming up and there few opportunities to get caught one wins like it or not thats just the way we are college Music basketball the computers matter what I dont like about the computers though I guess my frustration with the metrics is way too much emphasis is placed on November you know theres no metric that can show a team that improves over the course of a season like SMU has true but November has to matter because you cant punish a team you take Carolina as much as people get on cubber about that they had a top five schedule in the country you want a reward and you should you well they shouldnt be punished for playing good teams I think you can do both I think you should bake in to the metric how the team is playing in their final 10 games of the Season how how have they improved how are they playing now because it matters how youre playing in March it does but I also think November matters as well equally yes yeah see thats where I just disagree I I I would rather an SMU team playing like they are now than a team that had a great November and December and is 500 in League Play but thats just me and ultimately its going to be up to the committee and lets see if the committee agrees with you they wont they wont but look for SMU fans you got wake pit Clemson all at home in this building take care of business you will be in youre they have even Stanford everything they want to achieve right now despite this this LW here is right in front of them but were into February now right and youre youre right this is the month put yourself in position were Music approaching the heat just you know straightaway now you got to take care of B another rimrocker on an alley and its cber who throws it Music down and to your point its why Pittsburgh is still in you cant just go by its because of the November that theyve had I know Im trying to have it both ways I want p and SMU and and and theres a reality where they both could be absolutely its still there I agree with you I think in what we see from SMU and when you see them live and you watch their Music team they looked the part they do and they have the opportunity to more importantly in this building and this crowds been amazing I mean with you and President Bush and Romo all the stars are here to watch him play they they showed up and showed out for you I mean rashy rice is going to go from Moody Kum to the Super Bowl yeah he he skipped out on the Super Bowl press to come here tonights player of the game brought to you by into it Matt cross who really set the tone early 12 points in the first half he did he got off to a hot start knocked down a couple of threes played with a level of physicality and driving to the Applause paint as the bench is being cleared they the WalkOns coming in for SMU Jackson Applause young and Trey uter two Texas natives checking into the game I think they should score try to score if they get if they get a stop here absolutely theyll hold it but I I wish they would chuck one up hey if yo could take a three why not one of the walkouts right why not why Music not teams are still competing as they should oh we got lost on the back cut there tried to make up for it make a mistake like that you got to commit the foul you cant get give up an easy basket like Music that stay with us right here on acc Network nothing but net Joel Barry Luke Hancock Carlos Boozer and Taylor tanon bom in studio theyll break down what was a wild day across the ACC The Moody Coliseum crowd urging Jackson young to put it up but he looks over at the bench it dribbles this one out SMU a convincing Victory statement win at home 8561 Music win Andy enfields team improves to 8 and three tied for fourth in ACCC play for Randol chis our terrific crew Im Jay alter saying so long from Dallas lets get you into
