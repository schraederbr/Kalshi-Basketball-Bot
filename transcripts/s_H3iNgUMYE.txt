you know defensively on the boards how aggressive theyre going to be and one of the things thats played this team is how quickly they get off to a start in the game so lets see what the first 10 minutes looks like it was a loss last Saturday on the CW at Georgia Tech 7268 for Duke number 22 in the nation Charlottes in the green and they have the ball to start our game so glad that youre with us on a Saturday in the ACC a huge Saturday of action little bump on the play and a roach Nick Graves a homecoming from him for him from Durham North Carolina Ted Valentine Lee Cassell and Jerry heer in charge of the action this Applause afternoon going inside of t of the shot clock deep into The Possession first time out for Charlotte shot clock down to two driving to the rim not quite enough frill pretty good defensive possession for Duke coming right out of the clock you got a almost a 30 second shot clock violation Blue Devil shot 42 a week ago at Georgia Tech struggle from the on the arc four of 16 as a team McCain straight away and its a three ball the get us rolling hes a guy who scoring has been up and down but I think he can be really consistent 41 from three I think hes somebody if he hits his first shot can have a big afternoon exactly Mike could be good for his confidence after going over three on threepointers Jackson with a rim Bender for Charlotte he a guy whos been injured the last couple years hasnt played a lot of time hes you know hes kind of a 20 to 23 minute a game guy early in the season still doesnt have his conditioning yet but had a big game against STS in his last game 19 points in 20 minutes that was a career high effort for Jackson that is roach down the lane and they got foul well roach in his last three averaging 20 a game and if if youre looking for a guy whos going to pick up the scoring a little bit for Proctor its going to be him can go both ways drives left finishes right Strong finish inside didnt have a great end of the game against Georgia Tech couple of turnovers but hes a captain and something you dont see at Duke much a senior fore guy here as he completes the threepoint play Jeremy roach is playing his 104th game in a Blue Devil uniform as a 76 free throw shooter early lead for the Blue Devil Jackson trying to back down on Philip Hwy knocked away out of bounds keep it at this end of the Court 14 on the shot clock and youre seeing no double team help at all youre seeing manto man straight up Im going to guard my guy um Phil psky nice job that time big win on Tuesday at home for Charlotte against stepson out of the a sun you know no health no heding on screens fighting through Jackson again with a champ well and this the second time that hes profited from a guy getting beaten on off the dribble Jackson was eight and 12 shooting against ston and hes taken a couple of high percentage shots so far fist full of Rim both times filosi top of the key and he reminds me you know physically in the way he plays Armando Bott over at UNC Bott the leading rebounder early on in the season into the ACC Jackson way away from the hoop looking for a safety valve Patterson nowhere to go Jackson will te up a three bold but not beautiful no and much better him shooting that shot then the prior two possessions that he got two of 10 and three coming in on the season John sh talked about this moving filipowski to different places on the floor to the Elbow getting him out where hes not getting double teamed as much Mitchell aggressively to the rim against Jackson and a foul is call heres that look and uh get beating off the dribble Phil pasy uh trying to get over a little late getting off to help and uh nice dish Patterson really nice player for them Mark Mitchell is at the free throw line the sophomore from Kansas City Kansas 69 from the stripe on the year for Applause Mitchell Kane comes out for Duke Jaylen Blakes coming into the lineup K hit that threepointer earlier Mike yeah Tom we may see a little bit of this especially in the perimeter uh some early substitutions uh if you get guys with the maximum effort on the defensive end of the Applause floor BL Devils have struggled from the free throw line theyre 11th in the conference 70 theyve got a threepoint lead early on in our first half Patterson after a couple of pumps put it up there and missed Foster comes away away with a defender on his hip Foster in the paints and free throws coming up for Jeremy Applause roach its a second on graves Applause Mike roach the senior from leeburg Virginia did lead the team team High 20 points in that loss on the road against Georgia Tech where duid dominated that series Mike prior to our game last Saturday Duit won 16 in the last 17 meetings with Georgia attack Graves is a hes a big part of what Charlotte does I mean uh 24 assists six turnovers really good with the basketball Mitchell out and this and this one thing you know with uh with Aaron Fern that he will not with two fouls he will he put you on the bench and uh he will hell sit him down till the second half Shan Stewart is into the lineup for Duke he wears number 13 in white I think youre going to see you youre going to see a little bit more of him and I think youre also going to see a little bit more of TJ power out on the floor dangerous threepoint shooter for Duke DJ power yeah thats going to take a little bit of pressure off of filipowski on the perimeter Patterson crosses it over midrange and he knocks it down his uh his threepoint shooting has gotten better but hes really dangerous going to the basket and in the midrange he is their leading scorer just a shade under 15 points per game for the 49ers laai Patterson he deflected that one out of bounds it will stay with Duke along the Baseline take a timeout were early on CW Court Sid it it it makes it more special to come back here with you all and do a game and uh great memories here and uh great memories every time I come here with you Foster pumping up a three ball Caleb Foster actually did a nice job down to Georgia Tech 36 minutes for him 12 points in that game and that was kind of filling in on the Fly for Tyre Proctor Proctor and uh you know this team had a week to get used to playing without him and that was actually you know a good find and that that time Philip hsky didnt have to contend with the double team he found the open guy off of the dribble ninth made three of the season for Caleb Foster Patterson through the defense and the kick for the wideopen three raver hits it yeah thats uh thats his specialty hes going to be out there he hes only taken nine twopoint shots during the course of the year so hes a guy youve got to look for Beyond The Arc eight of nine from two so not bad inside the ark Reaper the red shirt Jr from greensbro North Carolina hitting that threepointer Bowski looking for his first shot of the game M its on a drive and it spins off the rim well thats what John sh would like to see him do as well maybe catch the ball in the elbow put the ball on the floor milic lost the handle in transition and the dunk at the other end jayen blinks this where Duke is so dangerous turning those turning turnovers into points Barry also into the game for Charlotte number 11 in Golden Green Patterson trying to go go Music Applause oneonone midrange and a hit for Charlotte from frill Blake spit on the fake that time it was a good offensive Applause move that whistle going against the blue doubles back to Shar illegal screen on Applause Stewart that milit just the the loose handle right there great breakout great look ahead you know roach as soon as he came up with a turnover his eyes went up the Applause floor Junior Jaylen Blakes with that Jam at the other end 49ers canot collaborate pass was intended for Jackson and out of bounds loose pass they tried to get a l to Jackson I dont think he was expecting it Jackson had a couple of dunks early on for the 49ers trailing by three just over 13 minutes to go in our first half Cameron Indoor Stadium not a lot of scoring out on the floor for Duke at this point with this lineup sellout number five 112 in a row here in dur shot clock is down at six roach carving his way against three Defenders young trying to clean up the mess and thats and thats where young is going to get his scoring in offensive glass now I dont think with Mitchell and young you dont have to double team either one of those guys in the post and Charlotte is continuing to do that bonus offense from y Ryan Young Who averages just under three points per game us an experienced player though in a transfer from Northwestern game number 131 in college for young this afternoon shot clock getting deep Patterson free throw line Mitchell goes high for the board had it knocked away Jackson over young got it back for a follow another Miss for the 49ers how about another chance Patterson misses and young swallowed it up and a foul is called Patterson on that uh trying for another offensive rebound still this is a this is a big physical Charlotte team okay now Applause okay first foul on Patterson hell leave the ball game bred Gill in there didnt hurt anything hurt two points for Patterson in the game in the first half as he goes to the bench Duke by five had put together a fourgame winning streak prior to the losses at Arkansas and then Georgia Tech and thats a three roach has it and hes got eight and again with this lineup roach is the one scorer on the floor that you need to zero in on and he was wide open Fred Gill directs some traffic shot clock inside of 10 high degree of difficulty on the move of the Mist from brazwell pretty nice help by Young though on that drive at Young hustling back down the court looking for the board and he got it to preserve The Possession two offensive rebounds by Young And it results in a three from Blakes and Duke has its largest lead lead of the first half only his second made three of the year and thats made possible on the offensive Rebound in the recycle by Young you know they they talk about you know Michael Jordan and Lenny Bas and uh think of the highlights that would have happened back in the early 70s an amazing honor for David Thompson and then so well deserve Applause absolutely back to the first half action here on CW Courtside Saturday Jackson has an open Lane to the REM and he punishes it hes got six and its all dunks both guys left him with a live dribble a break down Applause defensively that ends an 80 Run for the Blue Devils who by the way from Beyond The Arc by foure of six and four different players have hit threes all the way to the rim and creating contact and free throws for Blakes well and for Charlotte this is a great this is what exactly what you needed right here you got two guys going with the ball and a live dribble at the elbow but coming out of a timeout when a teams making a run at you a great answer right Applause here so Jackson had the jam on one end Mike but he picked up his second personal at the other to Blakes the free throw line now bad decision on the front end defensively but probably a good decision by filipowski not to get the foul right there to you know the compound Music things9 so very to the bench for Coach Fern quick conversation LS at the line I I want to see and not that I want him to pick up a foul but I want to see the referees on dieago Signal a foul on 99 thats I didnt even know you could wear 99 might have to go George Mike on you yeah right or Wayne Gretzky might have to get two referees by side by side to put lets get that one in cross that bridge where we come to Brad Gill nowhere to go against Mitchell staunch defending following Brill and that was the defending from Mitchell all the way Mike yeah and thats what they want to see from him to start with and Bild from McCain almost punctuated that defensive effort by Mitchell with a three BL devils are ninth in the ACC as a team 33 a little bit better this afternoon so far against Charlotte and were past the Midway point of the first half that rattles out to filipowski filipowski has not scored in the game so far Michael only one field goal attempt now a second one and uh had some contact on both of them no fouls called and dieago defended him on the drive there his teammates have picked up the slack 2413 well and with nio its its five fouls that you can give away so he can be physical until the paly threepoint Miss from brazwell four rebounds now for filipowski roach walks it up eight points for roach he leads all scorers right now Kane out of the corner came up short fouled in the act of shooting it looked like threadgill was the closest Music 49ers be Patterson on the foul yeah and thats uh you know Duke is getting to the line theyre getting inside thats starting to be a number thats really turning in their favor Charlotte has yet to get to the free throw line six of seven for the Blue Devils so far on free throws freshman Jared McCains at the line as TJ power comes into the Music lineup Blakes leaves Blakes by the way Mike averaging less than two points per game right now hes got seven those are really found points too its cuz he hasnt taken a ton of shots year this is a really intriguing lineup out there for Duke now too along you know with you got power and Philip howski and Mitchell along the front Applause line so the lead up to 13 that is now the largest of the first half just two points in the last five minutes for Charlotte looking for a three they wont get that one long rebound volleyball around to filipowski and thats a guy the guy who shot michic I think is their best player and he has not scored in this game yet Foster tried to get it to Mitchell fumbled out of bounds were going the other way Charlotte Mike just 35 shooting in this first half yeah I was at their practice on Thursday milic with the transfer from Virginia and thats the thing John sh told us is you know these guys theyve got power five transfers in their lineup and I said this team would probably be in the middle of the pack in the ACC so trying to get his teams attention with the you know with with this squad and um but milites I was very impressed with and his numbers reflect Applause that follow is against Charlotte Music theago and you can see that left leg kicking out a little bit and and part of that too Patterson didnt wait for him to come Get Set this is the thing youre you wont see that reaction to offensive things in this game but John shy will get fired up on the defensive end of the floor filipowski down the lane tough shot free throws ER and by the way mik well get to that in just a moment I was watching Lee Cel he signal the foul on 9 20 minutes and by the way the Blue Devils in a bowl game December 23rd theyre playing in the Birmingham bow against Troy Duke wi 7 and5 this season on the grid IR you know I I think that this this job and this program is looked at differently Tom over the last and started with David cut cliff and uh certainly Mike ELO what what hes done in the last few years and uh now Manny Diaz and you know it just has been in an upward trajectory and you know there is uh Manny Diaz and you know you know the oblong ball a lot better than I do but um I I think the perception of this job is is definitely increased in gotten better absolutely agree 100 Mike and Manny Diaz was the defensive coordinator at Penn State also was a head coach of the ACC at Miami and speaking of football Tuesday on inside the NFL nobody breaks down games like our crew with highlights and Analysis you wont find anywhere else this week the guys take a look back at the mammoth Sunday night battle between the Eagles and Cowboys inside the NFL Tuesday 87 Central only on the CW by the way I mean there to me Army Navy game is is unbelievable and its taken place today both teams five and six but you know that that matters not up in Foxboro first time ever yeah usually played in Philly in the home of the Patriots milic on the drive hanging and scoring his first two points as the leading scorer this season for the 49ers milic averages just over over 13 per Applause game course Co Coach K starting his coaching career at best point as a graduate yeah he talked about it was funny to listen to him and said practi yeah following his mentor uh Bobby Knight who he played for there and uh he said yeah it was a different deal coaching guys who would just come from a 50 mile hike and then expect having expecting him to play defense and getting stance wide open Miss from the corner brazwell he has struggled McCain scooped it up aggressively to the rim Takes a Tumble and scores uh so many times a missed long three and I think he surprised his teammates with that shot is the first pass to a fast break Duke looking to get up the floor quickly in this game thats nine points for McCain he leads Duke in scoring roach has eight Blakes has seven six points for Jackson hes on the bench right now for the 49ers milic again starting to get in the flow from close range well and and taking advantage of of power that time get into his right Applause hand so Duke trying to get his first win since November 24th just over a couple of weeks ago against Southern Indiana right here at home 8062 on a threegame home winning streak after the lost to Arizona millit against Mitchell a terrific manonman Applause defense Mitchell up for the rebound after the Miss from Applause milic up ahead filipowski with the kick and its McCain and its three from the corner pocket at 12 points and thats you know his decision making and you know Philip pasy really doesnt he doesnt really sulk if hes not getting shots and uh his decision making with the pass is getting better at the other end and transition Up and Under and good for Applause Buster so we do have a situation on the other side of the court and just at the tail end of that break so the Blue Devils have extended the lead to 36 17 heres the look The draw in you know everybodys going to converge on Philip housei and tell you duke has been really good in the open floor in the first half of this game so we have a medical situation for the moment was at the tail end of that last play far as I could seem like it was not a player but someone near courtside so again we are dealing with a medical situation here at Cameron indor stadium and we will return on the CW in just a moment you know and people have asked me over the the years have they thought about increasing the size have they you know what and there has been a lot of talk about trying to change the footprint you know thought about raising the roof putting in you know Street and and theyve looked at it architecturally and theres been no way and and probably the the person who has been adamant about keeping it the same has been Mike shashki and you know there was talk about building an arena in downtown Durham and um he was hes been right at the Forefront of keeping this the same now there have been upgrades to the inside of it but its its been pretty much the same 85th season for Duke basketball just want to update you that fan receiving medical attention on the side of the Court was conscious and taken for further evaluation so good news in that regard approaching the 5minute threshold of our first half in traffic bounces off to filipowski seven rebounds in the first half up ahead to Mitchell hell jam it and that for him if thats where he can get his point points early its going to be a big boost for his confidence out in transition gets some Applause dunks three points for Mark Mitchell hes a double digit scorer 11 per game at 11 points four boards and the loss at Georgia Tech fight on the weak side and its one by Mitchell up by head Philip hsky little ball fake and a little lay the left hand you know nice job that time got his got his back balance good ball fake and nice finish and really in no hurry 90 run on the first field goal of the game for filipowski you know they really have done a fabulous job in this game looking ahead everybody Mitchell running the floor extremely well you see the just the eyes up right there ball fake going for it finishing with his off Applause hand sophomore from Westtown New York pal filipowski Patterson is at the line for the first 49er free throw 78 as a team on the year Patterson shoots 70 close to 15 points per game leads him in scoring transferred from Missouri State but uh from Australia and you got to think that uh Aaron Fern is going to have a good pipeline from Australia only two who second International coach to have a division one job Mitchell line drive three filipowski tried the onehand rebound thats the way Kyle filipowski leads him in scoring just three points and one field goal today and a free throw as well and he just committed a foul also and Jeremy roach with eight points in this first half stepping back for a threepointer Duke is five of nine as a team on threepoint attempts McCain leading him with 12 points and the only guys whove played who havent scored are power and Stewart so pretty good Balan scoring the back court is picking up for Proctor not playing today so far Mike for Coach shy it looks like a week of intense practice has paid off Tyrese Proctor had not been part of that very early on within the first two minutes landed awkwardly on his left ankle on a drive against Georgia Tech and couldnt play the rest of the way right now the shooting for Duke 13 of 21 5 of N3 n of 11 from the free throw line so really good offensive and a lot of that has been as a result of their defense was 33 shooting for Coach Ferns team in the first half Foster picked up the foul his first Music just one of eight on threepointers also for the 49ers they make about six per game shoot Applause 33 Barry check out the shot clock with two on it for Barry turnaround free throw Applause line first two points for Barry in the game 20point lead Duke four one at home this Applause season prior of the lost to Georgia Tech they won five straight ACC Applause openers Mitchell in a congested area lay to the shot clock hell earn free throws and see that thats what Mitchell needs to look to do more more Milotic is guarding him but he was more he was playing a spy he was roaming around you know looking to disrupt really wasnt playing Mitchell hes got to be aggressive there get the pass which he did and attack the rim Fridays are magical with an allnew episode of pen and Teller fool us starring pendulette teller and new host Brook Burke Fridays 87 Central only on the CW I remember seeing them in Philly years ago Applause awesome another Miss from threepoint distance for Charlotte the struggles continue that was threadgill and then milic got back to tip it Applause away so far this afternoon the magic has belonged to Duke 21 points lead against Charlotte a team it has not seen since 09 so long ago the coach shy was in that game and a win they did play four times but that was not in the modern era early 1900s 2010 would be a memorable senior year for National Championship main hit 2010 at Lucas Oil Stadium and a win against Butler and the the title game 61 to 59 that half court shot came perilously close to going Music down back to Lucas Oil Stadium in 2015 to beat Wisconsin in the National final for the Blue Devils and Coach K Applause McCain two minutes to go in our first half Kowski individual move the defender fell down he took advantage good no call by the official that time know hes trying to buy a foul really John shy has reason to be happy with both ends of the four about 65 shooting for the Blue Devils and thats a little Fall Away by milic over Mitchell hes got six in the Timeout on the court look like mil also wanted a foul that he did not get so again Mike the Blue Devil 65 overall and 56 on threepointers well next week CW Courtside Saturday is back first upstart Lal heads to Miami to take on the number 15 hurricanes then we head to South Bend for a traditional ACC Big East match up as Georgetown is Notre aim CW Courtside Saturday continues next week 12 Eastern 900 am Pacific only on the CW what do you think our chances are of wearing just the shirt outside in South Bend Im going for it next week Im good lets do it theres the matchup next week Georgetown lost to Syracuse earlier today who did they lose to they lost to the Syracuse Orange okay long time Rivals you know what Im actually glad that those old big e schools are keeping some of those rivalries alive absolutely Judah minz led the way with 25 points and uh Ed kie who was an assistant at BC left did a great job at Providence and this is his first year at Georgetown so well get a look at another first year head coach for Notre Dame Michel sh thinking over for our good friend Mike Bray off the Miss Barry wants to run through the entire Duke D I think Dal Barry can be a great player for this team in practice watching him his numbers dont reflect it but uh hes got hes got great explosiveness a rangy body um I I I think there theres good things ahead for him steel and Barry came up with it in our first game of our CW Courtside Saturday double header Virginia de behind 19 points from Hunter Couture defeated BPO 7150 in blackbury so glad that youre with us Tom wormy Mike jinsky are outstanding CW ACC basketball production crew with you in dir theres the strip in the steel right down Broadway shot was challenged by milic as Stewart tried to get to the goal probably should have stopped at the free throw line although splitting nobody really stopped the dri dribble but a very nice recovery by milic and this one I mean he does everything he can shoot the three plays off the dribble rebounds the ball well I think hed be playing at Virginia if he had stuck in there and uh but this is a great great transfer for Aaron Fern its about a 9sec difference game and shot so roach conservative dribble up near midcourt twoman game Bowski Watch Out Below he got plenty of Rim but lost the ball and mich was the one who got the Applause block and then a drive by Foster heres the look I mean Phil lowski was not expecting the challenge and that is all ball oh that is a great defensive play how about this view from high above the basket right there look at that terrific defensive play now the question might be Mike did that ball actually graze the rim great camera work no hit a hand I think there was a knuckle Music involved no not the knuckle well watch Philips right hand yeah no thats what I saying it hit it hit his hand and never the rim right so would that in turn be a shot clock violation against Duke I they have to figure out the timing on that right now theres 5 seconds left on the game clock in our first half make or Miss Duke is shooting 58 Mike in the first half that is way above their season average of 48 which is still good third in the ACC so Ted Valentine is leading the discussion he s right there I said you know they were looking at hit the hand okay so thats the indication for it hit the knuckle right the indication for 99 by the way Mike Lee Cel put up a five and a four and then F reversed flipped it back and forth so that was thats what happened on the fou against 99 for Charlotte here a great heres our great our great TV production crew giving you that overhead look I mean filipowski gets high marks for the aggressive move but this is look at that ball on hand on all terrific defensive work eigor milic defending actually hes what really helped michic was uh playing this past summer on the Polish national team see I had to get that in there Tom that is outstanding work by your support staff helped that his father was a coach so you know but uh and that is in fact a shot clock violation all right so hand does not equal rim yeah you learn something every day you also learn that Luke is undefeated with a halftime lead and its sizable against the 49ers so once again Ted Valentine Lee Cel and Jerry heer parsing out the situation and weve been told that the shock clock violations of the 49ers will have 5 Seconds to work with at the end of this first half Music so Duke would shot only 42 on the loss of Georgia Tech much better much better this afternoon theyre going to adjust the clock weve seen 92 on the clock that seems like a lot but okay 92 and then overzealous defending from J Blakes his first personal foul I dont know that thats overzealous given the week that they just had in the uh in the practice practice went right y I will say that based on what coach shy told us Mike his Blue Devils have responded to this week to reenergize and recharge Patterson oh a three thats a rarity in the first half he has six points and so a late three from Patterson to take it to the locker room and filipowski Arkansas and the losing effort had 26 points a game high and 12 points on the road at Georgia Tech last Saturday cranking up the second half on CW Portside Saturday and a foul is called Graves for Charlotte his third and weve seen in this game so far that that filipowski has not spent a lot of time in the low post where he can get double a lot hes been out on the floor more Blue Devils won 27 games a season ago as the tournament champs as that one rims out mcain with a Reload and its money 17 points and three threepoint Applause baskets McCain The Freshman from Sacramento California milic Catch and Release Kowski had the position Applause tipped out of bounds and will stay with Duke PL of time on that shot clock really playing with five out on that possession everybody for the on the for Duke out beyond the free throw or threepoint loine you mentioned Duke win in the tournament a season ago coach sh the first first person to win one as a player and Coach after last year 146 in conference play they went 160 Mike here at Cameron endoor stadium has lost an early game this year against Arizona beat Virginia in the title game in the tournament its all coming down to the final episode you wont want to miss the emotional season finale of Sullivans Crossing this Wednesday 87 Central only on the CW Chad Michael Murray of One Tree Hill Fame starring in that show and its the final episode dont miss Applause it we had a lot of outstanding episodes of ACC football on the CW this season Mike we added another chapter last week in Atlanta with the second game of our double header and the surprise win by the yellow jackets they werent surprised coach stmy wasnt so that was a a very nice start for him first ACC game on the sideline against Duke at home and a court storming man that was all net Graves ripping the ropes for the 49ers first points of the game Graves well he picked up the the two early fouls and in the first half really didnt spend much time on the court talk about it hes uh from Durham kaposi and he hit the deck and Philip hsky is down behind the play right ankle so roach grabs the board and Philip howski still down Music Music its a great move Mike with a secondary Spin and he comes down on Jacksons foot and he didnt roll it completely over just tweaked it a little bit now Im not Im not diagnosing the injury at all anytime you you tweak it it Music hurts we wont read the lips there but um Jose fona the uh trainer extraordinaire for Music Duke five points eight boards for Kyle filipowski he leads Duke in both of those categories so far this season on that bench for the Applause moment kans up to 19 points as tied as seeson in career roach he lines up up a three and its not an issue see again I mean Im not Im not burying a guy but you know they come down and double team Mitchell inside which I dont in my opinion I dont think they need to do and that allows a good look at a at a jumper outside 124 career made threepointers for Jeremy roach the senior hes got two tonight Jackson backs his way and got by Young and thats just a good recognition you know and Jackson is a guy who they you know they may think about through this entire game John Shire has theyve not double teamed anybody theyve let everybody play man on man first points for Jackson that werent of the dunk variety out to McCain sizes it up angular rebound pulled down by Graves Patterson had roach on his hip created some contact so filipowski Mike has gone back to the lock locker room for further evaluation fou was on roach his Applause second make a decision right you know sometimes in like for this game if you want to you know you can ret tape it and you know depending on the severity or they can make a decision to shut it down in this situation youre up by 21 20 yeah they do have a game on Tuesday here at home against Hoster in the first alltime meeeting between Duke and HRA thats a 700 pm game Baylors coming up on the schedule Syracuse in early January the first ACC opponent for Duke as well Baylor is a thats a game thats looming large because its a a nonconference power five game Applause roach main floating to the rim and Duke has got gotten some big time offensive rebounds in this game that have turned into Applause points I was saying so far in the in their power five nonconference games Dukes one and two at this point so for their NCA tournament resume that Bor game is going to be big well keep an eye on those net rankings as the season progresses 14 teams out of the ACC are ranked in the top 25 this week including Duke at 22 thats a late foul not a good foul by Jeremy roach its the third on roach teammate Jared McCain is up to 21 points so hes continuing to increase on his season and career high scotting report you know Graves five of 15 coming into the game from three so make him prove his point challenge that shot but dont foul him 81 free throw shooter Nick Grace as Mike mentioned from right here in Durham hes hit dble double figures scoring five times this season for the Applause 49ers one more upcoming fouled on the threepointer hes up to five points for Graves Graves actually played at Durham Academy here for a couple years with Coach Ks grandson moms still a teacher here knocked out of Bounce of the 49ers in a 20point hole in the second half just four minutes in roach comes out picked up a couple of fouls so hell leave with three personal fouls roach has 11 points and hes made a couple of threepointers dread Gill hits the three so filipowski walking back to that Duke bench well I me you know without Philip palski and they look good walking back and without Proctor some interesting lineups combinations out on the floor for John Music shy and Tre young immediate double looking for the open man the man was open but it was out of bounds McCain leading the today J and difference is that you know his shooting percentage from three on the season has been really good 41 but from the twopoint range on the year seven of 26 uh just a little above 25 but here in this game Tom hes three of six from three four of five from inside the ark hes getting into the rim shooting much higher percentage there and its reflected in his scoring 16 made threes on the season for McCain and that leads the team this Applause year couple of players get tangle up at a foul is call McCain see here boy you got the you got the yin and the Yang of this you got McCain at zero and you got oh wait a minute Nago at 99 we got it all covered there numerically Music yeah so were watching Kyle filipowski hes he said its over to that scorers table we keep an eye on that for the moment is patter well thing the thing was if you if he was going to return it would have to be early or the only thing was going to happen was that ankle was going to tighten up on the bench so probably a good sign 102 Run for the 49ers cross cross it over go to the rim milic recovered and knocked it away from Foster other end hanging and scoring and thats Graves with seven points thats another way that often triggers a break to get the rejection and and miches has erase a lot of points at the rim and now the run is nine nothing four blocks in the game so far for milic out of bounds 49er ball filipowski coming back Applause in this looks like two points and then not great Rush up the floor no bigs back and a really nice take by Mr Graves and some nice life on the bench by Charlotte coach Aaron Ferns team back into this game 5542 Trail by 18 at halftime Patterson trying to back it down and does so 11 points for him Mike thats an 110 run and he has got a very strong lower body and showed it on that play and looked looked like a a polished low post player Im about charlot at 75 shooting this half Roach the aggressive movement of PA is called earlier in the half Duke was up by 25 45 to 20 and thats a big foul thats the third on Patterson so a good take by roach calm things down get to the free throw line but you get the third foul on Applause Patterson that 25point lead late in the first half for the Blue Devils roach at the line Applause got our Courtside Saturday double header coming up next week at Miami and at Music notame so thats Jackson the big man for Charlotte getting some medical attention looking at the right hand of Jackson hes got eight points in the game roach has 13 with those free throws foul on Duke Philip Music howski second on Applause Music him actually Charlotte has been able to get to the rim off the dribble time a nice job and uh and Nick Graves has had a nice comeback in the second half after being Limited in the first half with Applause fers Charlotte was in Conference USA a season ago this year their first in the American Athletic Conference really good teams Florida Atlantic a highly ranked team this year Memphis Dela South Florida and Mike the nine points for Graves all in the second half yep McCain has has an alley he knows his alleys he kicks it out Blakes got it to ball well and that time with with milit she took the body and it really limited his ability to block the Applause shot its now nine points for Jaylen blinks thats again a guy like that for Blakes to pick up the scoring average is just under two points a game roach almost had the steal now Graves perimeter working mtic thats a three followed his own Miss Graves driving offensive fou against Graves and the fourth on Applause Music him Music just barely got there that was Mike again the emphasis this year you must have legal guarding position outside of the restricted area before the plant absolutely and that was very it makes it very very difficult for the secondary Defender to get position that is the emphasis calling block charge this season Mitchell free throws upcoming first on milic so Mark Mitchell to the free throw Music line well and what this accomplishes too is youve got now Charlotte with five team fouls so youre a couple away from being in the bonus mitell has got hes got such a flat trajectory on his shot hes got to be almost perfect to make Applause it 69 on the season for Mitchell couple of Misses McCain had a chance at it so 14 of 19 as a team free throws for two Patterson against two Defenders filipowski came over foul is called so the foul was not on filipowski they got Mitchell for the foul his third Blakes Blakes will be called for the foul you saw Mitchell was not involved in the defensive play so again Blakes picks up the foul is Music Applause second I think theyre theyre trying to figure out who the foul was on our replay revealed that Blake was certainly closer than Mitchell cuz the initial signal was 25 which would have been Mitchell but youll see hes not really in the play defensively its more Blakes right there number two in white on the body yeah see Mitchells nowhere near the 49er yeah then Philip hsky thought they called it on him coming in late all right so for the last time Mike Im going to tell you that Blakes picked up the foul and that is two on blinks okay thats an easy foul the signal two not Music 99 Patterson at the free throw line you know youve talked about you touchdown the Patterson is their leading scorer but he has very quietly worked his way into this game really didnt take a lot of shots in the first half but its starting to take control of this game Patterson has 13 points on four seven shooting and hes four or six from the free throw line kosi into the corner blakeson got it right back filipowski from roach lost the handle fights for it shhawks at six BLS free ball BLS now how about uh how about 33 points from McCain and Blakes combined down low and lost out of Nick Graves getting out doing some work had some foul trouble early in this game and then we talked about the fact that uh laa Patterson their leading scorer doing some good work in the low post in the second halftime and theyre showing some fight 14point ball game they got to within 11 Mike with the score was 5948 so they have cut into that 18point halftime lead established by Duke after it shot 58 in the first half Charlottes won two of their last three that includes a win Tuesday at home against Stetson where they made 11 threepoint basket thats a season High theyve got four made threes in the game Duke has eight on 14 Applause attempts kaposi trying to create some space a second effort he hit the deck hard what happened that time he just got buried underneath the backboard hit his elbow right elbow and it has been a he spent a lot of time on the for just look where he is he cant uh no for him to go Reaper did a nice job defensively held his ground yeah clutching that right elbow and he scoreless in the second half too much yeah its its been a tough afternoon for Mr filipowski Five Points nine rebounds filipowski 49er basketball triling 62 48 first true Road game of the season for the 49ers knocked around Reber goes to the the floor I think they called a foul on Reaper I think Blakes was under the pile now reer gets the foul his second about the Hustle by Blake Mike to take it away cuz Reaver had that basketball well and this is the thing that John sh wanted to see coming out of that week of practice is white jerseys on the floor going after Applause basketballs roach needs some help Mitchell lunging for the pass and Barry Jeremy roach almost tripled himself into a lot of trouble that time its a first foul on Barry one and one and here we are 1024 in the second half and Duke is in the bonus already so Mitchell just two of six from the line so far four points for Mitchell four rebounds hes at the strike for John shy oh my God sh an assistant from 2014 22 assisted on that 2015 National Championship team for Coach K and a player in 2010 national champs First Team all ACC and an AllAmerican John Shire as I sit next to the AllAmerican Music Applause produc little better at the line for Mitchell that time Mike I know you appreciate big man free thr shooting well and and heres the thing especially for Mitchell um if if theyre going to play off him he needs to you know lessen the distance create contact get to the free throw line make the other team pay for not guarding him well Graves who just came in Mike with his four personal fouls lost the basketball on the sideline initially it was given to Duke and they will have possession Blakes on the inbounds nine turnovers in the game for Charlotte and I think you know as the season unfolds that TJ power may be kind of an X Factor for this team this threepoint shooting could be a big plus for Philip howski widening the floor a little bit taking some pressure off of him especially in the low post you can see even you know when he goes down low you can see how closed in their defense is kaposi and the shot clock too strong back out to Roach nice even though he missed a shot nice tap out to recycle The Applause Possession roach phasi travel traveling prior to the kick out to Foster and thats also the ninth turnover for Duke in the game you know hes very skilled with the ball but for a big guy its a tough thing to catch the ball with you know with your back turned to the basket get in motion try to do something with itow has five points in the game mik four times this season hes gone for 20 or more Duke able to kind of get a little bit more of a hold on this game but uh a nice fight by Charlotte after that first half think maybe getting a little bit of a momentum Bounce by hitting that three at the end of the half its the first ranked opponent that theyve played this season last one on the road against a ranked opponent you go back to 2009 thats the last time these two teams met Duke won that one they played three times prior to today here and Duke has won them all 6448 935 to go in our second half wormy jaminy and our outstanding crew on CW Courtside Applause Saturday well keep it going for you on the CW and the ACC all the way to midmarch take it right up to the ACC tournament Washington DC is the destination this year Patterson shot clock goes inside of 10 this is a complete isolation now he kicks it came up way short ball did not hit the rim and then gra stees it up Mike look like8 seconds on that just a bailout foul that time second on Foster now its its interesting with nine minutes to go in the game were seeing the first double team help and it actually came on Patterson in the low block we saw we saw filipowski coming over to give a little help in the low Applause post so foster is coming out with Graves at the free throw line McCain came back in main leads everybody with 21 in fact Patterson is the only

tested by their Charlotte team at 5 and three on the season Duke with the same record starting the afternoon P lets it Go Mitchell got it Mitchell hit the deck and hes going to the line so when we come back straight against nonconference unranked opponents did you get all that G man yeah I soaked it all in you just just washing over me appreciate that very much its always a pleasure to be with the legend for the Blue Devils Mike jinsky is number hangs in the Rapters of this Applause building and well do it for the entire season on CW Courtside Saturday Mitchell has a Bo eight points now for Mitchell and you know I I think you know with him and and with most players that the more reps you get the more you go to the free throw line the more comfortable you feel and uh you know hopefully for him that transitions into confidence and better results fight on the offensive blast won by the defensive team the other thing for Mitchell Mike a little more experience in late game situations controlling your emotions yeah yeah thats uh not a not a wise technical late in the game down to Georgia Tech he had a great follow dunk and then the taunting technical negated all that Blue Devils will play Georgia Tech here on their home floor for the second meeting between the teams this season McCain got two defenders in the air he goes old school Runner and couldnt finish the play The Crowd certainly wanted it its a good looking play the other end for Charlotte finished off by Bradwell his first buck yeah he had a rough first half actually was coming off a a very good game against STS and had 15 points had battled hes been battling injuries for most of his career brazwell was over five from the floor in this game in the first half hes on the scoring sheet Mitchell able to hang on to it aggressively to the rim spun into the fender created the the foul on reer third on him so Mitchell continues to get his free throw shooting practice in six of 10 from the line so far hes got a couple coming up right here for Mark Mitchell Saturday December 30th the bar stool Arizona bowl is coming to the CW catch all the as the highflying Toledo Rockets face the rugged Wyoming Cowboys 2023 bar stool Arizona bow Toledo Wyoming Saturday December 30th four Eastern one Pacific only on the CW certainly hope you were with us all the ACC football action during the course of the Season we had some Thrillers we picking it up with basketball as well if Im not mistaken I think Mitchells made his last six free Applause throws is now eight 12 in total and thats a for the rest of the year youll live with that number for sure started the afternoon as a 69 free throw shooter right there right at the corner of the the free throw line at the elbow be a great place for filipowski to receive roach stepping back and knocking it down good pump fake side step JJ reic used to make a living with that move 16 points for roach above his season average of 14 MCH Baseline and he lays it in for the ners its eight points for Applause milic 5 and A2 minutes to go in regulation Duke in no hurry in these possessions trying to use good portion of the shot clock filipowski forgot the basketball a sliding saving attempt by Nago went out of Applause bounds coach Fern who was on the Charlotte staff the last four years also coached in the NBL the top pro league in Australia and the Queensland basketball league you know Ive been doing college basketball for 22 years Im this is the first time I ever saw this at Charlotte practice okay they had piped in to their practice facility during a scrimmage Duke crowd noise actual student crowd noise piped into their practice lets go duke lets go it was it was act it wasnt just random crowd noise it was I dont know if they got it off of YouTube where they got it from Id never heard that in a visiting fa that is attention to detail right there and there are the crazies theyve sold it out again Mike 52 straights camed into a stadium I just started laughing to myself when I was sitting over the corner I heard that CU then I said all right this great they you know everybody tries to make it loud and you know what I heard lets go dke lets go D said this is look is over the top exactly what theyre experiencing this afternoon roach put on the brakes and let the defender fly on by pul the old Tom Cruz move 18 points you know what he did there Mike that was his move he stopped short and hit the Applause jumper Yago nice move by 99 deserved a better fate though didnt Applause he I tell you this uh this Charlotte ball Club can throw some large bodies out of the floor got to imagine Mike Charlottes going to contend in the American Athletic Conference theyve got size speed good coaching coach shy was Raven about the coaching staff for Charlotte the intrig you supported it with the piped In Crowd noise well Milotic I think is hes a polished player but the one Desa Jack his as he gets into shape and he gets his timing right hes the guy who can really see some improvement first American Athletic Conference game will be January 2nd at SMU which by the way coming up the will be in the ACC the footprint will enlarge SMU Cal and Stanford part of the rotation next season when are we heading out to California cannot wait team man cross country if its if its the last weekend of the Season we may kick hang for a little bit I mean filipowski Changing Hands it just spun off well go first class Gman you know that bats like an English G Patterson on the move the follow in the Miss and Philip psky got it its all about you know you get that get that Sunday with the F on the B well and you saw the shot by Foster he was looking for a foul and I think he got it a nine man threes were du you got those two guys on the season Tom average 10 points combined today they give you 33 for the and then you got the new coach Manny Diaz in a chef hat can you smell what Manny is cooking oh baby in amongst the crazies Duke footb fans hoping they will be celebrating like that after the bowl game and then into next season Applause free throw line for Caleb Foster kans 21 leads everybody Fosters got five hes at the line made his first start today for the Applause Freshman I wonder if Manny will wear that on the side lines keep the tradition going what you got cooking here in Durham for football season have to take care of basketball season first you can ask him that in the pregame meeting preproduction meeting next I tell you what the coaches in the ACC are so generous with their time in all sports but especially during football season for us on the CW certainly wish the best to Mike Elco departing as the head coach of Duke michic opposite shoulder Bowski 12 boards Applause filipowski you know the good thing is mik remember he went down with that ankle he came but Im a little interested hes still out there you know with a 22point game and he wants the Run shot clock at six Foster gave it up Mitchell L top clock drive and score Mitchell you know from what Ive seen he has been very aggressive in attacking the rim its been a different mindset for him in this game I hope it continues 12 points now for Mitchell who attempted a threepointer didnt make it hes now one of 14 on threes for the season thats an easy layup for Barry and you know when youre afraid to go to the free throw line you can be very timid out there on the floor so you know if his free throw shooting continues the way it is today I mean that could change his whole game Duke has a team mic 22 of 28 and thats close to 79 from the free throw line time out on the court so heres what it looks like for the Blue Devils Mike told you about that game Tuesday against hastra then Baylor Queens well have that one for you and then well talk ACC basketball with Syracuse and Notre D and you know Tom and this is is its oh this is a strange time of the year in college basketball because they had a very Compact and challenging November and and this part of December you got finals now you had Thanksgiving and theres Manny going off with the high fives and hes hes all right he he won the press conference today he won the crowd you know check those two things off but you got finals and then youve got a couple games and then youve got Christmas break and then then you come back and you got to get reignited and then you got the ACC season started so its its not an e December is not easy you saw on the schedule January 2nd at home against Syracuse to open up the ACC schedule for du we certainly thank coach Diaz for spending some time with us at halftime quick interview jooy the festivities this afternoon met him last night for Washington Duke having dinner over there and as was he blinks with another three 15 points thats just too shy of his career high of 17 for Applause Blakes TI in the back again one many third time caught up with him milic McCain and that is off of Sterling young so it appears that the Blue Devils on their way to Victory on their home floor will improve to five and one the home this season six and three overall final minute no luck for Applause foster so this snaps the little two game losing streak for Duke back on track Ill tell you what Charlotte made it interesting though Mike it was an 11point game at one point earlier in this half yeah its its a good game for them to build on and uh you know but but for for John shy and his team he talked about getting back into into the practice gym and shutting out the outside all the noise um relying on themselves and uh you know I think it was mission accomplished on that you know from that standpoint Spencer hover coming in for Duke hubt seeing action in his third game this season he does have a made field goal of the twopoint variety for the senior from Los Angeles Applause California shot clock winding down all right 55 15 seconds looks like hovert is just going to dribble it out G man 8056 the Blue Devils are winners in impressive fashion and they had to fight off the 49ers in the second half well nice job both ends of the floor offensively defensively Charlottes showing some nice fight in the second half but uh
