into the teeth of the Oakland Zoo here at the Pete and away we go Roger SS with the ball in hand Lyn kid wins The Tap Miami starts with it in the black on the rout 6 and 18 overall 2 11 in the ACC but Jeff cable said to his yesterday this team is talented and they are confident that is Jalil Bea the top 10 recruit in the country who misses from Deep we show you the pit starting lineup cam Corin is the Florida state transfer in the front Court Zack Austin going to have his hands full with Matt Cleveland today and then Brandon Cummings on the drive makes his second career start meantime for Miami we told you be Thea whos got it here coming off his best game of the season and then fellow true freshman Divine Ugo chuku makes a fourth straight start at point guard and you think that has really helped things for the canes it has because one its its taking Jil paa off the ball and he doesnt have to be a point guard now he can go back to his natural position thats being a score Miami team that has had losing streaks of seven games 10 games this year but again its been different recently here is Cleveland 262 the last seven like we said and 17 per game for the year a double comes and good hands from ish Leed on LY kid legett dropped it off Corin muscles up too strong pass Brandon Johnson Hugo chuku freshman from Sugarland Texas Johnson scoreless his last two games and they need offense from Brandon Johnson today well theyre going to leave him open and hes got to do a better job of playing now that they recognize that pit is doubling link kid in the post so lets see if they can one if kid identifies that and two if Johnson Dives weak side to get himself an easier basket and not settle for jump shots guo Diaz Graham the junior 7even footer from Spain tried to hand it off for legot wins it back shot clock winding down legs got to realize it slips it P to Corin who gets the roll thats the basket thats the type of basket were talking about with this leg youre going to get your opportunities get these other guys involved early youre going to need them and then pick your spots so you said theyre doubling Lin kid youd like that choice by pit yes hes a really good player in the post Applause here you got numbers here he takes a step back but he finds corn for the easy bunny there inside and thats the way you want to play almost like a point guard there get your teammates going pick and choose your spot stay in attack mode all game long so pit with it and here is leot had a roll off with the Panthers 14 10 overall 5 and eight in the ACCC you see but a four game losing streak they have dropped eight of 10 we told you there are shorthanded without low and done again Applause today heres johnson been averaging eight a game before he was quiet the last two kid the Virginia Tech transfer on the face up back out shot clock winding down Ugo chuku with a great finish from the rookie so many different matchups throughout the today this point guard matchup of Cummings and ukuku the Freshman matchup who settles down and place good basketball be critical for the team again Cummings getting that second career start three in the yellow for the Panthers went the Lincoln Park an hour away from here left hand on the drive and its cleared by Johnson two freshman going at it at the point guard Spot Cleveland head of steam just ran over leged no foul called and he couldnt convert fish are letting him play a lot of contact there Bill Courtney said Clevelands been going downhill he said its like trying to stop Derek Henry thats how Clevelands been going recently and thats how he makes you play he forces the officials a lot of time thats slow their whistle hes going to initiate contact I think its a great job Out official is not calling that foul leg get missed the jump shot and its a slow start for both teams to combine two of nine shooting from the floor in the first four minutes and a little sleepy start theres a trying to feel for whats happening theyre trying not to let Matthew Cleveland get to that left hand now lets see if they make identify Lyn identifi they come in Baseline on double team thats the pass you want to see kid passed out of it nicely Ugo chuku missed it but kid the offensive rebound Johnson Hoy they sag off of him again and hes opened up 0 of two great sign for Miami when L kid is a big if youre watching this when you the double team when youre in the post when the shot goes up keep yourself involved in the game go to the offensive glass next time link kid secures offensive rebound as you try to look the go back up I dont know how many opportunities hes going to get in the half court offense Diaz Graham off Target and kids fourth rebound to your point already in a two2 start these first five minutes with Cleveland directing for Miami Johnson you can tell the coaching point was keep letting it Fly we need you offensively no reason to lose confidence in your shot hes Carolina transfer yeah its hard to do when you know when youre struggling but again the teams going to leave you open take those open threes sometimes those are the best shots youre going to get in the half court offense Corin missed it Diaz Graham attacked the offensive glass and Le it buries it great job by is leged there walked in one hes going to draw a crowd that time he got an opportunity there stepped into it no hesitation both of these teams need to be relaxed playing they dont have all their weapons theyre missing key guys from the start Miami is more whole than Pit but just stay relax and play they playing a lot of freshman Miami has more experienced guys to rely on right now ly kid walks with it and its a Miami turnover five all the first 5 and A2 minutes and is legged we said here is a big guard a Defender take a lot of pressure off legged and and low and he comes out now and theyve got to figure out a way put so much pressure on Cummings who should just relax and play I mean theres no reason for him to look over his shoulders and just play through the mistakes hes going to Applause make heres Le with some good hands from Ugo chuku shot clock winding down and Leed got fou by Brandon Johnson yeah they had a couple of players roll ankles in their second practice but really their first full practice after Christmas and so that kind of changed what they were able to do in practice and it just has not been the same here since the turn of the calendar though there have been a lot of close games I mean you look at a team with 10 losses eight of them are in Quad one and five of the eight quad one losses are by six points or fewer now its no Solace for pit fans but they have had a lot of close games and then you look ahead at opportunities still out there Quad 4 game today you cant lose it only one more quad one out there at Louisville it is and thats so its not a lot of time to make up games but you got to take care of business try to get that Louisville game and then get in the ACC tournament as weve seen just in most recent history anything can happen you got to get low back duns out for the year but you got to get low back get him healthy sometimes rest this late in the year can be a great thing jayen low forc to watch today in concussion protocol after that happened in the second half Tuesday against SMU sleepy start here Brandon Johnson triggers again way too strong and Brandon Cummings with the rebound fourstar recruit whos at the controls of course younger brother of Nelly who played here at pit two years ago on that NCAA tournament team for Jeff cable Papa abadu Kate Richard freshman physical player brings good energy and Off the Bench early good post the Nile from Johnson on the feed from Zack Austin great read by Leed but he couldnt control it and AJ ston McCrae knocks down the triple tough bounce there its Lea did a great job and anticipating PL unable to Corral a loose ball and Miami benefits with a three Cummings got to be aggressive I mean theres a lot of responsibility so far here early this Leed is being really aggressive with the ball in his hand and this team is relying these other guys on the floor are relying on the penetration that low usually presents like that Jorge Diaz gram who was shoted great this season to Wi of GMO of course and now State McCrae rises again and he knocks down another AJ State McCrae the fifth year senior sford transfer hes been rolling the last two games and that continues here early he has I I think the emergence of uku just relaxes everyone else now everyones back in internal roles theyre more scores and we talked about with Nigel pack out this team was missing their their starting point guard and it affected everything now theyre settled down this is a dangerous Miami team that has offensive Talent heres the Steal You nearly get it you dont come up with it the ability to walk into one you dont get one easy than that this is just poor transition defense here by Pittsburgh got to get back this is a very talented Miami offensive team Bill Courtneys got him playing a lot better interim head coach it took over right around Christmas of course when Jim Lena stepped down 75 years old in his 14th season Bo Courtney had been with Coach L for a long time and he has done a really good job with this team they had a heart to heart about 3 weeks ago and they are playing together and they are playing hard despite what the record is they had a blowout loss against SMU Phi Courtney told those guys youre getting on the bus youre getting off off the team and credit to these young men they red around its a disappointment when coach Ls retired I think a lot of times you commit to a coach when he retires I think they felt let down and they they showed in their play now theyre responding Austin Schwarz had hit that third three in a row for Miami but then an answer from cam Corin his second bucket Miami is up by five here in the first half on the road pits got to get back in this thing with the defensive end of the floor right on Q they get a turnover from ston McCrae and leit gets the roll through the contact from Bea they need pick six turnovers like that get back its the defensive end to the floor right now talent for talent this Miami team can score the basketball youre going to theyre playing with confidence as we talked about a guys are more in their Road youre going to have to come out and guard these guys and make a Miss well another turnover for Miami right in a mustwin spot he doesnt need to do too much but he has to be aggressive hes not going to come out of the game hes going to play a lot but yeah he doesnt need to be jayen low but this team needs him to be aggressive when he gets the ball in his hand looking to make some plays playing through his Applause mistakes Beth thank you very much and welcome to Pittsburgh Peterson Event Center and just carve yourself in your couch for the rest of the day because this Saturday is loaded with basketball weve got Miami and pit alongside Randolph childr Im Mike Monaco and pit is in an absolute mustwin spot with its dwindling NCAA tournament hopes you see where they are right now Joe lardy has them outside the field got them as their 10th team out they have 10 losses this year eight of them in Quad one theyve dropped four games in a row theyve dropped eight of their last 10 and theyre shorthanded today as well against the Miami team that dont look at that record in the bottom left of your screen theyre playing a lot better recently theyve won two of their last three and the Panthers are without two of their three best players Jaylen low suffered a concussion on Tuesday Damen Dunn last Saturday fractured in elbow that might keep him out for the rest of the season as cam cor gets fouled and hes going to the line so Randall for you this is a massive game for pit and yet Miami is coming here with house money playing better yeah its a dangerous game for for pit theyre theyre moving the basketball world theyre playing together which they have to do minus that guard play the production theyve gotten from those guys that are injured but this Miami team is really talented and no one looks at this team and thinks theyre bottom of the ACC talent wise and theyre a dangerous team to play this late in the year because theyre starting to play with the level of confidence s Bill Courtney there hes starting tos settling in with this group and theyre figuring it out theyre playing they playing with confidence and a lot of that has to do with the emergence of their freshman dwine ugu chuku inserting that freshman guard in the starting lineup kind of slides everyone back to their natural position and Miamis playing better for it well K cor just missed both free throws but Zack Austin got the offensive rebound and then a strong drive but it rolled off for amsal delich and then the loose ball secured by the fifth year senior big man ly kid for this Miami team at 6 and8 overall 2 11 tied from last in the ACC but those recent wins at home a couple of weeks ago against Notre Dame and then Tuesday at home against Syracuse in Coral Gables when the canes put up 91 and theres a lot of Talent on this team nobody bigger than Matthew Cleveland hes off the floor right now for Miami but Lin kit as well hes got his second bucket great play there getting Lin kit the ball in the middle of the floor hes not on the side where the double team has been coming from the Baseline when he catches it in the middle of the court I dont think anyone knows where to come from to double the basketball great job by Miami identifying that getting the ball in the middle heres ish Leed 16 points a game and there is a ton on his plate without low and done Zack Austin couldnt score on the drive and hes still scoreless and all 13 points for pit have come from leit and Cory Jalil Bea top 10 freshman in the country back in his home state coming off his best game and that is the fifth three already for Miami and the lead is eight hes talented hes a natural score and now hes just freed up to when he gets the ball hes in attack mode his team is playing better theyre unselfish with the basketball theyre sharing it theyre communicating theres a Joy about Miami Heat basketball right now I mean Miami Hurricane basketball right now strong take from ish Leed and a much needed answer from pit to snap a 70 Applause run this Le is going to have to stay in attack mode I mean his superpower on the offensive end of the floor is drawing fouls hes constantly putting pressure on you initiates contact takes the bump and got a chance in an n one someone else is going to have to step up and help him hes the fifth year senior transferred in last year from University of Rhode Island preseason second Team all accs had a ton on his plate already but even more today hes a twoway player and I think thats the most underrated aspect of his game as well he often time guards the best perimeter player on the other team Big Block on Cleveland from Papa amadu kante and now in transition delich couldnt knock down the three offensive rebound though guo Diaz Graham for the Panthers Jeff Cables going deeper into his bench here in this first half and hes getting some energy from a couple of freshman heres delich from Bosnian heroina with the turnaround from amsal delich Del got to be aggressive again youre getting opportunity now theres no reason to look over your shoulder wor about coming out of the game just go out share the basketball make Applause plays heres Divine Ugo chuku true freshman point guard gave it up to his classmate Betha and out post that tree for kid so not in the center of the Court here spun on the Baseline got it back out late shacklock kick out Arison fire Paul Joe Bay too strong and the rebound cleared by legot and the Panthers run Austin running theor FL on the reverse gets the roll and its a onepoint game great job by pit rebounding and push it in transition p uh Miami on this end of the floor L kid was looking for the double team there but theyre coming on with the dribble so that time it was a quick spin I thought he could have reversed it or finished it but its never a bad play looking for a teammate and now pit is answered with a 70 run of its own to get back within one Bea coming off 21 in that win Tuesday against Syracuse spun it out and now lean kicks it out Austin a great three and D guy connecting at 39 from three this season when youre not as strong with the basketball meaning create offense on your own like the lineup thats in the floor right now they call the offensive foul on kante just continue to be aggressive much pressure on is Leed and the rest of these guys everyone must come together starts on a defensive end of the floor you dont have to take on any more responsibility than just do your job but its all hands on deck right now for pit because any hopes of making a postseason starts with the win here today Miami has knocked down 53s in this game and has the lead even without any points from leading scorer Matthew Cleveland nearly a 63 but thats short from the Freshman top 50 recruit Austin Schwarz and Jeff CA roll with a lineup right now of delich Le Corin guo Diaz Graham and Zack Austin Brandon Cummings off the floor after he got his second career start bin left it short Brandon Johnson ripped down the rebound B should turn in face there you know hes trying to back him down theres no reason to try to back your Defender down giving you some resistance turn face and drive first points meanwhile for Matthew Cleveland 262 is his average over the last seven games seven straight with 20 plus hes got three 30point games this season yo Diaz Graham no but a great follow and more energy from the Freshman amsal delich sometimes you just got a manufactur offense shot goes up crash the glass you know you get this type of this point in the season you see guys out there playing and you look at his numbers and youre like oh hes a shooter great job there crashing the offensive glass hes just been making play since he been in the game now hes with ambitious hit ahead passes in transition gets in the phase feeling it could knock it down and divide Ugo chuku with the rebound and then he got fouled by Ish legot his first and how about an injection of juice Off the Bench yeah delich comes in crashes the offensive glass he been making shots and making plays all game long again not a lot of creators on the floor right now for pit just is laging so everyone else has got to figure out a way to put their imprint on the game lose ball here rebound there hes provided some really positive plays for Pittsburgh heres Cleveland turnaround is pure and more of the same for Matthew Cleveland coming off a careerhigh 32 in the win Tuesday against Syracuse hes been getting to the free throw line a ton hes been playing with a ton of confidence all three levels again he has it all twos in his bag hes more of a righthand driver but he gets it in the post he got he got the fade away his leg just thre on to the bench of and look theyve never met in a top five matchup theyve never met in a top 10 matchup nor in a top 15 match up and you get one versus two today in that great rival R its Alabama Auburn they dont care what the rankings is theyre going to compete and thats going to be a fun game both teams on forc to get number one seeds that just adds to it but should be fun game to watch theyve never met one versus two in football but they do it here in basketball this season C corn with a good spin on the Block answering the Cleveland Applause bucket so its a threepoint Miami lead three plus minutes to go in this first half canes have won two of their last three despite the 2 11 overall ACC record and here is Matthew Cleveland starting to get more engaged in this game but he missed it against length on the runner great job there by g o Diaz Graham using his length not fouling as we talked about Matthew Cleveland attacks you on the offensive end with so much physicality gets to the free throw line you got to show your hands and not fouling second year with Miami after transferring in from Florida State he said this week my big thing has been keeping this team together since coach l Jim Lena stepped down right around Christmas they challenged him to be a leader he got fouled here late whistle but it did appear to be a foul on amsal delich c not liking that call hey check out ABC with a double header for you tomorrow afternoon this is loaded as well paig Beckers and number seven Yukon against number four South Carolina and a Sonic Blockbuster at one Eastern then top five Showdown Texas LSU in Austin and it all starts with the college game crew at 1100 am eastern on ESPN pitch doing a really good job of defending the sets of Miami when they know its coming problem is when sets break down now you got to sit down and guard and they guard Matthew Cleveland there who stepped out on the Baseline so thats a sixth Miami turnover in the second from Cleveland Cleveland steps out of bounds but thats on the Freshman UGA chuku supposed to be in the corner for the hammer pass hes standing watching something on film hell have to identify with the coaching staff and no you never want to mess up plays when youre going to benefit and get a chance of scoring young freshman will learn that Austin missed the turnaround after flashing to the block and hes 99 in Black true freshman they thought they were going a red shirt Cleveland no dice from Deep Le at the rebound hes had an active first half 10 points five rebounds speaking of freshman thats one cummings got to let go is Leed had made the play didnt trigger in the midrange Leed knocks it down Cummings found him Leed ties it thats where has to stay aggressive because again low is a big part of this offense as we know creating for others Comey has to stay in attack mode even if hes not looking to score hes got to attack and create opportunities for his teammates like he did there 27 all coming up on the final minute of the first Ugo chuku answers with a triple only his fourth College three playing with a ton of confidence thats not his strength right now really good in transition and on ball defense you can see him here picking up that half court shooting and will come great cut by Leed alluding Austin Schwarz and hes having to do everything for pit here in this first half here leg is showing you what youre supposed to due to a freshman hes aggressive in defense over playing you not a problem back door cut we go chuku around the hard hedge and turned it over Cummings pushes shot clock is off so pick can hold for the final shot and Jeff capable will use his use it or lose it 192 to go we step aside for a we just talked about in is legged that is such a big part of this pit offense and defense and its hard to take him out of the game so it should have been hard to find minutes for him on a consistent level with low out hes forced to play here today and its been really good so far three to shoot delich buries it to finish the first half Miami this team is much more talented than their record shows and I dont think anyone would debate that but when you you lose your coach youre as a player this team struggled mightily and Bills been able to get rally the troops kind of challenge them to say hey no excuses this is about you just reminded those guys of that and theyve been playing hard for them here lately they get a stop on the first possession as guo Diaz Graham missed it and Miami at the controls balance scoring nobody had more than Cleveland six AJ State McCrae had six as well off the bench Cleveland no ice from deep and legot clears it with already his sixth rebound Austin got lucky on that possession there he left Matthew Cleveland as he knocks down a three stunted on Brad Johnson got to stay home on Cleveland but he comes down and known as a three and D guy play good defense one possession and knocks down a three on the other knocks down a three ball on the other end second bucket for the Uber athletic fifth year senior Jalil Bia on a step through he missed it he held to just three points on one triple in the first half after those 21 on Tuesday playing back in his home state with his parents and his little brother here watching get a foul on LY kid jockeying with Cam Corin yeah just great job by there no switch there is makes a play and Austin makes a shot this is what they got to do they got to continue to play for one another again it starts on the defensive end with pit this Miami team is really talented a lot of guys are scoring the basketball here in football what Zach Austin just did for a celebration that is an automatic 15yd penalty Leed backs it out for pit up by five found post entry to Corin spinning on kid got a piece of it on the way up two veteran ACC bigs going at it Johnson had bad intentions and he got fouled on the drive and transition Brandon Johnson a big piece for Miami fifth year senior from Raleigh East Carolina transfer told you coming off backtoback scoreless games 0 for six combined from threepoint range in those two games were talking with Bill Courtney last night he said if theres someone we could really use to step up here on the road again without a road win this season its Johnson with his scor I think hes got to do a better job of getting into a space where he feels comfortable taking jump shots he struggling from behind a threepoint line but when Lin kid gets it and you know the double teams coming he can dive get himself some easy baskets he can also do what he just did stay really aggressive in transition and attack the rim and now Miami will extend after the made free throw something that pit wondered if it might be coming against the Freshman guard Brandon Cummings getting the start Cummings trying to direct and they get it over the timeline with 3 seconds to spare to cam cor I think pit has to help himself with that you had numbers once you broke the press three on two attack the press and try to score Cummings cant stick the three still scoreless does have a couple of assists and 15 minutes of work Johnson right down the lane talk about scoring you want to get yourself back in the game thats what you do run the lane hard attack the rim Miami has hurt Pit a couple of times in transition theyve got it back within two triple hand off Leed moved it for Austin now in the hands of ish Leed shadowed by Divine Ugo chuku Le it on the drive and he draws a foul on Ugo chuku this gets you involved scoring wise just a a dunk this is what you call a high percentage shot you dont struggle when you take many of those its a good feeling let me tell you having done it many times in my life Im sure you have but thats on a 10ft rim not a 8ft rim Cummings made the contested jump shot whated a foul as well and Brandon Cummings has his first points stay aggressive young man and stay aggressive good catch by Kid as the help came and we get a foul called on Brandon Cummings its his first after his first bucket at the other end great execution off the Baseline out of bounds play he wanted it on the right arm from Bea after the shot was up so silence says its not a hes a freshman okay its okay freshman dont always get the claws thats what happened when youre a freshman I like it great job just stay I really like that stay even kill you got to earn it when youre a freshman posted entry for kid from Johnson kid collides with Corin just leaning on him and kid scores with the left hand great job by Kid he was looking and waiting on a double team he loves that he turns over either shoulder he loves to fake middle and turn Baseline on either side told us last year his post footwork is what has improved the most in his game over a 5year AC CC career hes been it three different schools GRE with a nice finish as he stayed patient and probed yes he does thats where hes at his best getting downhill getting to the rim we were talking about Lin kid a minute ago look at the coaches hes played for I mean hes had three outstanding coaches we got to get the research department on that has anyone else played at three different ACC schools I dont know heres Cleveland off the shot PE and it spins out for Matt Cleveland then the rebound one armed by Zach Austin so Pitts got it up by four the first four minutes out of halftime for Jeff cable everyone else has to continue to step up delich was trying to do that cmings the offensive rebound and the floater was too strong off the back iron and now Miami runs with numbers and Cleveland comes storming in another transition opportunity pitch doing a great job of attacking the paint and theyve scored a lot of points but when they have not gotten back theyve got to get back and set their defense Miami has punished them in transition cant keep giving up transition dunks fast break points are now 124 in favor of the canes Cummings the L for cam Corin and a response really nice patience there from Cummings love the read by the young man it shows a level of growth in his game hes reading that that tag Defender that time ukuku was on the weak side didnt get in front cam corn and he throws the lot theres kid banging with Corin again help came and kid gets it stuck and ly kids got a couple of free throws coming when we come back in 9 of 31 is 29 of a teams games so if you play 29 fewer than 30 an injury first half of the Season Pat could have a medical red shirt in theory and come back and play somewhere next year yeah he have to get healthy and make that decision I think its you never know the State of Mind of whether someone wants to come back and play another year at college basketball I cant imagine he wouldnt in todays climate you know um and he was one of the guys from a national perspective that when he signed his n nil deal everyone was talking about him so hes well adversed in that ni game as you call it well pit broke that pressure with aggressiveness that you wanted earlier Brandon Cummings just stre to the basket and scored to make it a fourpoint lead again when a team presses you youve got to attack when the opportunity present yourself its not you cant give him freebies give them something to think about whether they want to continue to do that or not AJ St McCrae with a beautiful spin hes brought some really good minutes off the bench again today he has thats a big boy move there I love to see guards in the post and that time he feels the resistance spins Baseline they must teach that in Miami because all their bigs and guards are doing it when they feel body they spinning away got to be careful though because pit comes from the Baseline side good catch Austin follows up the kante miss both teams are doing it theyre manufacturing offensive points they dont run plays for you sometimes you just got to go to the rim like this guy and make plays happen K went straight up Cleveland wanted a foul didnt get it hit with it up by four delich on the drive got caught in the air St McCrae rescued it under his own hoop to Le it and now Austin pops free wanted to trigger didnt Dela a no look excellent ball movement and legged walked with it hes frustrated sends the ball soaring and its a pit turnover only their Applause fifth great drive there D unable to finish but Zach Austin says I got you my man no body on him no box out he reminds him Im more than just a three and D guy going to the glass K to the bench cam Corin back in for pen and those are the guys that are affected you when a guy like jayen low leaves The Game and his dribble penetration the creativity is missed if youre just joining us pit is playing without two of its three best players both injured in the last week happened in a span of four days Damen dun fractured his elbow last Saturday in Chapel Hill and then jayen loow and concussion protocol after a collision Tuesday delich reverse rolled off loose ball secured by Paul job Cleveland joins him and missed it and Clevelands frustrated with himself he should be no need to rush that shot both for both teams right now theyre getting to the rim be patient at Finish theres no shot blockers on the floor good hands from Johnson but onal delich rescued it for ped who backs it out Cummings orchestrates with 10 on the timer Cummings hiding behind the screen from Corin slipped a little pocket pass to him Corin draws a foul on AJ ston McCrae with a shot clock winding down both teams playing help Le and just passing the basketball a great great pass there by Cummings comes off the screen pocket pass little low for corn but he regroups and draws the foul has a chance to go shoot a pair here so core into the stripe Florida State transfer who averages 10 points and five rebounds a game to the line hey weve got a mens basketball triple header next Saturday over on acc Network Georgia Tech Boston College they start today at 2 Eastern followed by Chase Hunter number 23 Clemson in Dallas taking on SMU and then Virginia Tech and this Miami team captain the triple header Joe lardys got three teams locks right now from the ACC and then a whole bunch of teams hoping things go their way a huge game today wake and SMU SMU has a tremendous opportunity with wake and Clemson coming in to their building just an opportunity there to put themselves soundly in the field at home for a team thats really scoring a basketball thats starting to come together and play their best basketball at the right time by the way if you havent watched Clemson and Louisville those are two outstanding basketball teams I got my first look at Louisville in person this week man they are veteran they play together they play a really fun brand of basketball and look if you havent been paying attention to what Brad Brownell and Clemson have been doing the last few years its been really good hes one of the best coaches in in the game I mean Brad Brownell has been outstanding so happy for him in his program and what hes been able to build and sustain right now theyre playing really well and Pat Kelce was the right man for the job hes proving that shot clock winding down Lin kid moved it beautifully and Schwarz spun it out Joe Bay battled with Corin Schwarz hounding the loose ball but Corin ripped it away pit right now needs this energy theyre fighting their season is on the line its a very talented Miami team throw the record out this team is so much better than their record but if you want to keep your postseason hopes alive you have got to find a way without done without low you got to get it done Austin off the bounce bodies tumbling Corin goes up and got fouled by Lin kid pit trying to beat off the energy that the Oakland Zoo is supplying the lead is five Midway and as they fatigue or if they they struggled at all it really hurt the team because these other guys Zach Austin cam corn and yel Diaz Graham relied upon those guys to help the game make you know make the game easier for them however this season ends in the autopsy of it Jeff Cables going to go back and look at probably four games in particular he felt like Louisville Clemson Wake and Carolina theyre one play away from winning those four and in those games things happen you know you look at the weight game Tyler Johnson knocks down threes hes not known for threepoint shooting they played games and often times where youre in those games you want someone to beat you and unfortunately for pit fans those players have stepped up and made shots to beat them this was the team ranked 18th in the country in early December still a long way to go middle of February but it is a fourgame losing streak and eight of the last 10 for the Panthers AJ ston MCC at the line he only played 6 minutes in the first half feels like were going to see him a lot down the stretch hes playing well you know that thats the thing its at his size hes a big guard shot the ball well hes posted up as Miami now extending their defense I thought theyd do this more when they found out Jay jayen low was not in the ball game and you do it for multiple reasons if Isa is going to bring it up you want to wear him down Force other guys to make plays I think pit thought Miami was going to do it more as well they they did Jeff mentioned that to us but he anticipated cing sticks a deep three and like we talked about I think Cummings is going to play well he doesnt have to look over his shoulder youre going to play go out there and play hes going to make mistakes you tell freshman like that youre going to make mistakes make aggressive mistakes Applause out of the corner Schwarz is tied up and he turns it over Cummings running the floor and then Leed got fouled by Austin Schwarz after his turnover yeah you said you thought Brandon Cummings was going to play well and uh look this is a guy who wants the big stage and the big moment so much so that hes got ambition tattooed over his right knee he said that his father always raised him and his brother Nelly that way to to want big moments like that and here you go young man you get a big start in a mustwin game hey its best to have the confidence and figure out the rest of it later and Jeffs doing a great job hes not putting too much on his plate not putting all of the responsibility and the ball handling on his plate just sending them out there and letting them be aggressive delich missed it but will stay at this end of the Applause floor Nelly and Brandons father in the building reyell watching as Brandon was a fourstar recruit out of Lincoln Park about an hour Northwest of here and Nelly Cummings who spent one very good year with this pit team a couple of years ago he did and getting into the NCAA tournament in the play in one two games delich shut off on the Baseline Drive by Joe Bay Corin double clutched and they say its last Touch by Miami so it stays at this end with nine left to shoot Lin kid comes over Stands Tall now the hes out there theres Rim protection still got to continue to attack the paint your pit Leed backs it out only three to shoot and a foul with 14 left on the shot clock as AJ ston McCrae reached in and Bill Courtneys fourletter frustration says it all yeah it does a great job there staying in front of the basketball doesnt have to reach thought he got all ball put Leed on the line with a chance to make this a 10point game coaches talk about finishing possessions yes its like that like you youve done the 28 seconds of heavy lifting you often tell guys dont try to take it let them give it to you and a sense of dont try to take the ball away you know youre okay with dont put the ball you know the game in the officials hands and force them to make a call you play good defense you kept the ball in front of you challenge the shot if is leged makes that you just tell him good shot 10 is the largest lead and then Miami turns it over and so ish legett did so much in the first half second half its been more balanced oh hes picking and choosing you see here now theyre doing a great job of now you want to save him in the second half let the other guys initiate offense comings Austin and when you need to attack put it in his hands Corin had it roll out on the feet from Leed Miamis with it now theyve gone five minutes without a bucket they are in dire need of points here with nine plus minutes to go kid tough shot got the roll thats a big time move there that time Lyn kid is being p hes identifying where the double teams coming from in the first half it came from beeline side couple turnovers then they stopped doubling that time they came from the middle he spent Baseline link kid is seeing everything right now he playing really well 10 points 10 rebounds last time out only had six his fewest points in a game since November and then Le it forced to feed to B Ugo chuku on the Drive Cleveland cleans it up got blocked by cor loose ball secured by Kid still 20 to work with for the canes down by eight kid getting hounded by Corin who Pride it Applause free like it pulls it back out for pit and Jeff cable wants to settle down a Helter Skelter few is leged has stepped up like weve talked about theyve combined for 32 where jayen low the best player for pit is in concussion protocol not playing today and Damien Dunn might be out for the season after the fractured elbow last weekend I think Del has given him great minutes as well hes picked his spots in the head as moments no question Cummings shot clock winding down short from Deep battle on the boards and an offensive rebound Cummings again cant hit Cleveland went up for the rebound lean secures it and two offensive rebounds could be back breakers for Miami winning plays if you can finish this off thats just a reward for it but the efforts there leg it had it bounce to delich who gets the roll and those are the Hops pit got right there to make it a 10point lead what pit is doing is theyre sending three to four guys to the offensive glass that possession we saw they were able to come up with those offensive possessions that we seen in the first half a couple of times when Miami has been able to rebound theyve been able to push and get transition baskets but they got to secure a rebound first its 12 offensive rebounds he assisted or scored on about 70 of their points the most hes ever done in a half in his two years with the Panthers the best way to describe him is I said hes a winner and winners have a way of elevating their play and just doing whatever the team needs them to do great players do that but winners are able to do that as well his scoop is followed by Camp for biggest lead for pit its a dozen inside of seven minutes to go and the clock is ticking on Miami how do they get a hold of this thing right now one they got to get stops and they got to secure the ball on the rebound not that shot thats not the shot you want I think the ball now has to be in Lin kids hand and you got to find a way to get Matthew Cleveland involved patha had it Tapped Out by Johnson St McCrae off Target but another offense rebound for ly kid building on his double double kid going to work slips it around for Johnson thats what we were talking about the double team came that time Lynn is kid is seeing the floor well Johnson does a great job getting that dunker spot with an easy two LM kid has played really well 10 points 13 rebounds thats what is credited as his first assist but he has handled the double well hes going to make a lot of money you think so I do I I think he knows knows what he is as he physically matures a little bit like that shot there stops the drive from The Freshman takes away the L his mobility and skill a lot a lot more money we should say in this day and age yeah thats true its a really good pass there again he sees the Trap coming from the Baseline its an underrated skill set ball howling wise for a big hes backing his Defender down but his eyes are locating where the helps coming from Jalil Betha took some contact thats a tough shot that go fora and thats what was so tantalizing about this kid coming in its just called a bucket too small dips that shoulder creates that space hes off the point guard spot more than a natural role where he gets to score he was 10th in our ESPN 100 amsal delich little step through and high off the glass and a new career high for the Freshman with 11 points Off the Bench Kareem Abdul delich with the running Applause hook Corin hard hedge kid mismatch couldnt score it over delich delich comes over doing it on both ends of the Court he puts his body on LY kid and F is letting them play today the obsa delich game as this this one will go into the pit archives as all hands on deck and I I think these guys have stepped up and hes the one guy thats not expected from him to do it is guy whose playing time has been spotty at best and freshman really played well here today Johnson got to have it couldnt knock it down another offensive rebound L kid gets fouled he has been working hard hes got 14 rebounds but how about amsal delich just a great job there getting to spots with the step through and kiss off the glass his father Amir played professionally for 20 plus years and is currently a coach in bosne in Herz gabina where amols from dealt with a preseason hand injury after they had went out and added him Jeff Cable says theyve made it a point to look overseas for players and Jeff cable didnt really believe that delich was as tall as he was until he saw him and then he got him he said wow thats a legit 67 a legit 68 what hes Now list to that good looking shot he hes helping him with with ball handling you can see him up on the Press hes actually initiated offense a couple of times oh its a turnover from Austin on the inbounds and Cleveland couldnt get it to go be Thea can knock it down Austin the rebound and a big missed opportunity for Miami pit breaks the pressure into the front court and can settle it down great job there they didnt have numbers tried to attack press break now delich gets it to go but theyll say it was on the floor before the shot next four out Jeff C team if youre just joining us 10th team out according to Joey bracket eightpoint kingal delich with a Miss at the line so Miamis got it 340 to go Bea Joe bay kid Cleveland and state McCrae the five on the floor for interim head coach Bill Courtney big free throw there missed the other end looking for ly kid to get a touch here he is right on Q he gets surrounded and cam cor who has played physically today gets tagged with his third foul and foul goes on to the adjustment for the pit defense is love the Chet match that Im seeing when Li kid gets in in the middle of the floor they just come in automatically if he gets it on the side theyre coming from the Baseline side andami L kid got a little lucky there the middle he didnt know it was coming so hes on one and one on the 17 foul for pet 76 free throw shooter is good on the first ly kids been the best player for him today he has hes been the most consistent player and I think its great because again hes been doubled all game and hadnt forced anything its only five field goals theyve been doubling him and hes gone to the offensive glass to get his points and love to see patience from big men like that and his engagement in the game a lot of times when they try to take you out of a game like that you lose interest not link kid pit handles the pressure numbers delich to the corner for Cummings attacks delich open buries it amsa delich has 14 great play you want to see by both freshman attacking being unselfish St mrae answers for Miami and it was much needed hes been outstanding today off the bench three triples for AJ State mccraig he has hes been stunning inside and out were at go time right now for Miami you can see the level of desperation theyre playing with they know now got to make your run now 18 foul one and one coming for the Freshman Brandon Cummings this play started in transition there delig giving it to Cummings Cummings drives the close out gets in a paint gives it back to delich and hes played so well 14 points as you can see averages three on the season everybodys contributing taking up the slack of Jaylen low being out of the game and a front end Miss from Cummings and who is the last to touch it they say its last Touch by pit and so a couple of big free throw misses here they have been got to secure that going forward free throws matter here its only a sixpoint game surprised they didnt ask officials to take a look at that with two and a half to go Cleveland matched up with Cummings defended it well altered the shot and then pit trying to emerge with it and they will retain possession here its a foul on Paul J Mike Monaco thats in a great play right there by the Freshman Cummings I I was getting ready to say you need a bigger defender on Matthew Cleveland and as I thinking that he handled it he handled it he defended it and he blocks the shot secures the rebound and gets the foul hey big slate over on ESPN featured matchups look like this one versus two Carolina Syracuse Kentucky Texas caps it off at 800 eastern time with a great day of college basketball all right so Cummings good on the front end this time leads at seven 81 free throw shooter true freshman fourstar recruit in his second Colgate stting he sticks B Dads here his brothers here you knew he was going to play well we talked about it they shoot around and did a great job of not trying to do too much ston McCrae short partially altered by legot approaching two to go leged barely gets it over with one second to spare State McCrae rushed that shot is Lea was selling out to challenge it thought he rushed that three Le rejected the ball screen shot clock winding down Cummings wants a dagger around and out offensive rebound Austin and he got fouled its been one of the stories of the game and as we talked about this pit team they were going to the offensive glass every its all hands on deck to box out Austin is just going hes got a tip dunk here already sees it follows it goes get the the ball letting them know I told you before I thought this would be a difficult game without low for pit to win he just means that much to this team and everyone has stepped up and had their moments and and this is what you want to see this is a really important team win for p bit ends the four game win streak and now you can start focusing on hey start building momentum start building confidence this is a really big potential confidence booster for this Pittsburgh team they can hold on how hard without it like did you think they could win without jayen lo you think they were ready for that did I I did not I think theres a lot of moving parts to that and its what he means to this team its no slight on these guys kid answers gets it down to eight with a buck 32 to go and Bill Courtney Takes look to the official thinking he got a foul so they might have been trying to commit the foul B cant stick it 10point game 110 to go Miamis got to hurry and needs points fast Jalil Betha hits from three Bill Courtney will take his second to last timeout still got 62 seconds to go as a guard I want to space and you dont want to catch it in the corner you can see Miamis defense is setting up to push that ball in that left corner Austin can run the Baseline he gets it in too Diaz Graham who finds leit into his trusty hands an 81 free throw shooter hes got to get it over the line and he does to Cummings with a second to spare great job by pit there again G Modz Graham catching it as a smaller guard you got no chance of bothering him with the Trap when he catches it gets it in his legged hand and he gets to AC cross half court great press break offense there by the Panthers fourth foul on Paul joob Bay and double bonus for pit so Brandon Cummings to the line for two they had mistakenly at first announced that it was the fifth foul on Paul Joo Bay so both teams as we do nowadays when someone really does foul out use it as a timeout but it is not and for the pace of play of fixi andad its time for free throws I cant fult the coaches trying to get EX but you still a timeout you do so great job leaving Cummings on the line you focus on making the free throws Ill communicate with the other guys theyll relay the message for Miami putting in a play where you try to maybe get a quick three if not you attack the rim you dont have to have a three the clock is your enemy as much as the score is right now four straight free throw makes for Brandon Cummings The Freshman leads nine one timeout left for Miami 45 ticks to go a little slow to develop Jalil Bea through the contact had it roll out Johnson lost it kid W it Ugo chuku had it blocked by Austin Austin hauls it in and he might have just put this on ice for pitch thats the type of effort you needed if you wanted to win this game and now Cummings has to be separated from Divine Ugo chuku who had momentarily got into it with Austin but then Ugo chuku had stepped away and it looks like Cummings might have escalated that situation it is and hes going to have to learn from that Jeff cable comes and grabs him and hes saying he push me first you got to calm your nerves down and Jeff cable just said I dont care pointed to the clock yeah and said theres 24 seconds left were up by nine yeah no one cares if you got pushed its about a bigger issue its about winning this game and hes played exceptionally well and his team is not here without him but hes got to calm his nerves and stay down in so well show you what happened the pass into the front Court Austin slowing things down UGA chuku has got to come in and commit a foul someway pretty handsy with Austin but to be expected when you need a foul Austin barked at him and then Cummings with something to say and yeah he did get pushed did Ill give him that he did I think itll be double technicals there yep yeah I take that back I dont think Cummings escalated that so much as no see the first push yeah its still but again theyre down you dont want to do anything a lot of times they call goes where they catch the second guy the famous the second guy always second gu youre up nine you dont want to do anything dont worry about getting pushed or anything just You had a heck of a game done a great job I texted you this watching film earlier this week I think Brandon Cummings is going to be a really good player you did in this league you did what say you your opinion carries a lot more weight after AG have a double diall technical foul number three for pit number 99 for Miami they offet well be shooting two shots for pit voice of God Roger SS and its hard to say that you get pushed if you say something now thats a technical the other way and its and its hard if you could that thats all were saying about Cummings you just avoid the push back now you showing that sense of calm telling the officials to go take a look at that now thats a technical on Miami but no I think Cummings is going to be a heck of a player Austin he has so much experience to draw FR of his brother not just here at pit but older brothers and everything that hes gone through dad obviously having a lot of say so and inut in his career and and he just looks confident when hes out there playing and he makes tough shots hes not afraid at the moment and when hes been asked to play hes played I mean being its different when its early in the year hes thrown in the game he starts plays exceptionally well scores a career higher then he comes in late in the season with the team season on the line throwing into a lineup to replace Jay Lan low and hes played exceptionally well happy form Del has committed a foul on the shooter in the corner for three Brandon Johnson so 162 to go a reminder we still got an awesome day of college basketball coming your way coming up next youve got West Virginia at Baylor Darren deze has done a nice job with the Mountaineers this year that follows us here on ESPN to over on ESPN you got number six Houston at number 13 Arizona you got Duke in action on ABC at 400 Eastern with Dicky V his second game back on the call and also at 400 on ESPN number one and number two weve been talking about it all week long Auburn and Alabama rivalry game is good enough but how about one versus two for the first time ever in the SEC again we talked about that its throw the rankings out thats going to be a big time rivaly game anyway should be fun foul on the rebounding action after the missed free throw with 144 left you got a prediction Auburn or Alabama or where do you lean I dont I think its if youre Alabama because youre home you want to take care of business but I think Auburn has been the best team in college basketball from the start to finish um you got the former player of the year and I think Jan Brom is the SEC player of the year so its a lot at stake uh um Im Im expecting an amazing game and I just hear waffling do we get it you asking to make a prediction yeah please Im going to go with Alabama at home okay since she calling me out you know I was trying to dance around it but since she called me out were that that was like that was ballroom dancing of the highest hey hey I was getting my freddish there on man he called me out on it so Im going to go with Alabama at home I know you must have really missed me yeah I did you can see by my by the post we made Cleveland had it roll off this is significant to some its a bucket for Miami and pit takes care of business at home could not afford to lose it and Jeff Cables Panthers though shorthanded
