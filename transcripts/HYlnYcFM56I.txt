of 22 a semifinal win at barklay Center in Brooklyn when the hokes on the way to the ACC title beat Carolina and then beat Duke on Saturday night for the championship W its hard to believe that two teams in the conference havent played against one another for 14 months yep hoki in Black Couture the first shot of the day rebounded by Ingram Carolina of course with Davis kdo Ryan the three guard lineup for Hubert Davis Bott defended by Kid and of course the Stanford transfer Harrison Ingram Kad heres Ingram against Robbie Baron on the drive back for kdo deflected with six to shoot and turned over by Carolina Pat Driscoll Remy Steins Greg Evans on the whistle today at Smith Center in Chapel Hill and the Hoke lineup its been the one that Mike young has used the last 11 games featuring Robbie Baron the Northwestern transfer with Lynn kid starting at Center who leads the ACC and field goal percentage well kid has been a force on the inside Wes but the Hokes got to make threes if theyre going to win a game on the road here is Collins with six to shoot he will launch on kadoo and hit MJ Collins from Clover South Carolina shoots 24 from three and Stakes the hes to an early threepoint lead I think youre okay with that if youre the tar Hills in their manto man defense heres Ingram with Baron defending checked on Bott at the post and now Davis against Virginia Techs best owned ball Defender is Hunter Couture cadoo for Bott taking away Baron who was sneaking from the backside two turnovers on two possessions Collins In transition has all five of Virginia Tex points that was just a bad pass a nice job by Baron to get over there kadoo working against padulla now hell reroute heres Bott at 18 ft Davis a three back rim Miss and a foul called on Lyn kid for the push against Armando Bott and of course Wes thats going to be a problem for Virginia Tech this entire game Armando Bott obviously one of the top rebounders in the country and its just hard to keep him off the offensive boards and Mike young wastes no time here here Dan we talked about this this morning malijah potit might have a little more value in this game today against Armando bot and Lin kid at the post for the Hoke certainly defensively kadoo standing three Off the Mark and there is poti who grew up 45 miles away in Reedville North Carolina with the rebound poti size he was able to Block B cut out yep coutur working on Ryan padulla and were going to get foul called on Couture thats a moving screen for the grad student from orlandoo second on Virginia Tech well Couture is so important to this team you really dont want him picking up fouls and he just never got stopped he passed the ball that was like some sort of a back out of the back field blocking somebody look at you with the fun football analogies huh well were done with that nonsense now so we can talk about it heres bake out at the Block double team coming quick ball movement leaves Ryan open for three got it 42 three of the year for cormack Ryan won I think cormacs R cormack Ryans ability to shoot the ball is going to be crucial for North Carolina not only down the stretch but as they go into the NCA tournament Couture on the drive T out Ingram heres Davis Carolina transition chance for the first time today Ingram thought about the three nice job by the hookies to get back yep heres Baron trying to defend Ingram who Wheels into the lane and will draw Robbie Barons foul first on the grad transfer whos from Richmond its the third on Virginia Tech well its a nice job moving the ball by North Carolina and if youre going to react maybe kadoo is the guy you get back to a little bit more slowly you rack quickly to him and hes allowed to make the pass and that leaves a really good threepoint shooter wide open Harrison Ingram has six double doubles in ACC play but he is only a 56 free throw shooter now 41 of 73 on the year Dan He leads the conference in rebounding in League Play he is number one in defensive rebounds and you automatically say well okay that makes sense but hes third in offensive rebounds in ACC play WoW Wes if youre going to lead the conference in rebounds then youre going to get them both on the offensive and defensive end and his free throw shooting thats the one part of his game bless that has been subpar he has been outstanding in every other area potit against Bott rolls back with the left hand and it bounces away for Ingram I dont think theyre looking for a lot of offense from po look at Ingram all the way little soft running onehander from Harrison Ingram and Armando Bott helped make that play Wes because he sprinted down the middle of the court and Drew all the attention of the hokes defense Bill Ford sitting over there in the second row had to like the Running onehander by Ingram to finish transition pulla off the Baseline bounces away Kad scoops and Carolina runs again quick ball movement Ingram another three or Ry rather off the Ingram pass couldnt knock it in boy great ball Movement by North Carolina and Virginia Tech needs a little bit more of that too much dribbling right at the moment for the hokei Couture catching shoot three they caught the rebound Carolina on a 7 nothing run remember they got an early fivepoint run from MJ Collins did Virginia Tech heres Davis left open Baron tried to close couldnt Ingram the rebound resets and scores and one well Harrison Ingram has had games this year Dan where he is kind of outworked the the other guy that time NJ Collins commits a foul Carolina on a 9 nothing Music run business checking with no monthly maintenance feed so you dont chew through your profits staying with the carrier long term always comes down to trust thats why Ive stayed with Cincinnati Music Applause Music Applause Insurance Music Applause Music Applause Music I had no idea that I would end up creating a whole new community I wanted to change an industry that neglected me for so long I never wanted to settle for anything like I just knew I want to be Music great e Music War Applause Applause e ACC basketball is presented by food Li the official grocer of the Atlantic Coast Conference well seems appropriate today is Michael Jordans 61st birthday man well show you a couple highlights here really makes you feel pretty old when you remember who they were what are you talking about Wes though thats the number hanging up there in the Rapters off obviously and there are an in ordinance there is an inordinate number of people here today wearing jersey number 23 they know right its also the NBA AllStar break so that has brought back a lot of former players Kobe white is here today is Chicago Bulls Harrison Ingram at the line hes got six make it seven 10 nothing run for Carolina on a threeminute scoring drought for Virginia Tech who had the games first five Applause points and here is Collins who had the five for Virginia Tech hell fire on Seth tremble and hit good thing they him yeah getting ready to say Michael Anthony Jerome Collins Jr MJ has all seven of the Hoke points heres Jaylen Withers whos in the ball game against the former Tar Hill Tyler nichel and Withers scores W the hokes their defensive ranks in the ACC are not very high so there they really have to score points to stay in this game nichel has a three rattle around and drop in he was three for four the other night from behind the line hes had three double figures in his last five for Mike Youngs team its just taken him a while to get going whereas he scored 29 third points in high school so he can put it in the basket F cot right hand fell off tap follow Withers and poti collects and then the ball got knocked away and Bot comes away with it I think that was Withers that knocked it away Wes boy thats tough North Carolinas so good on the offensive boards and you finally get one you dont want to give it away oh like a trembl draw the foul that is two on potit if it is the second and we mentioned the sophomore Tyler nickel a year ago at Carolina played 15 games in the conference averaged two points shot 22 the alltime leading score in Virginia High School league history as Dan told you now for the trivia folks involved in programs It is believed today Tyler niichel becomes the first player to start his career at Chapel Hill and then leave for another school and return to play Carolina in Chapel Hill now we could go back to prior to World War II when guys moved around institutions before long before we ever knew what transfer portal meant man um but were not going to do that were not going to do that were just going to tell you that it is believed Tyler nichel is the first player to play at Carolina at the start of his career to then return to play Carolina in Chapel Hill Trimble hits the free throw by the way that was the second foul on potit so malija comes out of the ball game and ly kids return Wes and Virginia Tech was fearful of this too because North Carolina really gets the ball inside and thats theres a potential for foul trouble when youre trying to defend Bon yep so heres a little backourt pressure offered Carolina by four and thatll be a bump on RJ Davis as Couture was trying to make the catch but D it looked like Davis decided he could get the ball W and then changed his mind at the last minute Dan quite a difference for Carolina to get tremble back in the lineup too he missed a couple games with an upper body injury and you saw just how valuable his 17 1 12 minutes are per game in Conference playoff are W hes always been noted for his defensive ability and thats one of the places where the tar Hills have struggled after their 10 game winning streak p now here is nichel a catch and shoot three sure Tyler Nicholls got six and now all of a sudden Virginia Tech has found their outside threat Beyond MJ Collins only got a score outside of Collins is niichel po fans might not have been able to wager that coming into the ball game and Couture is going to pick up his second foul yep and thats on The Dan take us through thats a silo right because CER the cylinder rather Im sorry and west everybodys got their space and if you stand on the basketball court and you have a basketball in your hands in front of you and your hand and your elbows at a 90° angle you have a cylinder that goes up and down to the ceiling and the defensive player cannot get in that cylinder its goes from basketball in front of you all the way around your back and the defensive player cannot get in that cylinder and make contact and if there is contact its an automatic defensive foul six foul on Virginia tag heres Kad on a kick out for Ryan three ball good Cormac Ryan now a pair of Threes he hit four the other night at Syracuse previous four games to that he was seven of his last 26 but he was four of Nine the other night at the dome in central New York in the sevenpoint loss to the orange kid working against Washington hell turn with the left hand and now ly Kidd gets his first basket of the game first got other than nicolin Collins to score for the hokes kid has been good inside all year long and if youre going to let him play oneonone that close to the basket hes he might score a lot of points Ingram backing down nickel now hell turn with a right hand couldnt finish it slapped it out Ryan quickly to kdo standing three its a short three hit the front rim and Jaden young got the rebound and draws Ingrams foul itll be the second on Ingram second on Carolina its the first on Harrison well North Carolina really doing a great job at penetrating into the defense making the defense collapse and then Ryan again we talked about the fact that he has not shot the ball well as well as he had hoped at the start of the season but hes come on lately and thats a very good sign for North Carolina padulla young standing three from the front long rebound for Applause Ryan young hadnt played that many minutes in ACC play West hes only now one for five in conference play inside Washington the catch off the Ryan feed for the punch thats what happens when you make a couple of Threes Wes the defense comes running out on you Jaylen Washington averages three and three against the league kids spinning into traffic back with the left hand Ingram clears kdo across for Trimble couldnt get by Young now tried to slide Baseline look at Ingram out of the corner Harrison Ingram 42 on the year from behind the line coming in so our Hills have been very aggressive defensively against the ball West its really hard for the hokes to get any penetration and thats a walking violation yep travel will award it to the Tar Heels third turnover by Virginia Tech Jaylen Washington comes in good look from cormack Ryan Carolina fourpoint advantage Music we want it all we want beards and lattes great oh we want to be invited great and not attend great we want to take the shortcut you lost and not be in danger reverse sadly we cant have it all

Washington dunk and you might wonder how in the world could he get SW open look at the blow post where number 13 Jaden young hes supposed to stay down there when the hes come and jump out on that screen and he doesnt do it you watch number 13 He follows Harrison Ingram up out of the lane hes got to be down in the lane to prevent an Easy Pass like that to Washington we said young doesnt really play that many minutes and he just got lost in a defensive assignment and you see Mike young across the way at the Virginia Tech bench talking with his sta because that was a point of emphasis today Dan in their walk through this morning that and how would you go through the switches on the perimeter and what a drive and score by Kad Carolina pushes the lead to six now almost 9 Minutes in their largest of this first half well padoo is a guy thats not a great threepoint shooter but boy he can really get past you and get into the lane padulla trying to wire around Kad what a scooping score for Shawn padulla that is a typical sha padulla shot he just puts his head down and goes and the hogies need to get some offense from somewhere Coutures on the bench with those two fouls tremble well Ryan Ryan wanted the ball ran to the corner with both arms in the air and theres nickel drawing the foul D Carolina am I wrong in say Carolina is able to draw a lot of fouls by working their way to the basket they they get really good ball and player movement West so when you move the defense around now suddenly you can attack and youre going to force some fouls in North Carolina in ACC play theyve made more free throws than any other team and its not even really that close so heres Cormac Ryan from New York City 86 at the line and the front end good dont forget this is game one of a triple header on acc Network well send you next to Chestnut Hill John Meer peral maluck be standing by from Miami and Boston College and then Louisville is off to Peterson Event Center tonight second meeting of the Year Doug Sherman Josh pner are there for the cards and the Panthers all here on acc Network and always available on the ESPN app Weston already North Carolinas aggressiveness have forced so many fouls on Virginia Tech theyre in the bonus and theres 10 minutes left in this half and Carolina is a 74 free throw shooting team in conference play his sixth best and heres padulla against Trimble trying to find an alley again and that got blocked out of there and R Stein is going to call Seth Trimble for the foul nomin Falls Wisconsin sophomores first third on the Tar Heels and here is Shawn padulla as Dan Bonner said a swashbuckler if there ever was one in the ACC well West Virginia Tech is really getting very little ball movement padulla has just been putting his head down and driving to the basket now hes getting to the line for two and he made 14 16 in the last game so he is a good free throw shooter but the hokes theyve really got to get some ball movement you just cant have one guy dribble well here comes Couture Collins Brandon rexin are going to wait at the table and seven foot freshman red shirt Patrick wesler from Matthews North Carolina wheres jersey number five for Virginia Tech hes going to play for the first time since one minute against Georgia Tech five games ago and padulla hits the backend thatll allow Rex Steiner to get in the lineup freshman from aworth Georgia who averages about seven minutes a game in conference play well wesler is obviously in the game because of the foul problems inside yep and hes in there theyre looking for any scoring from him hes just going to try to contain Bon yep and theres the bounce pass to Armondo now and on Q hell wrap around wesler and Score first passet for Armando Bott and containing Armando Bott is easier said than done here is is re Steiner for niichel remember niichel plays with a foul Couture on the fou on the floor with two fouls Collins gave them their first five points and misses for the first time North Carolina has been very good defensively so far Wes and very aggressive on the offensive end fott is two for two over the top of Patrick wesler boy he saw wesler come off the bench and his eyes lit up thats a great job by North Carolina to go right at the inexperienced player on the inside ninepoint lead Carolinas largest Couture bounces for Nicholls three and Ingram another rebound Ryan thought about it hell drive hang on Rex Steiner fell off the rim look at Ingram go get it and dunk it Ingrams got nine points eight rebounds in the games first 11 minutes the lead is 11 at Smith Center in Chapel Applause Hill inspires Arbys crispy fish sandwiches still dont fit on the bun Arby sincerely apologizes for continuing to make big old sandwiches Orbeez we have 11point lead for Carolina and you said when wesler stepped on the floor its almost like Carolina wanted to get the ball to number five W wesler 7t tall Wes hes a big strong kid but hes only played a total of 5 minutes prior to this game in ACC action and Armando Bott is one of the most experienced post players in the country he knows exactly what he wants to do the tar Hills have made four of their last five shots mainly because theyve gotten good shots they have continued to be aggressive and Virginia Tech again their defense wasnt going to win this game they have to be able to score and they just havent been able to get a clean look hokes are seven of 16 from the floor Carolina 10 of 20 as weve played about 11 minutes the pressure on the ball has limited what the hokes have been able to do offensively yeah kid one dribble heres Couture Rex Steiner from in front of the Carol on of Applause bench and over 40 of Virginia Techs offense are field goal attempts come from three but that was a real long one heres Collins blocked behind by w Withers kid recovers for the hokes and then a foul called on a Tar Hill reach by Pat Driscoll against Armando Bon well kid he looked back he knew that Withers was coming and a really nice job by Lyn kid to get the rebound but thats a clean block and its good Patience by Kid he didnt panic in there he was surrounded but he kept his pivot foot and as a result draws the foul Rex Steiner out wesler out Lyn kid with the one foul remember potit has two and heres padulla driving and scoring off the Jump stop you dont see the jump stop much anymore no you dont but Shawn Padulas got it ninepoint lead Bott picked up on his dribble hes got to get rid boy Collins doing a nice job with Davis back to Bott a little scoop and tap follow of his own miss another another offensive rebound yep the lead returns to 11 nichel on the drive wouldnt go tap follow kid no offensive foul over the back on Lyn kid Dan thatll be his second eight on the hokes so now

childrens Clear Water Invitational is underway starts at 930 Eastern tomorrow morning here on acc Network its almost like the official opening the best softball programs in the country are in Florida this week for the Shriners childrens Clearwater Invitational we got full coverage on the ESPN family of networks here is kadoo the drive and scoop with the left hand second field goal for kadoo boy the car Hills about able to do anything they want on the offensive end West padulla working off a potite screen Fall Away against Kad and theyre going to call a foul on Elliot kdo itll be his first its five on Carolina padulla is a guy that can really put a lot of pressure on you and he has that step back jumper and the foul didnt occur on that first pump it occurred because K didnt give room to come down y you are a shooter until you come down on the floor and the defensive player cant hit you while youre still in the air and padulla misses the front end he has five in this first half Ingram is back Withers is out Hubert Davis said something yesterday Dan about being present on the ball defensively felt like Carolina might have come out of their groove a little bit in that particular defensive discipline I think thats been pretty good here in the first what 13 minutes of the game today it has been very good and theres Elliot Kau doing a nice job driving to the basket again the West the other day they were playing against Judah minz and JJ Starling and there those were two guys who can put pressure on any defense Ingram a kick back three from Kad bounds away for Couture 13point lead for Carolina under seven to go what the third year coach of the tar Hills doesnt want though is his team to relax yes absolutely Couture rolls nicely off the screen feeds potit on the roll in the basket first points for Migel potit and a travel in the back court an unforced error on Carolina is their fourth Wes I wouldnt call that unfor sha padulla came flying in there and totally surprised kadoo I thought he was going to get the ball and but thats the way padulla plays Mike young said about him hes all gas that boy has no breaks and thats I mean thats a direct quote from his coach and it is true Baron on the floor remember hes got a foul as well heres potita again and one malijah potit whole different whole different character from his first rotation off Mike Youngs bench here well they threw the ball inside to him and this is a very difficult play hes a little bit off balance so is Bott but potit recovers his balance first and is able to score and draw the foul against Bott and the first Tar Hill with two is Armando bot and he goes to the Tar Hill bench and here is Jaylen Washington back out there as potit knocks down the free throw five for meijel potit Carolinas League cut down to eight now its been hard for the hes to get stops West but they could sure use one here Ryan thought about it and then he tried to dump it for Ingram and baron got a hand in had a six minutes to go Davis Paxton woic on the floor he wears number eight now six to shoot heres RJ Davis to work step back over Collins for three bounds away corm Ryan the rebound right back at him cant finish Washington does w thats now eight offensive rebounds in the game and two dunks for Jaylen Washington and the Virginia Tech defense for the first shot has not been too bad they just cant get a defensive rebound Collins knocks down a triple 10 first half points now for MJ Collins his fifth double figure game against the ACC Wesson you mentioned it earlier he shoots under 30 from out there so those are two really big shots Ryan all the way through padulla rebound sevenpoint game heres padulla again contact couldnt Bank it home heres Ingram leading a three on two and Davis races in W that was a tough shot by padulla and when you take a tough shot that really puts your defense at a disadvantage that allowed North Carolina to get out and go first field goal for RJ Davis hes got three the lead is nine again tells you something about the versatility of this Carolina offense today Ryan forc the turnover heres Davis weaving back and blocked by Baron Davis goes to the floor and a foul on Robbie Baron will be his second nine now on Virgin Virginia Tech North Carolina doing a great job West getting out and really putting some pressure on that Virginia Tech defense and baron you know he blocks the shot it down low he got all of RJ Davis RJ Davis one of two at the line a rare miss a moment ago hes 88 from the line of conference play he leads the league in ACC play though in made threes per game has four now he missed all three of his threepoint attempts today yep so Nichol is in Baron is out for Mike young fifth year head coach of Virginia Tech whos done just a marvelous job after a splendid job at Walker for many many years and theres the rat Virginia native whos late father Bob was a fixture when he came back to blackburg in the New River Valley to be the Hokey head Applause coach this is a very important 4 and 1 half minute stretch for Virginia Tech Collins poti now padulla and heres poti going to work with Washington defending and malel potit got seven encouraging sign for Mike young theyre getting some productivity from their Post in potit presence here and they they really knew need some productivity down on the inside and heres Davis theres a floater in scores RJ Davis now has seven seems like theyve all come in bunches here doesnt it absolutely right side Couture oh boy now you get the former MVP of the tournament warmed up first points for Hunter Couture a deep three from in front of the Tarheel bench and that was against really good defense Ryan was all over him but Couture is a guy who can make shots absolutely heres Ingram spinning on Nicholls scores Harrison Ingram now hes got 11 in the half by my count and hes also worked his way to a double double 11 points and 10 rebounds in the first half on the drive kick to the corner Nicholls standing three bangs it home nine for Tyler nichel on three threes and Hubert Davis says hold up we had this thing going along like we needed and then all of a sudden Couture knocks down to three RJ Davis our second running onehander of the first half by the way and then Tyler nichel a third three in this first half sevenpoint game when we come back we want it all we want beards

want that shot we it in take it that stop what a make it this time is where youth is tested and greates are challenged the playoff push is coming the time is now well heres our game summary Harrison Ingrams already got the double double Dan its his ninth of the year in the 14th of his career here in this first half Hunter Couture had his first points a moment ago you see the threepoint shooting you see the free throws and Hubert Davis was not shy about taking that time out a moment ago no he wasnt he didnt like the sudden turn in the game as Tech knocked down a couple of threes and Wes Hunter Cure he did miss some time because he picked up those two personal fouls but cormack Ryan has been all over him defensively Y and in addition Ryan has eight points you saw thear Hills only two for 10 shooting threes both of those threes coming off the hand of cormack Ry Carolinas also got 40 or more in the first half in their third straight ball game but nobody said the offense has been the issue right heres Ryan try another one bounces away and were going to get a Jaylen Washington foul against MJ Collins I believe yep sophomore at 610 from Gary Indiana thatll be the seventh on Carolina so one and one with 251 to play I believe and MJ Collins I think will shoot the free throws so lets see Jadon young or MJ Collins the officials are saying its Collins although now they off signal to but I guess its going to be Jaden young Jaden young is two for two at the free throw line he played 12 minutes the other night against Florida State Dan it was his first double figure minutes action of the year in conference play dont forget the ACC huddles got their NFL draft introdu show coming up Monday night 800 position by position look at the ACC players who could get their name called in Detroit in late April Kelsey rigs with field Yates Jordan Reed and Matt Miller part of our coverage here on acc Network Wes dont look now but this is a fivepoint ball game yep so young gets the free throws he played for the great Freddy Johnson at Greensboro Day School by the way the alltime winning as coach in North Carolina High School history here is Ingram going to work on nichel Harrison blocked by nichel out of there well thats a heck of a defense sure is terrific play by nichel ahead heres padulla back for Collins and he misses on the three and Ingram grabs yet another rebound this is late in the season and he shoots under 30 from out there West the averages are going to catch up with an eventually Washington heres Ryan patite trying to help now Ingram thought about it back for Corman tend to shoot with RJ Davis po hes tried to force the double here goes Davis on the drive and pushed it up and here spun out look at this third try Ingram slapped it out volleyball style another offensive rebound RJ Davis tremble all the way through tried to scoop it up it hit Davis after nickel blocked it itll go to Virginia Tech we talking about how the h needed stops well Tyler niichel with two block shots has provided them with stops kadoo has come in the ball game Ryan out so you have kadoo Davis and tremble Coutures going out Jaden young is coming back for Virginia Tech poti is out but those are guys with two fouls West a minute 40 seconds left in the 47 left in the half so theyre just trying to save their guys but theyve taken away a little offense wesler has checked back in padulla for Jaden Youngs three and kadoo runs it Applause down and were going to get a foul on wesler trying to unhan Washington who was floating in front his first that is 10 now on the hokes with just under 90 seconds to go in the opening half tell you what were five wide at Halftime by the way Kelsey Riggs Luke Hancock Joel Barry Carlos Boozer Jim bahon thats a lot of folks thatll be fight to the Finish in that studio Washington free throw good fifth first half point for jayen Washington Carolina lead back to six so now Couture with those two fouls back in mhm offense for defense there Dan yep absolutely although they took him out on offense before but they got that wide open three for young and they figure if theyre going to get a wide open three they want theour to shoot it eight different T heels that marked here in this first half sixpoint Advantage padulla trying to cut into it again reverses around look at RJ Davis reach in there knock it away and then it Grays padulla Ramy Stein says on the way out of bounds so it will go to Carolina well this is really a force by padulla he draws a couple of guys youve got to be able to pass the ball but hed already left his feet to shoot really good defense by North Carolina kdo RJ Davis a catch and score what a great response by North Carolina Virginia Tech had cut it down to five couple of possessions left in this first half at least padulla winding down again pushed it up wesler the rebound trying to find Space Washington bothered it knocked it away and recovered it just because you get an offensive rebound West doesnt mean you have to shoot it he was well covered the play with a good threepoint Shooters on the floor is to kick it out for a three so Hubert Davis gets his team in the front court and takes the time out ninepoint lead in Chapel Hill we have breaking news right now so we wait to see how this plays out in all my years I never watched anything like this you have got to watch this replay folks Ms a catch hey you got to watch this Im watching o oh Im watching might Applause be now on Sports Center another wild night watch me Music me ninepoint lead for Carolina hey look you youre going to get to your script at the top Padulas played well RJ Davis here a moment ago just a tough shot but its kind of one were taking for granted this year huh well theres really no pressure on him Nicholls steps toward him and then steps back and you cant step away from him this guy in conference play has made more threepointers than anybody and he off to a slow start but hes got it rolling now yep eight different Tar Heels in the scoring column 6sec differential as we wind down this first half when padulla you want to be aggressive but you dont want to commit a foul in this situation 10 to go with kadoo seven theres kdo and scored it six for the Freshman they just spread it out could beat him oneonone Collins will launch at the horn banged out of there recover CED and thrown back up by Young Virginia Tech went the last 306 without a field goal 39 points in a half Les generally youd be pretty happy with that but the hokes gave up 50 the most theyve given up in a half all year out of the double team Bott Ingram Ryan bounds away on a deep three corack h his first two and he now missed his last three his I think his biggest contribution today has been his defense against cure and Bott the steal of a ball intended for kid up the hand of padulla six turnover by the hokes opens there offensive possession of the half or bacock calling for it against kid Armondo From the Block theres the double team Bott with 12 to shoot hell bang in on kid put it up theres three on LY kid kid is trying to have Wes keep his hands straight up in the air but I thought he brought those arms down against bacot so he picks up his third foul and I I think thats hard for any Defender you know maybe Zach Edy could do that go up against amondo Bott oneonone but Im not sure theres a lot of people who can manage any better than kid just did Dan theres some aspects of todays very modern college basketball that have got some old school in them thats one of them that feels like were seeing a lot more of oneonone isolated post playay it feels like as we move through this particular season and Bott has really helped himself west from the free throw line this year hes really improved his free throw percentage so he makes you pay for it when youre fouling 82 against the league seven points now for Richmonds Armando Bott and he hits the back in potit checked in he wears 34 for Virginia Tech to spell kid and Mike Youngs line up coutur out front padulla long foul line jump shot tough shot yep they caught the rebound look at kadoo all the way into traffic on the quick Music dribble theres a basketball analytic out there called plus minus and its used to measure your teams performance when you are on the floor plus is good minus is bad obviously six to shoot for Ingram skip for Kad now for RJs three from the left wing wow Dynamic ball movement gives RJ Davis 13 and the guy on the court with the biggest grin after that shot was Elliot kadoo heres Baron trying to answer cannot and poti gives the Hokies a second chance with a long rebound and the Hokies are really in a danger zone here West they could get blown out oh and it rolled in how did that go in because it came from your man sha padulla theres a will theres a away Quick Pass B caught the catch fell off the front rim knocked out heres the hokes two on two padulla again challenging and Ryan swatted it away well lets go back to the crafty ball movement in the half court game here Dan well the ball went inside then it went outside and Kad just a great job with the crosscourt pass he could see the defense was entirely down on the inside generally you make that pass from the corner all the way across the court youre asking for somebody to steal it and some conversation here with Greg Evans and Pat Driscoll and crew here and Im not quite sure I dont know whats going on whats transpired by Elijah potit is in the corner where Hashim zut is the Virginia Tech basketball trainer let me finish my thought here real quick on ellot Kau his plus minus at halftime was 20 now like to give you an example he was the only one in well cormack Bryan was 10 next closest behind that was nine Wes what that means is while you were on the court your team outscored the other team by whatever and in kads situation here oh I think thats what Mike young is complaining about the contact lens did come out but had some help from amondo bots hand like Po and Bot got some hand toand combat going but in the first half North Carolina outscored Virginia Tech by 20 when Elliot Kad was on the floor thats it and 20 West in a half is almost an unheard of number tell you what Elijah po finally got the contact L back in Long three Couture potit had it lost it they scrap for it look at this and were going to get a whistle and foul if thats potit thats his third bar its his third too its just been a rough rebounding day for the Hop and D Mike young knew it was going to be a struggle it was going to be tough they are the hokes that is 10th and the ACC in conference play and rebound margin Carolina is number one heres Bott on the cut to the basket and offensive foul yep weson thats one of those calls that you rarely see anymore because the defender has to be in position before the offensive player plants that foot and again thats a bang bang call that was really close and he was just outside the restricted area but if youre going to get a charge you got to be there early padulla after Carolinas fifth Applause turnover and the Third on Bon Couture with nine to shoot threw it up and Ryan will be called for the foul PM mag Ryans first second on Carolina Tar Hill fans not thrilled with the whistle well Couture is just looking for the foul here he turns and he goes right into corac Ryan and Ryan was sort of positioned to the side right so he didnt really have his guarding position established and I think thats why that foul was called thats a break for Virginia Tech though fourth point for couta Mike young said in the offseason about Hunter Couture company man if there ever was one he said Hunter Couture is a guy whose Legacy at Virginia Tech will not be just winning itll be what he meant to the program moving 10 years down the road or so kick out on the right Davis three bounds away and potit just got his third third on meijel potit so now kid Baron potit all with three Virginia Techs three team fouls here in the second half when you get great ball movement and thats what North Carolina has been getting you force the defense to move and when the defensive defensive players have to move around theyre not usually in good position for rebounding and thats what happened here they mooved the defense around so when the shot goes up the Carolina players have a chance to be in pretty good position for the offensive rebounds and theyve claimed a lot of them today 11 at the half 12 the difference here is kadoo and theres another Pokey foul thats on padulla Junior from Edmond Oklahoma it will be his first four on Virginia Tech and just like in the first half West the fouls are piling up on the hokes because the tar Hills have been extremely aggressive driving the ball and really fighting on the offensive boards Kau oh he lobbed one toward Bott who just slings it back to kadoo and then its turned over that was an interesting sequence yep thats six on Carolina and thatll be a foul on Ryan dribble drive by padulla second on cormack Ryan third on Hubert Daviss club and here comes Seth Trimble off the Carolina bench and hes going to get kads spot Withers and Washington follow for Hubert Davis here with 1632 to go cter wobbly start to the second half here Dan a little bit bless but you I mean you expected Virginia Tech to come out and really try to get back in the game and theyve done that they tried to be aggressive unfortunately theyve picked up some fouls Collins you mentioned the hes have struggled to get it inside theres kid in traffic and scored Lynn kid second field goal of the game and thats a nice job by the hookes to get it in there particularly against the mismatch although kid had to get that one over three players Davis on the bounce pass heres Washington Wheeling inside back strong to strong and out of bounds and hell stay with Carolina with 20 to shoot 1604 to play so again the hokes cannot claim the defensive rebound and the guy West that got his hands on the ball was Washington and he took an offbalance shot and yet somehow he was able to get his hands on the ball and create that offensive rebounding opportunity yep Carolina plus n on the glass and still holding to a 10point Advantage here Washington screen heres Ingram Oh no look to tremble Races Baseline feeds Washington hey what if Jaylen Washington will stay ready hell score cuz they will get 13 the ball huh well he did a nice job finding an open area but again great ball Movement by Carolina yep Couture kid inside lowers the shoulder put it up score and draws the foul backto back baskets for Gainesville Floridas ly kid so its a 12point lead for the moment Jaylen Washingtons dunk cuts it and then heres the bucket by Kid to make it 10 as we go to timeout so how was your day Music Liz just a normal day for us Pro Plan sport strength and stamina for life out here available at Tractor Supply the competitions never been

the most passion the most intensity this is the way basketball supposed to Applause be that is musty TV give her the ball are you kidding me and its a TI game he Dr it I cant believe what I am witnessing the streak It For the Applause Win well get ready were going to be in our nations capital for the New York live ACC tournament if the tournament started today Dan boner W its that time of the year isnt it Wes everybodys talking about the NCA tournament before we get there we got to get to the ACC tournament and those first three slots Wes we showed you the stand a little earlier yep you know all those teams are at least two games in front of Wake Forest but after that its sort of a jumble its going to be really interesting these last couple of weeks to see how everything plays out I would offer you that Clemson Wake Forest game on the final day of the regular season you see the 4 five scenario there if the double buy is in play for that 40 minutes of basketball my goodness its going to be a great game anyhow but particularly with those kind of stakes seven for Lynn Kidd hes got five in the half the hokes are back to within nine almost 5 minutes old here in this 90th meeting between the two schools but first in 15 months turned over number seven on Carolina carios have given it away twice in their last three possessions Tyler nichel on the floor short jumper good 11 for Nicholls seventh double figure game against the conference this year and thats again thats a shot in the lane and the Hoke didnt get very many of those in the first half but theyve done a nice job here in the second half scoring inside Bott working against kid who plays with the three fouls Armondo all the way underneath for the basket 10 now for Bott nice quick move by Bott he felt that pressure and just went right around it yep got five rebounds today does the grad student from Richmond theres hardly any out there to get here Ingrams getting them all Collins cure three on the move and its out of bounds last Touch by Kid and Virginia TCH Couture had a good look he clapped his hands in frustration after that play West because he knew he had a good look and Hunter Couture shooting 50 from three in ACC play coming in hes only one for four out there today Withers trying to bounce it to bacock theres the catch out of the double team and off the glass 12 now for Armando Bott on his fifth field goal well that is such a weapon yes you got a guy inside you just throw the ball to him be confident hes going to score or get fouled theres kid working get Bott with a right hand too strong Ingram another rebound kid made a couple of pivots West and went away from the basket made it a tougher shot than I think original Withers through traffic and one Jaylen Withers second field goal of the game looked like he lost balance when he left the floor and somehow still got it up on the glass well Collins did not do a very good job defensively there Wes you cant run at a guy who still has his dribble and Withers did lose his balance West but what a nice job recovering Bott did a nice job screening inside for him as well fifth foul on Virginia Tech is the fourth on LY kid and hell have to go to the bench the free throw by Withers round it out well Wes every time the hokes make a little run the tar Hills have responded so Applause far Baron poti on the floor now he plays with three fouls as does Robbie Baron Couture at 18 ft got it Hunter Couture just his second field goal seven now for the Orlando grad student and that ball got kicked itll stay with Carolina down here to our left and it looked like the tar Hills were trying to get it inside to Bott once again PO is in there with three fouls pookies are in an interesting little stretch here Dan they beat Florida State on Tuesday night play Chapel Hill here today home to Virginia on Monday night and next Saturday at pit theres a throw to and heres Davis a three that bounced away and there going to be a foul on Withers as he and baron both went to the floor Withers will draw his thats five on Carolina Virginia Tech came in losing three of their last four on the season five of six Road Gates well Baron that time really made sure he blocked out Withers witherss knocked him down trying to come over thats a kind of aggressiveness on the offensive boards though West that has been been rewarded for the most part today for the tar Hills coutour poti and foul on trembles reach six on Carolina second on Seth Trimble and its been a different story for Virginia Tech hman Road as Migel potit will go to the line Dan five and two in ACC play at the castle one and five on the road its hard to win on the road Wes and well this league has the stats to prove it coming into today thats eight now for patite home teams were just 60 and 41 thats under 60 and now we did have a twopoint game with Virginia Wake Forest but then 29 of the games have been five or less and only five overtime games we havent had an overtime game in almost a month we had five last one was January 24th in conference theres Bott bounce Withers and it banged out on the dunk he was trying to throw that one down too hard West yeah ninepoint game and its still nine long rebound padulo try and cut it to six cannot pookis had two front door misses there and heres a lead for tremble hell drive and score and you saw Pati just get out of the way Wes and I think thats what he had to do the hokes you know those were two wide open Shots by two of their best threepoint Shooters Ingram and Ryan back to the table for Carolina were going to get a stop in the action though on the next dead ball heres Couture for poti boy lowered the shoulder and drives home the field goal fourth of the day potite now in double figures for the third time against the league with 11 that was a situation West where Bott hit him too they couple of guys running into one another and theres Bott on the basket and the foul against Baron which will be be his fourth six on Virginia Tech with 1133 to go and Armondo Bott now eight in the half 14 in the ball game tar Hills at the line to extend their lead when we come back true

free throw line hes got an assist hes got a couple of rebounds and with Virginia Tech in foul trouble in the first half hes just taken over in there and as the hokes try to mount a comeback its very difficult when North Carolina has a guy like bacock who just makes it something happen every time he touches the ball Collins into traffic feeds poti and theres the fourth on bot I think no its going to be on kadoo Kad reached in you know I I think if Im Elliot kdo in that situation I just let Armondo bot handle things you know no reason to reach in like that heres potit to shoot two so 71 at the

double figures North Carolina has had an answer Mike young and his staff just kind of you work so hard to get it back to single digits and then you give it right back theres potit eligal now with seven and a half 15 in the ball game the Hokies are doing a much better job getting the ball inside in this half they really struggled to do that in the first half now can they get a stop Davis for

games are solid committee says theyre five overall as we begin play today well which makes them the number one number two seed if you will yep the North Carolina has had a really good season Wes they they they really did work in the nonconference part of the schedule they had that nine game winning streak MH in conference play front end one and one for Ryan good hes three for three and I know theyve tailed off a little bit here West but its hard to maintain that kind of performance through a long stretch of a basketball season every basketball season has some ups and downs second from cormack Ryan and when people think youre having a little bit of a downtime and youre still the number five overall seed yeah for the NCA tournament committee then I think youve done a pretty good job four and double figures for Carolina the lead returns to 11 can the hokes continue to score to hang in this thing Collins trying to find something heres potit left it on the front rim Ingram another rebound B Cuts got three fouls butti really needed to attack him not just take little soft shot that hes short on Koo on the dribble lost it with Collins defending and then commits the foul three on kadu eight on Carolina will give MJ Collins free throws down to our right was 725 to go the the interesting part about these two teams meeting today is their next game is against the same team Virginia on Monday night for the hokes Carolina next Saturday in Charlottesville of course Mike Youngs team lost by eight in Charlottesville in mid January and Virginia twopoint winner today against Wake Forest in the early portion of the schedule on this Saturday first free throw for Collins whos 23 of 25 on the year knocks it down quick reminder to you tonight 830 after the triple header

place to find it Kelsey rigs is in charge of that group gentlemen not you guys on acc network streaming live on the ESPN out couple of free throws for Collins on the one and one back to a ninepoint Tar Hill advant the hes are 11 for 11 from the L in the second half Ingram left the three on the rim forour the rebound heres Collins I thought he was going to pull the tri here they are another chance to cut it six Dan kid with the left hand makes it seven instead seven in the half nine in the game for Lyn Kidd and clest the Hokies have been since late in the first half they just wont go away double team coming threw it into traffic and finally Ryan collects Davis trying to shake nickel all the way through block nickel recovered Davis scores RJ Davis is listed at six feet in amongst the Biggins but another offensive rebound Collins Runner with the right hand Bott the rebound tremble on the Alley with Ingram Applause ahead if youre going to if youre going to drive the ball to the basket you got to attack Bott not try to float it up over him hes got a couple of fouls hes got three fouls maybe hell back off Davis trying to shake the screen lost it got it back Ingram sets banged around slapped out new 20 for another offensive rebound so the hokeys West they cut it to seven and then they had two chances to get the defensive rebound they werent able to do it Davis Fall Away with three oh my Heavens 18 for Davis that basket the most dramatic of them how about that coming up on five to play lead back to 12 on five of a row by Carolina Couture ly kid up and underscores well that breaks that five five in a row streak West but all five of those points were Second Chance points and thats where North Carolina has dominated today Davis all the way through offensive foul going to be called by Greg Evans on the baceline RJ Davis wrapped the arm and I think that laid the groundwork for the whistle with Davis he takes a bump and the shot clocks running down and how about this that step back that is some sort of a shot and Virginia Tech now trying to cut into the double figure deficit under five to go and thats going to be on cormack Ryan third all of the half by the way in the process today Armando Bott has now passed Ronnie shck for second in ACC history in career rebounds you getting up there in rarified air now with Vicky hem and Sh arent you its about as rare as the air gets in the Atlanta Coast confence the history of this league those are two names that among the biggest 10 for Couture and Bott who plays today in his 158th game look at that Ralph Samson we saw the other night in Charlottesville the great Tim Duncan Ronnie sh one of the finest gentleman not just as a basketball player but as a man and businessman and local leader in the Raleigh area later in life the great Dicky hmer Here We Go Again Wes its down under double figures Bott inside got the roll what a half for Bott and thats just again Ill say it thats just such a weapon when you have a guy you can just throw him the ball and expect something Goods going to happen back to 10 ahead of four Applause minutes kid trying to wind down again skips it for Collins three over tremble nine rebounds for bacot so hes one away from his 81st double double double team again one dribble diagonal skip pass and Collins got a hand on it and in J Collins is like man if I have just got a little more of that I might have been able to go the other way but half belongs to Bott Dan well hes just been outstanding Wes and again every time they need a basket they go to him and he produces 10point lead theres nothing better than a Subway series foot long except when you add an all new foot long sidekick like the 2 foot long churro covered in cinnamon sugar deliciousness or the 3 foot long pretzel salted and baked to Perfection honey mustard shot and lets not forget the 5 gooey foot long chocolate chip cookie whats your favorite clay youre my favorite sidekick no youre my favorite sidekick well

basketball is presented by Food Lion the official grer of the Atlantic Coast Conference and and just a moment ago Aaron Matson and the national champion North Carolina field hockey team honored here at Smith Center Aaron Matson pretty good you go from winning handful on your own to coaching one right right out of the gate one of the more amazing Sports stories in the country ABS absolutely Wes I mean they wi so many field hockey championships there was a kid out there with a 2022 Championship shirt on Wow there is a scoop Miss on the underside Ingram recovers and a foul called on Virginia Tech I believe Greg Evans tickets Collins with his first and eight now on Virginia Tech so one and one coming for no two shots for Harrison Ingram I think double check here with Pat dris oh one and one it is one and one he hasnt scored in this half that is correct has now quick reminder after the ball game well send you straight to Chestnut Hill John meita Perell Malcolm hunab be standing by Miami and Boston College and then well close the night at the Pete the Oakland Zoo will be at full throat after the win at Virginia wont they 630 tip time Doug Sherman Josh pner for Louisville and pits second meeting of the year and how about that pit team how well they play on the road yep jef C team in that group tied for fifth when the day started Couture the Miss of the three its an 11point game coming up on three minutes to play and he can make those West but that was a contested shot again nice defense by cormack Ryan who I think his defensive effort against Couture has been superb all day trle thought about it hits Bott with a pass and score of course he did Armond now continues his second half barrage pushing the lead to 13 17 and a half and hes seven of nine from the floor Collins has had a terrific day for Virginia Tech 18 points for MJ Collins now the problem now for Virginia Tech is theyre just trading baskets with North Carolina and obviously you cant do that when youre down by 11 yep eight to sh J Davis splits the double team and lost it and last Touch by Virginia Tech I believe is where that stands five to shoot Pat Driscoll double checking with Greg Evans I think Trumble will put it in play Ryan against Nicholls and a rebound poti got a push Colin might have gotten the away with a travel and Bot blocks potit what hasnt he done Wes he adds the block Bott a rebound away from the double double I believe nope now hes got it 13th double double of the year is the 81st of his career thats just means Morris set up a chart Ryan with five to shoot from Western North Carolina knocks it down 16 for cormack Ryan I think he was standing about bravard H here is Collins and the rebound for Bott with 80 seconds Applause left dont think he was quite out to Murphy when he cut it Loose Carolina going to go to 20 and six and 12 and three and keep the first place advantage and RJ Davis delivers to bot 25 for bot and he just stepped into the open spot Wes nothing complicated about what hes doing hes just doing it very well nichel missing on the three and theres a three ball for Tyler nickel thats his fourth three of the day hes got 14 in the ball game and with 28 seconds left RJ Davis got to get in front quarter how many times do you score 81 points and lose by a double figure right Carolina got 94 today arando Bott is going to finish with 25 and 11 he had
