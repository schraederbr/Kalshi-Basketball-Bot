to talk bad about him even though I never do but you start out already in the game coach talking about my guy give the home team the ball start the game why the home team well give the visiting team B I dont care theres keev theres another bad throw all right he and Yu mercifully get us started here so bayam and Alexander can calm down Shrewsberry with Burton Kev ji sir muhamed starts for the fifth straight time and Tay Davis in traffic couldnt finish and the rebound for the Mustang rebound leader and thats Matt cross and on Q heres BJ Edwards see Matt cross did a great job defensively against Tay Davis thats one of the things that Michael shy said he wanted to see his guys get into the paint quick shot Edwards in front got the friendly roll two nothing SMU its a good start for him he needs to get off to a good start that will help this team heres J head of the circle here is the Electric Burton by the way kick out for mohameds three back rim Miss Long rebound run down by Chuck Harris and Mustangs up to nothing Mohamed getting into the starting lineup to try to space the floor take a little bit of the pressure off of Burke and Shrewsberry as well giving them an opportunity to get into the paint but having someone to kick out to that can make shots he is now five of 25 from three by the way with the Miss to start there heres Harris against Shrewsberry now back to a quindo who is a shot maker and a shot taker with five to shoot Harris Chuck Harris that is a two and its good four nothing SMU on a pair of twopoint goals everything bad about that offense and they score thats great coaching wait a minute coach thats a great individual play by Chuck Harris you saying that you dont want that shot you dont want to do it that way okay heres Burton in the corner Shrewsberry had it taken away and this is Edwards with help behind the back of quo the dunk and you cant ask for a better start on the road if youre the Mustangs Michael shry not liking what hes seeing early going to the timeout down 60 buckets by Edwards Harris and now the dunk off the friendly bounce pass from Kio aqu quendo but we talk about Edwards and his defense leading to offense for SMU right Music Music Music well theres a look at 55yearold Andy infield Shippensburg Pennsylvania native played his ball at Johns Hopkins now in his first season in Dallas and trying to take SMU to a second straight 20 win campaign tonight Victory WD you are a trivia guy so I can throw this question to you T Davis Tay Davis able to knock down the three ball to get the fighting Iris on the board what NBA team do our two head coaches both have in common uh the Boston Celtics it will be the Boston Celtics of course Michael Shrewsberry coaching alongside Brad Stevens and Andy edvi coaching with Celtics with Rick patino who the guy him my right gave his first college job who oh Rick whos he wheres he at now oh I told him told turn around in two years told St Johns around two years thats about what he told yeah knocked out of B last Touch by Kevin jaai it will go to the Mustangs who got the C yigu bucket theyre four for four from the floor is coach enfields team by the way Andy infield was a shooting specialist in Milwaukee Philadelphia and of course Boston before then going to Leonard Hamilton program in Florida State yeah WD how about this though when you look at the four for four from SMU all of it in the painted area getting close now four for five know the a every shot of give me one of their three four shots have been from Beyond the threepoint Arc so everythings from the outside here is Mohammad son of the former NBA star and uh what national champ champion in Kentucky Nazi muhamd bounce pass knocked away and a travel gigou and of course at the noted a benches campaign number two is Micah Shrewsberry who was one time the division three assist leader for a campaign in his playing days at Handover College here in Indiana and as Cory told you from 2013 to 19 he was a Boston Celtics assistant already two turnovers for the Fighting Irish and both of those belonging to Marcus BD who had six turnovers the last time out we talked about that loss six turnovers for him and as a point guard has a negative assisted turnover ratio in ACC blade WD its hard to win coach when your point guard has a negative assisted turnover ratio well hes not a point guard hes a scorer the big other thing the big guy is just staying in the lane down here hes that gets in there Burton likes to get in the lane big guy is going to be right there two was right there hes not leaving that lane 72 265lb freshman from Istanbul Turkey four of the five attempts from not Bame have been from three so coach Shrewsberry want to see them get in the paint they hadnt been able to do it theres the double team briefly now heres yigu reverses the other way missed the layup Davis kept it alive and Shrewsberry ahead for Burton with the High Step dribble off the screen pocket pass Tay Davis to work Burton Ts up a three short and the rebound for Ed broken record one five of six shots coming from Beyond The Arc and we know they want to use the three however theyve got to find a way to put some pressure on smus defense in the paint aindo out of the corner for three Caro aindo has five hes a 42 threepoint shooter he had 13 points and nine rebounds in the ball game against Wake Forest coach and theyve recovered from missing their point guard this game theyre ready to go this game coach a entire new line change coming in five players in white will be entering the game on the next dead ball for Michael shb hes seen enough of his starting lineup I know you didnt do that often did you I never did that I didnt ever did I only played eight guys about to say you didnt play enough guys send another five there wer Five Guys to put in the game four points for Chuck Harris his second go I had to go in myself well Andy infield who has got by the way a 5 one road record in the ACC and has won four straight road games in the conference Corp he couldnt have asked for a better start than what hes gotten here tonight couldnt have asked for a better start and couldnt have asked for a worse start for Michael Shrewsberry considering theres very little support in the crowd for his team right now as hell have a new five on the floor we come back for break down 10 s here get some energy from the new group tonight Fort this students from the community Lear Music here here Irish F please welcome members of the robton community leing center as they present their to leadership from not Athletics of black history mon Applause Music Applause Applause Music my motherinlaw is watch my ass Music Music DJ Music I like I like 10point lead for snu and you see were only 520 into the proceedings Tay Davis has stayed on the floor but elsewise four new noted a players and the only reason Davis is on the floor is cuz hes shooting free throws its the only reason and this is one of those moves that could work but about 80 says it wont work because thats SMU was playing really well and now youre putting the five guys that are not as good as the five you had out there thats not a good recipe but fortunately for Coach Shrewsberry matako back on the court after missing four games with a wrist injury so he does have a steady hand out there already three turnovers in this game for noted aame hes the guy that normally distributes the basketball gets everyone in position and there are a couple veteran guyss J areski on the floor as well so fortunately for Tay Davis well unfortunately for those name he misses both at the free throw line but he gets to stay on the floor so Garrett sundra will have to wait a moment Julian roer Mato Nikita constantini a big fella from Monmouth in there to battle against yigu Jr kesn and Tay Davis thats the five for Notre Dame and heres Chuck Harris with six to shoot and SMU to work taken off Baseline and he stepped out of bounds so Harris turns it over for the Mustangs and here is Garrett sundra from Northern Virginia playing about 10 minutes a game into the lineup for Notre D so heres the thing now you can go and execute what you had the game planned for you had have to understand that this group is going to do everything that coach Shrewsberry says because theyve already seen them get off to a bad start so what they want now theyre not as talented however they will follow the game Plano now heres kesn who a year ago played a whole lot more than hes played this year and kind of helped shrewsburys first team to some success as did Ro for WD so you got two guys that did get a lot of experience a season too in shrewsburys first year yep heres Harris front Court cross and now a quindo on the drive Cario threw it up on the glass and the darn thing went in difference between being a Freshman and being an upper classman aindo able to bully his way to the basket knocking The Freshman back a couple of steps to get his shot seven points for k o a quindo he leads senu heres kesn hes fouled by cross shooting a three thatll be three free throws on the Matt cross foul now there are fouls and then there are bad fouls shot hit the side of the backboard Come on B let me hear about it that is a shot you just cannot do that hes not making that shot let alone I mean the back where he aint making that shot we saw Andy infields oh my gosh his expression and hes thinking exactly the same thing as coach is on that one thats why I dont miss coaching because it just your heart your heart blood pressure goes out the roof and you know theres nothing you can do about that but you got to know they cant score dont give them a couple points and this is just a lineup I Im sure coach is going to just try to teach these guys a quick lesson but You got to get back in there Im going let you pause for a moment and remember finally your coaching days to tell you that we got a double header tomorrow night on acc Network North Carolina Maria gang against uh Georgia willly in Syracuse at 6 Eastern and then Virginia Tech and Stanford follow from black or from uh out Al on acc Network how about the week for the not women basketball program putting on a show on big Monday and then in Miami tomorrow as well as game day will be joining them at NC State so three games this week for NE IV her squ the number one team in the country terrific team yigu on the follow hes got four now not name Cory for the ills at the offensive end defensively they forced SMU to some low shot clock when theyve been able to keep them away from these heres Toc gorner wearing number five for the Mustangs hell kick it across and a three ball away from Harris that rims out sundra the rebound for the Notre Dames like a play or two away from being out of the game not able to come back if if something doesnt change really these guys out there are not going to score against SMU SMU is playing defense I dont think theyre going to score against these guys he cant give up those opportunities the offensive rebounds and second chance put backs when youre working so hard defensively got to find a way to keep a body on the big guy yotu most likely will be on the all rookie team this year WD hes had a strong freshman campaign hes a freshman that reminds you of about a 24 year old professional player he is a 20y old freshman by the way I think he might even be a little older than that I like to check his person oh boy here we go kesn back for sundra and well get a hand check on Keon Ambrose Hilton thatll be his first and the Third on SMU Ambrose Hilton a little over anxious right there wanting to take away the three but nfo talked about how their defense is elevated and really boy Miller gets a lot of credit for that doing the job at the point of attack defensively but now you can see that theyve amped it up even more here after the success theyve had early Roper shot fake bounce pass for KES and thats AJ George the transfer from Long Beach State who knocked it out of bounds so we get a break 12point lead for were in South Bend tonight on acc Network and he kind of joked with us today and said well you know my temper might have gotten the best of me a little bit as somebody who follows college basketball I appreciate the passion Jim that hes coaching with yeah I mean he thats not too thats nothing really but I mean hes mad youd like to see his team come out and play better they didnt so now hes trying to shake him up again but I think a lot of this is not so much Notre game I think its just that SMU is playing really good defensively but how about that see thats the effort we were expecting from the beginning Tay Davis getting in there getting the offensive rebound getting his team extra opportunities and the effort thats the biggest concern is making sure theyre playing with the effort but coach this is a time when you want your team playing for you Burton a pull up three front rim Miss and AJ George pulls down the Carrol they can get nothing inside and theyre obviously not making the threes so its hard for them to score thats why they have five points Cole Serta by the way freshman from LeRoy Illinois wearing number five for Notre Dame doesnt play very much as into the ball game and hes into that lineup with Burton and Davis Kevin ji and BR Shrewsberry and Sir Mohamad is on the bench as yigu is going to go to the line on the foul against Josh which will be his first and it is the first on Notre aame here in the ball game so C yatu who is a 60 free throw shooter this is his first one hes had eight double figure games in conference play he only had four points and four fouls on Saturday in the Lost Wake Forest in Dallas and it was a game where SMU shot 36 from the field but more importantly they didnt have the Wake Forest transfer boy Miller against Wake Forest an opportunity for him to go play against his old team and Coach mentioned earlier hes the guy hes the key to the engine so when you dont have him as the point guard other guys have to step up but they just were unable to get anybody going offense heres Burt W Forest played a lot of Zone in that because they couldnt make any shots shuberry for Burt Baseline lost it on the dribble another turnover and weve seen Burton have a hard time handling the basketball in the painted area and so when you see that especially from your guy that you have to trust is you can talk thats a pass coach absolutely and a foul and one yigu goes Derek whittenberg to AJ George oh wait a minute you bought up D I did I want to see how they score this one on the official box score that is a shot that is clearly a shot that goes wide right so was whittenberg I agree with that as well that was a Cory Alexander pass it see WD not didnt even start with him today but you see I will call that second chance points for the Mustangs and opportunity to put another one on the board as George knocks down the free throw I tell you this AJ George played six minutes the other day against Wake Forest had six points hes come on the floor hes got three now and has been pretty good in his help defense as well especially on the Burton Drive a moment ago another turnover WD thats six of them against Notre Dame guys so now when you look can not to a and think about what theyve done thus far throughout this game theyre one of seven from three seven of their nine attempts have been from Beyond the threepoint Arc and you have six turnovers coach and theyre shooting 11 from the field its hard to beat anyone like that well youre not going to beat youre going to get beat badly too a quindo hard drive off the wing into traffic with a right hand score nine for carry o quindo and the SMU lead is 17 and Notre Dame unfortunately here in the first 10 minutes has more turnovers than points as Mohammad is tripped in foul and thats going to be against I believe jell Colbert who has checked into the game coach beheim youve been through everything in 47 years on the sideline so when you had a we wont call it much of a rant for Michael Shrewsberry but youve had rants in your day have you ever noticed that when teams come out to play after that they may be playing with a little too much pressure on them no I dont see and usually you get a positive out of you get a a little bump as your players want to go after it but the problem here really is the big guy is is just keeping the lane open bu game Davis depends on the Drive Burton likes to get into the mid range area they cant get there they just cant get there the defense has been too good and when you cant get in there you end up shooting threes and thats a losing proposition because theyre not a good threepoint shooting team smus got 16 points in the paint a quos layup the latest hes knocked down the free throw he has got a dozen their 25 I think a bigger issue for no game right now is the fact that SMU is shooting 69 so I understand the offensive problems but they cant stop SMU and thats the bigger issue with when youre trying to make a comeback you got to be able to slow the other team down defensively yeah a little bit but theyre off I mean you cant score seven points in 10 minutes and be in any game and thats where theyre at right now first twopoint goal of the half for Notre Dame and a quendo is rolling 15 first half points for a quindo in the starting lineup today normally does his damage coming off the bench making it difficult for Coach infield to take him out their starting lineup WD you going play like this the first has doubled up SMU or doubled up Notre and hes got 15 theyve got seven let alone the other 13 you have to remember SMU is second in the league in field goal percentage defense theyre a good defensive team Shrewsberry the floater and bucket for Bron Shrewsberry but those are the plays that coach shuberry was looking for get into the painted area and make a play whether its you look for yourself or to kick it out for someone for a wide open shot heres Harris foul line floating and cobbert the catch and dunk Terrell culbert at 610 on the board Shrewsberry the other way got the bounce on a three they needed that one bad for this game five for Braden Shrewsberry thats his 68 three of the Year Colbert right hand jumper good everythings going right everythings going wrong for no lead is 20 for the Mustangs with under eight to go here first half and the field goal percentage is up to 737 the Mustangs had a record 68 field goal shooting at Miami earlier this year and this first half has gone well beyond that heres the runner for Shrewsberry blocked away cobbert deflected it and were going to get a foul called I believe on J thats going to get us to a break here in South bin its been all SMU so far in the first half chunk Harris getting into the painted area Dunc transition off a great pass from BJ Edwards couple of Threes in his pocket here in the first half on the way to 15 points hes six off his season high of 21 against Virginia in December Cory but WD we know hes a shooter right when you give a shooter a dunk early and you give him opportunities at the basket coach youve seen it happen so many times it makes that three much easier much easier much different so SMU in control by 20 and the basketball AJ George getting some big minutes off of Andy infields bench Matt cross out there working against Tay Davis and here is Chuck Harris remember the Mustangs play without poopy Miller again tonight three ball at the front spins out on Harris constant tanosy the Applause Music rebound seven minutes to go in this first half Davis to work and a block is going to be called on Chuck Harris senior from Northern Virginia started his college career Butler his first fifth on Southern Methodist University Chuck Harris out of Gonzaga High School played for by guy Steve Turner coach Im sure you recruited some guys from there but I know you recruited guys from Team Takeover his Au program all of them coach Enfield had a long conversation with Bert Smith there it will do him no good but and you know that from experience experience Davis all the way to the basket blocked out of there by Ambrose Hilton and here goes SMU in transition Mustangs have been terrific theres cross from Deep had it spin out that was the guy that was in our league for two or three years only shooting from the threepoint line never really saw him go inside the threepoint line now hes a rebounder and a defensive player and a screener I didnt even recognize him today so mat cross who started his college career Miami then Louisville then UMass shooting threes and now at SMU he played 27 career ACC games before he rejoined the ACC for a third time and hell play more than that in this season of course has done much more work on December 16th was named the ACC player of the week not a not the same guy we saw in those other two uniforms no different player all together here goes Burton sne look around in the traffic and score thats really the first time hes gotten to his spot and he usually gets there easily which I think you got to give SMU credit for it yigu turns constant owski cannot stop s yigu nobody stopped him when he gets that close to basket did a great job getting in there sealing coach I remember you yelling at your big guys to go run to the rim and seal like that yeah but most of them couldnt catch it so we just didnt throw it to him what an indictment on find young people that used to play for you heres Burton trying to get another goal for the Irish K still a 20point SMU lead with 5 and a half to go they made that shot very difficult for Burton cross will hand to Harris youu calling with the right hand and constant tonosi will draw the foul Nikita is from ke in the Ukraine its his first and the fifth on the Irish and that will send Sam are we going to get oh Baseline okay were not going to get free throws dont forget Saturday we got a triple header for you start at Chestnut Hill at 2 presented by Food Lion its Georgia Tech BC then off to Dallas Dan boner and Ill will be there for Clemson and SMU and then Virginia Tech Miami close things at 600 Eastern here on acc Network big game in Dallas Clemson at SMU another opportunity for the Mustangs to try to get a quad one win but Clemson trying to stay in that same spot to make sure they are on Dukes heels for the ACC turn forgive me the ACC regular season lead yep tuck Harris has got seven thats his first three of the night hes got 58 of them on the year and he shoots 45 from behind the line Alo step back over a quendo front rim Miss and heres the transition off the rebound and look at BJ Edwards go to the basket getting score second points for and thats if you had to score on that possession because alako fouled a quendo seven times from the time he went from the threepoint line trying to get back down the floor 25point game with 420 to Applause go and boy the Mustangs now look we set it to top five teams for four spots in Charlotte somebodys going to be a hard luck five seat right but boy the Mustangs have looked a part of a double buy here tonight Cory look at how many times Alo fouls a quo on that possession but it cleared the way for ever to be able to get the easy layup but WD Im with you the Difference Maker right now what were looking at Wake Forest going to Dallas beating SMU on Saturday if things remain the same and these two teams finished with identical records that gives the deacons the advantage and they would get the four seed SMU would get the and the difference too this is they SMU has recovered from not having their point guard that first game you might not be able to do it but you do it in the second game were going to get a foul on constant owski I believe itll be his second and hes the player down on the floor 25point lead and well get a timeout here in South Ben its been all SMU in the first half Music hi Music Music e Music e Applause I would say its state Carolina and the doors were open today because of the weather on Frankin Street Gym if you could just get to the game you could sit where you wanted I cant believe that people went to the game down there usually when its snows an inch they stay home for a month we we are not going to be able to ever take him back to Carolina I love Carolina were going to Charlotte for the tournament I love Carolina they just dont know what to do when it NOS when I say things that are factual I dont know why you always have to say that its I just Ked a little bit about my guys not catching the ball listen I had guys that caught the ball a Lotter I wouldnt you absolutely did have a bunch of guys I get around a little bit you do get around but it is true that they do not know what to do with snow in the state of North Carolina they dont even have they have snow removal is sunshine in North Carolina its not anything to do with plows I tell you what well do all right well see if Governor Stein can visit with you during the ACC tournament Charlotte Josh Stein newly elected governor of North Carolina maybe he could talk to you about some of the procedures they have with DOT Id be happy to talk to all right here heres the reason we got a little pause in the action this constant owski and yatu uh mixup in the paint has sent Bert Smith and his crew to the monitors and Cory I think theres a question here about if its just a common foul or is there something else to this honestly there could be three different calls here there could be an offens of foul right there could be a flop or it could stand Tommy were going to get the answer they dont know what it is but theyre going to make one up the last play we have upgraded the play to a dead ball contact technical foul against SMU for making contact to the Notre Dame players head in a dead ball period theyre going to shoot two free throws and get the ball out of bounds all right so CET yigu has been given a flagrant one uhhuh because of the contact thats it above the shoulders so thats one on Yu but the common foul did stand thats it so there still was a foul so here is a look now remember constant owski was was called for a foul and that that foul that foul stand thats his second by the way and yigu because of contact above the shoulder should and and this is what you were talking about during the break it could be one of three things it could have stayed it could have been one way added which it was and yet there was another possibility of a flop there was a possibility of flop because the contact and the reaction was later it was a delay reaction on the contact he must have got hit by Mike Tyson and was out didnt realize it and and then fell so you see the hit yeah and now you see the reaction so the officials had every right to go over and also called that a flop Im glad they did not because there was contact but but the real Le theyre having the conversation right now I believe Eric is letting him know next time you may want to fall once you get hit well the first thing you should youre right it was a common foul it was above the head and then it was a flop you could have had all three one heres the real speed look its still the delayed I mean even after that its still a delayed fall its a delayed reaction even in real speed Bron Shrewsberry shoots these free throws it it was all three you had it right I dont think Ive ever seen that call I dont I dont know if Ive seen all three call either Seven for Tru got it Andy infield concerned about why it is Notre names basketball because once its dead ball then the technical foul the flager foul gives the basketball two not today but Andy is concerned about the fact that it was the common foul was also called which is while he was building his though it should have been their possession well it put two on constant owski by the way who stays in the game for Notre D heres kzne at the head of the circle Tay Davis Marcus Burton off the floor here with three and a half to go theres the big guy in there again they cant get to the basket yep you get toou drifts off to cover Davis six to shoot for Tay Davis against Matt cross kick out Shrewsberry pushes up a three thats good Brandon Shrewsberry has got double figures and that is making the most of a grenade nothing other to other to get that in the air coach great defense and greater shot and now constant owski and yigu going again thats the third foul on Nikita kantowski and the seventh on Notre Dame this what you call a grenade theres nothing left to do but get a shot in the air you see the shot clock bra Shrewsberry smart enough to recognize what is going on the time on the shot clock and has the ability to knock down the three to keep it at a 20po lead thats a great shot to get that off get it in the bat just to hit the rim would have been good I got it one and one for samat Applause yigu and the front end is no good rattled out for it 0 for three is the big fell for missan bll but heres the thing they did not get him off the floor fast enough so now con misses the layup there but he has to be very careful with the three fouls on this end of the four and make sure he doesnt pick up a four cross a three got Matt crosss first basket is his 39th three of the year thats what he did five or six years ago when he first started playing 42 to9 Tay Davis skips for Shrewsberry back for Davis we got to give the Mustangs a lot of credit they have been really good defensively in this opening 20 minutes despite the whistle there like you cant blame Notre James theyre they just cant get a good shot and its every time they get there the 72 guy is standing right there and theres no way to get a shot of so be gorer by the way the foul his first seventh on the Mustangs and the first one for Shrewsberry rattles around and drops in dont forget weve got gymnastics for you on acc Network in the ESPN app Sunday afternoon number 16 Stanford and Clemson at Little John Coliseum covers starts at 400 Eastern here on accn Bo Bron Shrewsberry has been the offensive punch Marcus Burton back on the floor by the way as well during the break now Michael shry going to go Zone defensively with no bigs out there cross makes a pain but the problem is now coach how do you keep them off of the offensive glass you got gar sunra playing the five position inside of that zone youve got to try to did not let him get that shot make him shoot a outside shot and hope they miss something out there here goes Davis around through traffic draws the foul and that will be tagged to BJ Edwards itll be his first and two shots coming for D in the line here with 155 he got to the line because the big gus on the bench thats the only reason he got to the Applause basket soig Davis to the strike the big actually had to get out of the painting area to guard G sunra because sunra is a threepoint threat and so now thats an area where on the offensive end Michael Shrewsberry can try to draw him out of the painted area to see if they can open up those driving lanes for Tay Davis Shrewsberry and Marb thats Garrett sundra by the way from that talented Paul the 6 program Team Takeover man okay Garrett is Team Takeover won a peace Jam Championship with my God J Jones for take over he also played with Denham and Patrick gunba and Darren Harris PA assist got a few ACC teammates as well and all those guys by the way were on the peace Jam Championship okay got it 21point lead gner Edwards left side heres a quendo who started off like he was going to score 30 in the half yeah the halfs not over WD but he not going to finish with 30 cross rolls Davis Baseline feed jigu and a foul called on Notre kesi got in there late got a little bit of the arm that pass delivered blow and BT Smith trying to sort it out I think its on Jr KES and it will be the Junior from South Bens first 18 foul on the Irish mat cross got away with a little bit of a ticket wing on that one right in front of Michael Shrewsberry coach Shrewsberry not happy about not getting that offensive fou call heres yigu and a 21point lead for the Mustangs and the first one good yigo has a chance to be really really good player in this league hes good down the low post hes physically strong and hes really a big force on defense he finds the ball Jimmys got a lot of experience he played second division ball in turkey and actually played in The Adriatic League which I mean I know theres youve told me this theres basketball worldwide places you dont think have leagues have leagues right well tury is a very very good basketball league one of the better leagues in Europe so for him to play second division before hes even 20 years old is pretty impressive right very good 23point lead and gner took it away from Burton but again at Burton just trying to do too much theres no space to go there get into the paint kick it out make play for someone else instead of hooking up your full Turtle minute five to go oh not a hook oh Matt cross we wont call it quite the Skyhook coach he must have heard that I said something about him just being a shooter now hes going inside and shooting hook shots you said he was allergic to the paint yeah you said that about was six years ago when he came into the league yeah six or seven 4823 SMU on the way to another 50point half heres Shrewsberry tried to feed sundra deflected to him with 10 to shoot and now Burtons got to run it down thats over and back and SMU will get it with 34 and2 to go turnover on Notre Dame SMU has had 13 halves this year of 50 or more well and Ill give you the points I understand that but this is a defensive game they have frustrated Notre Dame they cant score and your defense suffers when that happens and the turnovers lead to points and I will say this Cory when we talk about evolving teams during the course of a year I think we have to give Andy infield a lot of credit they were were scoring a lot of points in November and December and January theyve still got a lot of offensive acument but they are better defensively in February than they were a month and youre talking about a team that has 10 new guys this is my problem with the committee balancing the whole year you got teams playing great at the end and you have to reward them L to steal and score right now smus out of the tournament and the way theyre playing out without their point guard is theyre a different team now you have to respect that Edwards out front heres Harris with two one at the horn theres the 50 what we got there and it started it play theyve LED about 25 or more at the half they did it at Miami against Georgia Tech at home and here tonight against Notre Dame to give you an example theyre the only School in the ACC to do it North Carolina joined them they LED NC State by 25 and Halftime tonight Chapel Hill coach let me ask you this you have a huge lead like this at halftime what do you tell your team if youre Andy infield and you go in at half well you tell them its nothing nothing but they dont hear you you know you just their defense is so good I I would not worry you know if your offense is good and your defense isnt good then you sometimes worry their defense and not Dame is not going to overcome a 2 five point lead unless something crazy happens like that yeah they keep giving up those to a great shooter and bra Shrewsberry at the top of the key they can absolutely come up come back but Im sure Andy infield will address that the next time he gets a chance to talk to his team shrewsburys got 15 of Notre Dames 28 and C yigu was terrific in the first half he had eight points couple of rebounds couple of steals heres cross a three from the front and he answers the triple from ruberry thats the Matt grunts I remember shooting threes hes really improved as a player you have to give him credit 10 for cross ninth straight double figure game for him kesn answers a triple all right thats a better start Jr kesn thats his 14th three of the year and backto back threes for the Fighting Irish to start the second half the issue has been can they find a way to slow down the Mustangs and the answer is no backto back bus buckets for the Mustang as well yep ninth double figure game for yigu in conference play hes also had a couple double doubles against the league heres Davis another three and cross the rebound you see three black shirts and only a locko there for Notre D speaking of seeing what we dont see is all ACC candidate Marcus Burton on the floor to start this second half that shows you how displeased Michael shry is with his star guards performance four turnovers in in the first half for Burton and for Burton he hes a driver he needs to get to the basket but you cant get there he should be taking his 15footer thats what youd like to see him so Bren Shrewsberry draws the foul there its his first its the first un noted a little post whistle discussion with umpire Tommy morsy and Shrewsberry and I believe Matt cross saying hey no more a little more to that than just the whistle typically and theres sir Mohamed drawing the foul thatll be his first and the second on the Freshman uh theres poopy Miller on the SMU bench by the way whos missing his second straight game now Miller has said he would like to try and be back for Saturdays 400 Eastern start against Clemson and moty Coliseum in Dallas and I would say that that would change the complexity of the game against Brad Brown El tigers as o quindo drives for his seventh field goal hes got 17 coach let me ask you this if boopy Miller is ready the way o quindo has played throughout this game did you disrupt the Rhythm that SMU has been in to put your best player back in the starting lineup as we see Caro continue to attack 17 points for him already in this game going off the bounce and this they got it normally does his damage from Beyond the threepoint AR but showing his strength and finishing on the finishing strong in the rim dont lose your starting spot by injury so if he can come back he starts quindo goes to the bench hes been good Off the Bench y I think your team is better because these other guys have had to do more so but but I think you bring him back if hes healthy Ill say this bopy Miller and Chase Hunter will be worth the ticket theres a inside pass and yigao is back on the board well thats its really a game SMU probably must win get a quad one win they almost are in that position even though theyre going to have 20 21 wins 22 wins theres not enough quad one wins in our league theres a scooping score for Davis seven for Tay Davis we see what Michael Shrewsberry is doing they spacing to for a much smaller lineup for him kevi also not starting the second half So Tay Davis pretty much playing the five spot but theyve been able to have some success on the offensive end the floor and now backto back stops on the defensive end Applause I mean its fast break or secondary break and the balls in the air Cory it is that but you see muhamad actually having to play in the post trying to take away Matt cross thats going to be a tough match up for him as Matt cross has continue to develop his game not just a threepoint shooter anymore hes got a little conversation little extracurricular going on Davidson yatu and now all of a sudden BT Smith is stopping play WD I had a rule and Id like to talk a little bit when I was on the floor but when guys got face to face if I had to look up at you Im a go and quiet down coach I mean again I mean at that point like if I got to look up at you to say what I got to say normally Im going to walk away from the confrontation well when I remember when John Thompson lined up against rck patino I said thats not a good match heres a la but quindo couldnt finish it on the flush and therell be a foul on Notre Dame now its going to be on Malo itll be his second its the third on the iris we get a timeout so an early flurry from Notre Dame but still its a 26o SMU leag the jump and Caro quindo is going to go to the line the officials went over to see if this was a flagrant however malalako thinking that a shot going up trying to box out a clo going to stay with a common fou as a quendo does a great job finding the camera right after hitting the floor free throw from the Titusville Florida senior of quindo is good hes two for two at the line three and a half 18 in the game make it 19 as he knocks his next one down he had 16 in the first few minutes of the game by the way this is third School in four years he played 96 career games with 62 starts prior to this year in Dallas Five Guys with over 100 games EXP experience for the Mustang so although they went to the portal they went to the portal to get guys who know their way around the basketball court Davis the second chance opportunity first second chance points of the night for the Irish nine for Tay Davis in WD you know who was not won those five guys with 100 games Matt cross only played 27 games ACC play despite the fact bam said hes been playing s years despite the fact that coach said hes been in college seven years years no all right cant exaggerate a little and Edwards lost it on the in line out of is great job defensively by Shrewsberry standing his ground right there forcing the turnover and again its still a 26point lead but if youre mic bear you want to see something positive happening for your team all right Marcus Burtons on the bench were 5 minutes into the second half here y hes not happy with him but coach at some point when do you say okay hes my best player were going to need him next time out I send a message how when do you put him back in the game messages are for Postman I I never sent those messages I mean you just you talk to them at halftime you get on them you say whatever is guys saying then you dont leave him out I dont leave him out of the thats thank goodness that the postman is not involved here because Marcus Burtons just gone to the table and heres my question when he says Postman are we talking about guys who play playing the post with those that deliver mail deliver mail I wasnt quite clear enough I guess for you well I thought you went to Virginia you would know what that meant well thats all right lets get to the game we did have a slight indictment of all the post players in the first half so so now you so now you see where I am that was an exaggeration okay sorry funny joke okay got it Dennys isnt the best stop dont do it dont do it dont do it 25point lead for SMU lob a quendo foul by mohamd tell you what M quos taking a number of hits going for lobs already in this game however not Dame hasnt figured out how to stop it yet another opportunity for him at The Rim now heres and that is going to be two free throws as well great job our officiating crew recognizing thats a shot attempt yep so a quendo whos got 19 can tie his season high if he knocks both these down he at 21 in the win against Virginia back on December the 7th and what was the first ACC game for the Mustangs at Moody Coliseum but offensive rebound put back and damag the foul so this could be a fourpoint possession and yolan trayor is credited with the basket its first time weve seen trayor by the way guys in three games hes missed the last two played briefly at Virginia Tech after not playing stand because of a hip injury that he came out of last weekend at dayto day but trayor has got a threepoint play to his credit and his return to action for Andy infield you just have to give SMU a lot of credit they came in here to win the game yep thats what theyre doing they needed it going to get it mohamd double team in the corner trayor and George are there heres shrew be heres roer Music Applause Alo trying to beat cross into traffic Alo missed Burton he got could have had a wide open look and and were going to get over the back call and its on trayor a junior from France who played in Cal Santa Barbara his first third on the Mustang if youre Michael shw youre getting what you want get into the painted area but you got to be able to locate where your Shooters are missed opportunity on that but Burke was wide open and thats a guy they need to get going if he gets a look off Als penetration that could change his fortune here yeps got to get it in bounds and heres Burton against George AJ George 67 now and then Keon Ambrose Hilton who is 69 trying to help Burton for AO catch and shoot three and itll bounce over the glass out of play to SMU well Andy infields team Jim we s in the first half theyre 5 and one on the road the ACC their only loss on the road is at Carolina they won four straight road games and theyre trying to win 20 for the second year in a row here tonight Road games matter when it comes time to the NCAA tournament committee they look at that that will help them they started the day with a net of 40 but no quad one wins theyll have a chance on Saturday for that at home against Clemson top 20 tiger team of Brad Brown L whos got the week off after blitzing Florida State from the jump last Saturday in Tallahasse o quendo long three is off ambro Hilton the rebound and hell be called for a travel I dont think he ever got his balance as he tried to cradle well its hard to get your balance when the guy is pushing another so 29point lead for infields team and heres a look at the details Cory what catches your eye here well you got to look at meeting at the center line that say quad one youre 0 and four and quad one wins and you know the discussion is is how do you put in the SMU team over in Oklahoma who has four quad one wins but even though theyre three and 10 in SEC play theyve got four quad one wins they did most of it in the nonconference and so how do you place an SMU team over a team like that from the SEC well when especially when theyre getting you do it because theyre getting beat by 25 and 30 points now in the in by quad one teams so thats that has to factor in and it also has to factor in this is who you are now and they dont they used to do that theyve chosen not to do that to go by the whole season I think thats a huge mistake I think you have to go by the whole season but you have towait the last part of the season because thats when the TR is so you dont want to go in there with teams that are not playing with Johan trayor the basket third foul on Sir muhamd hell come out tror has got backto back threepoint trips for his six here in the second half thats a nice second half development for Andy infield it really is and hes been doing it with effort plays youre talking about two and1s because of the offensive rebound and then running and sealing getting position on the Block as he runs right down the middle of the floor again they missed him on that y Co Sera drifted on the three here goes AJ George in traffic he got stripped of it nice play by r first saved it to Burt Irish with a rare Mustang turnover and heres Cole Cera so WD coach Ive been here before in Burtons position where you turned the basketball over a number of times and Miss opportunity times that it hurt the team you can see right now Burton is much less aggressive than were normally used to watching him hes not really looking that hes frustrated hes upset Im sure that he was on the bench which hes not used to doing that but somehow you got to just forget all that you got to make a play make the next play make a good he did make a good pass you got to try I dont know why hes not trying to get to his pullup game thats where hes the most dangerous hes trying to get too far take the pull Roper missed the first hes now n of 15 at the line this year make it 9 of 16 senior transfer from Detroit averaging about 15 minutes of ball game in confer play lead is still at 32 and theres a Miss at the bucket out of bounds and last Touch by SMU says BT Smith WD you know how we often celebrate rivalry week yes sir this must be blowout week it started Monday night Duke at Virginia we see what North Carolina is doing we watched Virginia Tech score 36 points last night 11 in the first half and getting blown out and now with is doing here on the road this must be blowout week in ACC play as teams are starting to separate themselves we talked about that top five gunning for that double Buy in the ACC tournament well well get a timeout here Balls going to stay with the Mustangs who are in control the lead 32 in South d Music Music Music its a lot like with a basketball whats going to happen until the music stop theyll have to take their basketball go to Ling their basketball and grab a last one is eliminated we go one by one until theres one left I time toet your cont from football team we have freshman fresman offive Music all sore and last sore are you guys ready Music Music Music that is M TV give the ball are you kidding meum in Dallas we talked with Andy infield about that how important it was to get that four seed and he started with well Ive never been to ACC tournament before which was not true because he was in Florida Florida State but he wasnt the head coach but then when you consider he talked about is there an advantage to having that game before and of course he would love to have that double bu if they could get it yep but and he had that loable times when he was the head coach at USC yeah but when you consider being there and having that game beforehand to be able to get some rhythm going coach you coach all the time do you feel like that helps you I think its a big because there theres not that much difference between that team that Nick game and that game gives you a little momentum as it did in football this year with the teams that played the first game all won I think but Ill tell you one thing we have say Matt cross has really improved as a basketball player he is a complete player he defends he rebounds he hes a good passer and obviously he scores but hes really turned himself into a really good all round basketball player not just just a shooter when he started but that can tell that shows you what confidence does came to the ACC course Miami first then Del Lis but then going to UMass going down a level and playing minutes averaging over 15 points per game and rounding out his game has allowed him to be able to come back here as a veteran and help this team and some guys just take longer and just thats just the way it is some guys can play right away second year third year maybe but sometimes it takes even longer Logan Im who had only two points in conference play When the night began has now got four tonight correct me if Im wrong Im started some games last year Logan IM did average 17 minutes of ball game in ACC play and so when when Michel Shrewsberry goes to the bench hes got a number of guys that bed them good minutes a year ago they havent got much much reps this year but for the most part eyes and rooper kesn they have a number of guys who played heavy minutes for them a season ago yep I agree with you on that front Imes has seen his play he average 17 minutes in League game last year about five this year Garett sundra played briefly in the first half hes back out there good experience for the Freshman heres Burton kick out for Roper and Marcus Oh Long bounce pass they try and skip it to Ser of five to shoot for the Freshman now heres Roper shot clock winding down triple away and good 6 three of the year for Julian Roper the second they saved it with a really really good defense again from SMU thats been the story to me in this game and know they going back to the Zone defensively with a smaller lineup cross the three bounds Away rebounded by Chuck Harris Baseline this is Ambrose Hilton scoring first field goal for the senior from Toronto started his college career at Alabama actually transferred to Alabama from South Alabama this is his third school as well Brandy infield here in year one Sera missed everything under 10 to play now in the Mustangs again on the attack seemed like thats been a common refrain tonight for us huh well you know we got to give Mustangs a lot of credit they havent let up at all nope in the second half even though know has been able to get a little more going on the offensive end of the floor it hasnt slowed the Mustangs down at all but you still have the net to consider and the bigger you win by the more that benefits you in the net sura 73 of the Year by the way the three by BJ Edwards Cory was his first in his last 16 tries a moment ago well I believe that uh theres going to be a number of first because SMU has been able to get everything going but we know it wont be the first time because theyve scored over 105 times this year if they get there it wont be the first time for that 117 on the road yep at Miami heres Roper another three nope slapped out fresh 20 for the Irish and now we got a whistle and a foul so we get substitutions quick reminder to you that Saturday we got a triple header for you on acc Network food line presents Georgia Tech at B College how about Nate George in the jackets beheim 400 Clemson at SMU and then Virginia Tech at Miami at 6 George might be the most improved player in the league this year I think he will absolutely be in hes right there I mean he has just really surprised me where he was early and where he is now shoot hes playing great basketball Ill tell you what Im going to put you boys on the clock because two weeks from tonight were going to be at Louisville for Cal and the Cardinals at the Yum Center Id like to see some ballots from you guys on Player of the Year Rookie of the Year most improved coach of the year no problem Cory you up for that well I Im going toist I want to see beams list first thats not fair you just want to youre just like the guy that said behind me in school copy my work I tell you what although there never was anybody I about to say you know you have been a great coach for 47 years Hall of Famer my man but Im not giving you Hall of Fame student no trust me nobody looked at my paper nobody it it be hard to get the records from Lions New York too by the way just heres Chuck Harris at the line on the foul against Marcus Burton 843 to go and the lead is 32 tonight for the Mustangs I think itd be good two weeks from tonight we uh kind of do that we can do that all in all right good thats what I like to hear team were going to venos louville and were going to have great food and then were going to figure out whos on all the all right well do that theres Tay Davis and both teams interesting to see snu going with some full court pressure on them after the free throw yeah why 818 to go you got Chuck Harris BJ Edwards samat yigu is coming to game theres Tibet gorner fellow Turkish player and theres a three for caroa quindo thatll give him an ACC High theyre a little easier when youre up 30 that is 23 now for aenda he had 21 against Virginia in December and theres Davis and an n one on a qu so coach coming into this game this very well could have been my most improved player Tay Davis but you got to think of the job as yous done holding him in check tonight the Mustang with a Music Im here my hold years old Im you Bo my whole life Music Applause a Kio o quendo and car o quindo who normally does his damage from Beyond a threepoint Arc has scored in so many different ways a nice drop off from Edwards to Endo to get his first basket of the game and he has not slowed down ever since nope season High tonight 23 10 off his career high when he was a Georgia Bulldog at Texas AM at 33 one night on Buzz Williams its hard to get that Im surprised Buzz didnt went out there and Tackle him Buzz doesnt like that Davis Davis missed the n one opportunity out of the timeout B Smith the stop 10 second count on the Irish great call by my man Bert Smith who I still got to I got to find a way to talk negative about Bert Berts my Gody Bert text me the other day because I was talking about Mark snur being my my uh American Airlines whats the name of the americ adal Club okay was but it was actually B that got us in so you know I gave I gave the wrong official credit for that WD wow Shrewsberry a three Id like to start talking good about the officials but Im not going to lie on team well we we know youre not right over the top they could get they had a layup opportunity that they missed on that one surprised they didnt see the biggest guy on the floor wide open under the basket Chuck Harris short on a three you told ran right to the basket WD no was there yep heres a loo into the front court now SMU been in control the night from the jump here kesn a hard dribble laku thought about it and turned it over couldnt get rid of the ball to Davis Harris in the Mustangs lob and layup aindo fouled the third time in this half alone aindo has been out on a laob attempt and its going to be on bra Shrewsberry to be his second its the ninth on uh Notre Music Dame this is the first time a quendo didnt go to the floor he really should have finished that one that should be a and One Missed The Point Blank layup so quendo keeps adding to his total thats now 24 in the ball game hes 8 of 10 from the floor by the way they get booby back and hes playing coin quendo coming off the bench theyre going to have a heck of a thats going to improve their team b game on Saturday boy Millers back for Clemson y pretty good atmosphere at Moody Coliseum its a tough spot in the road anyway theres Shrewsberry kicking for a Locka 11 to shoot for the Irish Davis away for kesn pull up jumper good for JR kesn thats the shot I think they could have gotten tonight instead of trying to get all the way you look at the SM losses guys in all honesty Andy enfields got a little bit of a point for his litigation on postseason here and that ball last touch will stay with SMU their conference losses are Duke Louisville Wake Forest and the road to Chapel Hill again theyve lost to some of the top teams but North Carolina can make that same argument when you look at the tar Hills think about the teams theyve lost to throughout this year Kansas all well their list is like and National and the reality behind it is you got to beat some of those team I mean I not just playing yeah not just bling you got to actually beat some of those teams in order to truly get that consideration it was a hard drive by Edwards and yigu recovers cant finish Davis still scraps inside for the rebound I love the fact that the Irish are still fighting thats the one thing you love to see as they continue to turn the basketball over which has been a problem throughout this game Edwards went for the dunk Davis the foul second on tay Davis 10 on not to name but two free throws anyway for BJ Edwards with 544 to go and BJ Edwards is slow to his feet Im shocked that they just as you see it they are going to go look at it I was a little shocked that B Smith Tomy Mory and Eric Lewis didnt decide to go look at this only because you got a vulnerable player in midair previous players under review for the action on the drive hard foul which is a flagrant one and its its more so about the result when youve got Edwards unable to get up after the play right and then hes when you go off of one foot youre now vulnerable when you hit that player in midair youre attacking in a vulnerable position theyre seeing if theres a wind up thats one of the things you look for and there is a wind up but it really doesnt make contact so I dont think thatll come into play but going after a vulnerable player I believe that could end up upgrading this to a flagrant one yeah its its close play on the ball is what after review the player is going to stand so there you go common foul so the play on the ball call is going to stand as it was on the floor two shot fou there we go thank you B yeah I like that I think that I think thats the right route to go but when you look at it it is a vulnerable player in midair and the result often times is what makes it a flagrant one but Edward is able to bounce back up relatively quickly I think we can also say too he was trying to make the play on the ball he did not but nonetheless he did not take him out of the air it was a collision in the air well and there was no with there was a wind up but there was no contact from the hand okay or the or the upper body the contact was down low BJ Edwards who had a dozen on Saturday against W Forest has got seven tonight missed the front end and just like every Co college basketball arena in the country if he misses here somebody wins something but he doesnt Marcus Burton has two points right in this game and no real opportunities that he had that he passed up he just hasnt been aggressive and got too far in the lane and too many turn and youre talking about a young man 10 of his last 12 games has gone over 20 32 a career high for him at Boston College in overtime game so when you see him struggle the way that they have Coach Im with you you got to give smus defense tremendous amount of credit y there goes yigu he scores with the right hand hes going to be good 14point night for C coach y hes going to get better I think hes pretty good now too though yeah hes no hes pretty well hes 20 years old not fresh not a normal freshman it might be more than that foul line Burton lost it heres gorer wide opening transition he saved it to the other team and then went into the front row and numbers for noted a and one on the yugu foul Sandra straight up three out of the corner and thats the second on SE and the second threepoint field goal for jar sundra in this game knocks down the corner three the contact opportunity for the fourpoint play and this comes off of a noted aim turnover SMU turns it right back over and has an advantage saving the basketball back in bounds allowing the fighting IRS to get out in transition and SRA able to knock down the big three out of the corner so yigu and cross are going to come out of the game and we get our second look at yoan tror from France back on the floor for SMU as sundra goes to the line and completes the fourpoint play the rare fourpoint trip so heres a silver lining out of what has been a dark clouded day for the fighting IRS this line up with sundra at the five and playing Zone uhoh oh for yeah fortunate right there for Burton he didnt flip over the top TR may have found something coach you know its hard to tell in this game when youre down this much uh you know hes got his his starting line and theyre the guys that have to get it back going but heres the thing how many times are they going to play against a big like e to throughout the ACC its not a lot of them so often times you can put a guy like gundra at the five position play the small lineup play The Zone but he his ability to be able to shoot the three can give them an advantage on the offensive end Martin Burton if Burton isnt scoring theyre going to theyre not going to even be close he needs to get 20 for them to be in the game Burton has as Jim MTH and Cory talked about only two in the first half his career low is six from December of 2023 his season low is 15 and theres a three by Shrewsberry hes got 21 now in the ball game thats his fifth three of the night and an ACC season high and theres sundra laying it in sras giv shuber good minutes I think they found something with the young fell coming in playing him at the five position and making things happen not only offensively but defensively as well its down to 25 but I believe its been a positive second half for Michael s i for the last time I got to ask you to put the down because for the P to go please welcome your Music br Music Music 6 Music Music Applause Music back here in South Bend is TOC gner and the Mustangs as we go inside a four minutes to Music play five to shoot not sure they know they dont even know tror and did they get it away in time they did and were going to whistling a foul off the ball and its going to be on Jerel cobbert of SMU thatll get us to a timeout well continue from South B after this Music get Music Music Music Music Music you Music Music Music dude thanks Taylor you bet Arya massudi Eric Dorth didnt ready to bring bring you that from the tucko uh Marcus Freemans here no truth to the rumor hell ask baheim later for tips on football huh hes a big fan he is he you are a big football fan thats the thing hes done a great job here Ill tell you what unbelievable this is a tough place to coach football you either win and get win it all or get the final four orange and the Irish play next year out here yeah youll be coming to that Ive never been here thats what Im saying hey wild hack beam needs to get in the mix on that trip I agree now heres the question I have to come to South Bend again right yeah oh okay is it Touchdown Jesus or is the field goal Jesus which one its most know its Jesus its touchdown okay theres the drive and gner foul so with 332 to go SMU is on the way to just their sixth ever win against uh there is thats a that that is a beautiful set thats a live shot by the way for you and now Im not going to see on a cold night that Notre Dame is my favorite place in AC to visit but that look right there is absolutely a spot if not of Karen be completely honest you know she takes some great care so outside of that its not my favorite place B on second free throw is good what w what was Cory saying about coming to Notre Dame he loves coming no I got two rules he did not say I got two rules one the heat should be on it should not be 8° outside and secondly I cant park all the way across baseball parking lot like the 80year old man I tried to fight for you Mohamed on the bucket sir mohamd now has got six one off of his season high in the ACC against Louisville W said its no problem were just parking on the baseball field you know how far that baseball field is from here its a long ways coach I tried to fight for you but the Double Trouble Sid combination of Josh and allly they did not help they did not help at all and again and now allly thinks Im high maintenance you are but Ive been coming here for 12 years and Ive never parked at the base Stadium unbeli 12 years youre a rookie 12 years 40 yeah foul on Serta you Ain comeing here for 40 come on which which brings me kind of back to where I was before we got into the parking scenario tonight for you fellas um you forgot SMU is on on the verge of beating Notre Dame for just the second time the other time that they beat Notre Dame was in a second round NCAA game in March of 198 8 in the dean dome in Chapel Hill 8375 Dave blisss team went 28 and7 that year in the in Southwest confence remember 1988 so dont bring it up here now and by the way SMU bring this up Im not buying dinner like I SMU Advanced to play Rhode Island okay because I wonder who they beat I I cant remember that game rebound here the Mustangs what happens when your friends are with you know what with friends like us who needs enemies right coach thats exactly right well let me say this when uh SMU beat uh when SMU beat Notre Dame they Advanced to play Duke as the seven seed the Mustangs lost to the Blue Devils 94 to 79 the other side of the bracket Duke would then go on to play Road Island they were a great Tom penders with Tom Garrick remember those guys the ramso mo Cino Moy was Ono Mo was not on that Teo Mos younger than me he was not a 19 told me he was on that team today no I asked oh Casino Moy was in 1997 or somewhere around there all right but heres the deal he was thinking about going there is that RH Island Rhode Island pet Syracuse yeah got it yeah it took us a while to get there you already figured that check any excuses I will I will say this by the record you came here A bunch of times and you posted 11 wins here and thats a lot more than most people you got did you get wins against Digger oh yeah you beat Digger oh wait wait Lee torbin has already told me not only did you win here 11 you won 15 times here Jim oh thats I thats what I thought but you told me 11 I believe by the way you beat Digger you were 3 and0 here an 0 and two it to car but they talked about that earlier today WD they said they only won on each others home court WI a home gameer remember he barely remembered it but he did and a foul away jump shot is good for trayor and he has responded nicely to his return to the lineup here tonight absolutely has and now SMU with 97 points only three away from scoring 100 points for a six time this yeah and theres the drive by Imes Logan IM the basket noted aim on the verge of trying to theyre trying to keep SMU for aund from a 100 its been 12 years since theyve allowed 100 points in this building the last time in regulation was 1990 is that a five over five overtimes against Louisville in 2013 was the last time they allowed 100 thats like bam not letting me go to sleep way back that was one of the great games East tournament six overtime game with my man dvo whos going to be on the next game calling it making big shots down the stretch he made a shot at the buzzer that we thought won the game and now hes Im hes glad that he didnt because we had we made history instead of winning the game by the way the great temper Ray told me that smus win in Chapel Hill was also David Rivers last game for Digger Phelps tell you what David Rivers was pretty good David Rivers was a all the best players in Europe MVP in the European Euro league a couple oh smus not going to get to 100 nope doesnt look like theyre going to hold it on the last possession sundra by the way draws the foul from trayor hes trying to score whos that that will be Lono Ellis on his way out the door um by the way the Mustangs will win by 25 tonight be the second time itll be three Road WIS by 25 or more tonight second most in ACC play in conference history dukee has four this year Louisville had four in 201819 Virginia had four 25point Road wins in 2001 2002 or they all had three rather all of these have three its not 25 yet all right quick question bigger celebrity in this Arena okay lonso Ellis or digger ferel I had to say that cuz Digger would be mad Id say Marcus Freeman trumps all you going with Marcus Freeman I would okay look at Sun I didnt have that option I didnt give you that option Wes is cre own we got a hand injury across the way you see thats why yeah Nixon Dilan the fifth year trainer of the Irish who by the way spent 14 years in the NBA before coming here to South Bend to be the head athletic trainer for mens basketball taking care of Cole Serta 24 points they didnt might not get the 25 yep NOP theyre not going to theyre going to hold the ball Andy infield going to walk in front court and thatll do it youre right coach so disregard that 25o information I gave you a moment ago and disregard the Rhode Island thing too I dont want to remember I will I will thank you thanks for bringing it up well smus going to win 20 for the second year in a row go to 11 and four in leak sets up a big Saturday against Clemson Fells it absolutely does big weekend coming up with the Mustang opportunity for a quad one 977
