Music thank you Music and we are ready for basketball beatness PJ Hall and we are underway the tigers with the basketball first a Clemson team coming in with an 186 overall record 103 in League Play and Corey they are back to full strength and a full roster and Brad Rondo told us this week is the first time theyve an opportunity for everyone to pay the presidents early in the preseason and happy to have a full compliment played 11 players last weekend against Miami Court of Caleb love RJ Davis there is Armando bacon who called out his teammates following their loss on Tuesday at Wake Forest and all eyes are on this Carolina team to see how they will respond absolutely and this is the time North Carolina really has to take off if they are going to have a chance as Caleb love is fouled on the jumper by Brevin Galloway if North Carolinas going to have a chance to repeat the similar success that they had a year ago this is the time now where they have to start making a move back toward the top of the ACC well the connective tissue of this Tar Heels team is what you wonder about a junior from St Louis out of Christian Brothers College High School averages 16 and a half points per game that is six best in the ACC ENT throughout the afternoon Applause Applause yeah and for those of you on ESPN2 welcome to the dean E Smith Center in Chapel Hill North Carolina we are just underway we Corey Alexander and Angel gray Im Doug Sherman the Tar Heels scored the first two points with a pair of Caleb love free throws and we just had TJ Hall answered with the layout for the Tigers and RJ Davis misfired from the top of the key this is Corey what Joey Brackett says is the most impactful game of the day in the entire country and the reason being is because youve got two teams still hovering right above the bubble at the North Carolina a loss would take them out of Joy brackets field tuned in being here in Chapel Chapel pumped and they understood what that defensive stand there meant as an indication about this team right now at the other end after pass by leaky blast Nance missed Fires fight for the rebound comes to shepman but if youre North Carolina you like that possession because you play inside out all Mondo bacon to put his hands on the basketball and make a play for his teammates Banks it in for three and shrugs his shoulders into Michael Jordan Way well Im not sure if this is the place where thats going to be appreciated Applause hes got all five Clemson points on the 610 Junior from Spartanburg South Carolina and they go to Bay County Immediate double team with Chase Hunter coming down good defense by the Tigers forcing the turnover Davis was on the sideline and there is Huber Davis in year number two at his alma mater of course the preseason pick in the ACC and in the entire country but at this point having lost three in a row Corey some of the numbers during that threegame losing streak to me illustrate some of their issues on offense 77 made field goals on the 27 assists thats about 35 percent and as a way to the way to care last year when they won five in a row in the NCAA tournament they were assisting on over 50 percent of their Mayfield that is a portion of it but I think more of it has to do with the fact that theyre not defending at the same level that they have in the past and that is the biggest issue for the fields otter Tyson with the steal out to chase Hunter defensively the heels get back oh decides not to bank that one in and that glances immediately to somebody in the front row well PJ Hall was set on shooting that one in the first place simply to show that him making the one off the glass is no fluke he is a threepoint shooter hes made one in his last four games 36 on the year and love is followed by Chapman trying to cut him off at the pass in more conventional manner PJ Hall stepping back off the pick and pop action knocking down the three ball and then just a quick glance over to the crowd to let him so oh oh yeah this is no fluke Im here for real AJ Hall in the midst of a good year for this Clemson team that came into the day in a threeway tie for First Place Pittsburgh has already won today at Florida State so the Tigers try to keep Pace Caleb loves steps in and draws the charge play early for you already in the Atlantic Coast Conference Brad Brownell reading in his 13th year with the Titans and Brad Brownell was prepared he knew that this building was going to be electric today he knows that the North Carolina faithful are going to try their best to get their team moving back into winning Direction and he has talked to his team a lot about that over this past week back in January of 2020 he left his team into this building and won for the first time in 5910 Chapel Hill and he did tell us before the game today the net effort Antonios draw within four but that was a concern for brown Brownell finishing defensive possessions on the offensive glass we know much won the best offensive rebounders in college basketball thats on Xbox one as well as leaky black for the putback its an 82 Clemson run Paul has been a big part of that misses on the turnaround and here comes RJ Davis to Junior from White Plains New York and they go bacon draws a Crowd Goes early in this game you can see the concerted effort by the Tar Heels to get the basketball into the hands of Armando Bangkok allow him to make plays for himself and his teammates playing inside out while on the entry pass goes against with that bucket now into 19th Place on the alltime scoring list in the history of UNC hoops we have a great one on our hands at this point but Clemson Tigers have the twopoint Edge hello Im Angel gray the Tar Heels were picked as the preseason favors but right now theyre battling their way out of the middle of the pack Armando baycott and his fellow veterans were visibly upset after Wake Forest loss so he took some time to discuss how they reset and why he chose to come back Id want to win thats why I came back I want to win and the coaches didnt want to win like I told me and Caleb RJ and leaky like we came back for a reason and this now this isnt it but the thing about it is now is our backers against the wall so like I told everybody people that want to play B here on Thursday so strong words from one of the alltime great North Carolina Tar Heels and from what we can glean it seems to have found the mark his message has gotten through to this point I believe its gone through to this point but one of the things about Armando baycat he loves the University of North Carolina so when you consider the fact that he came back he won a state Championship as a sophomore and attorney Episcopal School he won a peace Jam title after him before his senior year with Team Takeover he won a national title in high school at IMG last year getting a taste of winning a national championship in college basketball thats why hes back here he loves this University and hes here to win a National Championship and right now his team is on the bubble of not even getting a chance to be in the dance so they have to make changes ASAP coming into the day Carolina as the shot clock goes off its another forced turnover by the hill Carolina was the last team in the field of 68 so every game matters for Armando bacon and the heels but again he put on a marvelous performance especially in the NCAA tournament run last year and it really means a lot to him to try and get back to the not just the big dance but the final four and try to win it all thats why they ran it back this year now there are parallels between last year that they were muddling along in January and February last year and then turned it around but is a parallel this year Fair under these circumstances Corey I dont believe its fair because of a different team but the fact that you have those four core guys back in RJ Davis Caleb love Armando and leaky black thats where the parallels are drawn because you expect for those guys in another year to be even better than they were a year before Pete Nance of course has been inconsistent at times and hes not Brady mannequin Brady man who was so important for that team a year ago and spring continues to be a question first Clemson player under the PJ Hall to score 106 tigers and Brad Brownell extremely happy to have Chase Hunter back in the lineup missed three games with the injury to his foot but playing very good basketball back in the lineup now as the leader at the point guard position Galloway back after the half Alex Hemingway back from the corner Applause give the assistant DeMarco coming off the bench black with Five Points early for the heel and thats leaky black spot you find him in the corner normally he is going to take care of business he loves to shoot the quarter three other things he beats the post Tyson comes in as on Pace for First Team all ACC maybe player of the year but he has yet to score and Hunter Tyson who leaves the ACC in defensive rebound comes up with a big offensive rebound allowing Chase Hunter to get to the basket and I believe thats going to be the first on Bangkok Music DeMarco done Music Shannon Chase Hunter to the free throw line measure Junior from Atlanta his older brother Jaden played linebacker for two years in Georgias fourth season in Western Kentucky with a win over South Alabama to go in the New Orleans Bowl you asked coach Brownell before the game today how are you going to manage the fact that hey now youve got a full roster can you play 10 11 players keep them all happy and be effective as well as you can be and of course coach Brownell told us it a lot of it has to do with the flow of the game you know depending upon how the game goes they played 11 players against Miami a week ago I dont expect to see his rotation go as many as 11 I think 10 will get in the game but its difficult to play 11 players at this stage of the year I mean of course the Lesser Leonard Hamilton and Florida State whos been doing it forever but outside of that is difficult to do that and for everyone to be able to come out and be productive there you see Dylan hunter in the game Alex Hemingway as well coach said Hemingway is the only tiger still restricted in terms of minutes for the training staff and the coaching staff will keep an eye on him but hes a floor spacer who Clemson desperately needs caught Johnson into the game for Carolina beats Jalen Washington the promising freshman thats him you see why hes so promising Huber Davis a year ago before David Washington ever stepped foot on campus here at University of North Carolina said he was the best shooting big man in the class a season ago unfortunate for North Carolina that he chose to come to Chapel Hill and Hunter Tyson now a member of the 1000 Point Club in his fifth season for the Tigers and these are the type of games that Hunter Tyson really gears up for you can see he has the level of energy stepping up taking on the challenge of guarding leaky black but he has been focused and locked in ever since earlier warmups just paying attention to his body language Applause Clemson shot clock down to five tough shot of the turnaround by Dunn offensive rebound for black here goes love tough shot and he was following Dylan Hunt around the show good timeout Clemson up four here in Chapel Hill Music on any weekend welcome back that was our Wendys wooden watch with Armando baycott and we get a double dose of the family because Im here with his mom right now with Christy Lomax Christy the last time we saw you you were rehabbing with your son you were doing your knee he was doing his ankle we talked about how you knew right away that he had that dog in him now we want to talk about his leadership very early on what did you see in that aspect its been very confident in himself and what he likes to do so I mean leadership came really easy for him it was really something and that has just been in him since he was born and we saw that as well after the last game he said we have to be better and challenge his team as far as his love for this University his decision to even come back and play what was the discussion with him in order for that to happen so I mean going to the final four was a huge accomplishment a dream of his and then going to the championship um was just you know the the icing on the cake so not winning for him was something and a goal that he wants and something he wants to achieve so that took a big part in his decision making to come back and go for a national championship and you know we cannot let you leave because youre one of the best storytellers of all time as far as something that we could share on the broadcast about how special he is in every aspect of the game probably not just on the court but off the court as well what would that be hes always like I said been the person that is an actions person um talk lets do more so you know whether it was with our family as a whole our goal that we said where hes like look this is what we need to do Im on board either you guys roll or dont so its not surprising that he takes that type of attitude and its always a love its always a motivation and encouragement because you got to do what you got to do so that thats something thats just again been in him forever Christy thank you so much for your time thank you guys you got to do what you got to do I think we can learn from that as well No Doubt Sage advice and her sons team has pulled back to within a point and Corey behind the bacon was put together one of the alltime great careers in uncs story history the alltime rebounding team top 20 in scoring led the team to the national title game last year and still there is plenty of time this year to make some sort of noise going towards March it absolutely is that when you consider what the Legacy he will lead as we see Jana Washington with the Finish DeMarco Gunn making a nice play looking out for his teammate and of course Armando baycott searing on his guys its simply about winning more important than having his jersey in the Raptors more important than being ACC player of the year he prefer to win Hemingway Banks went home thats the second Clemson jump shot off window and in today with that you know he came so close to having his jersey forever hanging in the rafters in four different ways last year walks back to Mid Court hes got six and the heels up two and youve got to love the response from love early in this game Caleb love of course part of all the noise thats been happening off the floor for the Tar Heels and you like the way Caleb has come out and approached this game to start it off getting to the freethrow line but also sharing the basketball and knocking down to three and he was so good last years NCAA tournament as well averaging nearly 19 points on the run to the title game off the air ball Here Comes Clemson heavenway wide open well short Hemingway makes about 50 percent of his threes he wont have many more open than that one love 43 for number two in life foreign Applause Music Caleb not once but twice back to back threes as the hills take a fivepoint lead Music number eight Virginia hosts Kyle filipowski and Duke the other big game in the ACC as Virginia tries to keep pace with both Clemson and a Pittsburgh team thats knocked off Florida State earlier this afternoon along with Corey Alexander and Angel gray Im Doug Sherman this building is jumping and that man mantle of it you remember he put he put 30 on UCLA last March he put 28 on Duke in the National semi final including 22 in the second half game winning three when he gets cooking hes as good as most anybody absolutely and thats one thing that Brad Brownell talked to us about in the pregame was hey we cannot allow Caleb love to see easy looks early and get going and start building that confidence because if he does he will burn you and you look at Caleb Loves threepoint shooting month by month February up to 37 percent hes shooting better and today two or three already from Beyond the arm Obama here only 29 percent what do you make of that Corey is PJ Hall is now into double figures with that bucket well I can tell you that when you watch Caleb Love play oftentimes you see him taking difficult shots and thats part of the reason why his percentage is has been down but you know hes a career 36 field goal shooter so he doesnt shoot a great percentage from the field and but hes always taking tough shots when he keeps the game simple he is very difficult to defend regard offense on the court for North Carolina with the president Seth Trimble out there five on the shot clock Davis turns six corners got to the basket and he was final Applause good and one thing that makes North Carolina a better offensive team also Doug is when Caleb love and RJ Davis are attacking the basket when theyre not solely relying on their jump shots and attack the basket of course they can have their opportunities but they also can make plays for their teammates and put so much more pressure on the defense personal foul on PJ Hall sends the accs best free throw shooter to the line this was pregame Davis and love who have done their best on social media a couple of days ago to watch any of the rumors that are going on around there that theres any sort of disharmony between the two and now love draws a big Ovation as he heads to the bench hes been replaced by dontrez style sophomore from Kinston North Carolina and one of the things that weve watched Huber Davis do as this seasons gone along he has extended his rotation playing more guys he did earlier in the year Applause toward North Carolina and the reason for that is to be able to apply defensive pressure on the opponents driving Galloway back into the game for Clemson hes got the basketball the fifth year senior from Anderson South Carolina is a homecoming going back to Clemson 70 Applause right there with him of course leaky black with a block shot Here Comes leaking going end to end and he is denied up to the rim to say no way now the block shot is Chase hunt hes like absolutely leaky is one of the accs best defenders however not so fast Applause Kansas on the road Oklahoma they were down 70 and since then its been all Jayhawks its gotten close ish at times but 24 points off turnovers 44 in the paid 17 in transition also good to get DeJuan Harris scored that was a lot in a very short period of time thanks so much and heres a look at the latest Bracketology from Joe lunardi and the reigning Champs from Kansas looking to get back up to the one line certainly going to get that win today against the Sooners or at least it looks like right now and I found it interesting I heard Joey brackets last night Corey talking about Virginia which is right now a number three seed on Bracketology is the top seeded ACC team and he was asked what if Virginia wins out could the Cavaliers move up and he said no he said this is probably their ceiling this year well and the reason for that is because Virginia plays in one of the best conferences in the country when you think about the fact that the ACC has so much competition from top to bottom when you think about this league youve got 12 teams who are competing nine of those teams in the NCAA net top 70 so you look at what has happened in the ACC this season go back and think about North Carolina preseason number one even everything that happened for them in the nonconference they still have multiple wins over Big Ten teams so you think about everything thats going on from top to bottom in this league Virginia right now is one of the three teams at the top of what I still consider to be the best league in the country PJ Hall having himself a big afternoon for the Tigers lets go back to Angel guys we were just talking about the depth of this legal how about seven players in this league that are on the Oscar Robertson award midseason watch list Ill take it even further there are three players on this floor right now that are on that list with Hunter Tyson from Clemson you also have Armando baycott and Caleb love for UNC so when youre looking at what makes Oscar Robinson The Big O him its because he was able to do so many things so well so when youre looking at those three players one player stands out for you about how balanced they can be I will go with the guy that just got second offensive rebound and the bucket on that possession Angel and that would be one Armando Bangkok who still even though North Carolina has not been great this season is still my favorite right now for ACC player of the year when North Carolina has not had success oftentimes has been because bacon either hasnt been in the game or he has not gotten his opportunities with the basketball in his hands you look at an alltime career ranking first in rebounds in double digit rebound games as well as double doubles in North Carolina history and of course Mondo did miss a game early in the year against Virginia Tech because of a shoulder injury as we were talking about with Hubert Davis before the game today at this point of the year everybodys got a rolled ankle a jammed finger nobodys 100 Armando missed the game against Virginia Tech we also rolled his ankle one minute into the game at Virginia so thats pretty much another missed game but the only thing that that hurt or this ankle was his averages its so far the reason why he was the accs leading scorer going into that game traveling violation called against Middlebrooks theres fake not fighting for the rebound hes got another one another way back foul a moment ago was on PJ hall for Clemson hes gone out of the ball game to protect him with those two having Middlebrooks back on the floor Godfrey and Tyson up front under six minutes to go in the half work the ball around from Davis that wasnt just a good offensive possession that was a great offensive possession from North Carolina once again getting the basketball in the hands of Bangkok accepting the double team the same three no one matching up picking up the basketball well thats the first big defensive lapse today that I can think of for the Tar Heels party I would agree theyve been locked in defensively and I know thats something that Huber Davis has talked to his team a lot about is Brownell actually switches it up you talk about PJ Hall in the bench goes to a Zone defensively and when you play zone against North Carolina youve got to count for where number five is whenever a shot goes up Applause Davis up ahead Davis attacks cant get the roll and there is bacon and a whistle and a foul a great offensive possession Armando baycott accepts the double team Pete nedge finds RJ Davis in the corner who makes the extra pass to Caleb love and this time its RJ off the screen stepping up knocking down the three of his own in the backcourt for North Carolina playing great basketball here thus far in the first 15 minutes of this first half Corey that was foul number two on RJ Godfrey so another one of the Clemson bigs with a little bit of foul trouble here late in the first half bakot Applause Mr Isaiah Wong leads number 19 Miami against Mr bacott and these Tar Heels at the Smith Center right where we are and then Marcus Carr number five Texas are in Lubbock to take on Texas Tech both games are over on ESPN and the app not sure anyone is playing better basketball in the ACC right now than Jim lareneggers Miami Hurricanes they have been looked like World beaters as of late all right we always talk about Isaiah 1 but Gordon Miller averaging 15 per game has just brought a different element for this Kanes team that he youre going against all the way to the elite eight they might be better this year and I would agree with everything youre saying however I think its more North had omir whos bought the different element so and thats the best thing about Miami is you can pick a number of different guys we havent even mentioned Nigel pack whos a knockdown shooter so thats the thing about Miami theyre versatile and their explosion now Id say only is very much in the conversation for potentially first team allconfidence agree and again but Jordan Miller is putting up numbers that very few guys have the last two players that have won the ACC Player of the Year award are doing what Jordan Miller is doing right now so youve got to look at him as all ACC performer Isaiah Wong was a preseason all ACC performer I mean again with Jim larenegger the the versatility they have especially on the offensive end of the floor right now is great to see a Colgate here goes Galloway right to the bucket nicely done for number 11 and thats not necessarily Galloways game hes more of a guy who lines It Up From Beyond the threepoint Arc who does his damage so you see him maturing as a basketball player one of nine division one basketball players thats 25 years old the way this is third stop five years at the College of Charleston then last year with Boston College this is now his seventh year as a college student another wide open three ball This Time by shefflin his first point to the day its back to a sixpoint game they give Clips a lot of credit even though North Carolinas had the momentum on their side the Tigers have not run away to high Music Applause comes out seen time and again over the last four years here in Chapel Hill and the problem there for PJ Hall playing with those two fouls he can only be so physical with bacon especially under the glass theres the 87 boards for Bangkok those two got right back by Chase Hunter man I tell you it is a pleasure to watch Chase Hunter play hes so under control this is a guy who really this is the first time hes played the point guard position in college basketball and has taken over extremely well for Brad Brownell yeah hes Distributing top 10 can assisted over four per game theres Galloway with the takeaway muscle Fort well on his way to yet another double double Johnson all alone everybody getting into the lead for the hand foreign Applause number nine for bacon love up ahead that would have been pretty if he could have finished no when you hear the name Nance you would expect foreign of course his father Larry Nance who was a Slam Dunk champion you know also a Clemson Tiger as well as his older brother both those guys are big time dunkers Im surprised Pete didnt put that one in the room Applause is Dan Larry was a tremendous Clemson Tiger as you mentioned weve got a timeout here in Chapel Hill and Caleb love making life easy for puff Johnson in the corner the drumble drive the penetration the kick and the three all good Music Applause lets give the crowd a lot of credit because from the tip they have been involved in this game even before when they got the swag surfing going the correct direction this is often times difficult to do so but theyve been involved well before the tip and knowing how big of a game this is that their team was presented with this afternoon and Caleb love as you saw has been part of that offense and when he gets cooking this team really can put up Points North Carolinas excellent sports information director Steve kerstner hes got an offensive came over during that last time out Corey to point out the fact that with these 40 points that Carolina has scored in addition to the 60 that they scored in the second half last time out of the loss to Wake Forest they scored 100 points in their last two halves and RJ Davis sticking his chin in there and taking another charge but thats a big foul in a number of different ways because not only does that hurt RJ Davis thats the third foul on PJ Hall who has been the majority of the offense four clips and in this first half and not only does that take him off the floor for the remaining 107 it makes him much more tentative in the second half RJ Davis spent a lot of the off season watching videotape of the former Georgia Tech star Jose Alvarado trying to become a better Defender and it has manifested this year he still didnt distribute the assists but Doug when I tell you that this team is different when RJ Davis and Caleb love are attacking the paint in comparison to settling for jump shots and also it gears up their effort on the defensive end Galloway right to the basket for a second time here in the first half the crowd for the moment and the timeout is called well take a break with him and be back to Chapel Hill in 30 seconds getting into the Carolina blue area on the floor has been beneficial for the hills RJ Davis to baycott with a strong finish hey the Wells Fargo active Cash Card earned two percent Katy Frank Tar Heel womens wear off against number 22 NC State at 8 Eastern on acc Network this will be the second game of a womens basketball doubleheader with Syracuse and Florida State Spock with Angel Ray Im Doug Sherman Corey Alexander here this has been a marvelous season so far here in the Triangle for all three womens basketball programs in the ACC I believe its been a tremendous season for ACC womens basketball all together youre talking about clearly the best Conference of the country on the womens basketball side so many teams from top to bottom I know at one point there were six ACC teams ranked I believe that was before a conference play where they start having to fight against each other but still a lot of quality basketball being played in the womens side shot clock at 25 game clock was at 27 so the Tar Heels can essentially hold for a final shot Music uses the bacon screen crosses over finds puff Johnson from the corner with three seconds left can the Tigers get off a good shot its Hunter but tell you what up nine North Carolina has looked everything but a bubble team which they are coming in and this building the Tar Heels are Tyson is the leading defensive rebounder averages close to eight and a half defensive rebounds per game in the ACC hes third nationally on that standpoint so when you think about the better rebounders in the game hunter Tyson along in that mix but its been all about bacon here in the first half lets go over to Angel who moments ago talked to Hubert Davis yes Corey you talked about how this team is different when Caleb and Armando are aggressive offensively calebug and Armando figures but when I talked to Coach he said its not just their energy on the offensive end its defensively what were able to do keeping Clemson in front of them and most importantly our energy and not putting them on the free throw line Clemson only shot two free throws in that first half guys an angel for you as a player you know human nature is when things are going well for you offensively youre locked in a little more defensively and oftentimes when things arent going well offensively youre thinking about your offensive game as we see Caleb love making the basket once again and I believe thats a dimension of his game when hes not settling for jump shots alone but is attacking and trying to get to that Rim he becomes a different player Corey Ill take it back to even not just offensively but leading by example as a leader we mentioned how Armando said we have to be better challenging everyone on the floor if you dont want to do that dont show up on Thursday were seeing a team that is completely different as far as what theyre able to execute on both ends of the floor LED by their vets Caleb love committed that foul and thats absolutely true and what Armando said needed to be said and it certainly seems like his teammates have responded to it they showed up on Thursday for practice and you know coach Davis continues to be very optimistic about the whole thing he said theyve had good practices and he has maintained they have had good practices even throughout some of their struggles this year and that only allows him to know that theyre capable the difference is putting it together in a game situation where youre only going to have five guys who get to play the difference in practice is youve got 10 guys happy because theyre 10 guys on your team that are getting minutes but when youre on the floor in a game only five of your guys can play and oftentimes thats where the chemistry can get messed up some guys feel like they should be playing more than others Etc but right now the chemistry has looked great well theyre only man Davis this year where the Carolina reserves have outscored their opponents reserves but they got a little bit from several different players in that first half coach Davis went five deep off his bench and he said in his press Avail earlier this week he doesnt need any one of them on any specific day to give him anything but collectively he needs something every game out of that group what he needs collectively from collectively from that group is defense he needs for those guys that come off the bench to pick up the defensive energy level then from where it was with the starters and I think he got that from this group today foreign Music by the way has himself yet another double double the 16th of his season and number 65 as a tar heel all time two more points good controls Applause I love the officiating right there by Clarence Armstrong just shaking his head saying theres nothing there because if it had been something it would have been the fourth foul on PJ Hall largest lead of the afternoon with Timeout on the floor pick and roll action to Perfection RJ Davis the pocket pass to baycott the spin the finish and Carolina rolling them all now theres numbers three and three versus quad ones this year and thats the reason why theyre still projected in the field both these teams right now as an 11th seed that will change for someone here this afternoon and this would only be Carolinas second Cottonwood win of the year its hard to believe they have played 911 games as Hall connects on the turnaround and the only one theyve won was against Ohio State a Buckeyes team that is now under 500 but when you consider the fact that of course Michigan coming in you would think that would be a quad one game especially on a neutral floor lost to Alabama in the four overtime game at the PK 85 back in November when North Carolina has a number of quad one opportunities remaining at North Carolina State February the 19th thats going to be a Sunday game I believe and then of course Virginia here on their home floor as well as duke here on their home floor so more opportunities for North Carolina but theyve got to take care of business and not only the quad ones but quad 2 quad 3 as well Applause and Carolina was the number one team in the country coming into the year and since the NCAA field expanded to 64 teams back in 1985 not a single preseason number one is missed the postseason tournament and again if the heels continue to play like they have for the last hour and 20 minutes or so that wont be an issue we asked Huber Davis pregame was he a play caller was he a God that liked to slow his team down call set plays and he said I will if we get scored on you get scored on your punishment is youve got to run what I want you to run and right there and ends up with the third threepoint field goal for RJ Davis RJ Davis is Right index finger has been injured a couple of times this year including most recently in the game against Syracuse but he has made three threes Galloway through the contact earns a trip to the line and I also like the classic Carolina look when love set up Davis for that three Davis after making the shot just like Dean Smith taught him to do back in the day point to the manual man who are very much connected and working in tandem today and because of all the outside noise everything thats been going on regarding this program you know in social media Etc that could be the thing that draws a team together everyone knows that hey what this team did a year ago with RJ Davis and Caleb love playing great basketball together and this may be exactly what they needed to get them back on the same page love rejects the screen finds his partner in crime but an offensive foul with those three personals took the charge dangerous play there by PJ Hall but it works out for him getting possession back for North Carolina of course as it goes on the jumbo trying here no ones going to like it you see PJ Hall turning his body if that one should have gone against Caleb love but BJ Hall forced it not to have picked up his fourth on that possession if youre Clemson how do you get Hunter Tyson going at this end well one of the one of the areas that you can get Hunter Tyson going is to get one to agencys best defenders off of them one of the things that Huber Davis isnt going to allow to happen give leaky black a lot of credit all ACC defensive team a year ago most likely will be back on that team this season and won the best perimeter defenders in the league and is it true that hes still growing hes up to six foot nine so a perimeter Defender who is 690 will tell you if you said that look it up thats not 17 points now for Caleb love the lead is 16 Galloway these other figures give him 10 points and its back to a 14point game okay so if youve got Caleb love defending you or rather excuse me leaky black defending you you cant just throw up your hands what more can they do to get him open look well you can try to run him off some screens that would help but to try to get leaky black off of him before someone to help us Caleb love lets one go but thats a knight has been forgive me afternoon as he knocks down the three ball falling out of bounds into his own teams bench 20 we have seen these in the performances out of Caleb love over the years good defense Again by UNC Here Comes Caroline Davis with a basketball to a streaking Applause foreign against the accs number one team in field goal percentage defense the Tar Heels just keep putting points on the board as Hall and Nash get untangled at the other end a rare Miss today by Caleb love yeah that was a heat check by Caleb love he immediately passed his chest saying my fault on that shot but when you you know we had a rule back in the day but it feels good do it and its good feeling good for Caleb Rose so far and right now I dont mind that shot I dont think Huber Davis will or will Music offensive foul ball from Beyond the yard Applause North Carolina firing on all cylinders offensively in this game Caleb love falling out of bounds is greeted by his own teammates after knocking down the big three and then classic North Carolina basketball fast break leaky black finishing it off back to Chapel Hill Tar Heels filling it right now on an 82 run and weve had a fun slate of mens basketball games this Saturday but let me take you on the other side to the women for the game of the year between the battle of the two undefeateds LSU and the University of South Carolina that game really features a little bit of everything legendary coaches Kim Mulkey Don Stanley and then you even had the reigning Player of the Year in Aaliyah Boston taking on Angel Reese shes had a double double in every single game this season and ziya cook she has been snatching ankles all season so definitely a game that you dont want to miss tomorrow guys angel you are correct arguably the biggest womens basketball game of the season so far this Boston undefeated number one South Carolina Angel Reese undefeated number three LSU coverage begins two Eastern Super Bowl Sunday on ESPN and the app and uh what the Bayou Barbie has done both on and off the floor in Baton Rouge has been nothing short of remarkable under Kim Mulkey it is an epic Clash tomorrow you wont want to miss and I believe that of course Aaliyah Boston last years player of the year will be spectacular as RJ Davis gets out and takes another charge he has been putting his body on the line for the Tar Heels throughout this game but I do believe that throughout that game South Carolina will win I know what youre rooting for because I think South Carolina will win I think they even though out of course legendary coaches on both sides of the floor I believe that South Carolina wins because its on their home court and they have the best coach however I think Angel Reese is going to be the best player on the floor in that game Caleb love having himself a big game setting up Washington back into the game and over the backbound called against leaky black guys well I love this picture as you can see the current Gamecocks head coach Don Staley she better handle then and now than you thats thats fat absolutely that is absolute facts I have asked her for some advice on her work and of course you know I asked our producer Matt Bartley in the truck says not only put that up there but put the goat beside me and over to the right of course Michael Jordan I mean again hey props to LeBron James Im a fan for passing Kareem AbdulJabbar on the alltime scoring list but there could only be one gun and he went to college here so you have to explain what that picture was from Corey that picture was from my guy Fred whitfields worlds greatest pickup game that was in the summer of 1990 97 98 one of those we played I played in it five straight years but Michael Jordan would come to Fred whitfields camp we would play a pickup game so of course in that photo there are you know probably 20 NBA players in the mix so many different guys who would show up to play in the game each and every year it was a staple of the summertime in Greensboro North Carolina a great tradition by Fred of course is now the president of basketball operations for the Charlotte Hornets alongside his good friend and the Goat Michael Jordan well when you asked Don Staley for any tips about her handle what did she tell you that she helps he was coaching when she was playing she was always helpful as a player she was always helpful and again one of the reasons why she is in my opinion the greatest point guard could ever have played to womens game not only because of what the success he had on the floor at the University of Virginia but also with the US Olympic team and part of the reason why shes done coaching the US Lincoln yeah so again LSU South Carolina huge game between undefeated tomorrow after after two oclock over on ESPN Music first winner with Jay billison great little plie there by Jay thats the Auburn Alabama game Auburns up four against number three team in the nation on the ACC Network extra at in the ESPN app you can watch Virginia Tech and Notre Dame Vandy coming off their big win over Tennessee is on the road against Florida that is on SEC network and lets get some hockey in here the best team in League the Boston Bruins taking on Ovechkin and the capitals on ABC drop 342 back to ca and Dougie fresh Allen thanks so much and were enjoying watching the Tar Heels on this end of the floor today they have been led by their big three RJ Davis showing that that right index Banker not giving him a problem today we go back over to Angel because RJ show a little bit of that dog today right Angel oh absolutely I was reading an article about RJ the other day and had Robert taught him how to be a dog on the basketball court is funny too because he finds solids and also being a weasel his mother gave him that nickname when he was a baby and he said it kind of just stuck he said my mom still calls me weasel to this day because they are ferocious animals so hes okay with that he said they might not look like theyre aggressive but they are deep down I dont know about you guys but Ive counted almost four possessions where hes taken a charge hes always stepping up his dad said my challenge to him this morning was to always be aggressive always keep your foot on the gas and weve definitely seen him today guys and little did we know that his dad was of course listening in our production meeting this morning and were all eating breakfast together didnt know that that was RJs dad sitting over there but he gave us a lot of insight and let us know that he was on his way to give RJ a pep talk before the game and we got to give Dad a shout out because the pep talks absolutely worked yeah Robert Davis was a Division II Legend at Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry New York when he scored over 2 000 points so at least on the offensive end he knows what hes trying talking about when he tells his son do this dont do that well the Apple didnt fall far from the tree because RJ can get a bucket no question about it McDonalds AllAmerican out of our fish are stepping back in in the city in New York City wow White Plains north of New York City dont make that mistake dont say stepping X in the city because people in the city will say oh no its not in the city well thats why I rely on you for geography yes and you rely on me for everything else wait a second I got two things this is true youve relied on me this is true from White Plains New York thats just north of New York City so its not considered New York City oh no no no no no okay no no no well you know Im from the south I mean you know you are Im a Virginia guy so you can help me with the DMV out of turn putting something in the wrong contact you let me know and for the record thats cap means its a lot means its a lie so for those who are right but those who are wondering what thats cat means now you know that is not true uh it is Applause Josh Beetle back into the game he had a short run off the bench in the first half for Clemson and a deeper bench now for the Tigers Ben Middlebrooks on the stick back the sophomore from Fort Lauderdale has his first points of the dash and Clemson now having seen its largest deficit of the Season trailing by 20 points at one point in this game now cutting it to 15 and Brad Brownell just imploring his team lets see if we can get this thing into single digits once again before the next time out make a run at it down the stretch but no way Clemsons going to give up on this game this early black the three to shoot back out to RJ Davis rising up Applause Beetle Chaplin Chauncey Wiggins an excellent shooter on the floor but Clemson turns it over with just unforced error Bob Beetle on that possession in a crucial time where you have to be shorthanded with the basketball really no pressure from North Carolina to come up with the turnover its Caleb love sitting on five made threes but weve got an illegal screen against Armando Baker by the way those five made threes hes five of seven Caleb love thats as many as the entire Clemson team and this Clemson team comes in shooting 36 percent from Beyond a threepoint arc on the season North Carolina and really hovering right above 30 percent but its been a reversal of Fortune in this game thus far yeah Carolinas shooting this year is worst in the ACC from Beyond The Arc and 329th in the nation but when Caleb loves shooting it like he does here today its a whole different story bitter books off the nice feed from Chauncey Wiggins and now its time here in Chapel Hill picks it back up down to 13 right now and one of the things that you cant do with the big league is relaxed especially against a team that comes in at 103 in ACC play you know Clemson is a good basketball team and right now North Carolina cannot afford to relax and take their foot off the gas pedal and UC just simple action no help allowing the easy two to cut the game to 13 Applause Music going right from the start today and the big man will have a chance for three seems as though often times North Carolina forgets they have possibly the best player in the ACC used area on their team theyll go through stretches where you forget about Armando baycott he doesnt get the basketball in his hands and you go through these laws and hes scoring droughts Etc smart play right there go back inside allow big cot to touch the basketball its not always going to be for a shot but something normally good is going to happen when he gets his hands on the ball player of the year now with 17 points again he has his 16th double double of the year and Counting with nine and a half minutes on the clock and of course youve seen a lot of ACC basketball as has Angel gray right now who would you say is the ACC player of the year I think its between Applebee and bacon at this point angel Im literally going to say Tyree Appleby as well I mean unbelievable performance Ive seen him in the passing days as well and so Im sorry Im gonna have to tag along with you and put my vote in property I have no problem with Appleby being you know you guys front runner for ACC player of the year I think he has had an awesome year this season but right now youre talking about a team that really is not in the mix with the NCAA tournament theyre in theyre being considered at this point and I believe that Armando baycott in the North Carolina Tar Heels when its all said and done will be in the tournament and a lot of that has more so to do with what he does in the attention that he gathers just by being on the floor yeah at this moment I agree that it could change its certainly not so enough but at this moment Carolina very much on the bubble level were to lose this game they would fall out of the field just like Wake Forest so a lot of basketball still to be played but Im still going with Appleby at this point but make out his neck and neck just behind him Music third foul on RJ Davis sends Chase Hunter to the line one of three tigers and double figures so far today Applause coming up in just about 15 minutes over on ESPN weve got Corys alma mater number eight Virginia hosting the Duke Blue Devils another big game in the ACC here on a February Saturday afternoon fun time of year and what do you see out of the whos and the Blue Devils today of course I have the whos against NC State on Tuesday and no one coming into the game was hotter than Kevin Keiths North Carolina State Wolfpack in Virginia put on an absolute defensive clinic in that game and if Virginia plays defense that way they will be back in the mix thank you this is able to knock down another three balls all must need a basket as the crowd was starting to get a little Restless here with Clemson making Clemson has not trailed very often this year to this degree 1860 lets see how they respond Applause Davis black Johnson loving Bay caught on the floor Paul trying to battle inside to keep the ball out of the hands of bacon who gets it on the double team lets get past a love penetrates hangs off the window now there to clean it up Junior out of Moon Township Pennsylvania has eight points off that Carolina bench Timeout on the floor followed by Clemson from Johnson making his presence fell the last two possessions leaky black the penetration Puck Johnson stepping up knocking down to three and then of course in typical North Carolina fashion Second Chance points on the offensive glass need to see Walter Davis Uncle of Hubert another North Carolina Legend the main reason why Hubert Davis is not only the coach here at the University of North Carolina but also a University of North Carolina as a player following in the footsteps of his uncle and Angel Huber talked to us a bit about his father and him being his biggest hero earlier today tell us more about that yeah absolutely especially since we continue to acknowledge and celebrate Black History Month he said that is the figure that continues please then you shared the story of his father to his team before practice he said with all the noise going around you have to think about whats most important he said his mother died when he was 16 from cancer so his father was left to take care of him and his sister at every turn he was always there always had a Hot Wheel on the table he was at every home game when he was with the Knicks he said for those type of moments we have to show up you have a choice you can either fold or you can show up and this is a team that I think has definitely responded because of that story guys absolutely and weve mentioned outside noise often throughout this game and Huber made it very clear what my father dealt with was real doors thats thats not the play thats the real noise right there what theyve dealt with is nothing nothing that as a team they could not overcome foreign North Carolina with numbers and RJ Davis going to take advantage of it any chance he gets you get numbers like that that is a wide open opportunity to knock down a big three and again a team in the ACC shooting only 31 from three has looked anything but like that team here today all rips the rebound to what away and lays it in this is Ben Clemsons biggest deficit of the Season Hall playing well with his 18 points yeah PJ Hall has given Brad Runner everything that he can in this game the problem as hes been saddled with foul trouble especially geared this second half does a great job defending without fouling on that possession but hes really been the only spark for Clemson throughout this game hunter Tyson just has not been able to get it going give leaky black a lot of credit a lot of credit for that we see PJ Hall trying to save the basketball going down the backcourt and RJ Davis recognizing North Carolina has numbers knocks down a big three Davis now with 17 points love leads all scores with 230 by the way for him during his career the Tar Heels are 193 when he goes for 20year War by Davis Applause Galloway lost his footing here come the Tar Heels love gives it back thank you and 10 team points for the senior from Richmond and another timeout theres nothing finer than the fast break getting out on the break Caleb love no big cats sharing the basketball its running down North Carolina with 80 points here in the D Smithson well by showing you the words of Amanda earlier in the weekend disappointing third loss in a row Tuesday in Wake Forest lost to the Demon Deacons in 9285 it wasnt nearly that close they were down 26 points made a nice push he called out his teammates a group of guys who came together last year to make it all the way to the final for the national title game and of early indication thank Corey his message has gone through and it absolutely has gotten through in it was it just the message that got through to RJ Davis and Caleb love the message went throughout the entire team when you look at leaky black puff Johnson RJ everyone getting involved outside of Caleb love and Armando baycott gossip scored 20 to 55 points so again this has been infectious through the entire team it wasnt about two guys it was about the entire team and Armando baycott has made it very clear he loves the University of North Carolina this young man had an opportunity to put his name in the draft a year ago as you know Runner off the ACC Player of the Year could be playing in the NBA or G league right now decided to come back because he wanted to win a National Championship in this place and therefore right now in order to even get that opportunity North Carolina has to be a better basketball team to make it to the NCAA tournament he even had a chance to dance when they play with the energy and the enthusiasm and the cohesion that we have seen today Applause Id have to say the skys the limit I agree and I think a lot of it has to do with the way they would post the game defensively the game against Wake Forest Wake scored 47 first half points against North Carolina shooting 51 percent for the game and uh Clemson coming into this game nowhere near that type of success a lot of it has to do with being on the home floor but thats something that North Carolina can do on the road as well being shut down in that first half against Wayne stories only 25 it has been all offense for the heels and the starters get a standing ovation Applause another double double this was 17 job well done for the heels but when you look at the reserves coming into the game these guys have been in the game previously this is not their first outside of Tyler nickel this is not the introduction to this game Hubert Davis is going to be looking to this group to continue with the same defensive effort and share the basketball as well again you know when you find yourself 24 points up before 22 remaining you dont look at this as an opportunity to relax hes now coaching up this group because hes going to need some of these guys as this season moves along and we get opportunity to see just with Armando baycott Caleb love and RJ Davis did today combining for 59 points shooting a great percentage very efficient more so than the entire Clemson Tiger team and Brad Brownell has entire starting unit off the floor as well Chase Center Brevin Galloway PJ Hallman double figures but again one of the big story lines coming out of this one is that Hunter Tyson was shut down averaging over 16 points per game he had a threepointer early and that was it on the offensive end to wiggas coming up knocking down to three and thats what he can do I believe hell be very good for Brad Bono moving into the future well they stretch for a guy that can really space the floor on the offensive end heres Jalen Washington bended by Godfrey turns to the Baseline and left it short Music its been ahead of steam it Styles in the air and then the foul comes that will send six foot ten inch sophomore to the line Carolina up by one making a statement this afternoon in the ACC Music Johnson is on its way to a third consecutive loss before they came into the day in a threeway tie first place in the ACC but Pittsburgh won at noon in Tallahassee 8375 so the Panthers have moved ahead coming up over on ESPN in just a few minutes Itll be Virginia and Duke the Cavaliers were the third team in that time if youre Clemson where do you go from here and what do you see from the Tigers as things have gotten a little sideways here in February well you continue to try to build on your Basics and you know the Clemson is about defense their defense first program theyve had great offensive output throughout this year especially from Hunter Tyson unable to get it but Im not sure theyll play against another team that has an individual Defender capable of taking hundreds heises out of the game the way leaky black did in this game so but the problem for Clemson when you look at their quad one opportunities remaining theyre both on the road at NC State which you know will be a rematch from a game where Clemson beat the wolf back on December 30th starting really what has become the role that NC States been on winning nine of their last 11 change but then you go to Virginia at the end of the month and again the only time the Tigers will see the Wahoos this season Tyler nickel had to force it out for the shot clock down antres Styles misses the footbed and again Joe Bernardi said coming into the day for this big matchup it Clemson loses it would then no longer be the automatic qualifier as it stands they would still be if everything goes according to what Joey Bracken still be in the field at the moment but Brad brownells club would drop down into the last four in second well and I can see that being the case but you know when you think about Clemson getting off to a 101 start in the ACC and you look at it the Clemsons beating Pittsburgh you know they beat NC State theyve beaten the number they beaten Duke theyve beaten a number of the highlevel teams already in ACC action they still of course have Virginia theyve got the return game with NC State if youre Brad Brownell and your team gets to 14 ACC wins I cannot imagine how you could possibly be left out of the tournament at 146 and so you know most likely theyre not going to win this game they leave here 104 six games remaining in ACC play they split those three games I strongly believe Clinton has to be an NCAA tournament team yeah two losses in the nonconference are really going to hurt him comes election Sunday at South Carolina and then to Loyola Chicago other than that like you say theyve got a really good recipe but if this goes back to you know me getting on my soapbox games in January February March are more important than games in November and December I think too often leagues teams are judged by what happened in November and December when youre trying to integrate so many new pieces into the puzzle in comparison to games that happened late in the season in conference play with teams know your Tendencies Etc and youre still able to be successful you get 14 wins in the ACC that should be a nobrainer and youre not saying disregard altogether youre just saying teams grow teams evolve teams change right because at the end of the day when you count the the losses you also have to count the wins that Clemson has in the nonconfidence comes up and knocks down a three not his strong suit Brent to see him improving from Beyond the threepoint Armstrong point just to Second made three on the season oh thank you for correcting me Ill find this up Applause I was talking yeah I wasnt paying attention at that point Applause showing the foul call against tall Republic Music one of the leaders for the Tigers trying to make sure his team closes out this game the right way there are Pringles on the line here at the dean Dome thank you no Pringles to be had at the moment that would never root against RJ Godfrey but I am a fan of Pringles yeah its been a long time since Ive had Pringles oh thats thats your fault Im not saying its not but its been a long time done boy everybodys making threes today for the North Carolina time here hopefully being home in the Smith Center was a cyphosaurize for North Carolina this was a way for them to get back on track get a complete reset of course after mono Bay caughts comments after the Wake Forest lost Im sure there was a different level of attention paid to every detail that Huber Davis wanted his team to be involved with in practice throughout this week and it is shown here throughout this game and it wont get any easier for the Tar Heels quick turnaround for their big game Monday night here against the Miami Hurricanes nickel that would have set a new season high for threes in a game and 15 they have matched their season High boy Wiggins does have a nice stroke for the records you were correct it was Justin McCoy so all the great things I said about Seth Trumbull I guess do I have to take those back or I can just leave it out there well I just want to go back to you saying I was correct I didnt need your validation I wasnt talking I was watching okay thats because you werent listening to me you should have been involved in the conversation that is true Mr McCoy with Five Points Off the Bench and even though this is both garbage time when they came in at the four and a half minute Mark for you said theyve got to continue the time City that the starters bought the game they really do because Hubert Davis is going to have to rely on a number of these guys you can think back to the Virginia game with Justin McCoy started the second half against his former team at Virginia as now blue steel will enter the game a number of the WalkOns guys who put in this ref the effort the energy and practice we rarely get an opportunity to see game Action Jackson Watson or Watkins rather Christian or Creighton Libo Beau May is Dewey Ferris out there as well gotta make sure yeah theres Dewey number 34 with the headband and Rob Landrum the shot clock off chances are theyre not going to get a shot up yeah I dont think theyre going to get any looks at it but regardless you get to pull off the warmup you get on the floor you get some game action thats what its all about Applause well good for Matt Kelly the sophomore from Charleston getting his name into the box store crowd wants to walk on to get a shot up cant do it but an impressive performance this afternoon he defensively was special here this afternoon they snapped the threegame losing streak with a 9171 win for Corey Alexander and Angel gray Im Doug Sherman saying so long from Chapel Hill now lets send it to Mark Neely and Fran for Schiller did you know one of Nissans EVS survived the North Pole
