the transfer from duke pit in the road blue Virginia Tech in the home white our officials Roger SS Greg Evans and Kellen Miller we are underway an ACC play on an early December Saturday in blackburg Virginia Tech starts with the basketball and its a turnover on the opening possession this is a hokey team to start the season Perry that averages 21 turnovers per possession thats one in every five well first of all they have new players playing together and the way Mike young likes to play he moves the basketball which means everybodys got to be on the same page because everybodys getting touches there for Virginia Tech they return low and Le it in the back court and theyve provided some consistency and a good start to this season a seven and2 start number 18 in the country going inside the Diaz Graham he loses the handle take a look at the Virginia Tech starters a hokey team shooting under 40 on the season right to the rack how about the Hops Toby lewow opens the scoring leow is a tremendous athlete hes really explosive around the basket and the spacing is really important people that know Mike Youngs teams know that moving the ball Distributing the scoring has always been important part of his offense and they struggled offensively cuz so so many people have to touch so many people have to contribute and the hokes defensively have forced backto back turnovers to start this game Virginia Tech has never had one dominant score Mike young has never had one player that that he just rods him its a team effort offensively and defensively it means everybodys got to contribute everybodys got to be on the same page shoot open for three cant connect see thats a young foul like hes and thats what Young is tell he W what are you doing we need you we need you to use your fouls rebounding the basketball taking charges not trying to get a tie up off the defensive end Pittsburgh has been on the road since November 18th this is their fifth straight road game and theyre off to a slow start three possessions three turnovers but big guys have to understand that its up to the guard to use the screen so many times bigs get called for moveing screen because theyre trying to create the contact thats not their job its the guards job to run the defensive player off of the ball Music Applause screens Virginia Tech gives it right back so both teams of the opening two minutes still trying to find their footing offensively ish legett kicks to Gaz Graham that bounces off the mark no Applause good the wow going right at Diaz Graham hes got all four points in this game wow is really good off the bounce and again his athleticism allows him when he gets in traffic to raise up and finish and pick go goes inside cam Cor in the first basket of the afternoon for the Panthers Pittsburgh plays with both of their post guys interchanging at the high post and running rolling low so they do a lot of post toost passing and feeding an immediate answer El Elijah potit rocks the rim if you want your scoring percentage to go up get easy shots like that and thats exactly what Virginia Tech worked on yesterday in practice potit was a game time decision woke up not feeling great went through practice went through the layup line and he is out there for the hokes yeah he was going to play he was going to play first conference game he was going to play yeah he aint sitting this one out theres the Freshman Tyler Johnson right to the rack for two this is a little bit of a concern for Coach tap because this is the kind of start they got off to the last time and a lot of it has to do with his guards I think really initiating creating shot opportunity for themselves theyre starting off this game trying to set other people up when Leed and low can go get their own baskets the leot on the drive there lost the handle Pittsburghs had six possessions theyve turned it over five times and Virginia Tech is taking advantage an 82 lead for the hokes early good look here wide open leot nothing but the bottom of the net thats what they want Leed and low can go get their basket their shots whenever they want what they try to do is play Within the context of the team and include other people but as the season goes on they will use their maturity to know when they can go on their own and just initiate offense theres Brandon Rex siner the floater Falls Reiner Rex Steiner is really deceiving he comes out trying to get everybody else involved but he is more than capable of stepping up and making baskets a good cut jayen low hes a crafty player of the sophomore guard his dad was a veteran a coach in Houston his stepdad is John Lucas he wears number 15 because of Johns son John Lucas second uh the third uh Ward and uh hes really well trained to really score the basketball open Corner three and Tyler Johnson Cashes in you know Jay sometimes it only takes one time for that ball to go through the basket and all of a sudden you start feeling good about your shooting a Virginia Tech a redot start theyve made six of their first eight shots a team that has been shooting under 40 on the season Diaz Graham tracks it down shoots the three thats Off the Mark keeps it alive though offensive rebound that rolls around doesnt Applause fall that ball deflected so itll stay with Virginia Tech you never know this hoky team was in the midst of a fivegame losing streak a good start well it is because they really get knockdown shot pit getting a great three right there from Leed but Virginia Tech comes right back with really good ball movement and Johnson knocks down to three good start for Virginia attack is restaurant know I think its the dogs at home I know who that is love Music Music Music Music Music Music Happ Music now Mike young in Virginia Tech off to a good start to ACC play a 137 lead in what has been a frustrating season for the hokes head coach he even said in his press conference after Wednesday in his 23 years as a head coach hes never been coaching a team thats in this big of a shooting swum well okay Im going to be a coach for a minute not frustrating yet hes got answers hes got to figure out hes never had a team not be able to shoot the basketball as well as he would like them but hes such a fine coach hes going to figure out a way to get the most out of this team and get the ball going through the basket getting shots like that really will help yeah they have gone inside eight of their 13 points have come in the paint good look there from wesler just rolled off the rim and sometimes when you get hit with situations you havent faced before it causes Poise and and you want to question what youre doing and how youre doing when I talked to him yesterday I said coach its just some answers you got to figure out he said I know he said is any coach really happy right now I said well they all still trying to figure out their ball clubs and I think thats what hes trying to do right now hes a heck of a basketball coach and I think the biggest thing with him is that in his offense everybody shares the basketball and everybodys skill level has to be at a certain level and when thats off it throws things out of whack and we were at their practice yesterday a spirited practice didnt look like a team that had lost five games in a row but theyre facing a ranked team today Pittsburgh not going away a Zack Austin three cuts the lead in half exactly thats what I said he I dont want our fan base to think hes quite frustrated yet hes got hes searching good turnovers wont lower any frustration levels his team against vanderbel on Wednesday night they allowed 28 points off of those turnovers they committed its a short memory of playing good defense after you turn it over and I think its more of the turnovers as well as well going along with the not shooting the ball well that has him a little perplexed Jaylen low for three that rims out no good offensive rebound was in the hands of let it before it was poked away pit is a very good offensive team right now theyve got all Five Guys on the floor to shoot the basketball they ranked 18 in the country right now thats the highest ranking in a decade for a pit team that has been rebuilt under Jeff cable they love to start ACC play with a road Applause win you see the space in Virginia Tech everything they do comes off with dribble hand off a ball screen Jaden Young missfires from three jayen low upping the tempo Austin a lot of contact no call but I think thats the pace Pittsburgh likes to play with wesler with a head of steam and thats a Applause charge wesler is in there to create going to the basket activity around the rim he just got to be smarter when he puts the ball on the floor those are the types of turnovers that really arent necessary that that makes the coach a little frustrating theres Jeff capable year number seven at pit what a job he has done with this program building them back up brought him to the NCAA tournament two years ago and hes got a team that is capable of getting back to the dance this season they have shown that with his seven two start well he comes from a coaching family so his dad was a heck of a coach at older Mion Wake Forest Jeff was really good at DCU in Oklahoma he has really challenged this team and they have answered the call Ish leet knocks that one down to make it a onepoint game see thats what Im saying you know low and legged at any point in time can go one onone but theyre really trying to get the other guys involved and them having an understanding of when to go when to distribute is going to be part of this pits growing situation this year battle for the rebound and its one by Pittsburgh Roger SS makes the call over on that far sideline good back and forth battle early December Saturday at the ACC conference play is underway Applause weve already talked about a lot OK fans lets welcome to the floor your Virginia Tech Hightech Music got we fans one more round of applause for your highs e November 18th and look at the competition two SEC teams two big 10 teams what a stretch incredible schedule incredible effort very disappointed they didnt make the tournament last year doing everything in his power coach cable to make sure this F team gets recognized this year he does not want anybody at the end of the season to point to their nonconference schedule he has went out and challenged this pit team and they have answered in finishing this road stretch in the ACC first conference game of the season here at Castle Coliseum great ball B movement and guo Diaz Graham finishes it off with a slam let me tell you that one possession was Big Time both ways Virginia Tech was determined not to let the guards penetrate they plugged the hole and yet pit was patient enough to wind up getting a good shot offensively up ahead Cummings and its a N9 nothing run for pit over the last four minutes the persistent pitsburgh that pit is playing with offensively right now has got to make coach cap extremely pleased he felt like they panicked a little bit against Mississippi State took some tough shots missed some easy shots but theyre really showing great patience right now even when they were behind Jaden sh contested three and he drills it exactly what the hokes needed their first make in more than four and a half minutes well we talked about shoot at the beginning of the uh game and we talked about his ability to score the basketball with be necessary and hes lived up to that Brandon Cummings cant answer on the other end Midway through this first half tied at 16 in the ACC opener another young player Ben Hammond dispossessed there by Zack Austin Hammond is really important I think to Virginia Tech because he gives them another ball handmer that is really necessary watch shoot right there get a good feed from from Hammond and the key on that play was that she was moving without the basketball a lot of times when guys penetrate everybody just kind of stand still youve got to move to open areas so the driver can find out and make deliveries and get you an easier shot and for Virginia Tech its about finding those offensive possessions where you can cash in and limit those extended droughts and they went four and A2 minutes without scoring during that time pit goes on n nothing run and if you dont score dont turn it over giving up easy baskets at the other end step back three young that falls off the rim no Applause good heres Jaylen low 15 seconds to shoot hes looking for a ball screen right now so he can create something leged in the corner he cant hit it battle for the rebound and a jump ball cam Corin tangled up with Jaden Music shoot Tyler Johson Applause Music Diaz Graham lines up the three cant connect Pittsburghs missed their last five threes Rex Steiner into the lane finds Jaden young Tyler Johnson called for the travel Rex Steiner has to be careful Ive always said this with smaller guard you can penetrate but you cant get too deep where size swallows you up and you cant make the next play Off the Bench into the game delich an instant impact delit is a young man that can step in and score the basketball and he can play either a small forward or or a three or four spot which gives him some versatility heres Migel poti going at cam Corin good defense by the transfer from Florida State ACC fans will remember cam corn from his time in Tallahassee another big transfer portal Gap by Jeff capable in this Panthers program coach capable felt he needs some physicality on his front line and uh hes come in and hes really done um a good job of giving him that and also he can step away from the basket and and score on the perimeter for Rex Steiner in attack mode took on three Panthers and still got it to go and see that time when he drove the basketball he drew he drove it with the idea of being able to score he kept his head up he wasnt driving it trying to pass once he got in the paint Rex Steiner going against Corin and rips it away giving up nine Ines on that matchup good couple of position possessions from Brandon re Steiner getting the hokes back tied up at 18 back and forth we go in the ACC opener here at blackburg is so uncharacteristic for a Mike young coach team you know 15 turnovers per game through eight games well and again I think a lot of it has to do with new players trying to Jael together and again how Mike young runs his offense his offense is run off of sharing the basketball screening cutting and everything and so it takes some continuity to be able to do that not off off the bouns L wow musling it home firing Virginia Tech back in front and hes three for three I think theyve got to get him more looks and utilize him both in isolation and in the post Music Applause area Pittsburgh likes to space the floor so the guards can penetrate and get easy opportunities low a contested look there cam Corin stays with it bounces in in to tie it at 20 crashing the offensive glass right now Virginia Tech does not have an offensive rebound and thats one of the differences in the game pit has done a pretty good job off the offensive glass Johnson down the lane decided to pass it Burham wasnt ready for it and its another turnover and again it goes to what I was saying how Virginia Tech feeds off of assist which means moving the basketball well you see Johnson moving the ball Burnhams not ready for the pass and its a turnover its the turnovers that have been creating the biggest problem I think for Virginia Tech this year no doubt seven turnovers in this first half coming into todays game hokes had a turnover one out of every five possessions and Pittsburgh Cashes in on a 3ish legged puts the Panthers back in front its not just the turnovers its the following possession theyve been prone to giving up a basket after they give it away Burnham trying to fight through traffic Dives on the floor tangled up with Cam Corin jump ball will stay with the hokes thats a jump ball possession goes to your hookies Applause top 10 match up tonight over on ESPN 2 Kentucky taking on Gaga this is the third game of a sixyear series coverage begins 10 Eastern Time on ESPN 2 two of the best teams at college basketball right now watch Virginia Tech off this inbounds play they always come up with a quick hitter right on Q everything but the Finish its like you spent a ton of time coaching H Mike Youngs team I tell you they do a great job of executing and you know when it comes to Growing Up offensive Concepts and plays Mike young is as good as there is LW got a great look there just couldnt put it home steps out for a three got it Toby low nine points in this first half to lead Virginia Tech and the layup is the only shot hes missed yeah the easiest one of them all now the Junior from London England who can jump out of the gym quite the offensive spark in the ACC opener for Virginia Tech Virginia Tech has done a really good job of keeping the Pittsburgh guards from penetrating pull up pop Isle it that thats just better offense than defense he tried to uh leer tried to drive the gap in there and just pulled up and knocked it down but neither low nor Leed has been able to really penetrate and score in the paint and shoot answers two teams that have woken up offensively you must have said something to him yesterday cuz I tell you what youve been talking him up and he has responded yeah he was a highly talented recruit coming out of Illinois went to Duke and had 599 days dealing with an injury that is a long time to not be playing basketball and he is working his way back into great form thew right there stepping up and watch the footwork L has when he catches the ball hes ready to face the pit three right there by Le it and he can do it right off the bounce and then shoot right there catch and shoot its really changed the uh this game an offensive explosion after the defense had dominated most of this first half and I think the defense has been pretty good I mean I think the shots have been really well earned and have come off of running really good offense alot has been the Catalyst for pit he has 11 of the Panthers 26 I think somebody lost a contact back in for the hookies Music everyone everybodys looking looking at it lets see if we can get a look at this it all goes to how important the cont who the contact belongs to because the trainers have extra contact on the bench and if its somebody really important theyll just say hey well just get you another one shouldnt you know if it fell out of your eye I yeah papa kti hes running to hes got to go to get antra and get the Im telling you they always have extras now thats funny off to the locker room he goes tied at 26 here in blackburg Rex Steiner lines up to three cant connect for Virginia Tech started this game shooting six of eight from the floor since then just five of 13 Leed of three hes been red hot missfires Applause there shoot contested triple too much on it tapped Applause out hoki a second chance opportunity burn him heres Jaden young pulls up from three and buries it that young man they have real high expectations for him they talked about him Ace cus was one of the assistant coaches was talking about him yesterday that he has a load of talent and they really going to need him to step up three big Second Chance points on that triple from the sophomore Jaden young Jorge Diaz Graham TR the answer that rolls around and does not drop Rex Steiner a three no good another Tapout Falls to Virginia Tech looking for some more Second Chance points and potit fouled on the Block hokes a threepoint lead with three minutes left to this first half what whenever the threes are going it makes you look better and they have been going for Virginia Tech as young right there tees it right up and knocks it down and puts Virginia Tech in the Music lead stand for thefield Sizzle hopefully its more competitive than in the Big 12 championship game I just saw the score of that 4510 Arizona State well youre my football guy so I need to get your uh predictions okay well my wife went to Georgia so I got to pick the Bulldogs and then I think SMU wins even outside Championship shoot wide open hes had a terrific first half Jade and shoot puts the Hokies up six but those shots have come off of action that has given him the ability to be free to catch and shoot hes not had to put the ball on the floor yet because of the action that they run low big shot and he drills it the sophomore delivers hes been quiet but a huge make there well but what hes done is hes done a really good job of setting up legged but he has the ability to go oneonone but the difference is this Virginia Tech team they really move well without the ball again catching shoot is what Mike Youngs teams do and thats why theyve been so effective in the past well even after that Miss Virginia Tech still shooting a season best 50 from the floor Austin trying to answer with a three no Applause good under two minutes remaining in this first half fourpoint lead for Virginia Tech in the ACC opener Music Applause inside to potit trying to spin his way free stolen away hes got to turn and find the defense he put the ball down not knowing where the defense was poti and got it Applause stripped Virginia Tech would love to finish this half with a lead right now I think thats very important to their p a team thats lost five straight games trying to snap out of it in conference play Ben burnam the steel and the slam Virginia Tech defensively has stepped up and really played well and caused pit a lot of problems in their ball screens and their penetration in this first half Jorge Diaz Graham no good on the triple Mike young takes a timeout his hokes with a sixpoint lead Music Music Ill tell you what Perry I dont know what you think but Virginia Tech not playing like a team thats lost five straight no and they didnt practice like it yesterday Mike Youngs Noto that that happens Veron makes a steal and finishes there I mean you talk about a coach that has won every place hes been and hes going to give them confidence hes not a yeller or screamer but his persistence and his execution to detail is the thing that will get this Virginia Tech Team going now this Virginia Tech team they have lost five straight nonconference games for the first time in a 100 years so this is unchartered territory and they have responded in ACC play you said it before the game you wipe the Slate clean when it comes to conference play they have done that in this first half and winners win I mean Mike Youngs a winner and his you know is the difficulty is getting his team to raise the lto up to what hes expecting and what he knows takes to win Jeff capable telling his pit team hold for the final shot they have a use it or lose it timeout and capable decides to use it well step aside as well final possession of the first half coming pit trailing by six Music Music Applause Music Perry Clark J alter with you coach if youre Pittsburgh what do you looking in the final 18 seconds for Im putting the ball in Lowes hands and try to come off a ball screen where he he can score it hit the roll guy or throw it to one of my Shooters in the corner in a spot up area but everything comes off Al Music Applause low and they get it right to him 18 seconds to work with trying to cut into this sixpoint Virginia Tech lead Applause and low draws the foul Virginia Tech had a few to give thats just their fifth foul of this first half so theyve actually got one more before pit would be shooting one and one I come back with the same play and thats why Hammonds coming in right now to get a little bit more quickness on low and Hammond commits the foul nothing changes they put Hammond in there just to commit the foul on low you probably wanted to take a little more time off the clock if you could though still plenty of time you dont want to play with low like that when hes got the ball cuz next thing you know hell knock down a three on you low in attack mode tried to leave it for Corin still time here for the Hokey shoot gets it off and Virginia Tech finishes the first half with a flurry great finish low got in Lows such a great pass hes so unselfish I think the second half Lows going to have to step up and look to score a little bit more for a pit hok hes trying to snap a five game losing streak to start ACC play and they delivered quite the first half theyve opened up their largest lead of the game eightpoint lead for Virginia Tech against a ranked Pittsburgh team at the break Applause a 132 run hokes have an eightpoint lead who set the tone for Virginia Tech coach if you want to get off the slide you got to get one guy to step up and low has been the guy that has really stepped up from the beginning you see him driving aggressively to the basket there hes on a post up and taking the ball hard to the basket and then he knocks down the three when hes left open but hes been a catalyst to get the Hoke is going and for Pittsburgh Leed has been the guy that has knocked down the threes he can do it off the bounce he can do it off the catch but hes the guy thats been spacing the floor and creating scoring opportunities for the Panthers El leet has 11 of the Panthers 26 this was a back and forth game really for the first 15 minutes of it and then Virginia Tech found an extra gear in the final 5 minutes a 132 run to finish the first half neither team got to the foul line in the opening 20 minutes so the Hoke shooting a season High 52 from the floor yeah but besides the W uh Shu stepped up and knocked down some really key buckets and played extremely well no one has kind of played with legged offensively and they normally need Cohen or Austin to step up with him as well as low to get some easy back baskets they go inside to Austin to open the scoring Austins been a guy thats been a catalyst for them and certainly they want to try to get him going well after only two points in the final four minutes for pit they open up with a bucket in the second half theres Toby lewow in attack mode right to the rim for two again the ball inside La the thing about low is that his ability to put the ball on the floor and drive it at the basket and finish as something that he hasnt done as much early in the season hopefully a continues for Virginia tackle heres Jaylen L draws the foul they kept him in check Virginia Tech defensively did but if they pick can get Jaylen logo and he can turn this game around in a hurry well you know the fact that that theyre playing without uh uh Damen Dunn uh Pittsburgh its really hurt them Dunn is an excellent ball handler they can put low off the ball as well as legged and uh it gives them a lot more diversity offensively right now low has to carry it initiating the offense and trying to score offensive rebound cleaning up the spill guo Diaz Graham Graham Diaz Graham is really an interesting player hes a really good shooter but hes hes not afraid to stick his nose in there and get on the offensive glass Rex Steiner the immediate answer thats Rex Steiner at his best right there probing not driving trying to create assist but proving reading the defense and getting midrange shots cam Corin answers with a midrange jumper of his own timeout Jeff capable after the junior knocked it down all Music Music of Music my Music you Applause Public Service an the number 18 Pittsburgh down six in this second half early timeout by their head coach Jeff Cap Jeff Cap was not happy Jeff Cap was one of those dudes I mean he guarded you and he was not happy with the way Pittsburgh came out and tried to defend Rex Steiner on that last jump shot and he called a timeout he sat through it at Mississippi State seeing the ball being taken every place and easy shots hes determined not to let that happen tonight and so now theyre going to ramp up their defense Jaden shoot a three cant connect this will stay Virginia Techs way low mishandled the rebound there when you talk about guards defending I mean and and Coach C talked about his guard play and how important it is to him cuz he was a big time guard I mean he got after guys defensively he guarded as well as scoring and thats what he expects from his guards feed inside wesler traveled well youre right it has to be something with the defense performance cuz in the second half theyve had three possessions theyve scored three times yeah I mean its just the aggressiveness and sometimes its just Instinct I mean as a coach you can feel whether or not your guys are into it its not about the ball going in or not going in its the intensity in which were playing how easy passes are getting through our reaction to the scouting reports and thats the thing that Im sure he wasnt happy about legot through traffic draws the foul Applause guys that coach that played guard they always believe that guards control the game and there you see Leed driving and getting fouled but thats just a feeling and and Jeff has so much confidence in his guard play that he really wants them to step up right now and assert themselves well it took until the second half but that was the first free throw of the game and and thats not a good sign especially when you have a attack guard like the lnl guys I mean you know Leed uh really does a great job of attacking L does a great job of attacking they havent gotten to the foul line which means that theyre not being aggressive enough and Panthers trying to string together some stops on the defensive end wesler rejected at The Rim cam Corin says no the trailer Diaz Graham cant connect and a foul called against cam Corin going up against Toby laow and they tag the transfer from Florida State for the foul Jeff cable cant believe it well Jeff is saying he had both hands on the ball so what did he push with thats thats a typical coachs question now well take another look quickly as Virginia Tech walks it up the court hes got both hands on the ball so what did he push with Applause heres lewow hes provided the spark offensively didnt get a good look there good defense and a foul off the ball they tag Patrick wesler with it thats his third the sevenfooter theyll come out of this game for Ben bnab so Virginia Tech going small ball here tallest guy on the court is leow at 68 I look for Pittsburgh right now to try to get the ball Applause inside Corin calls for it kicks it out Le it pump fake on the drive low lines up the three missed it low has to be shot ready that was about as easiest shot as hes going to get in this game Rex Steiner fading away he misfires low trying to up this Tempo in transition and then pulls it back leg it finds Austin pull up pop got it Austin has been a key guy in their success early in the season because he gives them another perimeter shooter but he also can go and score off the bounce they really want to try to get him going Virginia Tech clinging to a twopoint lead theyve missed their last four shots a team that has had extended scoring droughts that have hurt them mightily during a fivegame losing streak shot clock down to four jaded shoot Way Off the Mark I think pit has to continue to attack the basket Leed for the lead missed Applause it well this is what has plagued the hokes team during this fivegame losing streak in nonconference play just too many empty possessions Burnham brings him right out of it after five straight misses Ben Burnham delivers from the corner Burnham does a great job helping them space the floor because at his size he can step away from the basket and shoot the basketball really with Effectiveness Virginia Tech averages five made three or seven made threes a game and theyve already got seven tonight Mike Youngs team a fivepoint lead 1451 remaining in this second half its vwe at ESPN when we partner with the V Foundation you can join the fight against cancer by visiting v or donate Perry Clark you met Jim Valvano back in 1974 he was the head coach at Bucknell you were playing for Gettysburg against them we were playing in the playoff game and he had promised his team if they got to the playoffs that he would go through the warmup line and he was out there warming up we didnt know who he was we just knew this old guy was out there and the fans were going crazy and that was my first encounter with him and he was always a great motivator when he recruited Sydney low and Derek Wittenberg at the MAA where I went and coached he told them he said look I get real emotional and all like that during the game if were not communicating just come over and give me a hug and Derek Wittenberg has used that all the way through his time at NC State to win the national championship and no one was closer to Jimmy as a player than Derek was and if you watch doing that Championship run Derek always went and gave him a hug after every game doing that NCAA tournament when Jimmys running around crazy hes looking for Derek to give him a hug thats incredible Insight he tried to get you as an assistant coach too right he did and uh probably at NC State when I first went but I was going to uh Georgia Tech with Bobby and I was happy and so it just it worked out for the best I probably would have screwed up him winning the national championship so it things worked out for the best how did he look in the layup line uh he made it I mean we thought he was a player I mean you know he was young and all like that at the time I mean so he he looked pretty good you know and uh and but he promised his te but thats the type of innovation and motivation that Jimmy was he was always such a personality hes always fun to be around uh you know the ACC coaches loved him and he just gave the league a new life and everything when they when they asked him you know how you going to what are you going to do against Dean Smith he said I dont know how Ill live him you know and I mean that was his comment I mean and so but he always had that wit and character about him and we got a figure Bobby km coming in Mike chesi coming in and Jimmy valano all coming in boy you talk about the league being on fire he meant so much to the ACC and pit in the ACC opener gets a big bucket from leot forces the turnover and its a onep possession game this ranked Panthers team their highest ranking in the AP pole in a decade since the 2013 2014 season they would love to finish a 22 day road trip with a conference win trailing by three theyve worked their way back in it hokey led by as many as eight another foul this time off the ball what Pittsburgh is doing now is going more to flex action where Lowes coming off the ball going setting the ball screen bringing the big up and then running some action off of that and petite just blew it up that time low for the tie no good Tapped Out Falls to come The Freshman fires he cant connect another offensive rebound lean he cant hit it three really good looks and it just wont fall for p you cant get any better than that and again we talked about dun not playing but thats kind of been duns role being able to get Leed and low off the ball and initiated inside to poti hell be at the line for two you mentioned Damien dun out with that injured hand he he had played big minut and really Jeff cable told us that he designed this Panthers offense for three ball handlers so you take D out you got to sub in a big changes the way your offensive rhythm is supposed to work really and duns an exceptional player I saw him first two years he was that Tempo he played with some other guards and didnt get a chance to really initiate went to Houston uh with with with Coach Samson and now hes at Pittsburgh and uh hes a really hes a great kid and a really fine Talent that thumb injury that is projected to keep him out until January now now Virginia Tech is really small right now with with uh with the lineup that theyve got young is playing like a small forward and um low is playing like a four spot or fivan and Pittsburgh has missed their last 10 threes Panthers only Trail by four but they have been more effective going inside they have struggled from Deep give and go low kicks it out Le it finds Diaz Graham and he finally buries one from Beyond The Ark see but I think when low gets that deep hes got to put the ball on the glass hes got to shoot it and put the ball on the glass and let the bigs go and crash that time it paid off CU they wound up getting a good look just four of 22 from three before that make inside lell hammers it home and again thats Virginia Techs action you Applause know shoot has been coming down off of that pin down and and being open on that shot took both guys out FedEd inside and was able to get an easy opportunity stolen away lwow fouled he wanted to throw it down again what a spark he has been Toby Wow Mike young called him the best athlete hes ever coached jumps out of the gym getting it done on both sides of the ball after a Diaz grah three Toby laow has the hokes up by three for the break Mike young says Toby low is the best athlete pure athlete hes ever coached you can see it on display here his ability to explode and he does it in traffic he does it on a quick jump you know and so his his ability to finish and he has really been a difference in this game so far look at that vertical nearly a 50 in vertical to go along with his 68 height we were told by our production crew if he jumps up in the air hes eyebrow high with an African bush elephant how about that threepoint lead for the h hes looking to snap a fivegame losing streak and start ACC play with a win pull up pop too much on it from Jaden Music young one of the things Virginia Tech is doing theyre really doing a good job of taking pit out of their offensive continuity I dont think pit has shot the ball played with a lot of offensive flow theyve made some tough shots theyve executed some things but the consistency in which they they run their offense low weaving through traffic everything but the Applause Finish Ben Burnham good look couldnt finish it Pittsburgh started this second half three of four from the floor hot out of halftime since theyve just made three of their last 11 Cummings not a great look there itll stay Pits way though foul on the floor called against L pit is searching right now theyre trying to figure theyre trying to get low off the ball to allow him to have an easier time scoring the ball and putting Cummings in the game you see Cummings driving right there he gets bumped a little bit with F wind up pushing he comes out of the game with his second foul Austins back in the game to give him some fire Applause power Le it turnaround and it rims out no good thats the type of afternoon its been for pit theyve gotten good looks just cant get them to fall on the road in blackburg Music shoot on the drive inside wesler the seven footer muscles at home wesler did a great job that time of gathering himself he didnt just catch it and try to muscle it he made sure he had his his feet were set and he was able to power in for the layup but again but it comes off of action Applause pit is getting nothing in his low post game so far low splits the double team draws the foul Cohen even though hes big and plays in the post he what he basically has done is po to the perimeter and Pittsburgh if you look at if this where their scoring is coming from theyre getting very little action in the pain area and I think theyre going to have to collapse Virginia Techs defense I think Virginia Tech we saw them in practice yesterday they did an excellent job defending and playing gaps and taking away dribble Drives By Pittsburgh Bel low makes the front end of a one and one pit will be in the bonus the rest of the way Applause low shooting into the castle guard the student section here at Castle Coliseum makes it a onep possession game thats never been a very friendly section when I was coaching here and theyre trying to buoy the home team to their first win in six tries five straight losses for Virginia Tech they have shot out of the slump today Brandon Rex Steiner at another two and he Rex Steiner has done a really good job since earlier he hasnt tried to over penetrate he stayed in that middle ground where if the defense backs off he can knock down that midrange jump shot you see all the Virginia Tech players are in the Gap there really is no driving lane for this Pittsburgh team they have to do something with movement to create the ability to drive and kick stolen away Zack Austin the steal and the slam and its back to a threepoint Applause game this has all the makings of an ACC game thats going to come down to the wire pit defending with heart backto back Steals and they cash in on both of them that time jayen low delivers and that was a defense why coach cable called timeout thats the pressure on the ball thats the way that they wanted to handle the passing Applause Lanes hit 17 points off turnovers after backto back baskets off steals that three goes begging no good good bounces out Rex Steiner keeps it in play and Tyler Johnson had his foot on the line another hokey turnover onepoint game 731 to play you want to know why coach capable called a timeout earlier cuz this was the type of defensive effort he wanted to see as Austin comes up makes the steel and a great finish and then coming right back watch low pick the pocket and go in and score an easy one to get pit get pit back in this game Music ACCC opener here in blackburg Pittsburgh trailing by one its a Panthers team that trailed by as many as eight theyve done a nice job in this second half battling back well they really have I think they have to figure out a way to get the ball in the gaps to get easier shots on the kickouts for the three Virginia Tech has done a really good job of playing Gap defense and not giving up easy wide open threes pit looking for their first win in blackburg in more than 20 years tough place to come and win there a year ago Virginia Tech 15 and2 at Castle Coliseum only three and two here at home to start this season they would love to wipe the Slate clean finish this five game losing streak with a win in the conference opener and what a tremendous boost it would be for Virginia Tech to be able to get a win today good home crowd start the ACC low great pass count it plus the foul Tyler Johnson The Freshman off a great feed from lwow and again this is how Mike young teaches offense you score off the pass watch L sucks up the defense back back cut layup yeah and thats why when you turn the ball over and you dont connect with each other its harder to run good offense in the way that they like to run it now Mike young set after the loss to Vanderbilt on Wednesday night which made it five in a row for Virginia Tech I believe in this team were going to figure it out they have come out inspired today against a ranked Pittsburgh team lost the handle though Austin keeps it in play settles things down down for Pittsburgh Panthers trailing by four Pittsburgh has not been able to get easy drives to the basket low that time took a midrange jump shot but again was challenged there got to be a little frustrating right now for Coach cable theyve got to do something because theyve got five really good scores on the floor to get easier looks than what theyre getting and Jaylen low just shooting three of 11 from the floor this afternoon and he is usually the catalyst for this pit offense and give Virginia Tech a lot of credit defensively I know we talked about them needing to shoot the ball better but to that end in the win game their defense has really stepped Applause up Burnham trying to spin his way free Corin got a piece of it who touched it last and they say it was Burnham so pit basket B burner I he had a shot to catch and shoot I think hes better at that putting the ball on the floor gives the defense a chance to react and get back and it took away a scoring Applause Applause Music opportunity heres cam Corin see but even on the rolls the post are catching it out of the paint you know what you want to happen on the ball screen the big roll you like for to be able to catch it in the pain area where he can just go straight up and shoot the ball thats just not happening for Pittsburgh Applause today and a foul called against Diaz Graham reached in to try and deny Ben Burnham the pass his second foul were getting towards that point in the game where coach are going to go with stuff that have worked theyve got assistance theyre charting every offensive possession so they have a good understanding of what plays it worked and what hasnt Jaden shoot for a three got it jaded shoot buries his fourth triple of the afternoon again catch it shoot it and thats and thats that vinia Tech offense he came off the staggers was able to get the hand off and knock down the three Le it that goes begging Corin keeps it with the Panthers no points in more than three minutes for Applause pit see see how they tra in the ball screen the big is out hedging heaz Graham no good nothing will fall for pit right now its hard whats making it hard is that Virginia Tech is not letting the ball get into the paint so therefore their defense is not collapsing so therefore theyre not playing out of closeouts Pittsburgh just five of 27 from three meanwhile Jaden shoots been terrific comes right off the handoff catch shoot thats what he does he doesnt have to put it on the floor just squares his feet knocks it down you want to shoot a high percentage one good offense like that hes got to put that on a tshirt catch shoot but spell the way he does s c hu nil baby re Steiner fading away now thats not his shot I mean hes much better when hes facing backs the defense off and can play his midrange game low the floater he has been off his game hes three of 12 leg it the blow by right to the rim hell have two at the line when we come back Pittsburgh trying to claw their way to a road wi to start ACC play 18th ranked Panthers getting tested down the stretch down seven Music hey fans its now time for a tshirt toss watch out for flying tshirts making their way to our Applause Music Applause you Music Music about wor the championship Saturday in ACC network has you covered pregame and postgame Show Breaking everything down between Clemson and SMU to decide who wins the 2024 ACC Championship on the football field Perry Clark Jay alter with you ACC opener here in mens basketball Virginia Tech a sevenpoint lead 357 to play coach is a pit team thats ranked 18th in the country theyve had a terrific start to the season and just cant get their two star guards going in this second half well again I think give Virginia Tech a lot of credit because we watched them practice yesterday so we know what they were trying to do they really work hard to be in the gaps and not allow the guard to get in drive and kick and uh so therefore they made it very very difficult for the Pittsburgh guards to be able to get easy shots for other people and knock down threes those legged free throws and a fourminute scoring draft for pit the Panthers have missed their last six shots two of their last 12 and yet its a fivepoint game with under four minutes to play theyre right in it Virginia Tech desperate to get this win to the Finish Line a team thats lost five straight games good ball movement loow put it on the floor lost it battle for the ball Burnham jump ball is called the possession arrow stays with Virginia Tech possessions 4 seconds on the shot block thats how you know its ACC play bodies on the floor going for the ball you got to love it look for a quick hitter right now well shoots the inbounder usually hed be the guy on the receiving end of a quick hitter either burner or Rex Steiner coming off the screen Rex Steiner find shoot Hees it from three no good good defensive possession by Pittsburgh now can the Panthers get something on the offensive end theyve missed their last six shots Jaylen low goes to work see Los not getting by anybody and creating situations that have to rotate bu berries a deep three biggest shot of the game and its a twopoint contest he said I cant get by you but Im a knock down to three Rex Steiner trying to answer no good the wow the offensive rebound and hes fouled what a game has he played uh low has just been all over the place on the offensive glass Big Time rebound that time but watch low he keeps his head up eyes the rim knocks down the three his range is incredible and thats the one thing when watching film I was surprised with how deep he can shoot the basketball and I think sometimes because with dun being out hes really just trying to initiate the offense to get everybody involved hes not focusing on scoring the ball to his capability Toby lwow nothing but the bottom of the net from the line he leaves his Virginia Tech Team 72 free throw shooter on the season the wow play so hard and the junior an opportunity to make it a twopossession game and he Applause does two and a half minutes remaining in the ACC opener jayed low backto back baskets for the sophomore and thats what hes capable of doing turning the corner on the high ball screen and getting to the front of the r twopoint game low is shown up down the stretch on the road defensively too got his hand on it Le it Dives in Scramble for the ball possession arrow is with Pittsburgh thats the defense coach cap wanted to see coming out the loar room guys diving on the floor look at the pressure right there hes been hes been timing this you cant cross over in front of a good defensive player like that its on the floor you see Pittsburgh both teams getting after it jump ball goes to pit and Virginia Tech that is their 17th turnover the team that has been plagued by the turnover bug during this fivegame losing streak its showing up down the stretch hit with the basketball two minutes in regulation Panthers trailing by two Applause low has it here he scored the last five for pit working on Burnham in attack mode no Applause good the low goes down five on four Burnham a three Miss Music fires and a foul called on the rebound against Toby laow will give the ball to Pittsburgh hes saying lets get a review they all want they all want the review they all want the review these two teams are fighting their heart out right now this game means a lot to both of these two clubs and these kids are really playing extremely hard and its a costly foul call because not only does it give the ball the pit but the Panthers are in the bonus its a I think its a warning Mike young takes one of his three timeouts Toby leall a long conversation with the officiating crew after that foul and I get it youre a team thats lost five straight games its the first time in nonconference play since 1924 thats 100 years that Virginia Tech lost five straight nonconference games you want to snap this thing here at home against the ranked team youve played yourself in position how do you finish the deal well you got to make some open shots you dont turn it over which has happened to him and I think that the rest kind of take care of itself but I just think right now Pittsburgh has certainly ramped up the defensive effort and have gotten much tougher with that and for Pittsburgh I mean you know they have high expectations they were extremely disappointed with what happened last year they played a challenging schedule and uh coach cable like I said I mean hes a very competitive was a competitive player uh hes a competitive coach uh he he was very disappointed with the way they played against Mississippi State so this game means an awful lot de Mo Diaz Graham steps to the line for one and one and the junior knocks down the first to chance to tie this game at 58 Pittsburgh a team that has been on the road since November 18th this is their fifth straight road game trying to open ACC play with a road win minute 34 to go tied at 58 between ranked Pittsburgh and Virginia Tech look for some pin down action Music heres Ben Burnham attacking kicks it out Jaden Shu hes made four threes today finds Rex Steiner 5 seconds on the shot clock feed into lwow and he draws the foul so Toby laow the best free throw shooter on the team a chance to regain the lead from the line you know for Virginia Tech whoever comes up and sets the ball screen is going to roll especially if its Lu so youve got to have your secondary Defender there prepared to catch the roll and its hard because Virginia Tech has guys that can knock down threes L wow a confident stroke from the foul line hokey back in front by one he has 16 points to his name this afternoon he has been the Catalyst for a resurgent Virginia Tech performance now coach cap already knows what he wants to call loow misses the second Isle it has it for Pittsburgh Panthers trailing by one one minute remaining in regulation pit has not LED since the first half low down the lane off the window and in jayen low fires the Panthers in front he got the matchup he wanted he got low the shot he wanted to get timeout Virginia Tech jayen low delivers Pittsburgh their first lead since it was 2623 the key thing on Lowes Drive was if we can get a replay he keeps his head up so he so he knows this Target off the glass so many guys when they drive the ball they lower their head they try to figure out the where the defense is it doesnt matter watch it watch it he keeps his head up he sees the ball he sees the glass and he lays it in he doesnt worry about where the defense is we talk about his dad being one of the Premier a coaches in the Houston area hes been taught that from when he was 6 years old how about The Confidence from The Young sophomore jayen low he just made three of his first 12 shots he stuck with it he has made three of his last four down the stretch to put his team in front on the road Ive seen him in the summer at John Lucass camps and the drill work and everything that hes gone through its not surprising because its very difficult but for a sophomore to be able to step up and do that you know Kudos of that but lets give Coach cap a lot of credit because again he talked earli about the faith that he has in his guards hes kind of created his offensive system to play around these guys and he hasnt deviated from that you know when the games been on the line Music now theyve got to come up with the Stop and again look for Action from Virginia te theyre going to hit you with pin Downs Low cross theyre going to try to bring somebody from the weak side to the ball side theyre not going to try to beat you off the bounce theyre going to try to beat you off the pass and while Virginia Tech has made a few foul shots during this stretch they have missed their last four field goal attempts they have to find one here trailing by one they LED for 31 minutes of this game but they find themselves down one 40 seconds to play Burnham the drive rejected blocked by Diaz Graham you have to foul here for Virginia Tech not enough time to play this possession out in Pittsburgh in the double bonus will be shooting two with 25 seconds remaining well they had the ball in Burnhams hand the play broke down they were trying to get a quick hitter Burnham is the best guy attacking the basket off the dribble but again should give Pittsburgh a lot of credit defensively they switched everything on the action and even if he makes this is still a one possession game yep but a chance to give give the Panthers a threepoint lead Jaylen low 87 from the foul line thats who you want in crunch time got them both didnt even hit the r Virginia Tech One timeout trailing by three now some people say do you foul right now I always say do what you practice only 15 seconds remaining Hokies need an answer the young sophomore Jaden young for three missed Applause it and a foul called the possession arrow was with Virginia Tech hes thought they had a tie up there instead a foul is called Zack Austin with his teammates surrounding him on the Virginia Tech logo did he get a cramp liming off the court there the transfer from High Point he was the hero in Columbus when Pittsburgh beat Ohio State at the buzzer in overtime Austin Getting attended to over on the Panthers bench so its its a double bonus hell get two shots here and an 87 foul shooter jayen low a chance to make it a twopossession Applause game Virginia Tech LED for 31 minutes of this game they led by his many as eight a team trying to snap a fivegame losing streak in pit a ferocious finish now leads by five timeout Jaylen low I mean he he took over the game in the last two minutes of the of this both offensively and defensively and certainly got pit in a position right now to win this basketball game and what do you say for Virginia tack I mean they practiced well yesterday they did everything they wanted to do defensively they stepped up uh they did a great job with the dribble penetration um limiting the threepoint shooting um they just did a good job and you know its hard and thats the tough part about coaching in this game Jay sometimes you can do everything right and it turns out wrong and its hard for people to understand that you just have to kind of go through it sometimes each team with one time out remaining under 7 seconds remaining into Reiner they dont have enough time he caught that inbound right in front of the line off to lewow the buzzer sounds in Pittsburgh leaves blackburg with a road win to start ACC play and the 18th ranked Panthers
