on the season for Bates as well Music in fact Bates had a double double in their win Tuesday against Edward Waters University out of division two the first year head coach is Kenny Payne Applause most recently an assistant with the New York Knicks a member of the 1986 National Championship team under Denny Crum here at Louisville the opening tip is controlled by the Rattlers in green Louisville in the gray red and black so glad youre with us for ACC basketball Brian Oliver and called Kenny Payne earlier today he said he wants his Louisville team to come out and defend with a sense of urgency you know obviously coming off of that big win against Western Kentucky he wants him to be able to come out with a sense of urgency early shot clock is down to three for the Raptors Smith tries to drive it down the lane tough shot and its pulled in by curry good job Cindy Hatfield three ball Applause exactly what coach Payne told us his defense led to the offense at the other end when they put up a season high in points with 94 in that Victory against Western Kentucky on Wednesday they LED it by 11 at halftime Tillman stepping back that goes up for grabs and picked up by the cards in traffic Mike James was able to grab it Ellis a little touchdown pass as the cards play in a bowl game at Fenway Park today Applause against Cincinnati lets go last check they had the lead in that game Brian at Fenway Park Withers in the paints and he trapped Applause we see solid defense by Smith Robert McCullum sixth year head coach for FAMU you look at Robert mccullums resume and talk about a coach thats been everywhere and done it a little bit of everything head coach at USF at Western Michigan took that team to the NIT an assistant for several programs for the UCF Illinois Florida many others that was knocked away recovering defensively Huntley Hatfield and youll see this Louisville team theyll do a lot of switching on the perimeter they feel like they got bigs they can switch out and last time you saw Huntley Hatfield being able to play solid defense and come up with the block Withers Catch and Release and its all next picking up we left off another game again highlighted the fact that hes a good a guy is a great distributor being able to move that defense and getting where theres a wide open jump shot Withers are shooting 37 percent from Beyond New York the Raptors come back with the three of their own from their leading scorer Jalen Bates Bates is one of those guys that now knock down their three look for him to be able to touch that pain as well Bates shoots 39 from Beyond The Arc and Mike James stepped on the sideline in front of the Rattler bench again with that defense to offense Huntley Hatfield come up with that defensive block and then again theyre going to come out and try to get their move the defense you see being able to get the ball wide over the withers and again El Ellis does a great job of being able to pull two guys and realize that theres got to be somebody open its not rocket science Withers was about 25 feet away for that three Brian well behind the line 22 feet one and threequarter inches away shot clock is inside a 10 for FAMU offensive foul against the Raptors who saw Smith get around Ellis with a little bit of a chicken wing there again anytime you turn that corner and you see LL is staying solid Smith got by him a little bit of a wrap around off of that offensive foul anticipation and near Steele as Chase Barnes almost intercepted that one number 10 in green and Tom UC Floyd a m extending their pressure this is how theyre going to be able to disrupt this Louisville team because in the past Louisville has struggled with being able to have turnovers if you want to be able to get out and get some early offense and change up your defense a little bit give them some different looks and youll see from time to time as Robert McCullum team they will give them different looks defensively Louisville shot 54 a season high of the victory on Wednesday and they made 13 threepointers Curry on the interior and thats one of the things about Sydney Curry I mean hes a man down low among children you can give him an opportunity to be able to get over that right shoulder you go ahead and you spread it out four out and allow him to be able to eat inside Curry goes 68 270 pounds steal two on one with James the bounce back hustling glad back and knocked Away by Bates Curry follows the plan he lost it Tillman on the Run he lost it on the way up and Bates grabs it erratic play at both ends of the Court Brian yeah how about that that block by Bates from Fort a m though and looked like Louisville had the numbers came up with a big box never gave up on the play jumper comes up short from bars up ahead Curry and he beat everybody a lot of times you teach point guards to keep your head up you saw big being able to run giving us Curry an opportunity to be able to finish and you can really tell how Curry has improved his conditioning hustling down there and beating all the Rattlers to the basket and he pulls down the rebound at the defensive end averages about four boards per game and Curry two and a half points per game already has a couple of buckets Withers from the corner and even though Withers missed that shot when you see LL is the fact that hes able to touch that the paint King Payne said he wants his guys to share the ball but it also starts off with the pain touches Tillman Curry has it on the Baseline Louisville went 13 of 25 on threepointers Brian on Wednesday as Withers turns around and calculates the angle how many times have we seen LL Ellis being up again and the guys are running Florida a m trying to do a conscious effort to get back in transition but anytime you can throw the ball up to your big theyre going to run hard and that last time Withers being able to get a low post touch and being at the finish at The Rim so Ellis now with three assists in the early going in the first half Applause they work it inside it gets knocked away from Chapman On The Run knocked Away by Bates on the play on a driving JJ Trainor Music 10 times Music because theyre off and running Louisville up early 93 Cardinals in front of the first half 93 Florida a m comes in with record two and six and Brian Oliver not too bad considering turnover on this roster 11 new players and they lost their top seven from last season but Tom heres the thing that stands out return five percent of their scoring talking about emptying the chamber and trying to load up again you know for Robin McCullum hes trying to get his guys and trying to get them acclimated but if you looked at their schedule they have played some Heavy Hitters earlier on in the season MJ Randolph was a swack player of the year last year in their first year in the conference and they finished fourth with an 117 record in the swap 13 and 17 overall last season for Florida a m lets get a look at our keys to the game brought to you by your local Ford dealer with Brian Oliver when you look at both teams you know for the keys for Florida a m they got to create some points off a tournament this is a team again it doesnt have a lot of scoring and for Louisville weve already seen it Tom hasten getting up and down Ellis has already assisted on four of the Louisville field goals set his career high with 10 assists in the win against Western Kentucky on Wednesday for Ellis Bates not bashful Louisvilles done a good job of being able to limit four to a m to only one shot and again you see that theyre not sending a lot of guys to the offensive boards realizing theyve got to get back in transition yeah the 94 points on Wednesday Brian the most scored in three years for this Louisville program file against the Rattlers of Tillman first on Tillman third on the team Cardinals also had 17 assists in the victory Wednesday that was the season High without question the high water mark and the first win for Kenny Payne we showed you right at the top of the broadcast the water shower he got in the locker room taken his way down for two Brandon Huntley Hatfield and if you looked at that last offensive possession you see how Louisville every player touched the ball Kenny Payne preaches the fact that moving that ball getting everyone involved and then you saw that you were able to get the ball down low to Huntley Hatfield nice little jump up he was a doubledigit score off the bench on Wednesday with 11 points his four of six from the floor hit a couple of threepointers as well and he is the leading rebounder as well for Louisville in a congested area a couple of players hit the deck awkwardly our officials this afternoon AJ decide Jerry heater Chase Shaw Richard Matthews picks up the foul has a 34 for the Rattlers you talked earlier about the Florida a m having all of the newcomers sometimes it takes a team a long time to be able to establish some type of offensive Rhythm you know this Louisville team has come out has turned up their defense for him not having much success at being able to touch the paint and again Louisville limiting to only one possession at a time lands behind the line trying to add to a 90 run theyll get another chance as Withers preserves the concession trainer flips it back out to Withers shot clock at 10 silly is also in there number 11 for the Ville stumbled by Withers and he carried it according to Jerry heater right on top of the call yeah you see Withers seems like you may have tweaked that ankle a little bit you see boy a man doing a good job on his defensive possession you see with us getting tied up there looked like he may have stepped on the defenders foot you know Jalen Withers as he limps over to the to the bench hes one of those guys that Kenny Payne talked about thats multidimensional as far as his ability to defend to block shots you can throw the ball down too in the post and could create his own shot by putting the ball on the floor Withers the Redshirt Junior from Charlotte North Carolina one of the tri captains to the bench with that tweaked ankle Applause Music 123 advantage in the first half for Louisville Applause floater missed tapped around Lance came away with it that was Hans Louise June on that Runner Lance got it back they work it around trainer misfires Applause Florida a m has got to find some offense again theyve tried to run their sets Louisville doing a good job of being able to hedge by the defender a little time and then on certain occasions hes a great back to a play its unable to complete the play Louisville the second ACC opponent this season for Florida a m they lost in midnovember at Miami 8761 and their next two games how about Kentucky and number one Purdue coming up on deck for the Raptors Huntley Hatfield against two Defenders shot clock at five for Ellis a shoot Applause Chase for the loose ball its out of bounds off of basily of Louisville the Cardinals and L Ellis have the lead here at the KFC Young side ACC basketball is brought to you by your local Ford dealer the Worx Nitro available at works nitrocom and by The Fresh Market voted number one best supermarket in America Kenny Payne looking good in that Louisville uniform as well as his 76th through Sergey after being drafted in the NBA Kenny Payne the first round pick he was 19th by Philadelphia and played Four Seasons with the 76ers his numbers Brian here playing for the cards and my man KB because resharing history we were in Philly together and then you know talking about a guy that could shoot the thing and in his size what a great numbers here and we had a chance to visit no pregame Music hey you know the thing that strikes out is that its my rookie year oh my God I could grow a mustache until I was 22 man number 31 looks like you were at the free throw line lining one up there Brian Oliver and Kenny Payne teammates in Philadelphia and the first thing that Kenny Payne said to me at the shoot around today when he came over to me and Brian he pulled me aside and said Brian Oliver one of the greatest teammates I ever had we stayed around in the gym we got our shots up thats the kind of work ethic it takes to be successful at the Collegiate level and the professional level yeah KP and that man we went through it you know shout out to Charles Barkley Rick Mahorn Johnny Dawkins Hersey Hawkins that whole crew back then steal lands has it for the bill and heres one of the things thats shown out in the first half is that Kennys talking about the fact that he wants his team to to defend with urgency be able to get some turnovers take their time hes giving them the freedom to run but also wants them to have some discipline to run that half court set Curry trying to muscle his way on the Baseline lost the handle and two the Rattlers by the way Ellis has not scored so far Brian hes only taken one shot and that was a threepoint attempt at this first half but heres the thing though Tom you see them up 123 you see Stevens with a long threepointer good point guards take their time to get everyone else involved and then then they come out for their offense and I like the way that L Ellis is letting the game come to him and not forcing it especially coming off a 30point game the Rattlers dont shoot the three particularly well 27 on the season and now they must shoot take a three from Stevens gonna have another chance at it Tillman Applause trying to shake lands Applause they get an open three from the corner Isa weak side Curry runs it down when you talk about the fact that foreign has not shot the three rails because they have not been able to penetrate that Louisville defense he said last time you see that foul about the silly going on the penetration it looked like Stevens got a piece of facility and it will be on Stevens Tom I thought it interesting in talking to Kenny Payne he talked about the growth and I just asked him how do you keep your guys frustrating he focused on you know the task at hand seeing that they had dropped so many and he said that he felt like you know that he had to go back and teach a lot of the guys the basics of the game teaching them about being able to have ball movement being able to touch the pain and he feels like they are making this type of progression you see that offensive foul being called on James extending that arm and then I asked him I said you know and again as you go back and look at the replay here you see James come out and trying to extend himself and you see right there Applause Dominguez being able to sell were inside of 10 minutes here in the first half Stevens hanging and missing somehow the ball found him shot at Stevens with some flare and touch on that one and Stevens not giving up on the play you saw it last time for a throwing a ball in the post had all side pick now pin for him to come off again hes only seeing action in his second game this season and getting in the scoring column for the Rattlers that foul against Fairview Stevens picked it up his second one of the things that Florida a m has done a better job since the beginning of the game is getting back in transition which you saw Louisville being able to come out early get some easy baskets in transition theyve done a better job in getting back in Force Louisville to have to play against that half court defense other than throwing the ball in to Curry Louisvilles hit a little bit of a scoring drop Applause driving Ellis Drew The Defenders James thats a three came up short but Huntley Hatfield was waiting for it over the shoulder and into the bucket hung a Hatfield doing a good job of realizing where the ball is coming but then again good good Ball moving by Louisville and again if you forward an A M you cannot give them those extra opportunities that was Smith on the drive and Ellis picked up the foul his first last possession you see Huntley Hatfield realizing be at the right place at the right time A lot of times your Biggs would take those you know and say hey look what I found before they end up got to make sure that they box out the bigs and not get them early opportunities Huntley Hatfield with four points now cleaning up that mess with the other end Music Stevens Huntley Hatfield the rebounds you look and you saying why is Florida State excuse me Florida a m shooting so many threes Louisvilles done a good job of not allowing them to be able to get you some nice little pass over see they got a good look out of the set right right they got a good look at the set but then again before they end them they got to do a better job of being able to UC finally getting one to go you see Smith being able to knock down there three Tom you know Again Louisville has not shot the lights out of it as slowly UC Florida a m being away in the chick away at that lead second made three of the game for Florida a m Louisvilles just one of eight from Beyond The Arc and Pauls going to stay towards Louisville again when you see both teams going back at it you know Florida a m trying to get back in this game Bayern him Smith is like youre gonna leave me open Ill take it easy trying to jump away at that League Florida a m not afraid to trade punches with some of the Heavy Hitters Brian and the college basketball landscape and when I look at this schedule I look at the fact that for a new team thats trying to figure it out you want to be able to play against some Heavy Hitters thats going to allow you to be able to improve because thats what a lot of coaches take advantage of the nonconference get a chance to get a little coin in your pocket Tom wormy but then you also allow your guys to be able to play against some really good competition Kentucky and Purdue on the horizon for this Rattler team their first swac game will be January 2nd against Bethune cook but again its their second year in the swac they lost in the quarters to Alabama a m 6156 at that tournament in Birmingham Alabama where the top eight teams in the swac qualify and Texas Southern won that title a season ago Robert McCullum we told you about all the schools hes been at hes been an assistant as well Brian at Georgia Tech Oregon Central Florida south Alabama Samford Southern Illinois Kansas state Florida Illinois head coach at USF and Western Michigan and now here at Florida a m that sounds like a guy that was doing a lot of renting gosh thats amazing yeah lets steep into the shot clock had to shoot it James got it back put it on the floor and was fouled again weve talked about Louisville and how they were able to get started earlier this Ford a m Tim him has done a better job of being able to defend in the half court set gotta do a better job of being able to put a body on someone you dont want to give Louisville those extra opportunities on offensive rebounds so into the 11 for Louisville Mike James and thats an 81 percent freethrow shooter missing the front end of that one and one he was 22 of 27 to start the day from the striker Music Curry elevates up ahead Huntley Hatfield let the defender Go On by and drops it in and heres what well tell you Holly Hatfield didnt even look to go to the to the defensive board he realized that as soon as hes on the threepoint line hes releasing El Ellis knows as soon as he gets the ball hes looking up head up and be able to get that great opportunity such a big run six points for Huntley Hatfield and that one goes out of bounds off of the Rattlers again a lot of coaches will tell you that if youre a vegan youre outside of the threepoint line and watch Huntley Hatfield he realizes that Im on the top lls does a good job being to get out and then hunting Hatfield takes his time and being able to finish it and this is how you generate that offense limit the other team you see a steal by Tillman great hands Tillman shielding the defender with his body and then he lays it in Applause Ellis now up to five assists in the game he has not scored oh for two from the floor he handles it now for the Cardinals somehow I dont think that hes going to stay silent all day but like I say is it as a floor General you want to be able to get your other teammates involved Applause Withers shot clock at four driving Curry the tax second effort against two Defenders and a foul coming up on Florida a m and you talk about multiple efforts oh Sydney Curry down there built like a linebacker aint no hes doing all he can down there and again you want a guy that on that penetration by Withers you see the first effort the second effort and being able to muscle up and hell talk about a handful down there for the FAMU Defenders six rebounds of the game for curry at the freethrow line you were talking about tight ends in football a win for Louisville for the football program 247 at the Fenway ball against Cincinnati earlier today its a big sports day here in Louisville Kentucky that one up three I did I appreciate the assist thank you Brian dont expect me you do know Im a shooter I know every now and then a shooter will pass yes its a rarity its great to be alongside Brian Oliver the Georgia Tech Legend who had quite a travel schedule himself to make it Courtside here at KFC Yum center Ellis picking up the foul Applause you know in order to work with you I will do plans automobile skateboard I know you traveled by private jet so I get it thats not a problem and by the way I do appreciate you sending it Ill have to look into that great to be alongside Brian Oliver Tom wormy our outstanding ACC college basketball production crew with you from Louisville Kentucky Chapman had it tapped Away by lands and good defense by who lands that last time Chapman curled into the lane he didnt give up on the play realized on the recovery you try to contest that being able to come with that block its a day of football basketball and volleyball well get into that a little bit later as well for this Cardinal Athletic program Applause trainer turned into a double shot clocks in three for lands has to recognize leans in too strong Curry dominating the boards offensive foul great offensive rebound by Sydney Curran we talked about the fact that he is alone down there the bar is being able to come over absorb that contact you see Curry go up and then bars take it right between the numbers again talking about a player being able to give up his body thats one that you dont immediately just shake rub off despite the offensive foul curry with six points and eight boards he is tied for the scoring lead with Huntley Hatfield who is currently on the bench for Louisville you see Louisville showing a different look going into this Zone FAMU team has not had a lot of success or being able to shoot the three ball good grass over the bars good down by by Smith and again Im doing a good job of being able to chip away at this thing we see time and time again looks like Louisville is about to open this thing up but the Rattlers doing a good job of being able to execute their offense and now theyre showing Louisville a different look they won on Tuesday at home against Edwards Waters University division two out of Jacksonville Florida 5847 they also beat Albany State in overtime November 21st hell ball situation and that Arrow favors Louisville that last time you saw Hershey Miller trying to dribble best way to get through a trap is youre going to pass youre going to try to get it in the middle and take advantage of the mismatch that last time you saw Miller getting caught on the side the last thing you want to do is put that ball on winning the Trap again guard shooting 39 as a team in this first half just one of ten on threepoint attempts thats knocked away other end of the Court oh Louise June elevation and a rim Bender anytime you see a guy look at it was June coming up and again Tom wormy weve seen the Florida a m being able to chip away see Kenny Payne a little frustrated with his team calling the timeout Florida a m being able to come back so the Rattlers getting back in this one and one of the keys for them is to be able to have some turnovers you know June didnt have turned over and said you know what jump if you want to and see the Rattlers being able to cut this lead down the forward boy its Brian and FAMU has been able to use that defense to be able to get back in this game being able to understand that theyre not going to have to depend on that threepoint being able to spread the ball theyve been able to get the ball inside this last time you see turning good defense into offense theyve been able to cut this lead down right now and like I told you is that Louisville allowed them to stick around and now theyve got them on their heels Miller was pressured got it to Lance Percy Miller into the lineup shot clock is at four Miller Smith got a piece of him on the shot attempt number going to the line but I think that what FAMU has been able to do Tom is that recently when theyre trapping that half court theyre forcing Cleveland to condense their space in Louisville earlier was able to space them out move that defense and then either penetrate and touch the paint or get the ball down to the big right now theyre having some trouble troubles with that now three of five is a team from the stripe of the first half Miller at the line five of eight on the season from the freethrow line for the sophomore from Los Angeles California the transfer Tennessee State Stevens back into the lineup for the Rattlers Pride Music Bates Smith of the leading scorers for Florida a m nice hand for curry as he leaves the game hes been a force inside curry with six points and eight rebounds in the first half Applause Tillman tries to direct a little traffic with three and a half minutes to go in the first half was led by as many as nine Bates lost the handle in traffic Hands by Louisville a m and then they run that zone you dont want that that ball to just stick you want to try to penetrate those gaps touch the paint Force the defense to converge and then to get that kick out for a possible uncontested shot shot clock at 10 Applause coming out of that corner James elevates challenged by bars bar is doing a good job of being able to come challenge that shot and again we limited Louis from that position Tillman Applause foreign again just the one main three for Louisville in this first half that came from Withers relatively early bars trying to set up camp somehow hes able to get it back whistle stops play and its going to be bars on the foul like he got tangled up there Brian with Huntley Hatfield Mars call for that foul Hyundai Hatfield it looks like going to the line Louisville has come back into the game it seems that once he went on the bench the the flow for their offense kind of went away because again Kenny Payne talks about on the fact that he wants to make sure that theyre getting multiple passes and then the penetration it seems like there was a little bit more oneonone last few possessions double bonus for Louisville 74 percent from the line of the Season Huntley Hatfields sophomore from Clarksville Tennessee in a transfer from Tennessee the silly back in there number 11 seven points in the first half for Brandon Huntley Hatfield Applause and now hes right on his average of 81 points per game from the leading rebounder as well almost six per game for Hyundai Hatfield and that lead back to eight again as you close in a little bit more than two minutes in this half they get some stops theyve been doing a good job in the early part of the first half of getting stops and getting into early transition so running a m doing a better job of running the offense and not settling Tillman flips it out talk like at five inside of two minutes to go in the half Bates got the defender in the air knocked around and taken by trainer the silly Ellis through three defenders in Austin poor decision by LSU see Florida being able to capitalize on that again they its getting out how about Tillman being able to push the tempo it looks like as soon as Louisville tries to extend that lead Ford a m gets a turnover yet another one by June being able to go for the and one Tom Gorman 11 turnovers in the first half for Louisville and basily picked up the foul and one of the keys again we talked about this Louisville team that they can be prone to turnovers and you see one turnover gets them out base is able to finish and then they turn around again turns it over again and you can see June going in for what could be a a threepoint and a fivepoint swing for the Rattlers closest they have gotten since it was seven to three Louisville at the 1544 mark of this first half now this has not scored over two from the floor he has five assists after a 30point performance a career high on Wednesday against Western Kentucky one minute to go in the first half Vasily rattles out over the top of the Hatfield the Rattlers have done a really good job closing on Ellison keeping him out of the score they have and you understand that hes ahead of the snake and so theyve made him more of a passer that was blocked out of bounds its going to stay at this end of the floor the Rattler is identifying the head of the snake exactly what you said its Ellis and he hasnt scored and heres the thing that theyve got active hands referee having a conversation with Barnes and trainer there Florida Applause Robert McCullum calls a timeout with 406 seconds to go and theres 42 seconds on the shot clock Louisville led by as many as nine in this first half but they have gifted the Rattlers in this holiday season 11 first half turnovers and thats one of the things that has plagued them earlier in this season and you see it being at a rarest ugly head today and so for Florida a m already 13 points off of 11 Louisville turnovers and if you Kenny Payne you got to tell you guys that valuing the ball has got to be something thats primary and if youre Robert McCullum you have to love where you are because you look at this pace youve held this Louisville team to 22 points and then what was an eightpoint deficit youve been able to carve it back into it by defense and we talked about one of the keys for them is the points off the turnovers now theyve only made two of ten threepointers but conversely Louisville just one of 11 for Coach Payne from the threepoint atmosphere just over 40 seconds to go in our first half of play first ever meeting between the programs and that is the fivesecond violation of the Baseline but silly couldnt get it in bounds and heres before the NM did they took away Louisvilles first and second option and as you realize once that referee gives you you got five seconds and then by the time they were allowed to bring the other saw it was already a violation and youre talking about the frustration here but if youre Florida a m right now you get a chance to either tie this game or cut it down to one with a little less than 40 seconds foreign Applause Applause bounces off Second Chance Chapman followed his own Miss and got the whistle nice second action nice second effort by Chapman what they did is they ran him off that curl and you see Chapman going up there and hustling for it and then getting two Defenders up there drawing that foul get what it looked like Louisville being gonna open this thing up now Tom wormy gives it four to a m an opportunity to cut into his league and cut it down to one Chapmans a score for this team a careerhigh 18 points and that overtime win against Albany State I mean the story of the first half has been the Louisville turnovers and then Florida a m being able to capitalize and then the half court defense I felt like them extending their defense show and Louisville different looks kind of flustered Louisville and took them out of their offensive rhythm Applause twopoint game final seconds of the first half Applause if youre the Rattlers you shot 27 percent of the first half you are thrilled to be in this position right now Ellis trying to score very late not high enough for the square and the Rattlers will not get a shot away cards led by as many as nine in that first half and the Rattlers are all smiles and high fives for Coach McCullum thats Brian they Trail by just two after 20 minutes here in Louisville and as always it has been the turnovers for them Rattlers have been able to get back you got to do a better job of being able to move the ball touch the paint get the uncontested shots if youre Rob McCullum pretty much stick to weve done for the last five or so minutes of being able to be patient and then continue to use our defense to get the offense Florida a m out of Tallahassee Florida has the ball to start the second half there the green Louisville and the gray black and red bars deflected by Curry solid defense by Sydney Curran realized that bars is trying to beat him and get off the floor stayed solid would come up with that block Curry had eight rebounds in the first half tying his season High Applause here in 20 2223 Tom Im interested now as L Ellis looked to be a little bit more offensive minded you see it looks to be a foul down on Applause wow but going back to the point where L Ellis I thought that he sacrificed his offense to get everyone going we look to see him be a little bit more offensive mind to see him what theyve struggled all right trying to back it in against Bates bounce wasnt there Curry the follow after the Miss from his teammate Huntley Hatfield at eight points for curry and good job by Curry realized a lot of tension on Huntley Hatfield on the postup he does a good job of being able to get that position and again for Louisville theyve had success early in being able to get those points in the paint wanted five of their home court so far this season for the cards Ellis stripped it away up ahead clear path James went for the jam and Bates challenged him and picked up the foul for the Rattlers good pass ahead but even better recovery by Bates not giving up that easy basket because it looked like Louisville was picking up where they started in the first half hes a good defensive possession LL is coming up and then with us being able to get the ball a half for James but good recovery by Bates we see the last play thank you in that first part of the game for James who missed all four of his field goals and missed his only free throw prior to that one and a couple of changes for Florida A M Smith is out bars also out Richard Matthews number 34 has come in for the Rattlers with Mike James Applause pressure a lot of times this is not so much to steal the ball was to try to get them out of their rhythm Florida and stay disciplined what youve been able to do yet another deflection by Louisville Ellis crosses it over and lays it in Louisville coming out being able to set their offense by playing good defense and again if youre Florida a m this is one of those things right now is that you gotta take care of the ball because Louisville second and again for Louisville coming out of the half being able to come out to use their defense you see timeout the last playing good deflection out and under and they say we want to look and see if L Ellis is going a little bit of a Euro Step to be able to get that ball in and finish the play so the Rattlers call timeout and the cards converted the turnovers a 60 run to start the second half Curry eight points 10 rebounds a season on boards and the moves and the paint from Curry and we talked about the fact that hes found multiple ways to be able to put his impression on this game and I love the fact that being able to score being a monster on the glass being very active and giving them that inside presence that they needed and again right now youre already eight points and Tim bores and you see the last five games of the 202122 season average Apollo 17 points a game and now rebounds got out the gate with a little bit of a struggle but had a nice game on Wednesday and then got a good start tonight excuse me this afternoon get double digits on Wednesday with 10 points six boards prior to the game against the hilltoppers as Curry scores on cue Brian he only had 15 points leading up to Wednesday all season so heres what well tell you about my friend Kenny Payne hes from the old school like I am is that when you got a guy thats rolling and you can take advantage of a mismatch you go back to that that last time realizing hes got a guy in Sydney Curry throw the ball down and give him a touch and let him cook double double 10 points 10 boards first double double of the season for curry fourth of his career Bates at the other end for the Rattlers thats a nice move by Bates being there to go with a little spin move again this Rattler team has shown that if theyre not going away extending that that pressure because in the first half gave Louisville some problem they were able to create some deflections we showed you that they have played some very high level competition on their schedule so far for the Rattlers Ellis driving and scoring deep in the shot clock and a game where you realize now with LL is starting to pick up his attention to trying to score great pick and roll because you got a mammoth of a man in Cindy Curry sitting that screen and he gets a chance to get downhill for the Finish four points for Ellis Tillman off the backboard and in over Curry and Tillman has four and I think Tillmans had a really solid game again part of how they were able to cut in that lead was his play being able to get everyone involved you see Louisville again having a little bit of pressure you know the problem with that pressure good pass and oh see Burnside going up against Curry I thought we were about to have a little post to action Curry wanted to rip the rim right off its hinges there and a foul is called against Burnside UC Jalen with him for a nice dime and you see Burnside come over the challenge Sydney Curran again replay shows got a lot of ball but got a little bit of elbow too first Miss from the line for curry had been two of two what again as Brian mentioned his scoring average coming into this afternoon 25 points per game unable to cash in at the freethrow line I thought it interested in talking to Kenny Payne hes talking about how he had to pretty much start over we as far as getting a lot of these guys a little bit more acclimated with the fundamentals of the game and as you see hes a great backdoor pass and you see the nice finish by Chapman but back to the point is that it feels like his guys are starting to get again another turnovers I talk about it at 40 A M Truck trapping you see Tillman with another basket and it seemed like as soon as Louisville is able to get a little bit of lead the Rattlers come back five unanswered points just a second ago the lead was 10 largest of the game for the Cardinals they fight on the offensive class and Withers completes the play and thats where the length of Louisville is going to give Florida a m some problems you saw Sydney current be able to go into the basket but Jalen Withers not giving up on the play being able to get that rebound for the putback seven points now for Withers who followed the Miss at the offensive end Tillman Tillman ripping the ropes for the Raptors and hes into double digits with 10 points and again Tillman coming down and being able to come out and give them some offense and again weve got this lead again Florida a m being able to cut back into that league and it seemed that Jordan Tillman is the dude thats come back and got him going first being able to create some offense by a turnover to defense with a little bit of a step up and then afterwards hes saying you know what Im feeling it knock it down Rattlers are cutting his knee down to two Music so back in Louisville Kentucky KFC Yum Center and all of a sudden Tillman the leading scorer on the season for the Rattlers starting to heat up Brian hes into double digits with 10 points and not only with the 10 points you see that line four for seven two for fourth Bond R three Steals and I think that when theyve been able to make these runs hes been right at the Forefront being able to create some deflections and again what looked like Louisville opened up the second half getting some some kind of stressing this game out you know Florida a m done a good job but getting back into it the silly hooks it into the corner unley Hatfield strong shoulder Lambs lost the handle fumbled it out of bounds back to the wrap Louisville already up to 14 turnovers again if youre Kenny Payne you have to be frustrated but on the other end Lauren a m doing a good job of being able to not overturn Louisville over they found a little bit of offense both teams right now Florida and five for six to open the second half but for that turnover Louisville five for seven and remember both teams struggled from the floor in the first half especially from Beyond The Arc Issa trying to drive has to flip it back out shot clock is a 10 for the Rattlers Tillman Applause looking for a screen around Curry floats it Curry grabs it in the outlet Applause 11 rebounds now for curry shot from Alice almost spun it in Applause four points for Ellis both of those baskets coming in the second half he was shut out of the first half Bates straight away thats a two and we talked about Tillman Bates high and so now again having problems with this for an A M trap they needed that one a threepointer out of the corner in its lands they definitely needed that because up until now you know Louisville has struggled and one for 11 from behind R Chapman Hanks and scores at the other end hes got five and heres what well tell you with a team like Florida a m has had such a tough schedule these guys are realizing that the longer you allow them to hang around its going to give them confidence and you see right now they have proven that theyre not going away tamari lands hit a three on the previous trip to this end for Louisville just his seventh made three of the season now hes driving and hell earn some free throws lands looking to score and earning a trip to the freethrow line after the Rattlers first coming back to tie us up here in the second half thats on Louise June you see Kamari Lane not settling for the three being able to put the ball on the deck to get downhill again he was able to sell that because he he hit that first three first trip to the line for Lance bars will come in for the Rattlers and JJ trainer for the Ville Floyd tariki son leads and Huntley Hatfield as well for Louisville were at the incredible experience assistant coaching staff for Kenny Bain Danny Manning Nolan Smith Josh Jameson and Milt Wagner by the way is the director of Player Development when you talk about the coaching experience and then even some guys with the playing experience I mean you got some studs over there with a great college basketball pedigree shot clock inside of 10 Tillman just on the line Curry took it down Ellis right up the middle down the lane over the front rim and endless chance at the threepoint play and what weve seen Tom in the second half as Ellis putting his head down and deciding that hes going to attack the rim we saw him in the first half being over distributor you see Sydney Curry realizes he got and then look at Ellis hes realizing that hey Im going to get down here Im going to initiate the contact being able to do not only because make the basket and look how acrobatic he is being able to finish the play and go to the line for an and one so Ellis at the line remember we went for 30 points 10 assists he was the first Louisville player to do that since 2002 Curry got the message Applause being able to eat on the boards come out that Miss layup and again he is a monster Town offensive board you see Louisville extending their pressure and if youre basily you got to stay solid you know youre excited you want to get this crowd into it but you got to stay solid Applause literally clear out the defender gather himself in three guys being able to finish it the silly picked up his second personal foul he pressures Tillman Applause Tillman the only Rattler in double digits with 10 curry leads the way with 12 for Louisville hes got a double double with the 13 rebounds as well they kick it out to Bates passing tight quarters shot clocks at two Tillman just heaves it and that will be a shot clock violation against FAMU solid defensive effort by Louisville that last time they did not allow FAMU to touch the paint they forced him to get to the third and fourth looks and when you do that you force the team to get down to it what could possibly be a shot clock violation under 10 bars Applause all right Rattlers came back to tie us up at 34 earlier in the half Global led by as many as 10 in this half and by two at halftime and this trap has been the Achilles heel and you see oh El Ellis get downhill and absorb yet another contact on what youve seen is that Ellis has picked it up another notch decide Im gonna go ahead and put this team on my back Tom wormy stand in his lead right now Louisville up by seven Applause Music Works Nitro professional grade battery CPI Security talking about security Im not your man Sydney Curry being able to muscle and House people down low already 12 points 13 rebounds hes that guy Louisville has already got 26 points in the paint and man he has been a monster especially in the second half being in the pick up his scoring effort and take a look at his averages Brian coming into this afternoon he was averaging two and a half points and a shade under four rebounds and hes gone for a doubledouble first of the year fourth of his career and again I go back to my conversation with Kenny Payne and he talked about their schedule earlier on and trying to get this team to build up their confidence because she had a lot of guys that came back that did not have a lot of confidence coming into the season theres a lot of uncertainty about violations he didnt really get a chance to get many guys out of the portal and what he feels like is that his team is starting to kind of get it and one of these guys is Sydney Curry you look at how efficient hes been part of the whole thing is being able to have comfortability with a new coach in his system and hes starting to see it you see Ellis get more comfortable and now you see Sydney Curry having one of his best games so far this team Curry is a senior in his second year in the program Ellis at the free throw line 72 percent from the stripe on the season seven points right now for L Ellis and talking about Ellis weve seen him in being more of a facilitator yet Curry come with another offensive rebound Ellis has been a little bit more focused on turning up his aggression on the offensive end more of a distributor in the first half Ellis up to seven points despite that free throw Miss eight times this season he has gotten the double digits that includes his 30point game third best performance in the ACC this season Isaiah long had 36 in a win last Saturday against NC State thats the most by any player this year Isaiah long is showing there you know he picked up where he left all Flash and that Miami team is really good Jim larenegger has his guys coming back where you know what we talk about the Dukes and the virginias and obviously Virginia Tech Miami is one of those teams to be reckoned with this year and ranked in the top 25 along with Virginia Tech Virginia and Duke a couple of players go to the deck looking for the loose ball and that is Rattler basketball about the scrappiness from Florida a m again it seems like as soon as we see a little bit of daylight for Louisville look like theyre about to open this thing expand it to double digits then you see Florida a m being able to use that defense and the scrappiness to steal hang around in there 70 run right now for Louisville Currys tied his career high with 14 boards in this game hes got a double double leading scorer for the cards only player in double digits with 12 Bates couldnt handle the pass from Luis June all right Applause and that foul goes against Louisville but it was Sydney Curry he had a small enchantment on him and called for wiping them out second foul on Curry Brian we implore everyone to stay tuned for the fast break presented by your local Ford dealer we will touch on a number of subjects in and around the ACC and that includes the game coming up after Us Virginia Tech and Grambling Virginia Techs only lost this season Brian was in the Charleston classic they lost to the College of Charleston by two and thats it that was the title game of that event and you and I did them early as you see Sydney couldnt a big fella leading the break he got it back oh my God how about the challenge at The Rim I think it was Chapman number two in green who went up with him although and and again you see good defense by the Big Fellas like you know what dont dont let all this muscle fool you I can leave the break and you see Chapman come back and a lot of times for Biggs you see being able to run the floor and hes one of those guys if you give him a chance he will definitely put it on your head so Chapman was not whistle for the foul behind was Tariq Issa and he picked up the foul for the Rattlers and what turned out to be a really good foul I mean if youre a champion man I dont know if that was a smart business decision again holiday season you dont want to be part of anybodys poster Music done it all in a standing ovation from the assembled crowd here at KFC Yum Center for Sydney Curry the senior and its one of the things that hes playing with the energy and the effort and a lot of times that can be contagious and you see right now Louisville up by nine interesting to see the what FAMU gets out of this play right now Applause Rattlers have never LED in this game looking for three from Bates but silly pulls it in they did tie the game at 34 earlier in the half lands a little show and go he gets twisted to the floor awkwardly and he is shaken up on that Baseline lands Issa picked up the foul hes a good ball movement you see lands with a little step through right there getting his leg tied up going up for that shot with Issa so with 9 58 to go in the second half double bonus for Louisville freshman from Indianapolis Indiana careerhigh 15 points on Wednesday made three threepoint baskets and made all his free throws against the hilltoppers and heres one of the things too at the half Louisville only had 22 points and already 25 points in the second half as we go under the 10 minute mark and this is the largest lead of the game for the cards and that one is out of bounds to the rest of the bench with a illadvised crosscourt pass and again you do not want to give Louisville this opportunity to build off of that momentum so far theyve done a better good job of being able to take care in Advantage take care of the ball Applause how about Louisville eight of 11 this half Brian 73 for the floor Applause only half field able to regather shot clocks at 10 basilia if the dribble pass knocked away Issa was in the passing Lane Chapman Glides to the rip for two and the Rattlers refuse to go away and again what you keep seeing is a good solid defense and then lo2 turned into offense Applause trainer in the paint both sides of the rim Huntley Hatfield back iron two in tight chances for Louisville before the a m doing a good job of being able to come up with that that rebound and again still in the game being able to chip away as you see Jalen Rivers coming back into the game a 40 and rolling in the second half Chapman shot pocket eight foreign spins into a double and Bates just held his ground good job and then Ellis not being at a finish you can see Tillman still putting the pressure trying to get downhill lands fouled Tillman first on lands what youve been able to see is that when Florida a m gets a chance to be able to go in and attack putting them all downhill and Tillman has been that guy Louisville has given them opportunities with these turnovers to be able to get back into this game first trip to the line for Tillman in fact prior to that free throw rathers it on the attempt to three in the game substitutions for the Cardinals James number one Withers number 24 hes silly and lands to the Kenny Payne bench Applause first year head coach got that first win on Wednesday his team scored 94 points and shot 54 percent a season High and a win on Wednesday the Rattlers presenting a challenge to the villain their home court today Withers the kick trainer thats a tree ball and good good recognition by Jalen Withers realizing that you get downhill aggressive and see Tillman trying to get to the basket Louisville doing a good job of being able to get downhill and make the extra pass trainer again dribbles Applause five quick points to be able to extend this league up to 12 he only had one point in the first half hes got six now hes made it three his tenth of the season in his first two seasons Brian he only made Seven threes combined that hes got 10 this year well a lot of times were a player like that when you can see the ball going the hoop gives you a little bit of confidence its a little step back action by base coming up short Applause Music I like your thought but the execution needs a little work they could not collaborate the lead is 12 for the bill Applause Applause 5240 is the largest lead of the game for the Cardinals with 715 to go in our second half lets take a look at todays discover the best presented by The Fresh Market youre looking at for Ford a m Jalen Bates is giving them that shot of points and nine points by rebounds but but how about the effort by Sydney Curry today 13 points 15 rebounds efficient five for six hes definitely shown his presence in this game today 15 boards for curry who came into the game averaging just under four rebounds per game now what a performance by that young man five of six from the floor it is two games before today Brian he was five of seven from the floor so he has found the shooting touch now granted most of the time hes near the rim but you still got to finish the play well and heres the thing though is that you see him being able to get offensive rebounds and the putbacks they give him some postups but he has another a big very athletic they will get out on the break and be able to finish on the break as well they tried to get a debates it bounces on the end line Louisville ball Brian you remember when the Rattlers came back earlier in the half they tied the game at 34 that was at the 1410 Mark since that point Louisville on an 186 run against Florida a l and Louisvilles done a better job of being able to handle his press UC Jalen Withers oh he said no he was denied see June going up but the athleticism but has Lewis June going to block that those two players had to be about two and a half feet Above the Rim well again A lot of times you see guys with that type of athleticism it looks like Tom worm yet June was already up there waiting on him Victor thought he had an easy dunk but look at how high June goes up he saw him getting him to go up again look at that looks like Tom wormy man and you know what I also like Brian no call Great defensive Play Good aggression offensively they met in midair mind you and no whistle absolutely I actually didnt see her foul to be called Stevens thats a three and he was fouled in the process every time we talk about Louisville being able to possibly run away with this thing then Florida a m comes back you saw June with the big block on one end and then good ball movement they run Steve Stevens off with a stagger guys are late Withers makes the contact it could possibly be a fourpoint play and again you always teach the players you do not foul the shooter now Stephen goes and gets a chance to cap the composite Bill fourpoint play unable to finish off the old school fourpoint play Stevens had only attempted two free throws All Season prior to that again its just the second game of action in a rattler uniform this year Junior out of Washington DC Ellis got it back carving his way past three Defenders Applause and there was a foul great ball movement and then you saw L Ellis penetrate Kenny Payne is always talking about he wants multiple passes and after that you cap that all for the penetration watch the penetration by L Ellis realizing he gets the Finish to come over gets the ball dumps it off and then how about the finish by Mike James to James to the freethrow line remember this first win on Wednesday but their first three games of the Season were each losses by a single point well and you see again what looks like could have been another steal see the numbers and Stevens with a Im not sure he saw June almost for another highlight putback Tillman was stumbling off the glass and good for Tillman and how about Tillman I think that hes come out in Jordan Tillman has come out and had a great game sometimes the lefthanded guys are so hard to play because theyve got that little shiftiness to their game 14 points for Tillman December 22nd will be the next ACC game at NC State for this Louisville program Owen two so far in ACC play Ellis the road was closed goes for the three you see frustration for the kidney pain at last time he wanted to give JJ trainer a touch but he opted to float out to that threepoint line forcing LLC shoot the three Stevens again and thats a three you see Stevens with a yet another three time out again this Rattler team is not going anywhere again cutting that lead back down to seven that is eight points for Stevens Brian its a couple of Threes in this half and he saw Stevens again and I knocked that three and UC but a guy like that thats NBA range of UL Ellis you got to be able to close it close out on that easy Tillmans like man you know what yes I am feeling Im feeling it I told you Im feeling it Dominguez Stevens transfer from Seton Hall now he has a flare for the dramatic last year against Prairie View he hit a buzzer beating threepointer to win that game against Prairie View so hes been in those situations before and again just his second game this year for Stevens well and we talked at the beginning of the game Tom with the fact that they only returned five percent of the scoring from last year when you get a new team if you get a chance to play what you do is you build camaraderie you build confidence and I told you that the longest the the longer that they can hang around but yet offensive foul and another turnover Louisville has had a really hard time with this Florida a m press this is whats allowed them to stay in this game third foul on Ellis Applause so for the game the Rattlers are six of 16 on threepoint attempts and that includes two from Tillman and two from Stevens Tillman the leading scorer hes got 14 points on five of 11th shooter Music Applause trying to get Stevens back in the game he wanted to get Stevens in there for Chapman and now coach McCullum sends Chapman Into The Fray and it seems like coach Im feeling it man let me put it back in hes right behind McCullough you can see him Applause off the inbound Chapman short not a good shot by Chapman uh youve been able to get the offense you guys are a nice little offensive Rhythm shoot that contested shot with Sydney Curry right there in your face you could have got a better shot off of that one 16 boards for curry building on his career high Applause how about when he and DJ Burns get together for that game against NC State that ought to be entertaining all hands with a turnaround talking about two big dudes going at it meanwhile the outcome of this one long from being decided Tillman crafty move knocked away Chapman gathers it plenty of time on the shot clock Applause Music around James for Tillman trying to Corkscrew layup and got fouled in the play yes thats why defensive rebounding is so important that last possession Applause into a difficult shot and then Tillman being able to understand that I can attack the basket Ive got athletic guys are gonna come at me and I just have to make sure that I finish it and draw that foul Mike James picked up his third personal foul and Music the Rattlers continue to hang tough 5548 425 to go a new kind of superfood Hardys new supermarket and we welcome you back because were going to finish off this triple header with Grambling State visiting Brazilian Tech the Hokies theyve got a conference win against the Tar Heels Justin must have 27 and that one and theyll take on grumbling that is scheduled for four Eastern check your local listings for the game and time in your area Virginia Tech on a fivegame winning streak 70 at home ranked 24th in the nation one of four ACC teams and oh yeah the defending champs at the ACC tournament they won it against Duke of the title game in Brooklyn last year this year Brian were going to Greensboro North Carolina for the ACC tournament yeah and they go back to Justin must I mean this is the guy that can play at the next level because again he is a hes got Swiss army knife type skills where you can he can score he can defend he can be able to create meanwhile the Rattlers got it back through these June misses tapped around to Tillman theyve got time on the recycle Smith Tillman steps into it thats a three Curry gobbles it up it goes out of bounds and that is Rattler basketball and whats your final Louisvilles doing a good job with Defender but someones got to get in there to help Cindy Curry secure a secure rebound youre giving flam you multiple opportunities and theyve got a little bit of a rhythm you know Stevens has come out Tillman has shown he can make a shot and Bates so if youre Louisville youve got to secure this rebound after a good defensive possession Applause Music 4125 advantage on the boards for Louisville thats a tough shot from Stevens yeah that was a bad shot from Stevens and sometimes just because you shoot it doesnt mean that you need to that was a bad possession he can get a better shot Stevens anticipation almost had a steal trying to get around Withers that could have been a turnover for L Ellis but I put that on Jalen Withers again you got to be able to come to the ball you cant wait for it you allowed your man to come over youve got to be able to secure that pass Ellis Louis June defending now the double three and a half minutes to go in regulation and Ellis alertly pulls a timeout for the carts up by six 3 30 on the game clock do you think wed be in this situation Brian well heres the thing is that weve talked uh multiple times it seems that you and Louisville is going to be able to extend this lead but Florida a m has been able to use that trap you would think that you want to stay away from the sideline keep the ball in the middle keep that ball moving that last time L Ellis picks up his dribble and you get trapped they have had problems all afternoon long with this trap from Florida a m Music Louisville out in front for the vast majority of this game we retired early and then in the second half early on in that half Rattlers came back to tie this game at 34 curry with a doubledouble fourth of his career thats a career high in rebounds the turnovers though I mean that tells the story for Florida A M 21 points off of 20 Louisville turnovers right now that 20 turns the second most of the season and thats been the Achilles heel for this Louisville team we talked to delete the ACC and turnovers and yet what could have possibly been another turnover you see Kenny Payne telling Jaden litters hey keep it simple get the ball to L Ellis hes your point guard allow him you dont have to try to do the extra play Applause Music Applause Music and this is where you want your best player to take over El Ellis realizes theyve had problems with being able to score decides to put his head down Blows By His Defender and knows Im just gonna go ahead and get a bucket to be able to calm that run down nine points for Ellis all in the second half four of nine shooting Tillman misfires Bates over Curry and a foul against Louisville one of the things that weve seen especially for Florida a m is not so much just the turnovers is them being able to get the offensive rebounds with second opportunities you see this last play no one box Out Bait Currys on the backside of him and base gather himself hes a flex on you think you strong I got muscles too so Curry has three personals Bates does not finish off the threepoint play but does have 11 points on five of 11 shooting he and Tillman to double digits and the lone doubledigit score is curry for Louisville Ellis on the handle has nine he got swallowed up defensively Stevens lost it poked ahead and James see Stevens turnover and turn the ball over off of good defense Applause Defender chaplains coming back in Stevens leaves the lineup youve seen in the past a couple of penetrations by LL Ellis and I know he wants to be aggressive the next point lead with just a little less than three minutes right now the clock is your friend runs and plot run your set get a good look you do not have to go downhill Louisvilles led by as many as 12 in the second half largest of the game James into the corner Lance couldnt handle it and on their turnover and Tom this is the thing that kidney pain has talked about he doesnt want his guys to be robotic you see that last time James realizing that hey the play calls me to pass it and then now in Louisville up to 22 turnovers and this is again one of the things thats allowing this Florida a m team to be able to hang around Applause thank you the other issue Brian might be that Louisvilles only three of 14 in the game on threepointers the Rattlers shake up the lineup after making 13 threes for the cards on Wednesday season High if you have Florida a m you dont need a threepoint you got six points youve got plenty of time you got to get down downhill and the game for Louisville youve got to box out everyone goes to the glass two possession game with two minutes to go shot clock is inside a 10 for Tillman crosses it over in trouble but that help side defense by Sydney Curry he saw a Nifty move and so again you see Chapman getting ready to go downhill excuse me Tillman going downhill Sydney Curry going up good clean block its only four seconds traveling violation it was Stevens in the corner see Stevens head in his mind he had to shoot a three realizing that where the pass was he didnt have to take those extra steps he got a little Happy Feet right there and you see again a little extra step again sometimes you have to take what you was given to you that really is a critical turnover with 157 to go in regulation and heres the thing for Louisville you have to be able to get the ball in bounds you cannot Panic you dont want to get trapped Louisvilles never lost to a swac team 100 and the first alltime meeting between these two programs is one to remember and the cards string together a couple of wins after getting one on Wednesday and the first for Kenny Payne Ellis kicks it this is Lands shot clocks at five spins shoots and shorts bars has it Tillman and his 15 points on the dribble 115 to go on the game clock big stubble teams he came up short but silly has it for Louisville good defensive possession for Louisville again thats where you want to go give the big fella a touch interesting now if youre floating a m when do you look to foul again youve got youre under a minute youve got a two possession game Ellis drops it off Curry misses in close 40 seconds to go in regulation Brian still a two possession game three from the corner strong barge weak side and Tillman try to work off a screen bars has to shoot a three out of bounds out of bounds off both Louisville they are going to take a look at that there were certainly players from both teams of the vicinity as the ball bounced away and bars was forced to take the three Brian yeah and I thought that for for Florida a m they wasted time you didnt necessarily needed a three it was a quick two but then if you look at the replay right now you look at what possibly could have gone out of bounds off of Kamari lands from my point of view right there that looks like that may be Florida A M basketball and by the way that was Barrs first threepoint attempt all season and he really had no choice because they were late in the shot clock and heres the thing I thought that they exhausted too much time trying to look for the three in situations like that you go for a quick two and then youve shown that Louisvilles had problems with your pressure all afternoon long final two minutes of Regulation and overtime review for possession the call on the court is Rattler basketball so they must have indisputable video evidence to overturn that fall and support the ball being given to Louisville Champions number two lands his 22 for Louisville yeah it looks like just from again it looks like the deflection was off of plans interesting to see every angle right there that looks like thats got to be four to end and the basketball and Im sure obviously they want to take their time to make sure to get it right that was clear I totally agree with you Brian I think that angle right there is clear evidence to support the call originally which was Rattler ball are you confident enough just like if you were gambling would you put 50 bucks on it I might go higher than that hey I really thinking about this replay supplied by our outstanding technical crew this afternoon bringing you ACC basketball again the officials today AJ decides Jerry heater Chase Shaw Applause Jerry heater is coming our way to talk to Brian Oliver hits Applause so Brian Brian Oliver has the update from Jerry heater yeah he said that the ball never really it never touched the rims so now its going to stay at 224 Music ball Music plenty of time in this one 5751 it was a 2220 halftime lead for Louisville Tillman 15 points leading scorer for the Rattlers Applause and if youre basically the last thing you want to do is you want to foul and stop the clock and give Smith an opportunity to go to the line Oh I thought that would be number one took too much time to get into that into that play but then itll advise foul by basili all right Smith at the line for the first time today cant convert goes out of bounds the Cardinals Again Louisville up by six eighteen six left to go Music Applause look at the free play Smith misses that ball and then you see Bates come over there and again in Florida a m you want to play the foul game and try to extend This Game Force Louisville to be able to knock down free throws right now Louisville shot 16 for 23 free throws out a solid afternoon so Ellis to the line Brian hes one for three on free throws tonight Applause that was a confident stroke from Ellis Music again if he hits this were you talking about potentially a three possession game if Im for a m i dont necessarily need three I want to get a quick score and then continue to stretch this game out fellas with 11 points the double digits Curry came over theyre going to score the basket on the goaltending violation from curry in good penetration by Tillman you see the blowby took me and I understand hes got Curry puts it up high knows what the big guy is going to go after Music Applause yeah Applause Music so while we have a moment dont forget the third game of our triple header Grambling and Virginia Tech in Blacksburg Dean Lincoln Mike jaminsky standing by for the call of that one Applause so the last play was the goalten on Curry its about the only thing he hasnt done right today Sydney Curry 13 points 19 rebounds a career high for curry and Tillman on the other side for the Rattlers has a seasonhigh 17 points were hearing if youre in the Huddle of Louisville if youre Kenny Payne you draw up something simple to make sure that youve got Ellas coming to the basketball you dont want to crowd it and on the other end if youre Florida a m you try to deny that first pass and as soon as the ball goes you take that foul again you want to go ahead and put them on the line 11 115 seconds is still a lot of basketball believe it or not when youre down by only six its hard to win a college basketball sometimes it is it is but its interesting for me and you 115 seconds away from a second straight win this week for the bill if the score holds up this one did not come easy Ellis in the corner Chapman tried to tie him up foul them so Ellis back to the free throw line 11 points all of his points in the second half Brian he was Distributing in the first half with assists hes provided some scoring in the second half yeah we saw him decide to be a distributor at the beginning of the game to establish their Pace understanding they only had 22 points to begin at the end of the first half picked it up a little bit and started to be a little bit more aggressive trying to get to the basket tell us up to 12 points now with that free throw Applause Music dont forget to check your local listings for this game and Virginia Tech number 24 in the nation Blacksburg Castle Coliseum Lincoln jaminsky have it for you thats coming up next the final game of our triple header trying to solidify this one Curry just came out of the game to a rousing Ovation and why not Ellis with another free throw that should put a tight seal on this one 6153 Bates sacrobatic shot made it its only 13 seconds to go and thatll do it 61 55 Sydney curry with the double double curry with 13 points and 19 boards now its time to send it to Blacksburg Virginia and Castle Coliseum for Grambling in Virginia Tech Dean linke and Mike jaminsky Applause Music
