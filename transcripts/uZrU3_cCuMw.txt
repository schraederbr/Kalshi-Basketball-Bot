the officiating crew a veteran group for the second meeting between these two teams here this season ball in the air here we go from Little Applause John early on shein with the touch a Clemson team thats won five of its last six games big win over Florida State on Saturday turned over bub Carrington The Freshman from Baltimore taking it away and Clemson has had some turnover problems in ACC play so you got to avoid that they did a nice job getting back on defense because this Panther team they like to get out and go if they can freshman jayen low kick to the corner wide open triple bang how about that start from pit the team that leads the ACC and three point makes a game well Zach Austin who just made that shot he made over 123s at High Point before transfering to pit and theres another turnover the Tigers two possessions two turnovers we saw the starting lineup just a moment ago for the Tigers Hunter shefflin Clark Gerard and Hall maybe an AllAmerican now pit Henson Carrington low Federico Austin jayen Lows insertion into the starting lineup just a couple of weeks ago has changed the complexion of the team for pit they are nine and two in their last 11 talked about Blake Hinson before the game and Jack Clark is matched up against him thatll be an interesting matchup to watch all night long shein had a big game against pit back in early December 17 rebounds he ripped down the most by a tiger since Trevor Booker did it way back in the day another jumper count it Carrington again a good sign here for the Panthers on the road and its a good sign that they were able to play in transition Carrington is not a great threepoint shooter but when he can get in the lane for that short jump shot he is extremely Music dangerous five nothing Panthers early on Jeff cable was worried about the physicality that Clemson might bring but right now early on pit is up for the challenge that the balls got to go to PJ Hall and he needs to attack feder Rico he faded away thats not the way to get after feder Rico feder Rico Baseline Drive and Austin couldnt knock it down Zach Austin the transfer from High Point a three and D specialist he made a three and then missed the layup that drives you crazy if youre a coach down low Hall trying to wrap it around o late whistle calls and PJ Hall will go to the line the senior from Spartenburg this is not a very good pass to PJ Hall and hes got a struggle to catch it and now he thought he was further under the basket I think then he really was and so he tried to go under the basket to score I think if he goes straight up he might have an and one opportunity and as Hall goes to line for a couple of free throws good shooter on the year Dan what are you looking at for both of these teams early on well Clemson they have to they have to avoid turning the ball over and of course theyve turned it over twice already but if you are going to turn it over you cant have transition turnovers cuz Carrington in particular is extremely dangerous in the open court and for Clemson you know theyve got some power on the inside and they have to use it you know feder Rico is very tall and very athletic but hes pretty skinny and I think you can go after him you look at pits hot streak 82 in the ACC since January 20th struggle to start in their first six games it corresponds with the insertion of jayen low into the starting lineup with Ishmael Leed coming off the Music bench its the Panthers by four there he is they call him JLo jayen low The Freshman knocking down the triple and in conference play he shoots more than 39 from out there particularly with the shot clock running down you got to make sure he doesnt get quite as clean a look theres a big bucket there for the Tigers Hunter who has been playing very well as of late when when Chase Hunter plays well usually the Clemson Tigers play well Hunters been in double figures 10 of his last 11 contests 16 big points against Florida State on Saturday in the wind the tiger sweeping the noes on the season theres a defense stop for Clemson jg3 he can get hot in a hurry Clark oh boy that ball was sent to Applause Colombia well we talked about threepoint shooting and the guys we talked about havent made a three yet but heres jayen low hes one of Pits better threepoint Shooters and Zack Austin had five blocks the other day and hes already got his first one today Jeff cable talking about Austin said we know he can shoot to three we want to see it improve a little bit but that defense has been hit big for us over the last couple of games shaan cant knock down the Trey Ball so far the tigers are taking either long shots or contested shots and theyre not anywhere close to offensive rebounds wson was able to hold off pit back in early December in the steel city nice move did everything but finish low staying with it and hes earned a second chance here for the Panthers PJ Hall never saw him coming and low I think he had a basket except he slipped and fell Applause down this is a tough matchup for Gerard green s Carrington into the teeth of that defense driving Baseline patient foul called is hall went into the air on the pump lets take a look at our Star Stories for players that have been crushing it of Le brought you by crush and you look at is leget coming off the bench here for pit it has changed their season in attack mode and Jack Clark look at the numbers as hes gotten healthy and gotten back into the starting lineup of course being healthy is really important Clemson missed him early in the season and Ishmael Lega you just got to tip your hat to him at his previous stop at Rhode Island he was a starter all the time and thats an adjustment but hes you know I talked to him earlier he just wants to win and hes willing to do anything thats necessary nice pass inside federo federo cant connect we youre not going Im P this missed two Point Blank Range shots so far here Applause early RJ Godfrey a touch trying to hook it in t grabs his own board and he walks Shuffle those feet four turnovers for Clemson in the early going you know and thats really tough Clemson has one field goal and four turnovers thats not normally a recipe for success and the other problem for Clemson the reason godfre is in the game is PJ Hall picked up another early foul and you mentioned he was in foul trouble the other day and that I mean they were able to beat Florida State even though he was in foul trouble but PJ Halls got to figure out a way to stay in the game just 16 minutes against the nolles PJ averaging just nine points per game over his last two contests the Tigers would love for him to stay on the court and get going Drive kick free ball in the corner back iron not there for guo Diaz Graham this Spaniard and thats what pit likes to do they like to spread you out drive the ball kick it out for a three speaking the threes one of the best to ever do it in the ACC Joe Gerard thei knocks it down from the parking lot you just cannot relax against Joseph Gerard I mean you may think well hes not ready yet but hes always ready hes always ready he was ready against pit the first time is low the silencer Gerard had 20 5 Points and six threes against the panther so theyve seen it up Music close so far pit has been able to get in the lane against Applause Clemson JLo has been fun to watch early on hes got five and the lead four by pit Clark midrange Jay got it smooth looking stroke good movement and thats what you have to do against this pit Music defense you know in conference play Clemson really has only one guy Gerard that you really have to worry about and thats what the numbers show from the threepoint line jumper low goes down foul call is on Joseph Gerard we talked about Joseph Gerard II hes coming up the court you think hes just settling in well know hes lining you up for that shot youve got to get after him early and jayen low has done a great job with this floater in the lane he is so good getting in the lane drawing the defense if you come to him and hes kicking it out for a three if you dont hes really good with that floater want to remind you tomorrow here on acc Network eighth rank Duke squares off against Louisville at seven Eastern followed by the premiere of Coach K and Roy Williams Rivals reunited a one hour special featuring coaching Legends Mike shashki and Roy Williams sitting down together for an extensive conversation for the first time since their college coaching careers began over 40 years ago your good friend West Durham hosts should be a lot of fun thats the perfect host for something like that 128 hit hunter three from the right wing no Hunter has shot the ball better recently that was a tough one that was a bad pass he had to reach way down to get it and once you do that its hard to bring it up and make that three Conor almost got it slanging into D Applause Hinson call basket interference the ball wasnt going in anyhow but how about that Hinson hes stuck in there he throws it off the board to himself and then tries to tip dunk it in right off the yard that guys got some flare telling you but he hadnt had a shot I guess he had one shot hes got no points definitely 24 double figure scoring games 12 games of 20 points for Blake Hinson a stud who at 22 over the weekend against the hes in that win goet turning trying to getat some space Oh how about the patience and the Finish from RJ gthree a pit bench is wondering why there wasnt three seconds called everybody over there waving three and they werent talking about his shot Clon had some success early on in the paint Godfrey converting that time 126 rebounds against Florida State over the weekend Rod ronell saying that was his best game as a tiger and speaking of guys whos been around the block Jeff capable a Coach K disciple you see his his resume so far Dan Jeff has just been so good for them over the last couple years he got the patience that he needed and hes turned pit right back to being one of the PRI programs of the ACC program was so far down he has he and his staff have done an outstanding job building the pit program back up they a big ticket item now they a tough ticket to get in Pittsburgh Applause again Carrington jumper the three ball yes now that was a contest of three and Carrington is a guy in conference play only shoots 25 from out there so I think if youre the Tigers you can live with that one you team has played manto man so far chlin working down low gets to that preferred right hand and through and thats where Clemson has an advantage pits guys are tall in there but theyre not very Applause bulky theres iset has the match up against shein oh high off the bank did he call it looks smooth counts anyway leg gets a guy who can come off the bench hes pits leading rebounder he can drive the ball to the basket he can shoot the three and he can make ridiculous looking bang shots clearly leget at 17 against the Tigers in their first meeting where a mismatch inside sheflin had Leed on his back they didnt find him H oh Big Block theyre inside by Diaz Graham now a tie up possession arrow will go to pit this has been an emotional game so far how about the boom box bringing the Vibes early pit has been rolling as of late the Tigers trying to protect home court weve got a good one early on at Little John well pits looking to finish strong here down the stretch a similar position that they were one season ago Dan would you make of their resume so far here on the bubble well this is a big game for pit uh pit is in a situation Jeff Cap his guys trying to play their way into the NCA tournament they lost five of their first six in conference play but they were still struggling to put the team together and the move of low into the starting lineup and leged coming off the bench has really fueled them theyre playing as well as anybody in the league right now but all those games ear early games count so they just have to keep winning and this would be a quad one opportunity a quad one win for them tonight if they can get it a huge game for the Panther and pit of course knocking off Virginia too another three there from leg the Panthers have four of them the pit Panthers have six guys on their team who have made at least 15 threepoint field goals in ACC play so we talked about Blake Hinson and yes hes a great threepoint shooter but theyve got a lot of guys that can get it out there and knock it down they lead by eight on the road a team that isnt afraid of playing away from the Pete as Hall does good work there to draw with a foul PJ Hall will go to the line and Clemson has had their success inside but pit has done a nice job this time against a Clemson Zone just moves the ball a couple times and leg it with his wide open now Clemson has chosen to take the ball inside theyve already got eight inside points and thats what theyve been able to do get the ball close and PJ leaves it short do want to remind you that its Saturday right here on acc Network and the ESPN app will have a Lacrosse double header that starts at 1100 am eastern the 7th ranked North Carolina womens team hosting number five Notre Dame and then its a mens match up between number eight Johns Hopkins and number two Virginia DJ splits him at the line hes got two points and if Clemson for Clemson to have their maximum success PJ has to play well on the inside for him and you have to wonder picking up that quick first personal foul if hes going to be a little bit conservative on the drive oh missed the dunk Diaz Graham did everything but throw it down PJ Hall that was a smart play because he got beat out on the perimeter and he just hung back didnt try to block it Confidence from these pit Panthers and how could you not have it Austin dials up a triple well now thats Austins second three and as we mentioned hes one of those guys whove made at least 15 but he shoots under 30 from out there although as we mentioned he made 129 in two years at High Point its five ass six from Beyond The Arc down low trouble Wiggins on the catch back to Godfrey turning trying to face and Godfrey cant knock it down the entire pit defense is collapsing on the inside you got to be able to find people on the perimeter they are going to say that leg get stepped out of bounds a discussion by our officials well was it a foul or was it out of bounds play and here Diaz Graham the Godfrey comes over and helps and I think that threw Diaz Graham off just a little bit but Austin hes not off hes made two of his threes made both his threepoint attempts about this defensive start from pit Clemson has made five shots from the floor they have four turnovers when you throw the ball inside the defense collapses you got to give the guy some place to throw it thats a tough shot what has happened so far is the balls going in and the Clemson guys on the outside are just standing they got to get themselves in the field of vision of the guy with the ball in an open area so he can throw it to him little ice so there and a travel wow Clemson out of sorts here in this first half and thats a pretty good way to put it thats now five turnovers for the Tigers and thats just a situation where Carrington surprised Gerard what do you make of this so far Dan what is pit doing to cause this hesitation from Clemson pit is playing with tremendous intensity and we said this is this is a desperation kind of game for the pit Panthers there a pit team again hes not a afraid being on the road they have six true Road wins on the year thats third in the country nice drive there it couldnt knock it down was low Lows gotten that shot anytime hes won he hadnt made them all the Tigers over three minutes now without a bucket from the floor you got to get better ball movement and player movement Balls got to go side to side heres jg3 Gerard trying to create something turn around jumper not there that allows pit into transition Le it stops no look pass layup Federico no boy feder Rico has missed a couple at Point Blank Range Diaz Graham missed the dunk the tigers are fortunate theyre not further behind Hunter turning Fade Away jumper and the midrange Jay stops the drought thats a basket the Tigers badly needed but again oneonone play and thats thats a tough shot it was well defended 16 against Florida State and 18 against Georgia Tech right before that blow inside little Runner leaner no loose ball Carrington picked it up Tigers just not able to secure it Carrington midrange back iron and the long rebound to Wiggins now the the pit Panthers they they get the ball up there theyre not afraid to shoot it theyre not trying to play run time off the shot clock when theyre open they let it go PJ wants a three got it from the logo it is impossible to describe how big that is for the Clemson Tigers PJ Hall is a guy who can really shoot it from out there and yet in conference play hes under 30 thats got to be a huge confidence booster all trying to get the Clemson faithful into it one of the best home advantages in the ACC pit for their last five from the floor Clemsons Ds turned up a notch Henson still quiet and this one a star on the attack count it right on Q Blake Hinson Hinson I mean he does a great job shooting the three and he drives the ball to the basket you got to try to make him a midrange jump shooter and here were going to get a foul against feder Rico folling PJ Hall pit still up seven Clemson working their way back into it here in the first half our crust with more flavors than anyone else like the garlicky seasoned cheese and our garlic epic stuff Crust Pizza were talking Papa Johns iconic garlic sauce flavor mixed with the Clemson Tigers got his team to 9 and0 to start the season and that was the best start since 08 seven postseason appearances the tigers are well positioned here for an eighth Clemson has played very very well in the nonconference part of the schedule and thats really what has helped them as they struggled early in conference play and think about this now Clemson has lost three conference games by one point and they lost the fourth conference game in overtime where they had a free throw to win the game and missed it so Clemson theyre N9 and seven in the conference but they are really close to being 13 and three this is a really quality Clemson team they have been one of the best teams in the ACC on the court but here tonight they have struggles to get into their offense pit defense has been active itll stay with the Tigers there they have coughed it up five times the Clemson offense is super efficient when they protect the ball they just look a little out of sync and its its not that theyre not playing hard its just they just look a little out of syn right now and so all they have to do until they get themselves rolling is stay in the game and theyve done that so far and they had 23 bench points on Saturday against Florida State a big reason reason why they won just two of them so far here in this first half thatll stay with the tiger so another chance just four point two though on the clock that ball should have gone to BJ Hall immediately he was open and by the time he got the ball out there from three Diaz Graham was close enough to contest the shot thats what Im talking about Clemson is just a little bit off right at the moment as Beetle realized inside Hall realizes turn around Jay oh gravity didnt pull it through well I thought that was going down that was a tough shot and Diaz Graham was right there to defend Music it Diaz Graham wide open three back iron he has been torching the Nets and ACC play here this season from Beyond The Arc hes a high percentage low volume threepoint guys already missed two tonight thats going to be a foul I think on Austin so all that stuff that went on after sheflin shot the ball is immaterial because Austin fouled him on the Music catch thats a lot of banging to take for just the ball out of Music bounds hean chlan has been so important to what Clemson does they are plus 114 on the year when hes on the court hes a guy who just everything he seems to make the right decisions things flow very well when they flow through him Jeff capril pits head coach called him the ultimate blue guy shot clock under 10 winding down Beetle to his preferred left hand trying to turn creating theres chlin on the put back not Applause there these teams are playing like this is a big game I think everybodys a little bit tight they heard Dan boners in the house pit leads by seven conferences second leading score Blake Hinson has just two points oh what a pass wow and then a foul cold on Clemson sheon thought he had a block what about the no look feed there from low wow this is a play where he just gets right by Clark tips it away and I dont know how low even saw him in there Applause and that you when you come when you swing your arm down like that and come through the other guys body the officials are going to call that a foul every time first free throw off the mark Saturday afternoon the first baseball game of the season on acc Network as Miami playing the second game of a threegame series with fourth ranked Rivals Florida our coverage beginning at three Eastern from Alex Rodriguez Park in Coral Gables also available on the espnl a Diaz Graham left two points at the line there hes he hadnt been to the line that much in conference play only a 67 shooter Halls hit one three that one rims out thats a good look and I I think the threepoint shooting for PJ Hall becomes a confidence thing if hes open hes got to take them shoots it at 33 on the year from be on the arc but under 30 in conference play I just feel like Dan if he can increase that average and have that be a part of his game even more he can have a long NBA Music career shot clock didnt reset Henson at the buzzer lets it Fly and the Tigers get the stop Hall reaching High into the sky for and interestingly enough thats hinsons first threepoint attempt of the game points have been hard to come by as of late and and Hunter will try and end that half the line its a Clemson team thats won five of its last six games you see the conference record you see the net pretty good numbers and some really good wins on the year for Brad brownells team well that strength to schedule is really impressive remember Clemson is the only team to beat Alabama at Alabama this year they handed TCU tcus first defeat in a game that was neutral Court up in Canada so the number five seed is Joe lardys ition but as I say this is a very very solid Clemson team and its got to be encouraging for them that chase Hunter has you know hes driven the ball to the basket a couple times hes got the score well I think for Clemson to be at their best oh Hunters got four points knocks down the free throw that snaps a 3 minute and 12 second scoring drought for the Tigers neither team is particularly red hot here recently that win over Bama Dan snapped Bamas 19 game home winning streak and then pit snap uvas home winning streak just a couple of months later now you made the point pit has played extremely well on the road they beat Duke in Cameron Jeff capable I asked him how big of a win was that he said you know what was bigger was beating Georgia Tech the very next day it showed me maturity and a sign that this team understood the mission of the Season Henson down low they got it to their star and hes fouled hell go to the line Hinson has done a really nice job being patient waiting for his opportunities he hasnt tried to force anything from three but hes gone down inside and this is just I mean he gets great position inside theres a pretty good pass good catch he collects himself now interestingly enough hes not a particularly good free throw shooter either only about two out of three hon hits the first T talking more about the Duke wi that Coach K used to say teams it was in the 90 percentile I should say right after they beat Duke would lose to the Blue Devils and so he challenged his team right after it and what a streak its been for them nine of their last 11 games well we talked about how hinsons not a great free throw shooter 66 in conference play but those look pretty good again hes been very patient he hadnt tried to force anything here Music early its a sevenpoint advantage on the road for pit Hunter swings it out Clark pump fakes Cross Court pass deflected turnover and its a three on two here for the Panthers Bob Carrington all the way to the rocket rimmed out on him boy PIV Carringtons missed a couple layups that it wasnt an easy shot but thats one hes normally going to make and as I say feder Ricos missed a couple Diaz Graham has missed to dunk the Panthers theyre ahead in the game but theyve missed some easy opportunities no doubt Dan Gerard three straight away Splash and and you cant afford to miss many easy opportunities against this Clemson team another multi threepoint game for Joseph Gerard III Gerard just keeps moving R ronell saying he just keeps getting more comfortable with every game Dan you agreed with him and shoot around earlier this morning well the more I watch jard the more he look the more comfortable he looks with this Clemson team big response there from Le leget had his toe on the line so thats a two but leget has I mean hes made some important baskets so far in this game for the Panthers Jeff cable said leget really embraced the role of coming off the bench for the team said hes a starter in my eyes traveling violation Hall walked the seventh Applause turnover well Carrington is a guy who can get into the lane and this is I mean its a tough shot but he missed misses it and because he misses it that allows Clemson to get out and go and Joe Gerard moving without the basketball finally gets it and knocks down to Music Applause three what a drive Strong finish there from Leed Leed coming off the bench we talked about how important he has been for the Panthers and he has done a great job Off the Bench already nine points in the game tonight time out taken by the Tigers and Brad Brownell well its been pit so far in the first half one of the best Shooters in conference history trying to keep Clemson 3123 pit leading Clemson here by eight early on well it was the Tigers who knocked off the Panthers earlier this season and pit trying to get its revenge and what is a even more critical point now of the year you can basically smell March its coming I dont know whether you can smell it or not but its its very close delicious and you know that that other game that was in December thats almost like a year ago both had coaches or adamant were different teams at this Music point Gerard Drive floater rattles Music through thats an underrated part of JG 3s game hes got eight and he gets in there hes big enough that he can score he has a problem sometimes driving by quicker guys oh he picks up a foul Applause there that is Gerard second and Joe Gerard is a guy who he shoots the three so well youve got to pay close attention to him and theres a lot of contact in there and he just fights through it all transferring from Syracuse at the beginning of the year but hes 62 he weighs 190 lb hes a good siiz kid Danny hit the 2000 Point plateau of his career against his former team earlier this Applause Music month that rattles arounds not going to be their foul called going the other way its on Diaz Grant he got caught reaching over the back that time nice block out by Josh Beetle and thats you know Diaz Graham has three personal fouls Federico feder Rico has you know he hasnt played particularly well so far so that really limits Pits depth now feder Ricos got two fouls so Diaz Graham has three feder Rico has two the Panthers are going to have to go a little bit smaller lineup Jeffers has been a valuable contributor Off the Bench Jeff hes only about 6 s and Diaz Graham and ped Rico are both close to 7 ft back door cut thats pretty and Hunter fouls how about the feed for the shefflin great action run by the Tigers really nice screen by PJ Hall and Clemson is doing a better job here later on in the first half moving without the basketball I mean Harrington just gets picked off and Jeff Jeff has to help on that and he doesnt nice cut by Hunter thats a Clemson team that on the year hasnt gotten to the free throw line at a ridiculous a ridiculous rate I should say Saturday they attempted 30 free throws against Florida State and they knocked down 24 of them one of the best free throw shooting teams there was a lot of fouls in that game and Hunter Cashes in somehow its just a fourpoint game Jeffers has left the game so pit going very small three guards along with Hinson and Austin Carrington going to do it at the buzzer he feeds it instead and I think Austin shot came after the horn sounded it did indeed and the Panthers really controlled the first half seven times in the first half but five of those were very early and the the Clemson Tigers cleaned that up at the end of the half and neither team has shot the ball well but the Tigers have done a nice job staying in the game and now cutting it to Music four should be a fun final of 20 Music minutes here in the baletto State Panthers are going to have to get Blake Hinson involved if theyre going to win this game Hinson has only attempted four shots only one three and that was a wild thing at the end of the shot clock so he has he has yet to attempt a real threepoint Basket in this game Clemson has done a nice job containing him stats that may or may not matter pit is 15 and one this season when leading at halftime well thats a nice stat I dont know that means a thing exactly low step back clock lineing down oh he got nothing but air they were trying to get the ball to Hinson in scoring position that time and they spent most of the shot clock doing it and Clark did an excellent job defending Hinson and Clark has been the guy on Hinson most of the game so far L did have big points in the first half seven of them on the drive immediately Gerard showing you initiative getting to the rack thats a couple of times now weve seen Clemson take advantage of pit trying to overplay on defense nice pass by shefflin and Joe Joseph Gerard we talk about his threepoint ability but again hes big enough and strong enough that he can score inside that time he got fouled talk about score and this is where he scores very well tops in the ACC this season 88 from the free throw line thats actually number three excuse me when conference games he is now 66 of 68 make that 67 to 69 hes taken 69 free throws in conference play hes missed two of them hes got 10 points that was right the first time he does lead the leag in free throw percentage hes third all time in free throw percentage JJ retic leading that one and the Panthers theyre a team 44 of their shots come from Beyond The Arc but they cant rely strictly on the threepoint basket good ball movement Paul couldnt catch it cleanly now hell go back to the basket game against feder Rico hook shot Skies it it rolls off the rim chlin doing what he does best battling down low a foul called on hin that is a good move by PJ Hall feder Rico does a really good job making it a tough shot and then hint sheflin just does what sheflin does look hes already got great rebounding position just holds his spot and is able to claim that rebound Gerard out an ocean now looking inside ball poked away turned over leg it open cour shoulder down hall not in his house Gerard a little bit disgusted with himself that he lost that ball but his teammate bails him out legga thinks hes got a lane to the basket but PJ Hall is right there and Hall can afford to be aggressive in this half he only has the one personal foul thats the first block for Clemson tonight Henson firing rims out PA cleans the glass thats his first real threepoint Applause attempt one of the call didnt get it Panthers down the other way low what a move to get to the rack that time couldnt finish again well that was a tough Applause shot shaffin counter and the foul Music sheflin does a great job getting position inside and what a great pass by PJ Hall if they call that foul on feder Rico on Hinson so hes got two quick ones here in this Applause half Chaplan knocks down the free throw in the first lead of the game for Clemson little 5 spurk I mean just a great job by Clemson they looked a little out of syn to start the game but they just battled back weve got a good one here down the stretch folks buckle up leg it no feder Rico kicks it out Henson steps back jumper air ball feder Rico again had it poked away a scrum and a foul called how about the efforts by the Panthers on that offensive possession its great defense by Clark I mean Hinson had one that could have been wide open but Clark cut him off and then he makes Hinson step back and this legan is a guy whos always around the ball he leads the Panthers in rebounding just because hes so aggressive leging knocks it down tomorrow ACC Network eighth ranked Duke squaring off against against Louisville at 7 Eastern followed by the premere of Coach K and Roy Williams Rivals reunited a 1h hour special featuring coaching Legends Mike cheski and Roy Williams they sit down together for their first time in 40 years for extensive conversations and its going to be a lot of fun hosted by West Durham Panthers 0 for seven from the field to start the half Pittsburgh Le taking the lead Hons got to be careful he didnt want to pick up a third foul short jumper Gerard thats layup not a good idea to leave Music him hes got 12 now den and the tigers are invested in this one leg it lost it foul on Hunter he f this is just a situation where Hunter is being a little overly aggressive he reaches his arm and grabs him by the shoulder you just follow him along there he had help on the Music interior theres no doubt this Clemson team has elevated to another level when it star point guard plays exceptionally well Henson that time the patience and the finish at the rack Thomson brought the double team but it was a little too late and when Hinson gets the ball right there he rarely passes it hes got six back and forth we go early on in the second half Chaffin to that right hand lost the handle on it Hall little jumper Splash Beyond The Ark three PJ Halls got a pair of them I think hes surprised PTO Rico by stepping back PTO Rico I thought was in pretty good position but he didnt follow that step back and that gave Hall the room to shooting low foul called its on the Applause floor thatll take us to a immediate timeout second leading score in the AC Henson getting going but PJ Hall this is his home court and he Corner Trey Ball so an awesome tournament at our nations capital here this season Dan take a look at this bracket here if the season ended well all the way over on the right there those are the teams right at the moment if we started today they would have the double buy you can see both Clemson and pit are in the other category and that they can still play their way into the double bu but theyre just worried about winning games right now Syracuse with a big lead right at the moment over Virginia Tech youd like to stay out of that far left hand column cuz he just as too many games to win to win the tournament pit has started the second half shooting very poorly only one for eight in fact they made some threes to start theyre nine of their they were four of their first five theyre one for their last 10 big steal in the open court Hunter not able to finish but hes Applause fouled that is only the second pit turnover of the game Ste thats just a lazy pass by low that onehanded pass particularly in traffic like that and Hunter read it all the Music way you know Clemson has started to make baskets and interestingly enough psych psychologically when you start to make basket your defense picks up and so were seeing both things and because the defense picks up Clemson is getting easier opportunities so pit has to find a way to fight through this dry spell theyve got to get Hinson more involved you and I were talking at halftime it almost felt like a win for Clemson the way that first half win to only be down four well particularly the way that first half started Clemson did a nice job battling back theyre shot out of a cannon here early in the second half much like they did against Florida State on Saturday theyre outscoring pit 12 to four Austin Drive in the jam and the Applause whistle so Josh beetle is the one they called for that foul and this is great job by pit moving the ball and the pump fake hes made a couple of threes has Austin so you got to go out there and guard him and Jos thats really optimistic by Josh Beetle to think hes going to block that shot thats one where you just get out of the way but guards always think theyre going to block bigger guys shots threepoint play Austins got nine big points here now for pit thats his first his first points in a while he scored those two threes early in the game hunter put him on skates had to hit the shot though for the Highlight back iron really good tip by Hinson he didnt get that rebound but he was in the midst the three Clemson guys and tipped to to his teammate hinsons got to help his teammates by working a little harder to get open wide open Diaz Graham that rims out how about shefflin tipping it out to Beetle now pit continues to struggle from behind the Music ark and now one for their last 10 from the bonus spere Beetle couldnt hit the three thatll be Panther basketball right now PJ Hall looked to me as if he had an open look and he passes it up to Josh Beetle and even though PJ Hall in conference play is only shooting 29 from the Josh beetle is shooting 7 in conference play so you know maybe Josh beet was open for a reason out there beetle in conference play is now 1 for 14 from Beyond the off I would say shooter shoot but then you would come back with well youre not a shooter I would say get closer nice job by low and thats what Pitt was able to do earlier in the game Clemsons been able to cut off that drive into the lane lately low now with nine Hall that one rims out theyve had a couple of them go in and out thats one of those ones where Hall if he takes it the first look then thats pretty good thats probably good but he you know was did the pump fake and then that threw his shot off I think almost too high for Austin he was able to use all six seven of them we got two ties and six lead changes here in the second half Hinson trying to get going and Hinson can make that shot tough contested long threes I think thats his best thing there you go get closer Beetle drives the ball to the basket when you miss a long three sometimes thats like it turn turnover nice job by Clemson getting that out quickly yet another lead Music change this is the type of game we expected its been fun so far partner foul call is that on PJ Hall it is and is that number three it is now his third he only had one at halftime right they picked up an early one here in the second so now Hall and jg3 each have three see and now thats the the kind of foul that PJ Hall has been picking up theres no reason to commit that foul that far from the basket against Diaz Grant Hall moved into 10th in Clemson scoring history in the first half Henson that one off ball loose whos going to pick it up somehow pit comes away with the basketball low steps into a three the Lefty trigger at the horn no big rebound for Clark Applause Music Applause and another throw away from Clemson was great defense in transition by leot Dylan Hunter was rolling through the lane and leot got in the way forced him to stop and he had to try to pass back and he threw it out of bounds her into the back court just a second turnover here of the half by the Tigers again they head those five early and they got that under control heres legot one of the best sixth men in the ACC head down trying to get through really good defense from Clemson little bit too much oneonone at the moment for the Panthers Beetle the tear drop wont be their offensive foul calls its low in there taking the charge this is a charge you rarely see call anymore and lo I mean hes waiting for him but looks like his heels may be on the line of the restricted Music AR but I mean he was waiting there all day for him you have to be established before the Airborne shooter plants his foot before he leaves the floor boy thats really close but I mean hes standing there waiting for him thats one where Beetle just has to pull that one up back to back turnovers now for Applause Music Applause Clemson heres the Freshman hes got a matchup he likes the blow by and a foul cols its Godfrey whistle as always but Godfrey that time you know when a a guard like that is quick enough and drives by you you dont have to try to get in front of him or on the side of him you can get behind him and still contest the shot no help there because pit had the floor spread L an excellent free throw shooter 82 coming in and he knocks it down to tie this game Saturday right here on accn and the ESPN app we have a Lacrosse double header it starts at 1100 am eastern the seventh ranked North Carolina womens team hosts number number five Notre Dame and then its a mens match up between number eight Johns Hopkins and number two Applause Virginia blows back into double figures 12 times in 13 ACC games hes really played well hes helped keep the Panthers in it here in the second half when they have shot the ball so poorly and I mean that Pits got to feel pretty good about the score right at the moment because Hinson simply hasnt been a fact offensively and yet they still lead by one low set Zack Austin Blake Henson and ish legett really took him under his wing when he got here earlier this season how about shefflin little midrange jumper but shefflin is just too big and strong for jeffris down on the inside Chefs got seven and nine offensive foul di Graham illegal screen that is the fourth on Diaz Graham this game has all the intensity of a game he is a guy that has really had a good season and now hes got seven points in this game to go along with his nine rebounds the key there is though Diaz Graham just went to the bench with his fourth foul federo has three fouls a guy like shefin who has played so well this year has a chance to operate in side because pits saddled with foul trouble we talked about the threepoint basket Arya and how important it would be well in the second half pit is 0 for seven from Beyond The Arc Clemson one for four Its Made A Difference hasnt it so threepointer still going to be important but guys have to start making them guys like jg3 and Blake Henson can heat up in a hurry nice feed down low finish not there Godfrey battling as was Wiggins that was a shot the Clemson thats one they really need to make thats exactly what we were talking about they get the ball inside against feder Rico whos in foul trouble just cant convert its been over 3 minutes since pit hit a shot from the floor the Tigers defense has ramped it up heres jeffris against chlin right hand through contact no and a offense feder Rico I think feder Rico coming over the back and if thats true thats four personal fouls 33 they said its his third okay so I okay yes thats a foul you push the guy in the back with the official standing right there looking at you usually thats a foul so hes not now hes got three fouls fed didnt look over here but he might have said hey dont foul me out of this game not yet give me a second they need his big body down there dont they they do they also need some offense from Hinson there the Tigers and by one chlin just hit one from there a moment ago that one rolls off the Applause Music rim pick and roll feder Rico that time made no mistake Clemson just did a poor job getting back on defense I think they were trying to find Hinson and as a result they lost feder Rico go great roll to the basket for feder Rico feder Rico the Junior from Finland hes not going to shoot jump shots for you but he can do that under 10 now on the shot clocking Gerard five wow deep shot oh my gosh oh baby jg3 I mean hes been doing that this you know for five years now nobody should be surprised he is closing in on 400 career threes step back the response how do you like that from Carrington again thats not the best part of Carringtons game its part of his game but that is a big big shot for the Applause Panthers Gerard inside leaning in skips it now to Godfrey Godfrey fouls after a couple of nice moves to free himself Applause up well feder Rico hes really good at setting that screen in the middle of the floor right there and then just rolling to the basket and Gerard I I mean thats you talk about a contested three thats the definition of a contested three and who they call that foul on Hinson Hinson thats three okay three on Hinson three on feder Rico Diaz Graham on the bench with Music four God fory just a 56 free throw shooter the Tigers need this one from him couldnt do it and a deficit still one for the homestanding Tigers and the danger for the Tigers is if Hinson gets hot then they have a big problem oh my goodness gracious Carrington right now is the one on a heat check thats really a nice play by Carrington again he comes in in conference play only shooting 25 from out there Hunter through contacts time out taken Brad Brownell just called the time Applause yeah back and forth we go here at little jum trading threes here between the Panthers and the Tigers Hunter finishing through that tough contact hell be at the line when we come back lets take a look at what Joey brackets has for us here you got five ACC teams in pit and cuse on the outside looking in which means every game down the stretch now matters for all of these te now Clemson is in really good position you dont want to struggle down the stretch but this is a bigger game for pit than it is for Music Clemson you see wake is a 10 seat theyve got Notre Dame and thats thats a credit to Syracuse as well I dont think anybody expected them to have the kind of season they started a little bit slowly but theyve won some big games have the orange theyre up nine right now on Virginia Tech under four media timeout over there chlin hes got nine points and 10 rebounds tigers by two the Tigers defense has been really good in the second half Clemson or excuse me pit only shooting Applause 28 that 13 lead changes in this game and a whistle a foul and this a really nice job by the Panthers to try to get the ball inside to Music Hinson you know hes been guarded by Clark most of the night there was a switch that time he had shefflin on him shefflin tried to come over the back does a lot of things well free throws however an area he struggles and he misses the front end thats a big one now the front end is really critical so you left two points at the free throw line now you got to get a stop down here kick Beetle three thats small again I think if Beetle should pass that Applause up Clemson five of 13 from Beyond The Ark at The Rim Smith excuse me is leged but leot has been critical for pit coming off the bench he always provides energy these provided energy on offense tonight Beetle put back and the Tigers lead again he got closer Beetle really doing a nice job on the offensive boards that time and again you know just get closer hes got six points and in a game like this those are six big points heres AET deep three off to the left rebound by Hall the only guy thats made a three for pit in the second half is Carrington everybody else is over for 11 Beetle feeling confident hes got two buckets in a row timeout taken by Applause pit how about the energy shifts here in Clemson its been Josh Beetle G A lot of it coming in second half backto back buckets by Beetle has the Tigers up four hes made all his shots inside the arc and again in a in a game like this those eight points coming off the bench are huge and in fact as close as this game has been in particularly in the second half Four Points feels like a huge lead this is almost a must score opportunity for pit I think be the sophomore from Columbia game f country Tigers fans glad he chose orange here and is it little John hes got his team up four legot turning fading no feder Rico big offensive rebound clock did not reset low block shot leg it with three midrange jumpers good boy that is some sequence really good defense by Clemson just a nice job by legot to pick up that loose ball what a sequence legs got 15 pit within two Music Hall against feder Rico with the left hand Banks it in great job by Hall to get position and that was a wonderful pass by Ian shefflin you know your big guy fighting for magici needs the perfect pass and shefflin gave it to him a whistle a foul called on Clemsons Chase Hunter and hes trying to keep up with Applause Music Carrington now he was reaching around grabbing him as he came off that Hinson screen you saw just the end of it where his arms were extended forc Carrington to run through those Applause arms the one and one knock down by Carrington who shoots it at 80 on the year Well Thursday night at 10 Eastern after our womens basketball double header the nothing but net crew will break down the night in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every game and look ahead at the best matchups on the schedule in the coming week thats coverage you can only find in one place right here on acc Network see if they go back inside to PJ Hall a one bucket game down the stretch its Hall rotating the basketball Beetle to shefflin hes up a three oh he buried Applause it percentage wise in ACC play hes their best threepoint shooter Chefs got a double double himself him and PJ Hall have been big here for the Tigers in the second half under 10 on the shot clock pit needs a shot needs a jumper thats not going to go Applause Music down GL brell slowing him down calling a specific play wouldnt be surprised if you had that high low with shefflin and Hall again Shin seven double doubles now this season to PJ Hall Hall down low turning fading and he missed it all he needs to go straight up with that or into feder Rico the fade doesnt help you there carington smooth as you like hes really good in the midrange hes got 15 points now but pit is in a situation they need a stop Dan leot Carrington and low have combined for 41 points with Blake Hinson sitting at just six here Applause Music tonight Hunter under 10 on the shot clock beetle beetle to his left hand gets inside tries to flip it up defensive stop and there it is for pit he just needed to take that ball to the basket with his left hand he switched to the right hand tried to make a fancy move Carrington again midrange no Jack Clark big rebounds were approaching two minutes Applause left trying to defend and youve got both sheflin and Hall who can play on the inside and that high low game between sheflin and Hall has been really successful for Clemson at times tonight here is Hall under two to play trying to force it down low to shefflin its a turnover critical time and force is the right word if beo had made that pass as soon as he caught the ball I think shefflin was open 11 turnovers for Clemson three for a pit a whistle on the floor calls is that foul on beetle it is on be now part of a big part of Pits offense is their guards driving the ball into the lane and Carrington just puts his head down and hes going to the basket beet will hit him a couple of Applause times heres carington it will shoot two and he knocks it down hes got Music Applause 16 Clemson we said they turned it over early five times and theyve really gotten that under control but that was that was a tough turnover by Beetle two big free throws for Carrington the 10th youngest player in the NCAA this season still hasnt turned 19 that happens in July hes got his team within one Hall found himself alone and the whistle calls I think it was feder Rico that somehow fell down in there there was a screen on the inside and feder Rico just lost H completely fedo FICO you see the feder Ricos nowhere to be found hes laying down on the court in the middle of the lane I think PJ Hall was stunned that he was so Applause open that is four on feder Rico and Hall big free throw here under 19 90 seconds left to Music play here is PJ vying for All American honors here in his senior season thats Palm from a veteran and he extends the lead to three theres still plenty of time left in the game the Panthers dont need to go for three here but youve got to get a good look boy Hinson thought about that didnt Applause he the last 90 seconds have been an adventure for Clemson a couple of times this season Carrington to tie not there Jack Clark a big rebound and PJ Hall is able to just ignore feder Applause Rico carington had an open shot though in the hot hands for a pit here in the second half under 10 on the clock Clemson hunter three that will fall what a big shot for Chase Hunter a home Bounce has the Tigers up by Applause Music six we talked about the threepoint shot being a big factor in this game and with the shot clock running down talk about your home bounce right there Chase Hunter I mean thats a big shot hes now got 15 points in the game he has played very very well thats his first three of the game it is we talk about the last five or six contests Chase Hunter who had made his name on hitting big time shots throughout his career hes been phenomenal here for Clemson down the stretch and you feel like not just in this game but as you turn into March youre going to need Chase to be really big for you as you move not just a DC but to March Madness as well I I when you get into the tourn tournament time you need your best players to play well you need them to be healthy you need him to play well and certainly Chase Hunter has played very well tonight Music but even though hes only scored two points Jack Clark has seven rebounds and hes done an outstanding defensive job against Blake H Panthers need to score quickly Carrington takes it in and if youre pit that works clock stops are going to the line obviously Clemson is concerned about guarding the three and so Panthers take advantage of that and Caron drives into the middle of a crowd tries to throw it up there hes really been impressive tonight foul on be is Applause his so Gerard is in the game because if youre the Panthers you got to start fouling people Applause so Clemson going to try to get the ball into the hands of Gerard that one RS out and now Pits got a f going to go down the court the Home Run is Applause hit another foul as Austin drives hell go to the line for two boy and the roof ready to come off the lid here at Little John sheflin is a guy who just knows what to do I mean he just leaks out theyre not guarding him you know youre not going to try to throw an inbounds pass to Ian sheflin so you know with him coming to the ball thats hes not the first option and so he just does a great job seeing where the opening Applause is how about this night 14 and 11 for Chef well he made that big three that really changed the character of the game down the stretch that really put the pressure on the Panthers that one misses guess who its shein with the rebounds and the Panthers have struggled a little bit here down the stretch shooting free throw feder Ricos thats Music five go change your name Clemson now in the bonus its been a busy afternoon here on the campus of Clemson baseball going on as well against USC Upstate fans late filing in in but they have made a difference here in the second half Chaplan misses the first of two knocks that one down seveno Advantage for the Tigers and all you have to do if you the Clemson Tigers at this point is defend the three even if they get a quick two its okay leget will fire from three off to the right second chance that one not going to be there either and pits knocking to PO final few seconds take off the Tigers a big second half and they protect home court
