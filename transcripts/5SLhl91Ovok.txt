so its kind of like a winner take all when it comes to the tiebreaker in the standings and things like that that youre going to hear a lot about as we wind down the close of the regular season terrific officiating crew tonight Bert Smith Raymond Steins and Ted Valentine Syracuse has won the last two meetings Clemson has won the last three times in this building and five of the last six and the Tigers will get it first here and of course Syracuse drops back into their zone defense and most teams try to attack that by getting the ball into the middle in the freethrow line area heres Tyson with an early three and Hall tried to keep it alive shefflin chases it down second opportunity here for Brad brownells team and thats a good sign for Clemson that shuffling active early Galloway back rim Miss and the third try for shefflin a very active role heres Hall skip across Tyson a shot fake on mitts now heres Hunter hell try for one nope fourth try for sheplin he and right back into traffic skips it in the corner Hunter will launch again yes sir hey Ill tell you what I dont know how many at bats before somebody was going to get a hit but Chase Hunters on the board wow Chase Hunter West he has really shot the three very poorly in ACC play only 18 and he shot early in the year he was shooting 53 on the arc and so thats a very good sign for Clemson that hes able to hit a three he has lost eight tenths of a point from his regular season average to his conference average at 13 and a half points a game hes still the fifth best free throw shooter in the ACC Applause Galloway for Tyson quick entry for sheffler got enough to always Intrigue how they teams dissect what Syracuse does heres Galloway a little soft Runner you have to make a decision what youre going to be about offensively when you play the orange well there isnt any question whereas you can set screens against the Zone but the main thing you have to do is move the ball the ball cant stick with one guy ideally youd like it to go in and out side to side and get yourself a good look heres Bell the very talented freshman from California and hell put the orange on the board a lot to like about six seven Chris Bell yeah hes a long lean bouncy kind of guy Wes and 70 percent of his field goal attempts in conference player from threepoint range so thats a bit unusual he gets in the midrange although clearly he can make that Galloway attacking from the wing 15 to shoot for Hall West and thats one thing thats hard to do you attack from the wing and try to pass against the interior of that zone Syracuse really does a nice job covering up the Galloway going to traffic had it knocked away and that was Malik Brown that got a hand on it and here is Joseph Gerard III and judamitz a talented freshman run coach bahams offense and heres Gerards first three of the night and the rebound for brown hes fouled by Hall on the stick back first on PJ Hall first on the Tigers Now Syracuse West in conference play is a little bit less than an average offensive rebounding team but thats a great job by Brown he got that rebound in the middle of three Clemson Tigers so here is brown hes a 54 freethrow shooter and the first one good Malik Brown is from Culpepper Virginia played at the Blue Ridge school he was AAU teammates with a youngster well see later tonight for Syracuse and Justin Taylor you see Alex Hemingway onto the floor hes been averaging just five minutes in the last two games Hemingway missed most of December and almost all of January with plantar fasciitis he has come back in the lineup but only played as I mentioned just a handful of minutes in the last couple games but hes in early for Galloway and Hunter bangs away on another three now if youre the Syracuse coaching staff you got to be sitting over there scratching your heads that you know youre saying is this guy tonights tonight hes going to hit threes Bell heres Edwards Paul with the foul now well keep an eye on that tonight in our post match up and there is mint stepping out of bounds against Hemingway The Challenge tonight for Hemingway is going to try and beat and stay in front of mens because but he and Hunter switch right right thats the challenge for anybody because mints I dont know that anybody can stay consistently in front of mints early fivepoint lead for the Tigers Music Tyson and you got to make that zone move Wes heres shefflin cross corner for Hunter Tyson tigers are rolling from behind the line early three threes of their four field goals and an early eightpoint lead West the ball went from side to side it went inside and then it went back out thats perfect offensive execution immense tried to hit Edwards Ops for Gerards triple and Tyson the backside of rebound now if youre Clemson and you get that rebound West you got to be really careful when you make the outlet pass because Joe Girard likes to sit there in the weeds and hes picked off more than one of those this year yeah we saw him play a little defensive back last week against NC State like that heres the post Paul knocks in the jump shot first points for PJ Hall celebrated his 22nd birthday yesterday fifth best score in conference play eighth best rebounder having a terrific Junior campaign once his health returned Dan point lead Mintz is fouled by Hemingway Applause itll be the first on Alex Hemingway itll be the second on the Tigers but Clemson is operating early from the perimeter sheplin skips it into the corner Tysons got a three and the Tigers lead by 10 you see tournament consideration but their games next week Wes are going to go a long way to determining whether they can get themselves back on track for an at large bid to the NCAA tournament Jude immense 75 percent at the line the Freshman Fort Washington Maryland whos averaged 19 points and five assists in his last two ball games gets the back end of the twoshot chance you saw the orange would draw Carolina in the eight nine games Tar Heels played tonight at South Bend one of four ACC games on the Slate tonight including this one here and cant hold the ball you got to keep it moving there is Ben Middlebrooks and hes fouled from behind I believe oh it was Kadir Copeland who comes into the ball game a 66 freshman from Philadelphia who played five minutes the other night against Duke after not playing the previous four games and young Copeland out of IMG Academy tickets Middlebrooks with his first foul well she saw there the defense was really pushed up and they just lost middle Brooks in the back free throw no good by Middlebrooks dont forget Thursday night means womens basketball on acc Network Miami and Louisville get us started at six oclock from the Yum Center and then State and Duke from Cameron eight oclock Thursday nights on acc Network always streaming on the ESPN app middlebrooks got the back end of the twoshot try must keep in mind that the Clemson Tigers even in this tough stretch that theyve had theyve started games very well Vince tried to take Hemingway off the dribble Edwards gets the rebound here is Copeland racing through feet Brown layup good Malik Brown and Ted Valentine stopping play here and now theyre going to go to the benches and I think theres a question here on clock and so the officials Dan as you know in this part they can go to the monitor here to reset the game not reset it from the start but reset it from where the malfunction occurs score timers there is something they can always review yep there are certain things West they can review it like at the end of the game in the last two minutes but uh score or timers review they can error they can review at any time and Im Im not sure whether its the clock or the shot clock okay game clock I think okay but that was Wes how about that play that brown just made outside I mean hes got really good hands and he can score close to the basket and he was under a lot of pressure okay so with clock is in the left corner for you here and heres Edwards on the rebound now keep an eye on Brown at the foul line he just steps right in Wes thats really a good play I never saw the clock stop yeah I didnt either so eight point lead for Clemson and I got all three guys Plus folks here who handle all this and Im gonna get somebody there with a stopwatch if they have to yeah well it is its a game clock issue and like I say Im not sure that the issue occurred during that replay we just showed that was the that was the last play but it may have occurred earlier than that good chance to remind you with wrestling season wrapping up Friday night duels has moved aside now we get ACC lacrosse for you Jenny Levy in North Carolina theyre the defending national champions number one in the country theyll be a Blacksburg Friday night seven oclock ACC womens lacrosse on acc Network and always available for you on the ESPN app well the good news here for us and for everybody else involved is we got three talented guys on the whistle tonight to sort this out man well the problem I dont think is with the whistle so Remy Steins talking to Jim Boeheim Bert Smith will bring Brad Brownell up to speed okay ready to go all that and they they took two seconds okay so there we go well we want to be right and they were right everythings up to date in Kansas City and Clemson so here we go heres Hemingway shuffling on the Baseline nice skip out front Hunter another one too strong there Edwards collects the rebound and heres the arch Applause Gerard against Hemingway crafty Joe Gerard off the glass and boy good job by shefflin inside he boxed out brown whos already proven to be an asset the offensive glass Hemingway out of the corner bounces away shuffling tried to contend took a spill here the orange Mets a two on three kick out for Gerard got it Gerard West hes almost automatic with that three in transition nice job by Gerard to run the court and mince to find him yep three ball from Gerard he said 20 plus and two of his last three orange Trail by 10 now just five heres sheplin one dribble back for Hunter now Tyson that was a three that was a great job by Hunter West he was going to start to dribble that ball but saw Tyson and didnt and I think thats the key against the Zone move the ball dont dribble the ball Clemsons four of nine from three and a reach on hemenway will be his second so two fouls on Hemingway three on Clemson Galloway is going to come back in the ball game and hell replace the Junior from Newburgh Indiana but heres another look at Gerards Marksmanship but Gerard he just knows the spot to run to in transition and theres Hunter at the top of the key he starts to dribble but then he passes the ball and not only is Clemson getting good shots theyre making them yep they were shot terribly from threepoint range against Louisville theyve already made as many threes tonight as they did in the entire game against Louisville Copeland into traffic hes gets it to Mets on the drive and shefflin did a good job blocking his path turned over by the orange Chase Hunter back for Galloway ready to shoot background Miss Middlebrooks tried to poke it away I think Galloway is always ready to shoot theres no question and I dont think thats a bad shot you get an open three like that in transition I think you have to take it Edwards back down Mets launching and hits Jude immense now his 13th three of the year he hit a big one last Tuesday night against NC State and he draws the orange back to within five again Weston hes still shooting under 30 percent in conference play from three Tyson a hard dribble and now Galloway Hunter tees up another one and middle Brooks will chase it down second chance here for Clemson Clemson so far really doing a nice job on the offensive boards and they are not a very good offensive rebounding team Chase Hunter penetrates tried to feed middle Brooks deflected out of there Benny Williams got a hand in the path first turnover by the Tigers on the other end Copeland driving basket and the Tigers just didnt get back very quickly that time Copeland just never stopped Copeland playing in just his 16th game this freshman from Philadelphia starting to see more minutes here in the last couple games hunter Tyson knocks another one down hes got nine and off to a good start well I think the reason that Copeland is in the game is they want him to chase the threepoint Shooters and Jim behind a little upset right there because he did not get out on Hunter Tyson eight minutes gone in the first half Syracuse has hit their last three from the floor Denny Williams thinking about it on the drive jumper from in front and the rebound Galloway quick Outlet heres Hunter thats a great defense by shefflin Applause Clemson will launch him with the best of them wont they Dan sure will move the ball before they do Galloway Chase Hunter how about it nope and Hunter Tyson collects a rebound foul line jumper got it Hunter Tysons got 11 and old number five from Monroe looks like hes up for duty tonight because theyve got I think Syracuse has to get the ball inside to Edwards on the offensive end and obviously they need to do a better job blocking out on the other end middleburgs tried to pit him off heres Williams nice jump shot Benny Williams off the Baseline and Benny Williams is the guy who has a lot of talent and ability West hes come under a lot of criticism because hes so athletic and and just hasnt really played very well but hes a guy who hasnt been a big factor in ACC play so if they get six or eight points out of him thatll be great look out Hunter Tyson has got 13 and Jim Boeheim gets a timeout to nine point lead for the Clemson Tigers and its been engineered by Hunter Tyson Dan thats been engineered by threepoint shooting West the Tigers really hot from outside means almost 80 percent of their attempts have been from three and thats because the defense is giving them that three or thats what theyre getting with their balls moving against the defense I think they have to be careful you dont want to fall in love with that thing so its uh about living and dying on that line again well I dont know theyre getting good shots when you get good shots you have to take them its when you start settling for the threes heres Mets on a hard drive against Galloway left it short and RJ Godfrey on the floor during the timeout so is Dylan Hunter with Brevin Galloway PJ Hall and Hunter Tyson whos last been seen knocking in threes well hes 45 tonight Wes heres Hall he is uh got the opening field goal of the game and thats about it five to shoot PJ Quick Pass Godfrey up strong scores nice pass by PJ Hall Wes it was a nice pass I thought it was a little risky pass though the defense was collapsing I think if youre PJ Hall you got to shoot that one biggest lead of the night for the Tigers now at 11 under 10 to go heres Jesse Edwards he lost it and then had it taken away by Dylan Hunter fourth turnover on the orange Applause and that ball got kicked by Jude immense Ted Valentine with some observed with officiating hell come right over here in front of us yeah very athletic no question Applause foul on Hall again Paul Galloway was almost ready orange fluffed to Hunter Tyson heres Hall again thats the foul line PJ right over the top of Edwards got the roll hes got such a quick trigger Wes he turns and Edwards has to stay down because hes thrown a couple of passes and then he gets a shot off before Edwards one of the top shot blockers in college basketball can get up there to contest Jesses number one in the ACC hes got 76 rejections coming into the game Copeland launching from the corner and heres Galloway with nine to go in the first half well this is I dont think Brad Brown could have hoped for a better Offensive start Dylan Hunter tried to feed it to Hall turned it over West thats what Im talking about you get inside that zone you think okay okay I can make a pass but Syracuse their guys their arms are long and they really are good at tipping that ball away Copeland against Hunter Tyson trying to find something and missed the shot orange is now six of 14 from the floor well Copeland and ACC play West has scored a total of five field goals hes already taken two or three shots I dont think thats what Jim behan put him in there to do heres Hall at the foul line again half dozen for PJ Hall 15 point lead for Clemson and now what youre seeing Wes is Syracuse is pushing out on the threepoint shots and so theres a little bit more open space on the interior and thats going to be a foul on Dylan Hunter he and Gerard tangled up as Edwards was helping with the screen first on Hunter four on Clemson and PJ Hall well Hall is a guy who can operate inside and this time he just catches it in quick release before anybody can get to him the last time he faked a pass and that kept Jesse Edwards down and then the quick release PJ had 19 points 11 rebounds and a 13point loss at the JMA dome last year when these two teams squared off middle Brooks is in Hall is out well you need to get Hall a breather a couple of times during the game and when youre up by 15 is a pretty pretty good time to do it Vince on the floor hes got Gerard Edwards Brown has returned with Benny Williams Edwards lunging into Middlebrooks and thats going to be on Ben Middlebrooks his first five now on the Tigers we come back to Little John Clemson up 15 week part of this initiative members of Syracuse and Clemson joined one another another on the court to demonstrate their commitment to seeing each other as equals and treating each other with respect and dignity at all times recognizing that our differences dont divide Us but make us stronger as we welcome you back to Little John in a 15point tiger lead the orange have to figure out a way to get the ball out in the hand in the hands of Jesse Edwards in scoring position here is Edwards with a touch and right back to Gerard a little ball screen to try and help Joe against Brevin Galloway with 10 to shoot fall away two and it will roll off the rim and Hall had it shefflin tried to bat it away and two guys couldnt touch it and keep it before he went over the inline Wes Joe Gerard that hes really added that to his game this year its really you know he gets in there and even against taller guys he can create that turnaround jump shot situation and this is just the guys cant cant grab it Gerard quick slip to mince for this young man talented Dan hit the side of the glass though on the shot Syracuse has forced some shots Wiggins Quick Pass shuffling in traffic Ian got to do something with it and try to get rid of it three seconds three seconds to call Wes all you need to know about the Syracuse offense at this point is Jesse Edwards has no field goal attempts and cordir Copeland has three yeah four turnovers on Clemson Copeland wont get any shots for the moment hes on the bench Edwards however in the game wow on point now oh youre right an ACC player has a total of 13 shots on the year so hes coming into the game Edwards has to handle the ball in scoring position here is Gerard eight to shoot spinning on Hunter trying to find an alley pushes it up and in tough shot five in the first half for Gerard you know hes more athletic than you think it was but that was just craftiness yep under seven to go in his first half heres Chauncey Wiggins who comes into the ball game averaging 11 minutes in League Play Hall of three back rim Miss and Mets the foul on rebound again just because youre open from out there West doesnt mean necessarily you have to take it you got to move the ball get other people involved PJs a 40 threepoint shooter heres Benny Williams a line drive and Hall will grab that from his own teammate and PJ might have snarled at Wiggins for trying to get the rebounds yes I think he did Wes heres Hall Quick Pass shuffling the catch and score Dan thats the foul line Advantage we see all the time when teams are really excelling against Syracuse and that time Jesse Edwards pushed out on him and prevented him from shooting but he made the pass six minutes to play Galloway will get his first foul of the night sixth on the Tigers and another look at this foul line play we saw it a couple weeks ago with Virginia Tech Dan well you get the ball inside and he turns you see Edwards is right on top of him because Halls made a couple from out there and the guys on the wings of the defense dont drop back fast enough and shuffling good catch and score in traffic tigers have got 14 of their 33 in the paint building this 15point lead Bell has come back for the orange original starters out there for the Hall of Fame head coach and theyre going to call a bump on Wiggins against Bell going Baseline crowd doesnt like it the partisans here thought the 610 freshman was doing a pretty good job defending the 67 California freshman in Bell Applause he never really got in front of him Wes and he tried to cut him off and pushed him out of bounds one and one for Bell whos 82 percent at the line he was scoreless in 11 minutes and you see Ted Valentine and Brad Brownell in conversation as Bell hits the first Chris Bell had double figures a week ago Tuesday against NC State and then went scoreless against Duke and he hit both ends of the one and one Wes one thing that I think is happening here on the offensive end uh Syracuse has really been bothered by the physical nature of Clemsons defense yep and Clemson doing a great job preventing dribble penetration and covering up Edwards on the inside Hunter Tyson back on the floor skip for Galloway Baseline heres Hall look at the ball movement left wing Tyson shock fake Hunter Galloway step in cheats Hall against Edwards back for Tyson five to shoot Tyson foul on jumper got it wow 15 first half points or 16 points in this first half now for Hunter Tyson my guess what she could say hes out of his little slump I think you can confirm that in Hall forces an orange turnover Galloway the light is always green for 11 in the white and another time out for the orange Clemsons got their biggest lead of 18 in this first half Music team points hes six of seven from the floor and four of five from three and Dan a month ago he was a virtual lock for all ACC first team right well West Not only was he a lock for all ACC first team but he there was a lot of talk about him as Player of the Year and and interesting now a little bit of a slip Clemsons lost four out of five coming in and five of their last nine but itll be incumbent upon guys like Hunter Tyson and PJ Hall and Chase Hunter if the tigers are going to pull this thing from The Edge theres no question Weston you have opportunities its not like the seasons over right and if they play like this my heavens Applause post play for Edwards heres a touch for the big fella back for Mintz and then got deflected out of there Bell Scoops it up Hall tried to deflect it Wiggins there to defend the jumper from Bell Brown returned it and Paul blocked it Wes the energy the activity The Hustle by Clemson on defense is really something you know PJ Hall was out at the top of the key trying to prevent mints from getting the shot off and then he goes down inside and blocks the shot Syracuse has to figure out some way to match the Clemson aggressiveness here is Gerard Applause Music now Edwards foul line jumper and it will roll away and therell be a foul call on Dylan Hunter trying to contend with the box out on Malik Brown when Malik Brown Wes is a guy who works really hard on the inside hes a really good offensive rebounder yeah and you got to get a body on him and Dylan Hunter tried to get a body on him and thats the problem he kept the body on him with too long so Dylan Hunter comes out and Chase Hunter has come back and the first free throw for Malik Brown is good Applause quick reminder to you Tuesday night we got a doubleheader for you on acc Network Dan Bonner and Corey Alexander get these tigers at Charlottesville the Corey cast and jpj and then Virginia Tech and Louisville its a doubleheader next Tuesday night on acc networking always streaming on the ESPN app you two former Wahoos behave yourselves by the way I think theres any possibility that thatll happen less heres Galloway and offensive foul call Brevin used the left arm hes got two Clemson now has three guys with two and nine team fouls well Wes weve been talking about their aggressiveness on defense and heres the situation where theyve had such success moving the ball you dont want to create try to create things with the dribble against that defense until youve moved the ball Clemsons got nine fouls Syracuse but one with 403 to play Tigers up 16 boy Edwards had great position inside and they missed it Bell trying to find somebody and its brown 15 to shoot now Mintz thats a two from the left and its good Judah Mintz has got six in this first half hes really good on the Drive West hes really good in the pullup from midrange hes not a great threepoint shooter at this park pointing his career even though hes made one tonight Chase Hunter Chelsea Wiggins Josh Beetle came on the floor a little twopointer too strong Beetle got knocked to the deck and heres mentz hes got Justin Taylor in the ball game now as one of his wing Man Too to replace Gerard Metz gonna fire another three and hit thats nine for mens he is carrying the original offense West coming into this game he had made a total of nine threepoint baskets in ACC play Syracuse is on a seven nothing run and with 314 to go Brad Brownell wants some time out here and shoot immense is powering coach boeheims team to only Trail 11 hold on Judah Mintz is a really good driver Wesson a pullup jump shooter and hes not a great threepoint shooter hes only got nine and 16 ACC games coming in but hes got two tonight and that pullup off the dribble and thats going to make him more effective with his Drive West because now Clemsons going to have to push out and guard him yep Taylor playing the front of that zone with Mintz nice Quick Pass inside Hall The Catch and score what a tough shot Ian sheplin hit hall right in the hands with a hard bounce pass and PJs got eight on his fourth field goal thats a tough pass to catch you know it looks very impressive when you throw it but its a tough one to catch Edward still only has one shot attempt Williams a three Tyson the rebound Clemson doing a pretty good job though Dan he doesnt get many free chances no he has to work very hard PJ Halls been doing a great job defensively against him and theyve been pressure in the ball so the guy with the ball cant see in there for that brief second when Edwards may be open Hunter thought about the three now hell skip it back Josh Beatle Lefty triple and Hunter Tyson a rebound second chance for the Tigers quick bounce pass and shefflin misses the jump shot from in the lane I think he realized that Jesse Edwards was standing there between he and the basket yep here is Mintz with Hunter defending thatll Bound Away and Beetle catches it off the bounce thats a great block out by PJ Hall he didnt get the rebound but he prevented Jesse Edwards from getting the rebound fatal attacking Tyson a three oh boy wow and he was well covered and the expression on Chris Bells face and I understand that he was right there that is a very tough shot some kind of half now 19 in the frame for Hunter Tyson four rebounds or five assists I should say five rebounds for Tyson and theres a foul on Syracuse Applause and another look at Tyson and welldefended Dan well I mean Bell is in about as good a position as you can be hes right up in his face got nothing you can do about that Bell turned it over so the Tigers get it with 90 seconds to go right now Applause heres Hall that caught in the air leaves it for shefflin beetle trying to work around Gerard whos returned for the orange theres sheplin and hell run his own rebound down Tyson catches shoot back rim Miss Taylor to grab Tysons hes feeling it like everything he shoots is going in this is what were talking about with ball pressure Wes the Clemson as guards have done a great job pressuring the basketball Gerard fouled and made it hit a three Beetle fouled him what a shot by Joe Gerard West this is a guy who can score 10 000 points in high school and he just goes straight up in the air and Wes thats the Airborne shooter rule right once the guy leaves his feet the shot isnt over until he comes back down and Beatle fouled him before he came back down on the court the rare fourpoint play for Gerard makes it a 12 point game Music Applause theres shefflin Paul driving scoop cant follow Zeppelin he may have gotten away with one there Wes on a walk thats something that a jump shot was wide open shefflin again with the offensive rebound hes got at least four or five of them Ian shefflin has played well in his first time absolutely and he has struggled in games recently and thats one of the reasons why Clemson has struggled shefflin with such a valuable part of what they were doing earlier in the season seven to shoot for Gerard on the drive threw it up for Edwards and Tyson went for the block thought he had all ball Bert Smith has got Tyson for his first Applause Tyson and PJ Hall have done a great job tag teaming inside against Edwards and Hunter Tysons upset with this wet but he jumped into Edwards and forced him under the basket so here is the 611 senior from the Netherlands and it rattles out Weston he still hasnt scored tonight comes in averaging nearly 14 points nearly 10 rebounds in ACC play and two and a half block shots a game hes got four rebounds here in the first half does Jesse Edwards he is oh for one from the floor and thats the most stunning stat only one field goal attempt second one good first points and with six seconds left heres Chase Hunter hes going to race it up the floor on mints Ole Miss because Syracuse has only committed one foul so Vince can reach in and thats just the second but maybe he can reach in west but what if he needs the foul later in the game thats a I just I I dont like that doing that in the first half Chauncey Wiggins to put it in play here is Chase hunter gets it to Hunter Tyson three ball at the horn background Miss but Clemsons going to take a 13point lead to the locker room Dan Clemson played very well West particularly early theyve knocked down threes Syracuse is going to have to be more aggressive on offense off we go heres Kelsey Riggs and Dallin cup with the Tigers leading at the break himself open its a twoway street though they got to find him and Clemsons doing a pretty good job defending him right Clemsons doing a great job defending him being physical with him and theyre doing a great job putting pressure on the ball so its hard to find him when he is open yep here is Mintz and the orange with the ball to start the second half at Little John Gerard back for the rookie Music into traffic forced it up got the shot nicely done Jude immense hes got his fourth field goal first Syracuse player to double figures well now he can score in traffic less Clemson did a really good job as you noted several times moving the ball against the Zone in the first half but the balls got to move its got to go in and out and see sheplin there West you cant decide what youre going to do with it before you get it because the defense was playing off of shefflin and hes trying to make a bounce pass to PJ Hall and theyre backing off shefflin to cover Hall would you like to have seen him shoot it uh yes absolutely he can shoot that little short shot theres a no look entry pass and Galloway bangs home a three Chase Hunter was looking on the other side of the floor and then threw it crosscourt Mahomes no look for Galloway whos got eight by the way Applause the lead is 16 but Gerard really working to try to get open wrap it around for Edwards against Hall Jesse with the right hand and missed it Tysons clears it nice job by Hall to prevent Edwards from getting any closer to the basket and thats about as close as Edwards has been able to catch it tonight heres Hunter another no look for Galloway shefflin at that post area now Chase Hunters tees up another one Gerard in the orange back the other way here for a nice screen by Edwards got Gerard a window and then entry pass got dog go out and finally heres Hunter Tyson with the Syracuse turnover ahead for Chase Hunter Galloway another one uhoh the green light has gotten greener well Wes hes one of those guys when he sees the first one go in he cant wait to get his hands on it a second time Edwards well hes surrounded sure is Clemsons done a nice job on the orange big but Mintz has bailed him out and hits a third three five in the half 14 in the ball game for Judah Metz who Wesson its worth repeating in 16 prior conference games he made a total of nine threes hes got three tonight and its a career high for him theres a foul on the orange as shefflin went hard to the rack and the foul is on Bell itll be his first its the first on the arch shefflin will go to the line to shoot two where hes 76 percent it is worth noting Judah Mintz was two for two from three against Duke the other night and here tonight he is three for three hes hit five straight threes and in Dan as youve noted he couldnt buy one for about two months Scheffler missed the free throw and this young man out of Fort Washington Maryland is coming on strong in the final turn of the regular season well he really is west but the Clemson defense has been good enough theyve prevented him from getting in the lane on those drives and he doesnt have any assists tonight those are the third and fourth free throws of the night for Clemson theyre one of their first four at the line thats a very good freethrow shooting team and theres Metz he is fouled by Galloway thatll be the third on Brevin Galloway its the first of the half on Clemson thats three free throws now for Judah Metz thats what happens you make three threes and then guys are trying to push out on you and mentz will go to the line and the Clemson bench is complaining they felt like mints kicked his foot out there and that was the source of the foul and Brad Brownell thats what hes doing hes giving them going through some things with Raymond steins theres Chase Dylan Hunter is at the table hes going to come in for Galloway meanwhile they wanted to do a little housework over here in front of the orange bench and Ted Valentine feels like thats been accomplished so now Mintz will shoot three free throws and the first ones good how about another look here Dan now now mints that foot did come out a little bit West but Galloway ran into him yeah you know its not like theyll not want the old Reggie Miller who leg kick out oh listen to you talk about your boy all right dont forget Thursday nights 10 oclock following our womens basketball doubleheader Kelsey Riggs huddles up with Hall of Famer muffin McGraw Lexi Brown and Kelly grahambling nothing but net all the highlights all the analysis of ACC womens basketball available here on accn and of course on the ESPN app well lets tell Reggie what you said my goodness 12point game almost three minutes gone here in this second half Syracuse 10 of 14 at the line tonight nice pass Hall shefflin trying to create it go back to PJ in one 10 for Hall the foul is on Edwards itll be his first second on the orange Dan West youre just not going to see better interior passing than this the ball goes from Hunter to shefflin to Hunter Tyson and back to PJ Hall thats I mean thats just outstanding passing and Wes the key to that is every pass forces the defense to react and you make a couple of passes and now the defense is totally out of position hauls into double figures hes got 10 now on his fifth field goal first trip to the line for the Junior from Dorman High School in Spartanburg and a free throw no good tigers fighting it a little bit at the line tonight one of their first five well theyre not fighting it from the other line West so thats been the key Mets on a reroute look at this shot whoa Juda Metz wow hes got nine like that in the second half so now Syracuse going to come with some pressure hes got all of the Syracuse points too heres Chase Hunter back to Dylan his younger brother foul line shuffling inside Hall with the right hand Wesson thats what you do when somebody presses you you get the ball down the court you beat the press and you get an easy shot Mets into traffic Bell a step back and a good three for Chris Bell important answer for the orange Bell can really shoot it heres Hunter orange coming with the Trap shuffling ahead heres Hunter Tyson left open for three Off the Mark the rebound run down by Bell might have gotten away with a bit of a double dribble Works foul line hanging two bounced out Hall the rebound for the Tigers this games getting a little Pace to it well West for as well as Clemson has played weve still got over 15 minutes left in the game and its only an 11 point game yeah yeah Hunter working on the top foul line heres Chef on Monir Hema into the game and Tyson is fouled in the corner by Mintz on the three second on Mintz so Hunter Tyson will shoot three free throws when we come back to Little John Clemson ball movement this is a after Syracuse tried to press Clemson just got going before Syracuse got set and what an athletic play by PJ Hall coming under the basket and dunking that thing over his head doesnt for Hall tonight six of eight you see the four rebounds hes on the tiger bench middle Brooks has come back into the ball game and so is Alex Hemingway by the way for the first time here in the uh second half and Hunter Tysons gonna shoot three free throws fouled by Mintz as we went to break free throw good Tyson by the way the eighth best freethrow shooter in the ACC now with 20 on his first free throw Music second one good dont forget Thursday night womens basketball doubleheader Coming For You Miami and Louisville Katy Meyer and Jeff walls locking up at six oclock Eastern in Derby City and then Stayton Duke from Cameron Carol Austins got the Blue Devils 11th in the country thats all here on acc network streaming live on the ESPN app 22 now for Hunter Tyson Applause hes got his seventh 20point game of the year Music Gerard blocked parsley I think by Hemingway and Tyson got the rebound anyway did a nice job staying in front that time not a Chase Hunter but remember Joe Gerard is a guy who can get a lot of Threes quickly Chase Hunter has shot fake standing three nine for Hunter on three triples tonight Dan and again hes really struggled shooting the three in ACC play Tyson the rebound of the mints Miss but just when you think Syracuse might be crawling back in Clemson knocks down a couple of threes Applause up top Tyson theres foul line for shefflin he and a couple dribbles skip for Hemingway standing three oh boy alex Hemingways 31st three of the year really good patience Inside by shefflin shefflin is having himself a heck of a night largest lead of the ball game now for Clemson reigning triples tonight in the upstate tigers have hit 12 of them so far donation from New York Life based on their Affiliated ACC teams final ranking all the early years of the threepoint app one of my favorites theres Gerard baham wants a foul wasnt called heres Tyson foreign thought Gerard was fouled going in the lane and Clemson dunks it at the other end to push it to 22 Applause inside Edwards the catch fouled and won first field goal of the night for Jesse Edwards comes with 1345 to play in the ball game on middlebrooks second foul Dan well Joe Gerard takes the ball into the lane here West and he leans into Hemingway but Hemingway went straight up in the air and watch this dunk by Hunter Tyson somehow he Ducks under the arm of Benny Williams Edwards at the line he is 73 percent this is his improved the player over the last what two and a half years Dan I would agree with that Wes he really has developed his skills and I think a big reason for Clemsons lead tonight in addition to their 12th threepoint field goals is they have limited Jesse Edwards heres hunter in the corner Tyson thought about it foul line shuffling working against Edwards back for Tyson three long rebound Gerard swiped it out of there another really good decision by Chaplin West that ball didnt go in the basket but that was a really good pass Williams got trapped going Baseline and a foul on Middlebrooks will be his third he and Galloway the two tigers with three thats three on Clemson here in the second half and Benny Williams getting ready to go to the line well this is a nice job by Syracuse they push the ball up and Benny Williams just attacks the basket Benny Williams sophomore from Bowie Maryland first of the free throws is good dont forget Tuesday night doubleheader of ACC basketball Comes Your Way Charlottesville where Virginia will host Clemson only meeting of the regular season between those two and then youve got Virginia Tech and Louisville from the Yum Center at nine oclock Tuesday night double header right here on acc Network Williams got one of the two the lead is 18 for Clemson Hemingway Hunter Tyson Chauncey Wiggins PJ Hall on the floor Chase Hunter on the drive lost it Wiggins scooped it up tried to put it up and Edwards blocked it out of bounds thats the impact of Jesse Edwards his 77th block shot of the Year Dan Magna said the Syracuse defense does a nice job here West they tipped the ball and made it a tough play on the inside Hemingway a triple backroom Miss Mets the foul on grab I think Syracuse has to move a little bit more quickly West theyre down 18 on the drive Mintz tried to feed it to Edwards he got kicked around Hemingways got it what a save heres Tyson with Gerard to beat and hell wheel it out Music and the Tigers will reset with hunter in the middle of the floor its a great job by the Orange getting back on defense Music Chase Hunter a lob Hall The Catch and score I wasnt sure quite where Chase was lobbing that Dan on PJ Hall does a really nice job West recognizing that he cant dunk it just flips it in the basket Williams heres Gerard Music Hemingway doing all he can to keep himself in front of 11 who got a bit of a screen and missed on the three and Edwards punches home the rebound dunk orange jump right into the Press heres Wiggins Quick Pass Tyson feeds hall right back for Wiggins Brad Brownell wanted a foul on Chauncey Wiggins move to the hoop instead heres Metz at the other end he tried to dunk it and it rattled out West thats a really tough dunk to make coming underneath the basket like that Hemingway left it on the rim Edwards collects Music Applause Gerard is trying to get Williams to move here in the offense against the Tigers Joe dumps in a jump shot hes got 11 now on his fourth field goal well thats a really nice job he drove the defense away with a little fake and then was able to step inside Hemingway here is the inbounds for Tyson and he is around and Hunter goes all the way to the glass he got a round Bell Dan seven in the half and 26 now for Hunter Tyson he got around a couple of guys West you dont often see Hunter Tyson dribble the ball against the press all the way up to court for a layup pretty slick open field moves Gerard lost the handle against Hemingway 15 for the orange on the shot clock Music Metz Benny Williams at three when Clemson will take that shot every time and Jesse Edwards West as far as far as the Syracuse offense is concerned is just totally out of the game right and thats not a formula for success for the orange Applause Hunter left alone four threes and 12 points tonight for Chase Hunter but this game tonight is about number five in the white Dan well he goes by one guy thats Gerard then he goes by Brown uh by Bell excuse me and then by the best shot Blocker in the ACC wow Gatorade fit Fitness starts from to our ACC network coverage of mens basketball tonight here at Littlejohn Coliseum 21point lead for Brad brownells team at 7352 and what a performance by Hunter Tyson oh my gosh by the way Brad Brownell knows Tyson is secured another DoubleDouble tonight too Dan hes now got 26 points 10 rebounds Copelands coming to game Tyson defends him Mintz by the way is out cymer Torrance onto the floor for the orange and here is Torrance a little soft floater spins out Pima had a shot at it Dylan Hunter ends up with the loose change my mints was just exhausted oh yeah I mean hes been playing unbelievably hard Galloway Hall Baseline all his hard work got rewarded there Dan Ians played really well tonight but its been a its been a little grimy for him hasnt it well it has been and again unless you see great interior passing Gerard on the Baseline 23point Clemson lead Torrance Music trying to find something tried to bounce it inside Brown the catch Copeland in traffic he threw it by Monir hema and now with four on the clock Torrance had a shot rattle out you know youre talking about shefflin West hes got six points six rebounds and six assists for the Tigers tonight Clemsons got a season High 23 assist tonight shefflin for Hall TJ tried to save it Torrance had it and tell you what now Samir almost ended up over here in Bonners lap West weve seen all night that the Clemson Tigers have done a great job when they get the ball in the interior with the passing PJ Hall that time catches it and sees shefflin cutting to the basket outstanding tend to shoot Tigers cant wait around here oh Galloway backroom Miss and Torrance the rebound Samir Torres the transfer from Marquette hes got a little gear about him Dan in the open floor with the ball yeah he does and I think Syracuse is going to have to use some of that gear hes missed not contested shots but shots close to the basket you know the orange cant I mean theyre down West by 13 points with eight minutes to go that they cant really excuse me 23 they cant they dont really have the time to play a half court game shuffling in traffic Hall the rebound PJ went right back up with it and a foul called on Monir Hema I Believe by Ted Valentine yep sophomore from Niger transfer from Duquesne his first Music on Saturday when Virginia Tech visits Cameron but Tysons 13th DoubleDouble tonight Dan pushes him to within four of bacott who leads the ACC in that category and you see Jesse Edwards there nor Chad omeares had a terrific year and philipowski is going to be the Rookie of the Year Im not breaking any news there tonight long inbounds and Galloway will take it on a bounce and were back to action here at little jump obviously Wes the Clemson threes are a big story of the game but I think Clemsons overall intensity particularly their intensity on the defensive end has really been critical for this ball game theres Paul on a catch and I think were going to get a foul on again Monir Hema trying to defend PJ Hall that is five on Syracuse and Jesse Edwards makes the walk back in front of our Courtside location to return as does Jude immense here well this is a situation where PJ Hall is just fighting for the ball and Heman knocks him a couple of times Well Hema had the whole defensive pass interference he was holding the Jersey heres Hall thats a two off the inline and Metz without his wingman Gerard here on the drive Judah flipped it up and Edwards follows it home seven in the half eight in the ball game for Jesse Edwards and that allows Syracuse to press listen thats one thing we havent seen a lot of today and that is Syracuse being able to get all the way to the basket draw the defense get the ball up on the board and allow Jesse Edwards to follow it backcourt foul on Copeland heres another look at the mens Miss you can see he just draws all the white shirts Wes and that allows Jesse Edwards he comes from the freethrow line and nobody blocks him out but interestingly enough mince has knocked nor anybody else has not been able to get all the way to the basket and create that situation very often tonight in bouncers Galloway again pressure Chase Hunter another no look for Tyson quickly heres shefflin into traffic right back out for Brevin Galloway under seven we go sheffler nice pass PJ Hall that is now 24 assists tonight for Clemson not only is that a season High thats the most of any tiger team under Brad brownells watch and that is only 412 games Dan and theres an offensive foul on Copeland at the orange end of the floor which is seven now on Coach boeheims team well this is a situation where Copeland is trying to create something but theres nothing there Tyson does a great job moving his feet and Wes weve been talking about the energy and intensity on the defensive end I think weve seen energy intensity by Clemson on the offensive end theyve moved the ball very well theyve moved themselves very well they found Open men I think the other part too Dan if you were wondering where the Tigers were in terms of the remainder of the regular season when a lot of people are kind of writing them off I think brownells team wants to fight well I dont think theres going to be any quit these guys have really played hard tonight 10 for shefflin on his fifth field goal kick out for Torrance and the rebound for Edwards as we go inside of six to play heres Miss on the drive feeds Benny Williams he was under the goal and Syracuse going to get bailed out with a foul on PJ Hall thatll be his second its the fourth on the Tigers so the orange will put it in play on the Baseline and heres what were talking about the Tigers losing four of five and five of Nine the net is 82 the quad one is three of three and theyve gone from last four the final four to considered now in Joe linardis Bracketology but Dan you mentioned this earlier at the top tonight couple opportunities awaiting them but you had to win tonight Edwards turns and scores over hall nine and a half 10 in the game for Jesse Edwards well what that resume showed you was that the Tigers have put themselves in position now not as strong a position as they were in before losing four or five but everybody struggles once in a while during the season Torrance flies off the turnover for his first points and thats something else Syracuse usually pretty good at forcing turnovers but they havent been able to force turnovers and create easy baskets Galloway took his eye off the ball so to speak in Torrance able to force the turnover and heres Chase Hunter into the four Court hell get into the lane and draw the foul from Edwards a couple of free throws coming for Hunter on the eighth against the orange but heres Torrance a moment ago this is only the sixth turnover of the game against the Clemson Tigers and the Tigers have really been good with the basketball very strong with the basketball they wont they werent that particular time but West to get back to what were talking about with that Clemson resume right the Tigers havent played themselves out of anything they have plenty of opportunities but the key now is you got to win games and so they the opportunity is right there in front of in fact West people talking about whos in and whos out well you know what nobodys in thats right nobodys in literally nobodys in and the only the only teams that are out are those teams that theres 11 of them theyre still transitioning right so theyre not eligible to play New Mexico state has has ended their season and then there are a couple of leagues where everybody from the conference doesnt make it to the tournament uh the ivy league is an example in Colombia from the ivy league has been mathematically eliminated from the ivy league tournament so technically Colombia is out and theres a couple other schools like that but theres very few schools that are out and nobodys in yep under five to go the lead is 22 Benny Williams squares up and knocks down a long two second field goal of the night for Williams and heres the Press again from the arch and heres Galloway a little easier time on this particular trip for Clemson PJ Hall down underneath the basket telling them just slow everything down heres Hunter foul line shuffling Galloway back out for a three from the left long rebound and Torrance in the orange try to run heres the rookie Taylor handling it now Metz another one how about Judah Mintz hes got a season high four threes tonight and hes had a terrific ball game boy mets has now got 21 that ball got deflected in the backcourt Galloway Clemsons got to work it toward the front here and they do with a pass ahead for Hall with under four to go Brad Brownell Im sure wants to see his team finish strong shefflin is fouled on the play by Edwards free throws for Ian sheffler very many basketball games scoring 48 points in Boston College is such a tough physical defensive team and they I think they are as tough and physical as any team in the conference particularly when theyre playing at home boy what a tough night for the tigers at the freethrow line they may live to tell about it but Dan this is a really good freethrow shooting team its not having a great night well unfortunately for them Wes its about the only thing they havent done well tonight they travel Chase Hunter walked in the backcourt with 328 to play thats only seven turnovers for Clemson Music Applause by the way Virginia only shot 32 percent tonight from the floor Dan and they were one for ten from three in the first half and finished four of 21 Taylor thats a two this kids a really good cheers Im gonna tell you what he is hes got a little bit of the crew cut that buddy bayheim had Ill tell you what but hes a little bigger a couple years from now he might be somebody you want to pick up when he gets off the bus Applause Justin Taylor he is from Charlottesville by the way Virginia Tyson gunning again rattled out shuffling another rebound closing in on a doubledouble thats right now with eight rebounds got a bucket of assist Tyson a three hello Wes thats the way the game started they missed a couple of three shuffling got the rebound and finally they make one ten eight and six tonight for shefflin by the way terrific game for the young man from Loganville Georgia and Grayson High School theres Edwards scoring Jesse 12 in the game now for Jesse Edwards on West so hes got a double double hes got 12 and 10 and you know and thats interesting because hes got the double double but he really hasnt been a factor in the game yeah and again you get the penetration this time with the pass and PJ Hall has to leave Edward so hes open but Edwards he only took two field goal one field goal attempt in the first half only scored one point and so hes had a good offensive second half but that double double really hadnt affected this game Reverend Galloway knocks down his first free throw Galloway tonight is his fourth game against the ACC where hes made at least three threes well obviously theyve made a lot of Threes right I think one of the big things in addition to the other stuff weve talked about is the game that Ian shefflin has had and Ian shefflin has struggled recently and thats hes not responsible for the Tigers struggles but when he plays well that gives Clemson an added Dimension that makes him really hard to defend front REM Miss for Taylor Chase Hunter the rebound look at this oh whoa wait a second hang on big fella I mean didnt you just get enough birthday cake last night Applause Music Jesse Edwards inside with the right hand it rolls out shefflin battling for the rebound and Torrance a foul on Brevin Galloway oh Dan take us back to your days when you used to do this well I never did this Wes but this is really something hes all alone and decides a little bit of Showtime BJ Hall normally isnt that kind of you know but hes all I dont think he realizes anybodys behind him Wes but hes had a heck of a game and again his aggressiveness against Jesse Edwards has been a big factor I think he may have done that because Jesse Edwards scored a couple of baskets on him Galloway free throw nine and a half 14 in the game for Brevin Galloway and now the Cavalry will change this is quite a statement by Brad brownells team tonight Dan this is not easing by this is 20 plus with 90 seconds left they really played well Wesson obviously the game is much easier when the ball goes in the basket and it didnt go in the basket form against Louisville and tonight you know they made 13 threes and so that really helps when you make that many threes but their their energy their aggressiveness on both ends of the Court was really impressive it it looked like January Clemson tonight didnt it it did and again Ill point out that Ian shefflin had a lot to do with that one he can give them that kind of contribution they suddenly become really tough Benny Williams against RJ Godfrey knocks it down seven now for Benny Williams and Chauncey Wiggins will put it in play and heres Josh Beetle Tigers now have to solve this press in the final 70 seconds heres Wiggins now Godfrey and Brad Brownells telling everybody who to get God forget the ball to Wiggins and a minute left to go and theres Wiggins he got it swatted out of there by Edwards heres Mets and a nice skip through layup for Judah Mintz boy hes been good tonight eighth field goal hes got 23 one off his ACC High the lead is 18 here with under a minute ago tigers are going to Raleigh they beat NC State 7864 in late December and the wolf pack after the win against Carolina and later tonight theyll get Wake Forest theres Middlebrook scoring and Syracuse is going to Pittsburgh who beat Georgia Tech last night Dan for the second meeting of the year as Williams lays it in and Pittsburgh won the first meeting of the Year West at Syracuse Applause and Clemson is going to win convincingly tonight Dan 9173 huh really was convincing Wes and theres a lot of basketball left to be played important basketball left to be played the Tigers have set a record tonight with their 12th ACC victory of the year theyve never done it and tonight they make it a no doubter 9173 the final Hunter Tyson
