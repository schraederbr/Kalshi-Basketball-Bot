about this team and you know he definitely feels like that they have a chance here to not only have a good game here but also a productive season when you lead the nation in threepoint shooting you dont always know you got to change they can shoot you in and shoot you out so far this year this guys been shooting them in Applause we are underway the JMA Wireless Dome this historic rivalry continues on Applause mens Gerard Bell Williams Edwards a five for the orange well have one four in a row expense when you watch Cornell played you think a team that runs Princeton sets theyre not as physical defensive to get out the impression they get after you on the defense has been pretty good possession there the first time in the defensive end of the floor Williams Dolan gray boothby and Hanson starting five for Brian Earls big red stolen outside is here Willis will try it and hit from three great so Cornell fan here I mean theyre going to get a lot of Threes up you know I think theyre over under we joked about it I said I think theyll get over 43s up tonight and first a shot no surprise for the nation leading team in threepoint and two first ones of three how about that well thats the thing theyre shooting them a lot but theyre making them too 11 per game yeah theyre just under you know theyre just under 12 a game second in the nation and threepoint is made theres another guy who can fill it up Joe Gerard knocking it down the Glen Falls New York product makes it a 32 game hes just such a big part of what Notre Dame needs I mean uh Syracuse needs to do to get going closer hes a finisher for this group hes the leader of these guys and when hes scoring it just takes that much pressure off all the other guys you want to see him make shots early 32 lead early on 41 wins in a row for Syracuse series as once again another three from Isaiah gray those looks have been easy so far yeah surprisingly so you know Syracuse usually just side to side movement getting that three at the top without getting inside is always been an adjustment but this is the other area you got to watch out for two on one gray has trouble with the handle stuck in the lane outside the boothby he misses the rim Music immense and a foul coming up this will be against Isaiah gray good foul by gray there his teammate fell down in the back court Syracuse had numbers there was no call here on the screen on Williams and thats a great job by Syracuse when impression your point guard Bigs always a tough to come back set a screen free up the ball hands gets the bucket as that one climbs up the rim and drops home big didnt show on the ball screen allowed Judah Mitch just to get downhill get to the rim and Lay It Up being down low the layup is in from Sean Hanson so Hanson Music one of the productive players in this starting lineup for the big red extends the lead out to four see Syracuse Zone initially was so spread out because of the threepoint shooting they knocked down two threes then you get spread out and give up a layup holy Apollo Jam off the Miss by Bell Benny Williams couldnt get that one to go oh mother in as Dolan tried to lay it up but Chris Bell said I dont think so my friend well comes man have himself a block party here early retransition defense getting back you know Cornell is going to try to beat the Zone down great transition defense by Syracuse early Jesse Edwards more so known for the the most frequent shot Blocker on this Syracuse team there in emphatic back by bells that pass is deflected out of bounds Max Watson into the game for the big red one of these signatures of Brian Earl lots of substitutions in and out throughout the game hes going to keep fresh bodies they play you wont see it as much tonight because theyre playing against a Zone but they like to play with a lot of pace a lot of cutting a lot of movement you dont do as much of that against the searching Zone but youll see a lot of ball movement and they got so many different Shooters on the floor guy Raglan in Chris Manning in as well theres Manning with the offensive rebound outside to Chris Kane nothing upsets coach bayheim even more than rebounding out of the Zone most teams are afraid of as a stapledge Syracuses program is you have to rebound again in their Zone Colin buries it Greg Dolan shooting 58 from three hes the guy you have to watch especially from behind the arc but after that make is 59 now Im pretty sure its going down thats just amazing to be that comfortable and in a Zone like that 59 is hard to do alone in the gym let alone in the game Gerard from the wing he answers so Gerard with a three to cut it back to a fourpoint game good reject of the ball screen and pull up I mean hes not a 59 shooter but hes definitely not a guy you want to leave open great rejected the ball screen stop and pop there by Gerard balls moving really quickly against the Zone a lot of its moving faster than those Applause third raggling mess on the moon Applause well looking for help top to Edwards Music I think seven leads so far for the big red as Mintz saws the foul when we come back itll be time to remember a Syracuse Legend most likable guys most well respected men youll ever meet and mentored players his own and so many young coaches as well and the words and the words there from Jim Boeheim its important to note in that tweet Luis Orr was his first recruit and that shows you how impactful that has been to Jim Boeheim throughout his coaching career and what Lewis Orr has meant to him Music I just couldnt imagine even with those big harm is going dealing with today feed down low from Manning and the foul off the shot attempt by Chris Kane its got to be so hard for him I mean as of someone that coach youre so attached to your players but just dont theyre like your children you can never imagine him today just a lot to deal with when you think about the pillars of Syracuse basketball there have been so many great players you walk into this building and you see all of the banners and the legendary figures Louis Orr is is one of the original building blocks of this program yes for this program to reach the heights that its that its reached under coach bayheim he was the first for proven jersey retired to have a heck of a career fourth straight NCAA tournaments with Chris those were recruits and it started Optimus free throw attempts another rebound Scramble for Cornell low as Kane drops it in so Chris Kane missed a couple of free throws redeems himself and he will get a foul coming up off of the inbounds that was charged to Max Watson when a team shoots it as well as Cornell does youre just so spread out I think Syracuse now is just trying to figure out what do they take away and theyre trying to keep the ball out of the middle of the floor you know around the free throw line then theyre also trying to get out to those Shooters in that time before that was able to throw it over the top for a lot pressure here Amanda man shown by the big red who lead it by six 137 Mance lobs it up no good to Gray Williams who had a three earlier on outside Williams Raglan offensive rebound another board for the big red man and open and a steal Randolph sometimes it looks like players they dont quite know how the Zones moving and it looks like theyre open but they dont realize it at times Music well again this Zone does move quite a bit you know theyre not just a traditional three Zone I often tell people the Syracuse zone is often imitated but never duplicated you just dont know what theyre gonna do in it because they make adjustment within the game and theyre at their best when they force turnips within their Zone and get out and the guards get out and get in transitioned the three from the top of the arc is in from Benny Williams much needed as Cornell had built its largest lead of the game at eight now its a fivepoint game if anyone adding up to his games just around 31 from three so for him its good that he gets his first attempt to go in Applause the foul line the ball movement from Cornell seven to shoot outside High arcing Rainmaker three is in from Sean Hanson those are the difficult shots that you deal with I mean you played great defense and then for 28 seconds and two seconds left in the shot clock someone throws up a three that was one of the better defensive efforts I thought Syracuse had in his own Gerard foul coming up off the shot attempt by Jesse Edwards as Edwards will go to the line for a pair of free throws thats Grays second foul I think hes gonna have to come out we have a college basketball doubleheader Wednesday night right here on acc Network and the ESPN app number 24 Virginia Tech is in Chestnut Hill to take on Boston College in our first game at 6 30 Eastern then Florida State Post Notre Dame in Tallahassee these are the final games before the holiday break so plenty of proofs action headed your way along the ACC Network this Syracuse team winning it though they even got there hey you know only ACC went so far the early in the season it started the turnaround of this fourgame winning streak for them Edwards cant get that one ball knocked out of bounds over to Cornell Gerard really is getting it going this early trying to keep this team in this game early I think the last play just great playing in the post spin it off kind of Edwardson drawing the foul getting them to the line when youre attacking the zone you want to try to be swinging it around you cant just move it around threepoint line as well as Cornell shoot it you got to penetrate somewhere try to get into the free throw line and just throw it over the top like that and that is a gold town so once again Hanson able to take advantage and it looks like theyve found something there over the top well theyre shooting and usually at the free throw line area thats usually the center and Edwards is there and its just not a lot of communication from the forward so whos going to take away that LOB gotten that twice already so Im sure a big hunt theyre going to make some adjustments Amir torrents into the game for the orange down low to Edwards having trouble with that ball turn it over Dolan trying to shake free from Torrance and a foul coming up against Lawrence number three against the orange so when Point Syracuse does not turn the basketball over because this team wants to play fast they want to get in transition to shoot threes as quickly those told us he wants to play like the old Loyola Murray Martin but some of the Young Folks dont understand no one played as fast and Pace than shooting threes as they did and this Cornell team is just a dangerous team because of the way they shoot the threepoint to 38 with that length speed that he played with he talked about how that pace and Tempo came about by virtue of coven and social distancing protocols again remember the ivy league basically skipped a season in 20 20 21 so they have plenty of time to reflect and try to build the offense Booth B3 battles out tipped around grabbed by Gerard theyre getting their hands on a lot of balls this right now Syracuse defense is just so spread out because so many guys can shoot it Gerard nearly stripped feed down low flip to the rim lose the battle and itll head out of bounds itll stay with the orange Applause shooting shooting the three getting lobs inside just doing a little bit of everything got Syracuse off guard as the Big Reds up nine early here in the first half Music I go mobile app ACC Network basketball is presented by Food Lion official grocer of the ACC as we get a look at the history and some of the historical photos of Cornell versus Syracuse how about that plaid jacket by coach behind I think Im going to bring it back out man yeah thats looking sharp not a lot of people can pull that off put big homes I think he pulled that off that last shot you saw there the the battle of the bayheims buddy and Jimmy in 2019 127 thats the number of meetings all time between these two programs the first meeting back in 1900 41 straight wins for the orange theyre down by nine right now to Cornell out of the ivy league Syracuse is out to pick things up on this end of the floor in their Zone weve given up four threes theyve given up also eight points on a plane Watson cant hit strong rebound by Benny Williams and now rebounding well on if youre just starting theyve given up three offensive rebounds already so theyre gonna have to start taking things away big red four of nine from three after that Miss by Watson wins with a drop for Gerard garage throwing a lot of attention theyre hedging him hard coming out on Fall Springs theyre not going to give him any open looks everyone else theyre scheming and theyre backing off a little bit but theyre really pump hard and close one to shoot missing the shot was Gerard loose Dolan in the mix Shooters find the shooters in the Syracuse Ragland from Deep tipped around out of bounds Cornell basketball Marcus Philly in him for the big red coach Greyhound is that happy with his group again another offensive extra possession there theyre not rebounding out of the zone you know Cornell is going to take shots but when they take those threes you gotta rebound it he has been happy with his clubs rebounding all year Dolan you know Manning for the Baseline Music torrent Torrance and thats going to be a blocking foul against guy ragley Junior you notice that possession Syracuse trapped the short corner and they wanted they want to stop you from throwing the ball down there so whenever that ball goes into the post in that short Corner theyre going to trap you and most teams straight pass out of the Trap skipping across to a shooter most teams arent able to to make that pass thats the one pass theyll theyll leave its just a difficult Passover that length to do time and time again but Cornell was able to execute at that time so lets see if they stop trying to throw it in that short Corner one thing to be concerned about here on the big red side five team fouls Midway through half one Lawrence trying to attack the Baseline feeds it outside gets it back from Mens shot clock to seven Music four to shoot down to two Torrance got it cant be afraid I thought he was open early in the shot clock turned down one didnt turn that over theyre keying on certain guys throughout their shoes theyre leaving the guys they deem non step up and taking make shots Manning the dish and they lay up his Miss by Hanson he got it back though somehow boothby three thats good Mayhem again another offensive rebound again theyre just not rebounding against the zone you cant give up threes and offensive rebound that time a mislayup they got lucky with that of another offensive rebound right boothby shot 48 from three last year that would have been best in the nation but he was a few made threes per game away from qualifying hes rear 43 percent threepoint shooter so guy shoots it that well for his career you definitely need to know where he is at all times you see theyre so spread out right now because of the ability to shoot the ball theyre just looking around looking at each other thinking I cant leave my area because I got a shoe there and great start by Cornell the man in bucket extends the lead to 11 the Cornell big red in control early more from Syracuse in a moment Music Geico has been offering savings for over 85 years as longer than the buffalo wings been around Music lips are burning oh

you can supercharge your audit system with AI lets create smarter ways of putting your data to work IBM third game this season for the Cornell big red against the ACC and Randolph they have come very close to knocking off a pair of ACC teams they have and theyve theyve played really really well and then you know theyre on the parade theyre on bothered theyre going to play the way they want to play and theyre pace and they want to play fast and they will play even Cricket as they get after you did you see the full compression now theyre just such a unique and difficult team they play not many teams in college basketball play like this they pressure they get after you they run and jump now that theyll fall back into mantoman on offensive end theyll shoot it quick theyll run in Princeton section just a difficult team to match up with that includes their last game which was against Miami back on December 7th they lost 107 to 105 and thats a loose ball foul coming up against Monir keema its like an 80s NBA score there I mean you dont see that type of sport Im Cottage Athletics uh its not overtime but theres just two highpowered offensive teams and that Miami team is really really good they gave out and they gave Miami all they wanted and and this is a big opportunity without a doubt for the ivy league because the ivy league trying to defeat an ACC team we dont sometimes think about ramifications of things in December yes but this is an important time of year in these nonconference matchups where youre building your resume right wrong or indifferent November and December are big as far as your March resume box office a lot of conference games wins is just not an easy thing to do and lets be honest just gives you bragging rights turnover committed there by the big red I believe Cooper Nord stepped out of bounds a sideline on that three attempt Gerard leaning in and scoring Gerards going to need some help I mean hes been the entire Syracuse offense at this point so Gerard with seven the orange down by nine back door feed to Hanson and again Manning with that passing able to beat that zone defense nine point lead for the Cornell Big Red stay tuned more in a moment on the ACC Network its a Randolph Childress back with you in Syracuse New York the threepoint shooting certainly a major story line in this game and just look at the difference between last season and this season both teams going in opposite directions I mean Syracuse had a threeheaded monster shooting threes a year ago in all shooting 40 percent of better for Cornell is just even more guys they got about five or six guys shooting it from well from behind the yard and just their style of play just giving everybody a tough fit and they lead the nation in threepoint shooting as we said and Syracuse have lost the Buddy brothers and I mean Bajan brothers and Gerards here and off to a good start himself I mean hes doing all he can offensively to keep his team in it but hes gonna have to find someone else is going to have to get involved in this game on the offensive end Syracuse to help him out unforced error there as bannons pass ended up out of bounds intended for Cooper North nine point lead here this is the guy that needs to get going hes got I think he needs to keep it a little bit a little bit massage great job going to the glass off the Williams Miss Edwards able to draw a foul there and again the rebounding could be key in this game and Edwards trying to establish control he got it in a post there I thought he skipped it prematurely make the help come before he skips it but again great sign of a big man you dont always have to get the ball to score he goes off the glass to get his shot and drill foul there nice inbounds play and the drop and the bucket for Malik Brown and here still Manning able to keep it under control man and outside Booth B3 no good Watson offensive rebound boothby tries it again from Deep thats no good Manning tries to track it down he cant instead its brown Applause sevenpoint game with seven minutes left to go before halftime Gerard over manic hes in a zone right now hes really feeling it knocks down another perimeter jump shot tonight hes today hes just have to know hes really filling it and just needs to get some other help an air ball from Williams but again able to get the loose ball Manning drives in and lays it in Chris Manning got a seam and got a bucket six points lead for the big red theres big Harms upset with brown he wanted him to rotate over Applause that was did a great job of running out to the corner challenged a threepoint shot no one helped him and gave him a layup I think he just needs to be patient in there theyre concerned with his size Gerard now outside mens he misses tipped around right into the hands for brown and the dunk he can open shots getting to the offensive glass with their size theyre the bigger team theyre the more athletic team they should be the team winning on the offensive glass so theyre going to need to do so as theyve done now to get themselves back in the game here Watson Corner three misses Edwards rebound out to Gerard two on two basketball Gerard driving to the rim some contact perhaps no call booze raining down at the Dome boothby cant get that shot to drop as coach behind very displeased with that lack of a call then scuba layup catches underneath the rim Watson back down the floor Boogie with room stops outside to Manning this is the pace Cornell who wants to play at Hanson Watson Puckett this is the pace just just the up and down as quickly as they get it if they can shoot it in five or six seconds they will oh Syracuse wants to control the pace a little bit more but again someone else besides Gerard is going to have to step up if Cornell shoots it great but they can shoot you in shoot themselves into a slunk and right now theyre missing a couple threes and you want to attack the glass when you can tomorrow our womens basketball quadruple header starts at noon Eastern with Wake Forest Syracuse then Louisville takes on Pitt at 2 pm after that its a top 10 matchup between number five Notre Dame and number six Virginia Tech in Blacksburg and eighth ranked North Carolina State hosts Clemson the cap today what a full day and evening of Hoops on acc Network that Notre Dame Virginia Tech matchup is going to be great Music Applause Gerard misses Ragland rebound Randolph youre surprised that Cornells been able to hang in there on the glass I am because you just would assume that Syracuse Center I am because you just would assume that Syracuse and their size were just overwhelming but again this is an experienced group of guys I mean this team is played against Syracuse theres a bunch of Juniors and seniors in the starting lineup so this is their third and fourth time playing this matchup again they played two ACC teams earlier they felt as though they could have won this team thinks they should be undefeated they lost both of those games by two points so theyve come in here with a lot of confidence to see it right now second foul on Bell Raglan three short fell with a loose ball so Bell has two fouls five committed by Syracuse as a team in this first half with four minutes left to go Mance he cant hit from Deep his struggles in the half continue threepoint shooting is just not his strength hes at 17 coming in what range thats a deep three from Nazir Williams he shot that from Cornell I mean what range on that this is a comfortable group confident made this six three in the night draws the only offense to Syracuse has the answer but so many guys are shooting against its a great match up here big red versus the orange Syracuse down nine early Music and its been a tough go for Jesse Edwards in this first half one point four rebounds hes on the bench right now and Randolph he has not been able to get going in this game yeah I think coach big harm is a little disappointed in his rebounding I think him controlling the paint right now lets make some miscues and Cornells ability to take advantage of it and get to the glass was disappointing a little bit theyre going to need him to get going and get going he assists the rest of his half definitely getting blown in the second half and one for June and hes the guy hes definitely capable onetime freshman of the week already in the ACC looking for another his team would assist averaging 15 4 right now shes the most lightning candidate right now with Jesse ever shot much in the offensive problem he seem to ride there talking to him telling me being really aggressive ass off the hands of fill in and a steal Applause sixpoint game with mens taking his way to the Lane throws it up in hand what a move by Judah Manz starting to heat up fourpoint lead Applause see now in a defensive insistity picking up now an impression the ball a little bit now and look how far out is catching at the logo at half court now to get that reversal and drain from the corner drills it Isaiah gray with a threepointer and once again the big red able to counter a bucket from Syracuse at a critical moment from Gerard I go out great here gray has two fouls I know he doesnt want to pick up the second hes a really strong physical kid you want to attack him I dont think he is picking up the third foul they switched off of him now Ray has eight by the way for Cornell Gerard inside of the foul line and a foul coming up against Nazir Williams driving spin move shot fake sees Williams with his arm straight out just jumps up attempts to shoot with his arms down and draws just experience in the back oneonone situation Gerard knocks down the first 101 situation moving forward so at least a bonus here remaining two 223 for Syracuse by the way we are talking about the struggles of Jesse Edwards how about the two leading scorers for these two teams heading into this game Edwards averaging over 15 points per game Dolans averaging over 13 points per game theyve combined for just four points total in this first half but weve talked about the different scores as well I mean Jessica which is a doubledouble guy hes the biggest Advantage because we dont think Cornell had anyone inside the guardian and lets make no mistake about it this team goes as Gerard takes it and right now hes the reason theyre still in this game and only down six points billion down low Hanson lost the grip on the ball out of bounds Syracuse possession lets see out of Syracuse youre used to that lent you know pass the ball in there like that Music with his size and athletic systems on the Block the shot forces of turnover down the Baseline fell into the front Court Gerard against stolen under two minutes left to go first half Cornell has carried the action for much of the half here drawing so much attention Music Applause Music Applause but within one possession its a threepoint game Bells a streaky shooter great sign if you if youre an orders man for him to get going there and an air still and its a turnover you see shots are falling when you got a young team you see shots are falling Bells doing it on the defensive end and on the offensive end here just sizes this Defender up raises up shoots for three he had three straight games in November where he scored double figures but offensively hes been a little hit and miss so far but hes been hitting so far in this first half to go through the Growing Pains of a freshman Bells shot rattles out Watson rebound shots are going in for the oranges so that defensive intensity now is kicking up which is again when you you got a lot of young Defenders on the floor that basketball attendant gives you energy on the offensive end super size three from Watson no good the follow is from Keller burpee Applause another offensive rebound for the big red Gerard heat check some rods on fire right now Applause one point game 3736 Gerard has 15 as Brian Earl wants to call a timeout Gerard has put the orangeman on his back with 15 first half points bringing his team back from a doubledigit lead and hes just feeling it right now he doesnt want the screen he just sizes up raises up pulls it deep range shooter hes like were not going anywhere we own this 81 about rivalry here look I mean Gerard is a player who in high school had games where he would score 50 and 60 points yeah and thus far hes been sharp in this first half but I think hes made the adjustment the biggest adjustment for him is last year you schemed buddy behind and you had you know you just defended him normally now hes the focal point youre scheming him I think thats why he struggled early hes figured some things out and I think youve seen the reason his offensive output has just increased these last four or five games and thats why theyre on a fourgame winning streak coming in because of him and hes shown that he can carry the low hes eventually going to need some help but right now hes showing it hey just figure it out we got a whole other half of basketball to play I got to this first half Applause foreign Music Applause everybody knows the key to Cindys on and especially the Syracuse zone is getting it around the free throw line and stolen with two to shoot gonna have to let it go he does not beat the clock so they wore that shot clock down ran out of time the effort to play your accustomed to seeing it happens quite frequently in its own so I know coach Earl has to be disappointed coming out of a timeout core execution my corner they led by as much as 11 and that lead has been whittled down to a point spell and a foul that will put Bell to the freethrow line for one and one so fill in default number nine knocks Bell down and that draws the whistle its a bad foul there you dont want to commit a foul there by filling one point lead you want to defend and got a no shot shot foul situation now you go from here playing defense and up one two three putting Bell at the line for one and one here this is Bells fifth freethrow attempt of the Season he doesnt get to the line much and hes tied it up at 37 hit this free throw it would put Syracuse out in front for the first time today Music Applause he misses seven seconds left for Dolan so something to note you will see teams do that now they dont have much rope left with 16 fouls so kind of to make things harder for the other team well he went after the ball he went after the steal aggressively if not I said dont call the foul he gets the layup Watson one to shoot got to let it go and that is it for the first half so tough execution there by Cornell to end the first half big contradiction to have Syracuse started out so slow picked it up late in the second half defensive intensity picked up bought themselves the game now he got us off the game here in JM JMA wildest dont Music Applause Isaiah gray three of three from the field with eight points ballad scoring from the big red meanwhile Joan Gerard third 15 points well see with second half action has in store as were back underway down low Hanson the kick foul line J Short from Nazir Williams in a rebound taken by Edwards now Euro in the lane lays it in and accuse on top for the first time today thats the Syracuse basketball youre accustomed to seeing rebounding outleting to the wings and the guards getting down pass theyve done a really good job of scoring in transition like you see there boothby Rainmaker three is short rebound so theyre getting the attempts theyd like but the Shops not falling now from Deep for the Big Red Sox hadnt consistently fail tonight which helped them and kept them got the lead form with the offensive rebound they had 10 offensive the first half against the zone you dont want to give up that many rebounds in a half you know in a game let alone a half theyve just been so spread out by the shooting of Cornell but they seem to have made the adjustment to the defensive end we talked about that thats the adjustments of this defense they dont just play thats what makes the Syracuse Zone unlike any Zone in the country they they make adjustments within that zone if they like now theyre trying to take away the Zod and live getting to the corner threes they do as much movement in scouting within that zone as anybody that actually plays on defense a couple of free throws from Gerard thats the third foul against Nazir Williams Applause Music now all of a sudden big red find themselves in a fourpoint hole now the ball is just moving around perimeter its got to get to that spot right there Williams down at seven to shoot the reverse layup is blocked by Edwards the accs best in that department Music down low for Williams in a blocking foul on the way and it just feels like the momentum of this game has gotten away a little bit from Cornell well Syracuse is also using their their size and athleticism you know the shot blocking there thats what your customer is seeing from Syracuse Biggs just controlling the paint the heat check shot there hes been so hot in the first half Ray and that ball knocked away from the near Side by mints itll stay with the big red Music Syracuse entering this game on a fourgame winning streak Cornell had a finals break after their game against Miami the twopoint loss Williams three is good because here Williams cans a threepointer its a onepoint game in favor of Syracuse off early good luck again trying to get that ball in the middle of that zone when it does you dont have long to get ready to shoot that time his feet were set Williams knocked down another three down low Edwards turn around shot puts it up in air all day just waiting on him to get that done in the second half theres no one in his roster to guard him if he starts to get if he decides to get in the paint get deep no one of his roster can bother you can bother his hook shot whos Pete tries a three thats no good the rebound taken by Edwards Cornell trying to do something they havent done in about 60 years and thats beaten ACC team the last win against an ACC team came in the 5152 season against Wake Forest as Williams goes glass fixed in the lead out to five the bank shot getting himself going quick three here whoa a quick three a long three and a good three for Nazir Williams some of you may think thats a bad shot but if Syracuse was in mantoman those are the shots that they would take and I think coach is just trying to emphasize the only offensive end in front of their bench I think hes going to tell us guys we got to pick up the pace a little bit here Syracuse kind of slows it down a little bit flexion and a steal gray Anson swing to Dolan Williams open from Deep missed it Hansons trying to tip it back in instead Edwards with a loose change thats the biggest difference so far in this second half zero offensive rebound not the closest that theyve come to get their hands on one that always has to continue to man The Pain control the paint and thats a challenge you dont want it on a one and done against the Syracuse team it is frustrating at times playing against a team that wants to control the pace of the game Applause Mans Too Strong on the shot foul coming up and this will be charged to the big red and I believe Greg Dolan so thats number one on Dolan three substitutions in for the big red Watson Manning and Ragland back in gray along with Hanson and birthday will sit I think some of whats going on with Dolan as well is hes having a guard Gerard afford to the mens and its just guarding talented offensive players like that but he whips with the dunk passing not many centers can can drive and Kicking Music foreign misses the three another defensive rebound for the orange who lead it by four but those having a guard Gerard so Jude immense here is just giving him hes taking his legs from under many hes not able to make shots blocked by Ragland ushers us to a break four point lead for the orange that many centers in the country to catch the ball there Edwards here the jump hook follows that up with a drive Baseline kick passing the Benny Williams for the dunk she was taking control of the second half up four Music with the awardwinning Geico mobile app we are aspects of predictions on how many threepoint attempts we thought Cornell would make reminder for averaging 32 per game I said 25 Randolph said 40 weve got a bet for Dinosaur Barbecue on the line you do lets see where were at that briskets looking really good right now Im not a cheap date so I can imagine though not not looking good for me no its not nine of 28 go the big red so far from Deep a lot of time left man 15 36 to get 12 more I like my odds Im feeling pretty good about that so do we do whoevers closest to the number wins I mean I would think so I mean the game started stop right now yeah but unfortunately we got 1536 and I like my art so the only question you need to ask is that Jesse Evans gets test checked to see if his nose is bleeding the only question you gotta ask is man do they do they have good wine over there I dont know I mean well Im not a cheap date my friend I hate to do that to you man cant turn down good barbecue and a good meal unless we see the the amongst the greatest performances of all time on the defensive end in the next 15 minutes Im in deep trouble Gerard throws into Williams to the wing Bell dipping in and its an offensive foul against Chris Bell great job stepping in by Ragland number three on Bell Music I thought Bill had his shot initially he had the one dribble pull up there off maybe he thought he was a little deep a great job way to step up put your chest and take a charge there Cornell trying to turn the tide on a lot of rough statistical numbers in this series including one and 28 all time Dome they were out in front by 11 at one point in his first half and now a tieup between mannon and brown and that jumpoff call Works in favor of Syracuse Malik Brown has brought he brought effort when he checked it in the first half and chipped in with four points and really acted on the defensive end in his very first possession he comes in second half gets a tie up I mean hes hes using his length and athleticism but hes really getting after the bringing some energy to this Syracuse defense and their 15point win against Monmouth career highs in scoring and rebounding 117 in the win over the Hawks managed to turn around Jay Off the Mark gotta get back to such a defense lets come right at you Watson three long Miss taken by Mintz in the orange Edwards by the way has gone to the back to get looked at further as a foul picked up here off the drive by Gerard Gerard just a tough tough matchup for these guys just super aggressive get to the paint drawing contact getting doing a great job getting some free throw line tonight this afternoon I mean its already shot forward hes a guy you dont want to foul strong performance continues as Marcus Fillion heads back into the game the foul was charged the guy Ragland Jr Gerard looking for point 19 he has a sixpoint lead for the orange hes almost quarterback from the free throw line I mean hes shooting 81 percent coming into United this afternoon I think hell those numbers arrive throughout the year which shock me if you shot over 90 back door speed and a steal off the pass from Manning tried to get it to Philly and now were going to foul the other way against Manning trying to deal with two defense so a rough sequence there for Chris Manning second time today did they had a bad foul I thought in the back court they did it right before the end of the first half and that one was a shooting foul the one and one this ones not but you dont want to put a team in a bonus really early committing fouls oh man stumbling there a bit and another foul coming up against Savannah and he is on his way to the bench thats number three on Chris Manning something must have said him because he had to file he was asking for the next one and didnt approve of the first foul but kind of begging getting super aggressive asking for the next one this was up obliged six team fouls already for Cornell as Bell continues his strong play the lead is at nine after the Bell three a 70 run for Syracuse Williams cant answer loose ball to the Cornell bench over to Syracuse great shot we talked about Bell I mean hes streaking hes gotten it going hes been aggressive and confident in stepping up and taking and making shots and now Qs is starting to get some of some help heres another look fell again that one misses barely great penetration by Gerard he has it going but gave an extra pass through she making stolen still trying to find some room wide open in the corner Williams cant hit rebound taken by Williams deflected and stolen by Philly theyre going to keep shooting them Watson he cant hit there lose track down same to Williams and this is what you cant have at the Syracuse defense because eventually theyre going to make some youve been up four or five offensive rebounds in his possession alone Bradley gang alive blocks at the rims by Brown so a flurry on threepoint attempts by the big red does not net a bucket instead its another possession for Syracuse holding nine Gerard defeat Bell trying to get into double fakers hanged in the air cant score loose taken by Raglan not going to call it on the defensive file with his contact is he went and jump into the big like that Dolan with the offensive rebound from the Watson Miss its going cold from behind the line here and a scale by Gerard three on one the lobby server to miss the Freshman from Gonzaga High School in DC showing you his Hobbies Applause 11 point lead for Syracuse timeout Big Red Applause Music of the onehour show begins at three Eastern noon Pacific back inside the JMA Wireless Dome and it has been a tough tough time shooting the rock for Cornell from Deep they have struggled mightily from three especially in this second half they struggle from the field minor league in total in the second half as well yeah two of 18 from the floor I mean credit to Syracuse defense this Zone has got knocked into getting steals theyre limiting you know they had one bad possession but they gave up maybe four or five offensive rebounds literally in one possession since then theyve done a really good job nice look down low and a layup for Sean Hanson they were able to hit that play a couple of times in the first half they do it here to cut it to a 12point game I hope he can try to in the past you wanted to try to run that play against the smaller of the Wings inside and a big round thats heard me talking about him its another midrange turnaround jump shot there and young guys are starting to starting to chip in here we talked about someone else needing to step into the game and help Gerard out and everybodys doing their part here and well have a kickball here as Jesse Edwards set to make his way back into the game and Edwards one of those players who the productivity has increased here in the second half and that has really helped establish control you see the bench stand up when he comes out the defensive effort has picked up both halves when hes entered the game and credited to him a lot of his stats arent showing up his statistical stats but his energy and effort on the defensive end is its one of the reasons the orangeman had to leave youre just joining us its been a tale of two halves as gray and man and head back in for the big red Cornell LED for just over 19 minutes in the first half Syracuse Neverland and in this second half its been the opposite Syracuse is pretty much LED most of the way here in the second half Cornell has not been able to see his control again Gerard gambling there nearly came up with a steal down low Hanson trying to get it to Dolan Dolan only three shots from the field in this game right now look how active they are getting deflections I mean this is not the same Zone we saw in the first half and they are really getting after Cornell right now on the defensive end s slips and a travel maybe a little too deep for the Freshman this penetration see bayheim telling them calm down Young fella calm down slow down we havent talked about that much in this game so far this is one of the younger teams yes for Syracuse and in the country for that matter they got some limp they got some experience and that was on cue was a senior lead this group and we talked about Gerard and the other guys just sophomores and freshmen so Gerard cant get that one man Applause speed Brays open but lost the ball he was underneath the rim but didnt put it up thats because Jesse out would stand right there and he didnt want to start the break because that he went up and shot that I think Applause all right the AC leader in Block shots hes got him here throwing it down they just theyre just doing it theyre just picking back up they didnt go to him early theyre making a considered effort to get him the ball in the second half critical moment right now in the game for Cornell theyre not shooting it great you just got to continue to take shots this team has been down before they were down by 21 against Miami before storming back and they had a shot to potentially tie the game or win it late mints lost it again wow the PowerHouse dunk from Jesse Edwards off the line Edwards has announced himself that he has arrived this afternoon into Hanson throw it away call the foul well the officials are getting together and yes there will be a foul called the nearsight official pointed that it was going to be Syracuse basketball but a foul was called I think theyre trying to look to see if theres a shooting foul he was looking to pass I think he knew it was coming and tried to pass theyre looking on the monitor to see if theres two shots are underneath yeah yeah its not shooting foul being inside out here coming up Watson Corner three that rattles out and a hole will be called here on Edwards of Syracuse foreign coach boeheims message earlier who sat him down he did do so in the first half Cornell is going to continue to shoot these threes what a run put together by Syracuse 182 Cornell has missed 15 of the last 16 shots shot clock down to five gray now to Raglan step back three missed it lost the ball Edwards now over to mens another possession for Syracuse aided by a turnover courtesy of Cornell Music Bell jumper knocks It Down Smooth midrange jump shot there just get into his spots playing off that threepoint shot knocked down a couple threes tonight you gotta respect it shoots his rhythm it rain shot looks good coming out of his hands hes got 11 gray he cant end the drought Edwards tied up and a jump ball called it will be a Cornell possession out of the break a 20point lead and part helped by Jesse Edwards Elvis just picking it up on both ends of the floor here he catches the post goes up slams and finish it just dominating his second half helping Hughes to get up by 20 here maybe you just needed a Snickers Derek Jones and Randolph Childress here with you in Syracuse New York Jesse Edwards has been a big part of the second half but Randolph how about the progression hes made throughout his career the leap last year and now in his senior year a double double machine I thought his injury last year derailed him I thought he was on Pace to get the most improved player in the conference a year ago and hes still improving on those numbers now averaging the DoubleDouble and hes just been got to show the greatest team that may be their best player off the mess Cornell able to get the ball back Williams he cant hit those shooting rules continue out of bounds and itll stay with Cornell as we approach seven and a half minutes left to go as Gerard appears to be holding his hand there I think the most important thing about that last possession was that that was the 41st threepoint shot which means oh I need to start wheres my computer already started looking at dining options and beverages here for my dinner I I may have been floated a barbecue suggestion so yes it looks like you youve got grabbed the dub on that friendly wager yeah three to shoot one to shoot for Dolan missed it man and gets it back took hunting Williams his floaters no good Dolan now Manning from Deep thats good thats just the basketball guys were finally rewarding Cornell for getting on the offensive blast they had missed nine straight shots and 21 of their last 22 shots before one for Manning and I know this sounds crazy but this game is far from over this team is so dangerous because of the the amount of players that can make shot for them and when youre up big this time find yourself trying to milk time and run clock and this is a team that thats very comfortable shooting in five seconds or eight seconds Music put off the gas into Syracuse At All by the way that foul charged to Chris Mann and thats his fourth so Bell on the side of Syracuse and Manning on Cornell each with four fouls just under seven minutes left to go and one out of two Music where they are Music Williams good step the floater is blocked by Jesse Edwards 31 blocks on the season heading into this game and emphatic one there I mean he rotates over and nearly they gave someone a concussion he blocked that so hard in Miss Danger that ball came out looking like a die made a fastball coming out of there I mean he has some heat on it looked like the fans were okay over there theyre joking and laughing about it one to shoot and the shot is in Marcus Fillion able to connect to cut it to a 16point game second block shot of the game by the way for Edwards Williams speeding ahead tried to squeeze that one in deflected outside Gerard three missed it Loose Williams had a hand on it over to Cornell back in the flow for the orange theyre giving Gerard a break here if youre Cornell this is your change you know the Syracuse teams incident bench a little bit in offensive weapons a rod is out right now so if you wanted to make a comeback this is your chance change start chipping away just lean down to the foul line ten seconds to shoot Dolan trying to find some room foul line Jay is going theyll give you that shot all day long if you take it talking to coach Earl before the game he definitely expected the pace of this game to be slowed down as an unforced error there by mens I think he wanted a lob there but Edwards not ready for it coach bayheim telling this guy his timeout he saw your freshman guard throw a left hand fast hes like calm down young fella 14point lead for the Syracuse Orange Cornell trying to charge back 6 52 lead for the orange Derrick Jones and Randolph Childress with you from the JMA Wireless Dome its been a half of basketball that has been dominated by Syracuse but also too helped Along by a significant scoring trout for Cornell that saw them missile and 21 out of 22 field goal attempts I joke with coach Earl that if he needed me I can come out there and make a couple shots with everybody I didnt think hed really need me Brian Earl one of the greatest threepoint Shooters in the history of the ivy league as a member of the Princeton tigers guys like you and him would salivated playing in this era well I told him I would have loved to play for him yeah you know I I told him that I would have flat out most played for him the way he lets his guys play and get up shots Quick Lane for three a lot of time left and this is the time you want to make games interesting this team is custom depressing and getting after you a little bit here and I expect Gerard to get to the scores table get in this game Syracuse doesnt find a way to get a basket here that ends a personal drought for rag when he had missed on his first eight field goal attempts got three five to shoot for mens mens floater got him freshman assistant no one touches the ball he dribbles out the clock but hes knocks it down the lead at 10 11 by the three you die by the three they died by the three early and now theyre starting to come alive here among shooting drought its a lot of time left hard to believe at one point if youre just hopping into this game that Cornell was actually in front by 11 in the first half and Copeland catches the window for two foreign Applause theyre able to save the ball to Edwards and now the action will flow the other way into the front court for Torrance and its thrown away so a break for Cornell with 33 left to go need a couple of Threes to get back into this game down by 12 presented by Food Lion official grocer of the ACC Music back inside the Dome 7058 lead for Syracuse Derrick Jones and Randolph Childress with you as we take you down the home stretch and threepoint shooting has been one of the big story lines in the game and also off the air as well between Randolph and I as we made some predictions beforehand about how many attempted threepointers would be made as you can see one person is losing that bet decisively Im like the crowd that yells when theres a ChickfilA Sandwich when they missed two free throws that was big with the with the threes they got in the 30s Im yelling like come on they are now Cornell just one off at the program record for attempted threes check that two off as a loose ball foul coming up they have 47 threepoint attempts as the program record interestingly enough last year in the 12 point loss two Syracuse here in the dome and it looks like they are going to eye up that record and potentially go reasonably north of it as Bell sinks in the free throw they may get 50 before its all said done today but this is how they play I mean theyve actually slowed things down because they didnt want to rush to take quick shots against Syracuse and again the zone defense for them just stepped off they got started getting deflections and um just really commanding that team in the second half incredible to Malik Brown his minutes are just been great Henson tries to fake out the defense cant do it there gets it back today Sean Hanson with the bucket its a 12point game Torrance double team and the bell bell the law for Edwards two more Edwards gets the jump the dump there but great job by Samir Taurus just being strong with the ball taking on the Trap that would have tied the program record but Greg Dolan split on the back line turnover Cornell Jesse Edwards closing in on a double double hes got nine points along with 11 rebounds great job by Torrance again just pressure throwing it over top of the defense now Music Applause Torrance a little teardrop to go back to cut by Dolan the speed the kick out the threeway off to Watson and thats into the hands of Torrance and that should be the time for the program record for threepoint attempts down the floor to Williams the lane thanks it in nice finish by the sophomore from Saint Andrews High School in Potomac Maryland I had a privilege of recruiting him couldnt keep it from the orange man and you see why Keller boost me back Ragland back in as well and this has to be a deflating experience for Brian Earl in this second half his team preseason number five in the ivy league theyve reached the ivy league tournament last season lost a heartbreaker to the ivy league regular season Champion Princeton but once again Cornell undeterred seven and two coming in both losses coming to ACC teams kick out for Williams down low well I dont know how many ivy league teams has it just yet was controlling the pain and so I Im seeing him now I dont know I would think they gonna place a little higher than fifth seems to have so much depth and so many options and theyre going to be a tough out in any league and tonight you know this score is not indicative of how this game was early Predator Syracuse turning things up that guy right there with the basketball Joe Gerard now Williams his jumpers no good the rebound control by DJ Nix whos into the game for the first time Cooper Nord the three is in and the three is also a program record for most threepointers attempted in a game by a Cornell team attempt 48 on the day foreign ER 33 seconds left to go we talked to a lot of folks coming into this game there was definitely some concern about the Cornell big red dealing with Syracuse and there you go Jesse Edwards gets the double double with that bucket what a performance in the second half for him 11 points 12 rebounds he had one point at halftime with four rebounds now hes up to 12 I mean he and Malik Brown controlling the inside has been a big help to Syracuse kind of pushing away the block Down Low by Edwards and that will do it an emphatic end to a comeback by the Syracuse Orange they win it 7863 an impressive defensive performance in half two yeah you see the overall adjustment by Syracuse in that zone we talked about it Cornell came out firing for three early spreaded that defense out Syracuse made adjustments to it got him to run
