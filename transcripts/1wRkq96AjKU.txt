against hes going to be really important inside of that zone he was terrific of course at the JMA Dome back on the 11th of January Syracuse 18272 big ball game tonight not just in the 40 minutes here at Castle Coliseum but in the collective seasons of both Virginia Tech and Syracuse Jesse Edwards Grant basili get us going and great to have you tonight on acc Network MJ Collins draws the start for Mike young and of course the orange settle into the Zone here Dan well they do and you got to get the ball inside and then look quickly heres Padula at the foul line the rebound taken away and that is Malik Brown and youll notice Jim behinds lineup tonight the Freshman from Culpepper Virginia Brown plugged in so this is a brand new lineup first time the orange have started a ball game this way Edwards on the scoop at the offensive end so each Club has missed a shot of course Tech opens into mantoman and heres the Hokie lineup we told you about Collins with Couture Padula Vasily and mutts and there is the silly from the corner my goodness 373 of the year for the Wright State transfer the Virginia Tech Hokies West when theyre right theyre relying heavily on the threepoint basket Mike Youngs not going to be happy with that backdoor cut just a defensive breakdown and one of the problems the Hokies have had in ACC play is they havent really shot the three effectively yeah Virginia Tech and ACC Play Just 33 from behind the line three ball Couture and the rebound pulled away by Jesse Edwards Music Applause theres that back down we talked about Gerards done a marvelous job developing a full game for Coach behind and look at a hell ball and possession will belong to the orange and there across the way is the 77 year old native of lions New York most wins among active division one head coaches A Thousand Eleven now in 47 years that is alma mater Applause sliding through his mints and hell draw the foul from Couture Judah mentz has got a crafty game Dan yeah he does Wes hes a guy who does not shoot the three very well but hes really good attacking the basket as the season has gone on hes done a much better job being a point guard in high school he was a scoring guard so hes done a much better job finding his open teammates he said you know get midrange jump shots but hes always been very good getting to the basket first on Couture mens is a 75 free throw shooter Syracuse comes into the ball game they are 11th in conference play at 72 percent and he buys one of two this is a game I think where the Hokies are going to have to score they scored 72 points in the last game and they still lost by 10 yep Syracuse is a team that can put some points on the board how about basily again from behind the line mutts the rebound had it taken away by Edwards now Gerard leads the break hell try and skip it ahead throw on the way to basilic turned over by the orange heres Padula in transition the lobby for Justin months Applause thats some play by matz that was not a perfect pass Applause easily West Virginia Tech really worried about playing you know defending that screen and they just let Edwards go Music live all ball game weve played almost three minutes theres that high post pass nice catch facility on the bounce hes got five early West that was really hard move he had to twist his body around to be able to get that up there yep ice cream by Edwards trying to get Mets on the attack Gerard looking for a window and here is the 68 rookie Brown back to the veteran now Edwards will move on basili tried to force it up and I think Clarence Armstrongs going to tag him for a travel yep turned over by Jesse Edwards but back to the bounce and lob from Padula thats a nice job by Virginia Tech to get out in transition as they say its a good idea by Padula not a particularly well executed pass but you have some margin per error when youre working with a guy like mutts yep Music Doula foul line area Quick Pass but silly the catch and slapped out of there by Brown Justin Taylor has checked in for Syracuse wearing jersey number five hes a freshman from Charlottesville you get a look at Malik Brown whos also from the Commonwealth hes a Culpepper native I think basily caught that bar thered been a hole in his stomach that was some hard pass but it was thrown into traffic you know throw the ball into trouble if you can avoid it quick bounce pass is kicked by the orange and itll stay with the Hokies and Mike young who had the pregame popcorn always yep 66 wins here in Blacksburg 365 21st season as a head coach Music medulla silly quick three spins out Edwards another rebound for the orange now hes made one West but hes had three really good looks yep and I think if youre the Hokies youre willing to live and die with them Gerard backing down on the tour A Little Fall away is partially blocked but right to Edwards immense spinning foul line jumper is no good really good defense medulla for Couture Music Collins is three out of the corner Edwards will pull that away for the orange Syracuse doing a nice job and not allowing any second chance opportunities Taylor a three and thats what he does Wes hes an outstanding outside shooter first points in almost three games for Justin Taylor plays about 17 minutes a contest theres another look in basily scores across the foul on Edwards foreign free throw for the Hokies when we come back to the castle underway in Blacksburg tonight on acc Network Music Applause Music Music thank you Music well you see the first meeting 17 days ago Syracuse pulled away late Dan to win 8272 the differential in five threepoint baskets big night for basili big knife for Gerard Five Points also a factor we talked about the fact that Virginia Tech is a team that really is a good team when theyre scoring effectively Im not sure theyre going to win very many games when they only make three threepoint baskets and second half field goal percentage of course that is a big difference and you know during that seven game losing streak Mike Youngs guys didnt play poorly West they just something went wrong every game and in most games it was the fact that they didnt shoot the ball well after the foul on Edwards got us to the break but silly missed the chance at the threepoint play so a onepoint lead for Virginia Tech and a lob and dunk Mensa special delivery and Jesse Edwards has got a pair of field goals here thats the second time Virginia Tech has found themselves picked off and has given up an easy inside basket there is mutts quickly Couture right corner basily Chris Ball movement here by the Hokies trying to find the crease in the zone Couture quick shot my goodness where did he come flying in there didnt he pokies regain the lead on an acrobatic follow by the Freshman MJ Collins and medulla almost took it away hell ball well send it to the Hokies because lots of times when you play zone you dont have any specific lockout responsibilities and Collins flies in he was over the back but fortunately the back he was over was basilis heres mutz he seems to be the guy but silly the dog and Dan when I say the guy mutz is the guy whos triggering absolutely the offense soon as they start dropping off of him for those passes hes really good at that midrange jump shot Hokies by three Taylor on a quick pass Edwards the catch basily blocked it and recovers it and Edwards has committed his second both Syracuse fouls belong to the senior from Amsterdam Jesse Edwards Applause I know this is frustrating for Edwards to have him shot blocked but you got a hundred stand youve already got one fouled youre so valuable to your team you just have to let that one go yep and thats thats sort of been a problem for Edwards he really needs to stay in the game and every once while he gets some foul trouble so with Edwards on the bench Monier Hima the 611 sophomore transfer from Niger checks into the lineup he plays right there in front of mutts heres Couture out of the corner Virginia Techs passing West has been outstanding theyre forcing that defense to commit theyve been trying to go outside to stop the threepoint shot but then Virginia Tech has hurt them inside so now they clogged the inside and Couture hits the three pokies have opened up a sixpoint lead Taylor at the top and it rims out rebounded by months Applause 70 run for Virginia Tech medulla thought about it theres mutts again one dribble on that zone and tend to shoot now Collins to much Quick Pass thats Lynn Kidd and its blocked off by Hema award the basket for kid on the goaltend by manir Hema that is great ball moving in great Patience by Virginia Tech and a timeout will be taken here by the orange eight point lead for Virginia Tech its a nine nothing run seven minutes in at the castle Applause Music quadruple header and boy Virginia Techs on a tear Syracuse has gone almost two and a half minutes without a basket Denny Williams on the floor for the first time tonight slapped out of there and the Hokies have a turnover Virginia Techs done a terrific job against the Zone Dan well they sure have thats been the key to so effectively here is Lynn Kidd and out on the left side John Camden a young freshman from downington PA misses his 16th three of the year hes hit three and 15 tries coming into the ball game for Mike Young Im here Torrance on to run the offense and heres Taylor with another three Im not sure that at this point in his development West that contested three is really in his wheelhouse hes really good if he gets an open look Music heres Camden Darius Maddox by the way announced prior to the ball game is not available tonight for family reasons here is kid a quick kick out Camden eyes a three spins out and the rebound for the Freshman Taylor Torrance and the orange are just hoping for a basket here kick out three from the front and how about three of the year Well Wes he comes into the game from outside from threepoint range shooting 16 percent in ACC play 18 overall Camden will try another one left it short and the rebound for Nema arhima I should say Monir Hema who has come onto the floor after Jesse Edwards picked up two fouls six minutes into this first half and that ball got stripped off of Torrance its going to go the Hokies Virginia Tech with a fivepoint lead here on a big Saturday in the castle Music four of our quadruple header what a day its already been as we reach the Midway point of ACC playing were seeing a good one here tonight well we sure are this is a very important game for both teams probably more so for Virginia Tech as they try to get back to their winning ways and of course when you play Syracuse you got to be able to attack that zone and so far Virginia Tech has done an outstanding job Grant facilities the guy scoring but look here Justin much catches the ball in the middle makes a great pass to pizzelle who locates perfectly then okay lets send basily out to the corner and then how about that leftheaded pass by Padula and basella he catches the Fallen sideways hes twisted and turn it all around but somehow hes able to score him Syracuse came out of a drought on the three by mens a moment ago heres another look out of Couture from the right corner foreign and again West the defense collapses inside and Ill tell you what you cant leave Couture like that Applause thats the way Virginia Tech is playing on offense has the orange between the devil and the Duke Blue Sea here Justin mutts had nine assists 17 days ago in the first meeting between these two hes already got five and Padula just fouled Gerard on the three so Sean Padula the sophomore from Edmond Oklahoma draws his first its the second on Virginia Tech hes got some energy about him Doula and he gets him he gets him on the wrist Music so here is Gerard who arrived in central New York as one of the best pure free throw shooters in New York State history remember of course hes set also to scoring records in Glen Falls what a senior year he averaging 15 points a game or some crazy thing yep and hes noted for free throw shoes in fact I was once uh called out for putting the announcer Jinx on a free throw one time at the Dome oh really but I havent said a word and Gerard missed the back end so there we go okay well theres no such thing as the announcer Jimmy he got two of the three orange to within six heres the zone and mutts look at that look away past the Couture look at that oh my goodness he threw it but silly wasnt quite ready to handle it it looked like Dan I dont know how he got that to really messy through it through about six sets of arms is kind of got a Vibe about him at that post position at the foul line area against the Zone it feels like hey when you have nonassists in the first game probably feeling pretty good right hes already got four today as you said Collins who drew the start and Couture traveled on the Hop yep fun to go one way thought about it and it cost Virginia Tech possession as weve reached the Midway Point weve talked about the Midway point of the ACC calendar that came in the noon hour today 75th conference game we had 75 down 75 to go before we get to Greensboro theres a runner and another acrobatic score from Metz six for Judah Miss and West thats file number two on Sean yeah we said mince is really aggressive he is hard to stay in front of Petula got a little bit Tangled Up would be silly there and thats two fouls now on Padula and backtoback possessions third on the Hokies and Mintz had the free throw roll off six here in the first half freshman from Fort Washington Maryland Music to the foul line from Vince quick kick to the corner for Collins look at an open three Couture Applause cant move the ball any better now he did not play in the game at uh Syracuse Dan but hes impacting this one here Pokey lead is seven and a turnover must roll to the deck and tried to make the save and mince commits the foul itll be his first and the third on the arms first has been active on both ends of the Court West the only mistake he made that time is he tried to recover the ball by dribbling and it worked out pretty well because he was able to draw the foul well lets go back to the ball movement here Dan its been spectacular well mutt throws it inside and its not a clean catch by basily but because hes operated so effectively and theres the defenses called defense collapses and Couture is the guy who knows how to find the open area all right substitutions here for the Hokies we get our first look at Malaysia Poteet hes coming the ball game to run that Baseline against the zone it was silly now plays the post and a nice pass both teeth the basket Applause Music lead goes to nine heres Gerard a kick out in the three ball from Williams and the rebound for Couture Music Applause Music Applause the tour out front padul on the bench with the fouls bazilly moves to the post area and heres Collins a three foreign thats his 11th three of the year Jim Boeheim wants a timeout and he will take it hes got a word for Judah Mintz as they come back to the bench Virginia Tech has built a 12point lead at home from the Huddle who just patted Hunter Couture on the chest Mike young the head coach of the Hokies tell you what hes got a plan tonight against this Zone doesnt he but hes got a plan West but his guys are executing the plan perfectly thats the thing you can have all the plans you want but if your players dont do what theyre supposed to do then theyre sort of worthless yep before he well we have seen from Virginia Tech tonight is a tremendous ball movement and when theyre getting open shots theyre making a very high percentage the Hokies look like an offensive machine and West gets a 12 point game but with the way the Hokies are playing all funds you think its like a 22point game immense back in the ball game thought about the three Couture there Gerard a little step back and push Hema could not control the rebound for Syracuse now Couture noted as a tremendous Defender and he was just close enough to Gerard to bother that on Camden with uh hold on theres a long three back Couture that was that was deep Music the orange back on the attack down 12 they need a three and Taylor obligence thats what Im talking about that time Kane Taylor the catching through shoot three before the defense gets there yep that seems to be what his strength is right at the moment Justin Taylor who played his final year at IMG Academy in Florida but is a Charlottesville product a couple of Virginians on this roster here is Collins launching and hitting okay thats not a defensive lapse right there by Syracuse thats just great offense yep back to a 12point advantage Music Taylor against Poteet Music of the Hokies can gamble a little bit more here right Dan mints fouled before the shot thatll get us to a timeout Mike Youngs team up 12 ahead of seven minutes to play in the first half Music Hunter Couture the ball goes inside he doesnt stand he goes down to the open area in the corner and of course hes a great threepoint shooter now MJ Collins does the same thing you see everybody in the zone go to the middle and so Collins is wide open the Hokies made three threepoint baskets the last time these two teams played theyve already got six tonight yeah and interestingly Wes with the way theyre shooting the three you think theyre all going in the basket but theyre only six for 15 from out there in fact 15 of their 29 field goal attempts have been from Beyond The Arc so help me 12 assists on 13 baskets is also good isnt it not bad yeah not bad I mean Mike Youngs got it hitting on all cylinders to the point that Jim behind has to counter and bring Jesse Edwards now back onto the floor with the two fouls and Edwards has to be very careful Wes hes a very experienced player but youve just got to be careful when youre playing with 2000 the first time Chris Bell of course freshman from Concord California inside this is brown maneuvering around and scoring second field goal for Malik Brown and West for all the talk weve been doing about Virginia Techs offense Syracuse is only down 10 yeah and they really havent gotten anything going yet on offense Camden left open again hell hit well you know if you shoot enough eventually its going in thats his fourth attempt his first make he had six points at WinstonSalem earlier this year hes got his fourth threepointer to start his scoring here tonight and push the lead to 13 keep in mind that Padula is on the bench here for Virginia Tech because hes got two phones Hokies have hit six of their last seven from the floor much trying to help with the double team with Collins on mints four to shoot and here is brown skipping for Bell got to put it up does as the shot clock goes off and it spins out Malik Brown battle but couldnt control it and basily does for Virginia Tech notice the honkies in no hurry with Padula on the bench Couture takes over at point guard and thats Tor hes so versatile three ball Collins Applause 11 in the first half not Weston the orange are standing around looking one another like what do we do now the lead is blown to 16 at this point heres Taylor trying to answer and does Justin Taylors got nine he averages just five against the league Applause he scored what 25 against Bryant earlier in the year that is correct yeah theres mats hes been the straw to stir of the drink tonight if you will in the first half Couture attacking skip pass Camden thought about it 10 to shoot Couture Wes once you get that zone scrambling did if you keep moving the ball eventually youre going to get a wide open shot 16point lead and mens pushes it off the glass and in now you got the idea that time that mins just said enough of this Im taking the ball to the basket yeah hes got eight the lead is 14 again and hes out there trying to fire up his guys on the defensive end yep Music but the key to this whole thing has been getting that ball to mutts on the inside skips quickly now heres Collins tried to go to Couture I think Taylor got a hand on it was seven to shoot back to college with five heres Vasily in the corner he will drive stepped out of bounds Clarence Armstrong on the whistle Applause so with 4 13 to go its back to the orange dont forget we got a womens basketball quadruple header tomorrow well start you at noon at the JMA Wireless Dome Louisville and Syracuse and then its off to Tallahassee Brook Wyckoff and Florida State against Carol Lawson number 16 Duke and then it just the beats keep coming because then its North Carolina and Clemson at four oclock and then the night cap the Commonwealth cup Kenny Brooks takes Virginia Tech to Charlottesville six oclock presented by Food Lion to see the Cavalier all that on acc Network and streaming live for you on the app Wes we had a foul I think called on Camden he and Bell got mixed up out there and the Hokies have been very aggressive on the defensive end and air turned over and here comes Collins mutts and thats going to be three on Edwards if that is on Edwards thats three and it is Jesse Edwards third as we go to break behavs team Trails by 14 10 and then down three threepoint baskets in seven excuse me in the ACC played so far this year he only has a total of seven hes got the three more tonight and hes got good shots and hes knocked them down well you see Justin Taylor for Syracuse keeping the orange in the thick of it with his three threes well as as badly as things have gone here for Syracuse West you have the opportunity here in the last four minutes of the half you just stay close you dont allow the Hokies to go out on a run maybe you go on a little run yourself and try to get it under double digits but 41 points and a half that is some offensive performance for the Hokies you notice the zone now Contracting a little bit trying to find months theres basily scoring easily through a double team well first of all thats a dynamite pass West its a tremendous catch in traffic and then basily doesnt hesitate he just takes the ball right up through traffic and scores boy what a half for Justin mutts and hes only got one field going Jude immense trying to yep Jude immense trying to get Syracuse going has eight to shoot kick out three and mutts collects The Rebound in front of Malik Brown thats really good defense by Collins to keep mins from getting by again mins not a great threepoint shooter if you can force him into that shot thats great Camden Music looking for some help there is what a pass back door slapped out by brown but right to Camden redshirt freshman from downington PA well thats the way the first half has gone for Syracuse they get a great play at the basket and the block shot goes right up do a shooter who knocks it down Camdens got five two field goals here in this first half he only had four in the uh 12 games he played so far and theres a block call and that will be on Collins itll be his second thats the sixth on the Hokies quick reminder to you Wednesday night right here on acc Network Dan and Ill be at Smith Center in Chapel Hill boy Pitt Carolina for the second time meet and then Florida State and NC State in Raleigh at nine oclock Music State the big win today Florida state with that really tough loss thatll be an interesting event all of it for you they came back against Miami sure did what a terrific come from behind win most wins in the ACC for a pit team since Jamie Dixon went Nine and Nine in his last year Dan Panthers standing in eight victories after the victory today theres Mets attacking and a foul to be ticketed to mutts and thats going to be just as much that is seven now on Virginia Tech with 217 to play Syracuse by the way 72 percent freethrow shooting team in conference play and 11th finally Wes weve been talking about the Virginia Tech offense but their defense particularly the defense by Hunter Couture against Joe Gerard has been spectacular Gerard only has two points both of them from the freethrow line and hes only attempted two field goals second one good thats called smothering defense right there 10 points for Judah mentz nine for Taylor thats 19 of Syracuse is 29 between those two guys both on the floors we work our way toward two minutes to play Quick Pass heres Camden step in two over the top and Hema Falcon Monir Hema draws his first Applause thats really good reaction by Camden nice job by mens to come flying at him before running off that threepoint line but then he just steps inside and he has a nice jumper youngster Camden an interesting story Dan he played two minutes of the first game a year ago at Memphis and suffered a foot injury so essentially hes a redshirt freshman who then went in the portal comes here to Blacksburg Music and uh chose Virginia Tech over LSU in the process Music Applause fun to play for if youre a player and foul that time on Camden his Mintz was attacking at the head of the circle thatll be the first on campus now on the Hokies foreign Applause Music Applause Camden over to talk to him Mike Jones the associate head coach for Mike Young and by the way a terrific player in his own right here is mens front end of the one and one Mike Jones made me feel a little old today Wes he stopped me in the hallway and said that when he was in school Entry School he used to fake being sick the first day of the ACC tournament and what he would do is he would he would stay at home and he would watch me doing games in the ACC I got news for you Mike get in line a lot of us did that principal Foster Bluford Elementary in Greensboro never caught onto my deal though foul is uh ticketed to Monir Hema itll be his second last six on the orange what a great thing that was you know I mean it was like the big deal in this part of the country where thats what people would do they just want to watch the ACC tournament yep the quarterfinals used to be Thursday at noon just like they are now come to think of it heres mutts now Frank Couture tend to shoot 90 seconds to go in this first half a sparkling opening 20 minutes for the Hokies oh boy Couture left open he was left open because mutz drove to the basket and the defense collapsed on him mutts has been nothing short of fabulous 15 for Hunter Couture on five threes Dan fog is into much once everybody Chase mutts and then mince is running down to the corner because sillies open and Virginia Techs been very good from the corner but thats Hunter Couture out there like I said the devil in the deep blue seed Youll Go cover basilia in the corner where do you cover uh Couture at the top of the gate and when youre moving the ball as well as Virginia Tech has moved it thats the kind of dilemma Syracuse his face with you know its amazing the similarities after the win the other night it gets Duke Dan to where Virginia Tech is coming into tonight a year ago after nine games they were two and seven they kind of been you know wobbling around in their conference season right then all of a sudden they caught fire the other night they beat Duke theyre two and seven again and here are the Hokies playing maybe one of their best halves of the year they got 49 points with a minute 21 to go yes and the funny thing about Virginia Tech is they did such a great job in the nonconference part of the schedule their metrics still looked pretty good the way everybody measures for whether or not you can get an atlarge bid to the insane tournament Virginia Tech is in decent shape our Joe linardi has him out of the tournament but under consideration but this is a team they can get hot they have some opportunities for big wins coming up they just have to avoid stubbing their toe theyre playing terrific in this opening half building an 18point lead immense on the drive lost it got it back 16 to shoot for the orange look at this kill against basily the Up and Under rolled off Camden ends up with it well you got to be careful about that west central Syracuse he starts doing that Im talking about mens everybody else tends to stand around and watch the Hokies have gotten their offense role with ball movement and thats what the orange need Music theres mutts knocked out of there well played maniere inside Brown on the Finish thats generally a staple up to Syracuse offense to get out create your offense with your defense but thats the first time weve seen that tonight boy nice play by the sophomore transfer Moneer hema first time anybodys knocked the ball away from matsune yep the tour Camden now 13 seconds to play Brown gambled on the Steal eight seconds heres Couture now basilia three sure why not Applause why not to the end of the first half my goodness what a show Dan what a tremendous show I mean great ball movement great shooting great defense in Virginia Tech cannot afford to lose you have to win all your three and four games and then you got to get some one and two opportunities and get wins there after the hotel it has been a terrific day in the ACC will kind of cap it as we move through this second half Edwards plays with three as we open the second half and Jesses got the ball to post and here is the rookie meant to work on Padula who fouls in and that is three on Sean Padula to start the second half interestingly enough wesla only played 10 minutes in the first half because the foul trouble and mince is one of those hard to guard guys you know Petula did a nice job stopping him he figures mince is going up for the jump shot so he goes to the fake and he gets the foul free throw is good for Judah mens hes got 13 now in the ball game three times hes been the ACC rookie of the week and thats good as long as youre not comparing yourself to Kyle Phillips this is the second one by the way philipowski and the Blue Devils today philipowski 187 rebounds Duke beat Georgia Tech by 43 in Atlanta I mean it was hard I mean its hard score to look at and go what heres the Zone again and Padula clutched on one out front heres mentz or much rather and the kick out three and the silly battled for it and they got carried out and Judah Mintz now takes over and the orange Gerard had a quiet first half too he only took two shots yeah just a couple of free throws for his talent and basically Couture was all over him MJ Collins is going to get whistled for the foul and the foul on Collins will be his third it is the second on the Hokies quickly thats the second time theyve fouled mens here in the second half West and weve only played one minutes in the second half and mince has already been fouled eight times in this game pretty much a sellout here tonight at the castle on a Saturday night great environment here is Edwards rolling and scoring third field goal for Jesse Edwards theres some question about seriously turned over Gerard off the giveaway the scoop and theyll battle for it brown comes up with it cant finish and the rebound pulled away by Justin mutts thats good scrap by Syracuse but just couldnt finish mayhems throwing a little full court in there occasionally as this years worn on well theyve pressed a little bit Wes is to speed up the game to change the tempo they usually dont stay in this very long but they knew something to change the way this game has flown Music the Hokies were tactical against this Zone and that ball got kicked by Edwards 42 will be reset to 20 thats a break for Virginia Tech it is a break for Virginia Tech and mutts is you know thats a time where I think he threw a pass when he should have taken that 10foot jump shot Music Ula just kind of a go route to Couture in the background Music Applause Music Quick Pass but silly open out of the coin theres a way on the rim and heres Jude events Now Syracuse can take their time here but dont forget youre down 16 Bells three you have to take good shots yep and I dont think that was a good shot Bell can really shoot the three but I think you want to move the defense around a little bit get yourself a rhythm three and told you Padula was scoreless and then spent the last 10 minutes on the bench at the end of the half the silly out of the corner much tried to follow couldnt near the orange with another try well the Hokies are not going to shoot 62 percent for the game so the orange being presented with a bit of an opportunity here but they cant convert even yeah Vince misses a soft jumper and Virginia Tech who had 52 at the half youre stuck on that number still three minutes into the second 20 Lins will try and unlock the basket nope long miss the silly cleaning up inside skips for Couture three ball got it come on threes for Hunter Couture Tides his season high he had six earlier this year against William and Mary Music when Couture is all over Joe Gerard and a drive Mintz will go to the deck and Jamie lucky I think I think he called that a charge is that a charge on Judah Mintz yes it is much does a nice job stepping in hes just barely outside that restrictive check it back in for the Hokey number 11 John 10 John Camden is reported back from Virginia Tech a nasty fall for both guys but yeah both appear okay Eminence checked in Justin Taylor had a nice first half for Coach Boeheim has also reported back and here is Padula which bounce pass through traffic Camden the head to Justin Muntz crowd wanted him to challenge the basket you see what the Hokies have done their last two games Monday night against Duke they were just sparkling heres Padula trying to get him going again some of the three first points of the night for Padula its 48 from three tonight and that was before those last two threes expect Padula to get going at some point lead is 22 now four minutes into this second half at the castle Gerard out front attacking on the dribble now picks up on the pressure now Mitchell trying to make something happen a little Runner and He will draw the Padula foul that is four on Padula and that is three on the Hokies free throws when we come back in Blacksburg where this week he was one of the main if not the main face of ACC basketball on television you simply cannot talk about the history of ACC basketball without acknowledging the pivotal role played by Billy Packer yeah and it was interesting you mentioned in the first half to you know kids that hung out of school on Thursdays well they were more than likely in the 70s watching Billy Packer Jim Thacker and Bones McKinney at the Greensboro Coliseum and then the nation found out about Billy Packer from 34 straight final fours Dan while Wes I am not objective at all about Billy Packer in 1991 when CBS expanded their coverage of the NCAA tournament and they needed more announcers particularly more analysts Billy Packard told his bosses at CBS to hire me you know some 37 year old nobody from nowhere and and that started a what has now become a 33year run for me so I owe a great deal personally to Billy Packer Im going to miss it yeah were all going to miss Billy Packer heres basily on the catch and he will score with the right hand 16 now for basily his first point to the second half Applause out of the turnover here is Collins hes got players with him Camden and the ball got slapped around after the missed layup and heres cymer Torrance trying to flip the orange to transition and the silly will slap that off the glass and that will be a basket for cymer Torrance itll be his first points of the game you know Torrance got it up there but somebody else got a hand on it I dont know that this one is going in the basket the dead Balls Above the Rim and it hit the glass it hit the backboard and thats a goal Town out of the double team you see Virginia Tech work it to the front Court again now they played 10 minutes in the first half without Padula theyre gonna have to play most of the second half without Purdue and that ball got knocked away on an entry pass to the pivot area where that was costly in the first half against the orange Syracuse has kind of handled that a little better here in the second here well that time Brown did a really good job hes got really quick hands that youngster Malik Brown with the ball drawing his first start of the Year tonight and gets the dunk on the Baseline fourth field goal for brown hes got eight and heres that pressure again offered by bayheims team Applause miles to Collins the double team quick ball movement gets it in the four chord for the Hokies Applause it has been all Virginia Tech tonight have been here recently the last few possessions Syracuse has really ratcheted up the defense has been density not quite so easy to get the ball in the middle of that zone heres Collins Camden quick entry facility oh nice turn and score 18 for basily now Dan almost a field goal he is really skilled Wes thats not a tough thats not an easy shot a little six foot jump hook immense hits fourth field goal to the night for Jude immense hes got 18 points or Im sorry 17 Applause so it is 18 points for minutes the tour has had a hot hand here tonight too you dont want to hold the ball too long I feel the Hokies against these defense but silly caught it foul from behind thats Taylor another nice entry pass by month vasilio get a couple of free throws dont forget Monday night on acc Network at seven oclock the Huddle crew will have the exclusive reveal of the accs football schedule for 2023 theyll break down each team Jordan Cornett with EJ Manuel Coach Rick and Ronnie Jones ladies and gentlemen Roddy Jones joins The Fray its available for you on the ESPN app and of course here at ACC Network Music 19 for basilian this has had Couture gets the long bounding rebound Music Collins trying to get us to mutts air for a nice job by Torrance to fall in in front and theres a pass too hot to handle for basily and Hokies giving away up 18 with about seven minutes gone here in the second half Im telling you what if youre down low and mutz has the ball you better be ready yep he rifled that one a little bit out of the region basily one of the few mistakes mutz has made tonight heres Taylor a catch and shoot three boom Justin Taylor Im impressed Dan his first double figure effort against the league hes got 12 now on four threes Music all the threes hes made Gretchen have been yep heres Collins getting it to Camden now mutts feeds the ceiling Applause 21 for basily hes now had 20 or more and three of the last five games and its his fifth 20point game of the year Syracuse they they attacked right they pulled that ball out of the net and went flying down the court and so mutts picks up the foul trying to stop Brown second on mutts fourth on the Hokies here is Malik Brown oh Dan do you know whats in play now no I dont are we giving away bacon yeah crowd will tell you just rip their hearts out didnt they were giving away bacon really thats it yeah you get a certificate for bacon Corey Alexander and I walked out of here with some certificates last year for bacon here heres Brown again boy the pressure of bayheims Team here has cut this to 14 now Malik Brown with five in the half that ball got deflected away and theyll battle for it and Camden Scoops it up trying to calm things down heres Collins now thats not precisely the way they drew the Press breaker up but uh theyll take it theres mutts the silly again Applause and lost out of bounds by Monir hema and that will get us to a timeout well Grandpa silly started this game with the three from the corner hes now attacking the rim another 20point night for basily in the Hokies in front of a gold standard and with the NCAA tournament selection committee when we get to the end of the year one of their biggest factors is going to be quad one wins and the other team there the Clemson Tigers that was a quad three game for them and I dont think a lot of people metricswise believe in the Tigers even though theyre having a great year that was a game they could not afford to lose and so the fact that they won it is huge for the Clemson Tigers yep good win for Brad Brownell on the heroics of Chase Hunter threepoint play in the final four seconds here is Camden a three spins out and manier Hema the rebound for the orange Music Wes this is this is a 14point game I mean Syracuse has clawed their way back into him a trail by as many as 22 of the orange heres mence a fall away two is good thats you know Vince has made a couple of Threes today but his drives to the basket and his it rains jump shooting ability hes got eight in the half and 20 in the ball game and thats a foul against uh Miller I think Virginia Jackson thats a foul against so Collins will pick up his and forth so thats four on Collins foreign Music number five on the Hokies Applause here is minced out this thing gets into single digits Dan defense out of a double team here and he stepped out of bounds yep sure did mutts did a beautiful job I thought helping Couture force that double Dan well mutton Couture have played together for a while West and that was really a good job because what you want to do is get the ball out of the hands of mints Music Collins front Court heres butts Music remember no Padula hes got the four fouls that Dan just mentioned Camden playing more minutes tonight he didnt play in the last two games and played one minute of Virginia heres basily and three out of the corner and brown the rebound West the shots that were going in the first half are not going here its frequently in the second hand yep Brown foul line area now Taylor another three and Justin Muntz had a shot at it caramed off the head of Torrance and it will go to the hokers dont forget coming up when were done here tonight at the castle nothing but net Kelsey Riggs shes got Joel Berry Carlos Boozer in studio tonight full coverage of the seven ball games on the ACC schedule tonight some analysis and thoughts as well as look at updated standings and more here Applause just the second field goal for the grad student Justin mutts West and thats the way you want to attack the Press when a team presses you you want to make them pay for pressing you and you do that by getting an easy basket here is Torrance Applause so Im here working on Collins Taylor of three and Torrance gives the orange another chance Taylor a little strong and Couture the rebound Brown trying to force Couture and theres a foul on Malik Brown The Freshman from Culpepper Virginia to be his first and third on the orange unless the Hokies have been I think a little bit passive in attacking this press but not that kind of young nice job by Camden to get the ball over half court and get it immediately down to the Baseline and that allows basily the opportunity to see the play develop in front of him Applause so team foul number four Syracuse to him breaks the pressure see and thats what Matsus been doing hes catching the ball and standing there d be better if he did what Camden did the last time and that is catch the ball in attack Music what have you seen Syracuse done anything differently Dan I think theyre just being a little bit more aggressive with us and to be perfectly honest with you the Hokies are missing shots yeah you know these are the kind of shots that Virginia Tech was getting in the first half and they made a very high percentage on it yeah they hit 11 threes and theres a foul Music Applause Music Music and that Hunter Couture worked so hard on the defensive end if youre going to screen him you have to get stopped and youve got to be ready for some content well of course Dan you know hes been battling an injury with that left arm hes got a sleeve on the arms got pad around the elbow and up on the forearm Wesson and we knew it already but certainly weve seen how important Hunter Couture is to this team yep here is mutts and Justin slipped but was able to keep his balance and possession again so Syracuse presses and theyre allowed to drop back into the zone heres Collins nice pass to silly and it rolls in what a night for basily hes got 23 in the ball game what a night for Couture thats either six or seven assists for him to go along with his score Silly Season high is 30 earlier in the campaign against Delaware State he comes up with the orange turnover Music eight minutes to go at Blacksburg okies trying to get their third Conference win mutts the jump shot fell off the rim basily the rebound first one block second one good thank you 18 point Advantage now for the Hokies Dan and boy Grandpa silly has been terrific well mutts actually takes the shot this is the first time hes taken one and vasili right around the basket gets the first one blocked talked to second one home what a performance huh right well thats thats a pretty clever thing and yeah thats great that you go with the kids and paint the shoes that sounded like it was a fun project yeah Applause here is Belle inside seven and a half to go and turned over by the orange Couture for mutts and it was touched on the glass by Bell and that will be the basket for Justin months whos impacted this game far more than his six points would indicate Timeout on the floor in Blacksburg Hokies by 20 years including in the early 1970s when my partner Dan Bonner played basketball at the University of Virginia we were playing a freshman game okay its a freshman game even though its a freshman game they still had a lot of lunatics in here because they were playing easy they were fans but go ahead okay well what fans so what happened here well I went and I tried to steal the ball and I ran into that wall and the wall doesnt have much give to it what does this thing this thing yes came and pecked me on the head Music laughs it was humiliated Gerard three ball for the orange out of the timeout and thats Gerards first field goal yeah it is he had 24 in the first meeting hes now got five and the orange take it away and here is mints give it back to Gerard Jesse Edwards hes playing with three fouls so is Judah Mintz the silly has the same idea that I did hes trying to guard Gerard and now mutts almost got the turnover here is Mensa three and brown the rebound third try for the orange Gerard attacking on the dribble blocked out of there by Lynn Kidd who returned to the lineup during the timeout the long neck hokey bird pecked you in the head yes thats awesome Applause what a fantastic memory of you in Castle Coliseum thats not really a very good memory of mine we lost the game I got pecked on the head what more can I say by the long neck bird Lynn Kidd stripped of it over the inline it will stay with Virginia Tech but only eight to shoot here for Mike Youngs team see Lynn Kidd who started his career Clemson has done a nice job started the Duke game played 20 minutes Dan on Monday night four points and four rebounds Music heres basilia real three and the rebound for brown and he saved it to Camden New score Music for John Camden tonight boy Wes Syracuse had cut it to 12 and they had possession now suddenly its back out to 19 career high for Camden immense floater fell off the rim for kids Brown does a nice job getting in position I think a little offensive rebounds Malik Brown who started tonight has deserved the opportunity to start tonight Music long young freshman player for Jim Boeheim from Culpepper Virginia that ball got turned over heres Edwards and then stolen by Couture and mutts did Edwards just drive behind the back pass pass that midcourt that got stolen so good Music and Justin mutts sets it down after the Syracuse turnover Virginia Tech has pushed this back to a 21point lead at 7756 and Dan I keep thinking about last year in relation to this year and knowing that Virginia Techs got a road game at Miami on Tuesday night and all of a sudden Mike Young and the folks in Blacksburg with some momentum theres opportunity out there Wes and again its opportunity that was created by the fact that Virginia Tech did what they were supposed to do in the nonconference part of the Season theyre only nonconference losses to a very good College of Charleston team yep and they struggled shooting the ball they were without Hunter Couture and of course none of that matters people talk about wow the tournament selection committee uh they consider games you lost without one of your players but you know I dont know that theres really a whole lot of validity to that the loss is still a loss but Virginia Tech now has some opportunities the Miami and Virginia games they would be quad one opportunities which would be very important Boston College Notre Dame Georgia Tech those are games the Hokies have to win and again its a quad one opportunity because if you play on the road and your opponents neck is between 1 and 75 and you win that game its a quad one win Virginia is the only team at the moment in the ACC that you that you can get a quad one win playing them at home because when you play them at home the net is one through 30 and Virginias 15 yep Carolina by the way off this weekend playing Pitt on Wednesday night in Chapel Hill has a net of 31 as Edwards draws the foul from kid so now hes going back to this bacon business again thats it and were going there with Jesse Edwards who is a 71 freethrow shooter and going there for the first time tonight to shoot two now Dan the key is he has to miss them both okay all right and now see the whole deal go to the side well see they theyve got a great meet lab here Wes and Jordan Wicks is the manager of the Meat Lab so shes probably prepared if he misses them both but would prefer that she hang on to her bacon well done Applause your research knows no bounds inbounds knocked Away by Syracuse it will stay with Virginia Tech you know its no surprise here at Virginia Tech theyre giving away bacon no no and its it is added to the environment here at the castle by the way well and this is a great environment even without the bacon thats it second count so Virginia Tech commits the violation and people may say well wait a second that ball got knocked out of bounds earlier Applause but thats what Mike young is saying Mike Youngs talking about the ball got knocked out of bounds so didnt we get a fresh 10 on the inbounds she does right Music if the ball got knocked out of bounds by Syracuse doesnt Virginia Tech get a new 10 Music Applause you get a new 10 if you call a timeout oh here is mens and thats a fall away too and hes fouled by Couture Applause Virginia Tech with 4 45 together so again when Syracuse knocked the ball out of bounds on the original inbounds pass they did not reset for the 10 right well Wes if they knocked it out of bounds on the original inbounds pass no theyre not going to reset the team thats what Im saying okay so thats why Virginia Tech then had the 10 second violation here we go yep Jordan better get ready inter Meat Lab apparently Applause did he just did he just save her bacon yes he did Music our producer Daniel Givens and our director Eric Freight tonight have really enjoyed this portion of the broadcast its an awardwinning portion for them so meanwhile its a 19 point game with under five to go how many times does Music basketball well tonight would be one not sure if this is the first one heres Padula out of the double team hokeys two on one basily back for mutts who is fouled by Edwards thatll be his fourth and the sixth doesnt speak on the orange by the way Jim mayheim is out of timeouts in this ball game tonight Music thats you know when a guy goes in like that and gets fouled youre not really trying to protect yourself when you fall yep 24 year old grad student Millville New Jersey tell you this is uh Music this is one of the more engaging young people in ACC basketball Justin mutts as you see Jim Boeheim not happy at all with the proceedings tonight well when youve coached for 47 years Wes you have probably had a lot of games where you havent been happy with the proceedings four and a half to go and Torrance Music with mints now Syracuse Trail is too big to waste a lot of clock and mutts the rebound here is Padula back on the floor with the four thousand Torrance will reach across to commit the foul now Padula is back in there because theyre using a three guard lineup thats his first theres Collins and Couture and he dool in there to try to handle this pressure so Vince will come out Applause after Torrance commits the fact and Wes one of the interesting things is Padula here at the line he really has not played a lot of minutes tonight yep hes been in foul trouble and Virginia Tech has done a lot of this without his presence on the court third best freethrow shooter in the ACC at 85 percent Music is one of nine kids in the Padula family from Edmond Oklahoma Music second one good you know he had a solid profession of the Year yesterday I mean he worked really hard in the weight room he bulked up and he sits now hes got some physical strength to go along with that Boundless Energy that he possesses yep Syracuse finds themselves in this 22point hole and Music Applause Music scoring drought here and Torrance will end all of that to the drop his fourth point Applause the orange continues with the pressure here Vasily back from mutts the Collins and the Hokies are into the Four Courts and the Hokies really are in no rush right now Wes with a 20point lead under four minutes to go you dont have to be attacking that pressure Applause you dont want to totally take your foot off the gas you want to keep playing with the same Pace that you play theres a stole a steal by Edwards Torrance with the turnover Gerard launches a rebound for Camden it has been for John Campbell without Darius Maddox being available tonight for this team has done it without charismatics and with Padula being involved from yeah the silly long Miss on the three under three minutes to go well Syracuse does not have time to uh sour they have Virginia Monday night at home Dan and theres Gerard on the drive hes got seven now in the ball game Virginia big wow today against Boston College wow from a terrific drive 10 and a half 12 in the game for Justin mutts what hasnt much done to them oh terrific night for months hes got 11 rebounds hes got eight assists and theres the spinning score for Edmonds Music to talk about Edwards in his scoring thats really hurt Syracuse today with Edwards getting an early foul tournament Kadir Copeland The Freshman from Philadelphia commits the foul well step aside here in Blacksburg Music Applause Miami we mentioned already house before for Mike young a couple weeks ago man well youve got to tour back and you have Colin suddenly playing very effectively and I mean for heavens sakes if he gets contributions like this off the bench from Camden yeah and Wes you have to say that it you know they were two and seven in the League last year and basically the reason they got rolling is the ball started to go in the basket Dan they went nine and two in their last 11 Applause to finish 119 here is Copeland now this is a young freshman from Philadelphia who went to IMG Academy with Justin Taylor as well and theres a whistling foul in a 20point game itll be on Grandpa silly itll be his second the eighth on the Hokey cymer Torrance to the line Music Torrance takes the starts right out of the bacon the other thing that strikes you about Virginia Tech and again without maddoxs availability you look at MJ Collins I mean Malaysia Poteet checks in we havent seen much of him tonight the the death and damn it these guys are coming together for young a lot like last year well this crowd will be a handful down the stretch in February yeah I think so Wes and again the key is they have to avoid injuries and weve said it a couple times the hunter Couture injury sort of derailed thoughts you have to avoid injuries and lets face it you have to make shots and they certainly did they didnt turn it over they made shots in that first half well T will draw the foul of Hema and how about that hes not going to get an assist on that but good evidence from Reidsville North Carolina is a transfer from Bryce 79 percent freethrough shooter he will get a couple here Wesson weve both been around the ACC for a long time and you know Syracuse they havent been in as long as we have but still you rarely see the Syracuse zone defense dissected with the efficiency and ruthlessness that Virginia Tech did tonight well and Justin mutts huge piece of that there goes Copeland on the drive and thatll get a foul called so a couple of free throws coming for cladier oh T will draw his first Copeland is four of five at the line this year wow so the fans were chanting bacon but hes four or five so the bacon is probably safe the first one good Music Syracuse who had split their last six coming into tonight staring a third loss in the last four games for hosting Virginia Monday night and they lost 7366 by the way the Cavaliers in Charlottesville back on the 7th of January heres Padula and he is bumped and fouled and that is John bulla jock ey the Redshirt Junior from the south of Sudan Music and thatll be his first and that is nine on the orange dont forget womens basketball tomorrow High Noon start Felicia leget Jack has done a marvelous job in year one in Syracuse and Jeff walls brings Louisville in after a hard loss the other night and gets our coverage started then at two oclock

womens basketball ACC networking always available on the app they can for Justin mutts as he exits yep terrific night huh well Ill tell you how terrific it was Wes these two assists sort of a tripledouble Music 85 68 and Padula the rebound of the Miss Sean will lob for Collins and he caught the inline Jamie lucky says so thatll turn it over to the orange with 73 seconds left Mike young is telling me just slow down Music fellas I think were gonna have win number 13 in our pocket itll be their second straight win in the ACC Music beating Duke on Monday night to get a win here tonight Scoop from Torrance hes got an eight ball in the second place and you were talking about it they go to Miami and then their game next weekend is Virginia here yep sure is theyve got a big week coming up hey what a Saturday it has been in the ACC you had uh a threepoint game at Pittsburgh a onepoint game at Clemson and Florida State you had a twopoint game in WinstonSalem and the Hokies are getting ready to put a cap on it with their second win of the week and third in conference play well that that win by Clemson just amazing theres Padula with the shot clock winding down and Camden the rebound and basically Virginia Tech can wind this out boy that first half now was strong as morning coffee Dan that was about as well as youll see a Virginia Tech team play particularly on the offensive end my heavens and theres a shot clock violation with 18 seconds left Dan told you much was within a whisker of a triple double 11 points 12 rebounds and eight assists tonight as Virginia Tech made this look easy well they did and this is the Syracuse team Weston has been playing pretty well you know they had a tough loss against North Carolina but Virginia Tech just took them apart yep sure did Hokies are impressive tonight 8570 is the final
