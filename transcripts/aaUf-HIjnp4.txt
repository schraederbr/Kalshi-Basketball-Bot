lets see if they play through him once the offense get stagnant and so if not Leed if not lamin who might be another X Factor type for either the Panthers or the orange I think for the Panther its Damen dun I think he needs to be a guy that can step up and I think its a good time for even Elijah Mo a freshman home youre kind of going through the ups the ups and downs as a freshman year but hes a capable shooter rck down defensively inside cam Corin with the layup and he goes down hard appears to be okay and so the Panthers with an easy two points to begin the ball game they saw the starting lineup low and Le it one of the most potent onew backourt punches in the league and now as you referred to Damen Dunn is back and getting close to 100 hes a terrific third option in the back court coming off the bench he is and when you have a hand injury conditioning is fine but dribbling the basketball catching the basketball all those things bothersome hes beginning to get more and more confident he return from his injury heres jier Davis getting another start today as Donnie Freeman remains sideline with a foot injury shot clock under five Starling puts it up just like the Clemson game that is what the Syracuse offense was early going against the Tigers and hes just a difficult guard he has size has physicality a lot of shot making ability just a big time score coming off a 25point performance in the Lost Wednesday down in South Carolina for has it poked away inside up and over lanin no and number 44 in Syracuse white pulls down the rebound you and I talked about the match up its going to be Eddie Lin and cam corn because of the way they play inside g o Diaz Graham his ability to stretch the floor we thought Syracuse a match up with Jer Davis ending count the basket for jier Davis as Corin got it on the way down and were starting to see the teams establish the other guys theyre trying to get the other guys going you Syracuse there going to Davis attacking G Diaz Graham off the bounce here is low 63 sophomore from Missouri City Texas again they lob it inside and the defense doesnt see Corin playing Up Above the Rim thats twice already here in the first half theyre back screening Eddie lampin and one with Cam Corin on a perimeter you dont have to guard him you got to know his scoring comes in the paint the guard needs to sit back and help I know they they top of the Scout report but got to help the big out on that back screen its a great shot there by Dav he has become a threat from threepoint land in recent weeks gives Syracuse an 84 lead shoots 35 from three has a great looking shot you know thats the good thing about when guys get injured get more opportunities and the guy were talking about is Donnie Freeman whos a great rebounding freshman in a double digit score Lankin didnt see low coming from behind who picks his pocket Taylor comes back and gets a jump B great recovery by the Georgia state transfer Lucas teror with great hustle there getting his hand on the basketball great call by the officials I think Lucas Taylor and Kyle cuff can Elevate this Syracuse team because theyre two guys that if they come in and and energize this team with their defense like plays like that I think the scoring theyll find it some the game will come to them and their teammates but they need guys to get stopped thats one of the issues that the the orange have been dealing with is getting stopped here is Taylor working by Diaz gr for the Lefty layup thats what you mean you get a stop the basketball guys tend to reward you you get a switch on Diaz Graham ability to beat him get to the rim but this is where you got to make your mark get stops like it the senior from PG County left it short on his first attempt of the afternoon I think theyre missing Eddie Lin there hes showing you his numbers got to give him touches hes got a big size Advantage not height Advantage but size Advantage coren deflects that ball out of bounds Syracuse will keep with 14 to shoot Yeah Eddie Eddie LM is a guy let him touch it early hes an unselfish player he really wants to pass hes a double double guy but hes not looking to get 20 points hes looking to pass the basketball when he gets Starling finds the Freshman Elijah Mo buries it from the corner 13 for orange great shot there he struggled from behind the three but has a reputation in the shot mechanics of being a shooter Zack Austin you can say the same about him but puts up an air ball and here comes the orange up nine again more from that same Corner great close out defensively by low to force the air ball and that shot like that you shouldnt look to see where you are just catching and shoot big swing there as ish Leed answers with a triple at the other end wasnt sure where he was in the corner there talking about Elijah Moore ish Le shows him it doesnt matter just shoot it lampin you thought that would be a key could he take advantage of his size and strength on the Block I think the only guy that they have in this lineup or in the roster to physically match up is Papa con and hes on the bench right now Balls moving everyones touching it but when it settles down in a half court if its not in JJs starting hands Eddie Lampkin goes a long way of elevating this team when the offensive end the Flor whistle on the shot low will have a chance for three when we come back the Orange is getting hot from behind the threepoint line starting with who else JJ Starling knocking down threes and the freshmans getting in on the ACT Syracuse up I think thats that would be the one thing I I think for both teams theyre still trying to evolve and find out theres a confidence factor that that plays in and youre still trying to evolve and find your identity and when teams Scout you in this league and they do something against you teams begin to emulate that and and its attacking your weakness and you you you dont know what teams going to involve into because the two guys you see at the top they significant time thats JJ Starling and Damen dun and theyre both easing their way back into the lineup and thats changing their teams Dunn number one in blue guarding Starling out front good ball movement to find Lin and weve got our second goal tend of the afternoon this one goes against double Nichols Zack Aus Eddie great pass there by getting it to Eddie lamin and wow well Austin is one of the better shot blockers in the league fifth in the ACC one and a half per game but that not a block shot goes as a goal tend and second field goal for Eddie lanin Applause Jr Cam For Hands it off to Austin thats one play there great job four five there ability to switch great defense on the ball there excuse me low gets back to his left hand and it was a tough shot tough pass to handle more able to stay in bounds and keep possession thats a great defensive possession there both ends of the floor but keeping jayen low out of the paint difficult task inside to Corin this third Point Blank shot of the day that time its just great cam corn just being an athlete there I think one advantage he has hes given up a lot of size and physicality inside sprinting 94 ft get to the rim is something I think he can beat Eddie lanking down the floor in and great job taking advantage of that yeah six early points for the Florida State transfer who averages nearly 11 points and six rebounds T Applause night into the back court legot tracks it Applause down Starling brings it back for the orange 1340 remaining in the first half here on a Saturday afternoon in central New York Doug Ferman with Randolph childis and now backing down all little dj Burns of the last couple of years at NC State Eddie Lin though misses on the reverse Starling for three Ed Lins going to pick up the foul going after that rebound thats what you and I talked about is what Eddie Lin can do play more like DJ Burns did for a team that struggled offensively I know they came away empty in that possession but if you saw what happened he missed a point blank layup backing you down in the lane scoring it kicking it outside and that time great job by low filling the contact drawing a foul trying to draw another foul he said I got one I want to draw a foul on cam coring there and official didnt wasnt having any of it Noe well big Eddie is the energy guy for Syracuse his teammates feed off it the fans feed off it hes on the bench now having picked up that foul movich into the game for the first time as they go inside the aforementioned Papa amadu kti misses his first shot Syracuse with it up by five nice pass by stovic and the reaching foul called against Damen Dunn twotime transfer four years at Temple and then last year at the University of Houston when he battle injuries and coming off an injury here for pit early what youre seeing from Syracuse is the balls moving this is a team the basketballs moving around everyones touching it and theyre making the right place Peter movich this is the first what an ESPN college basketball quadruple header we have for you today number nine Kentucky and Vanderbilt get it started at 230 Eastern van Cooper flag and number two Duke take on week Forest followed by 12th rank Kansas hosting seventh rank Houston and we cap the day with number one ranked Auburn and number six Tennessee what a day for college basketball on ESPN y Mater is won six in a row and at home in the Joel they should give Duke as good ATT test as theyre going to see in the the ACC this year a lot of great game today just a great day of college basketball what a slate ball comes out to Music Applause Le Starling going to be whistled for the foul as legot hit the D I think you can throw away what weve seen with with Syracuse and perception for some I think theyre very much in this game and they they match up well with pit they have defensive guards that they can put out there K cuff talked about to make life difficult for legged and and low and I think thats what theyre doing here early well on seven made field goals Syracuse has four assists a little better connected than usual as is legit makes the front end his hero is his dad Dietrich who suffered a massive stroke while driving his son to a nth grade basketball practice the crash left Dietrich paralyzed hospitalized for 6 months requiring three brain surgeries the two FaceTime every day they talk all the time and they got their own connection that is just special and has continued on despite the difficulties that Dad now deals with I recruited is so Im very familiar with the story and just a credit to who he is I mean just so much character you love him as a player he impacts winning and and just when you when you understand the his family Dynamics and all of what hes been through you just cant help but be aan F of his legac he inspires so many thats around him and been fun covering him and watching watching his his growth and the fact that hes a DC guy isnt so bad not do hurt either you know I love my D out of St Johns College High School good poke away Inside by Zack Austin pit with it down Applause four dun gets around Bell using the screen Bell recover Miss shot rebound by Damen D who at 5 205 mixing it up inside with some landcape and also hes trying to war cuse into what he wants it to be and when youve had a guy like beam a legend a guy whos built this program it it takes some time I think people need to be a little bit patient hes trying to build Syracuse in what he sees in his vision and I think people need to be a little bit more patient about that and and and I know thats difficult in todays time and I think its more so nowadays when you know youre my has a high level of expectations on this job and I think patience is wared 10sec violation is the orange couldnt get it across the timeline and so now Pittsburgh trying to completely eliminate what was a ninepoint deficit a former point guard at Syracuse the only time he has been in college basketball was a few years under our buddy Seth Greenberg at Virginia Tech before coming back to his almost Mo little floater by Ish leet now with seven points and he draws the Panthers back within one how do you think Jeff capable was served by coaching for his dad at Old Dominion then having two other head coaching stops at VCU and Oklahoma then going back to Duke as opposed to for the most part ay has been at Syracuse and and heard one voice throughout his playing and coaching career oh you got to remember Jeff w coach with his dad dad was a great coach so hes grown up around the game and so much Insight when you do that and then he goes and plays for the greatest coach in college basketball history and learns from Coach K and and what hes been able to learn and then also the experience factor with him you go in and you have different stops and he understands what this league is hes played in it hes been an assistant in it now a head coach in it and its just a different perspective where alri is learning on the fly as this game evolves and hes trying to make this transition with not a lot of head coaching experience capable got his first head coaching job at 27 autrey didnt get his first until he was 51 yes so hes still learning his wise red ay said after his rookie season as a head coach last year now he better understands his wise why am I doing this why am I saying and when to do it when to do it right and it takes time with that and particularly when youre again its never easy without the circumstances but when youre replacing a legend and I mean you know were talking about one of the best better most influential coaches in the history of this game and Jim Beam with the zone and everything else and how it was emulated and never duplicated with so many different Applause people 25 ft from the bucket Dunn picks up the personal foul as Kyle cuff Hit the Floor cuff movich lampin jquan Carlos and Chris Bell out on the floor so four reserves the only starter out there is lamin now we get one the twin brothers coming in here Mo Diaz Graham back in with Cam Corin jayen low ish leget and that looks like Zack Austin over there number 55 in blue Panthers with the lead 1918 they had been down by as many as nine and Syracuse has gone quite a while since its last field goal B coming this way your hands werent ready CH I was getting them ready to shoot I was worried about thank you right there the man sitting in the nice Hawaiian Syracuse shirt next to us just saved my guy he did 2000 points score with your number hanging at the jaw make no mistake I would have caught that and shot that you dont worry thats one thing I I couldnt move but I would have moved my hands my body wasnt getting out of the way but I would have got it and shot it my storage in Rhythm for three and the orange continue to make their jump shots here this afternoon eight of the orange nine wins are here in the dome and thats where your road players are apart feel more comfortable feeding off the crowd and got to keep low and legged from going to that right hand when possible for the most part the orange are doing a really good job but when you make a mistake against these two when its difficult because both are downhill theyre forcing contact and forcing the officials to make a call and obviously red Archer doesnt like that call if you are a lip reader yeah well keep it to yourself but clearly not happy with that call jayen low back at the free throw line the uh best free throw shooter in the ACC ninth best in the country at 91 pretty much automatic his threepoint shooting percentage is down this year to 28 what do you make of that cuz he is a good shooter he is I think its scouting report he doesnt get as many looks you lose a guy like Bob Carrington who drew a lot of attention himself now hes the primary guy and teams hes the top of scouting report this year and thats the only part of his game I think the slow to three ball this year so how about that movich gets in the way of his teammate knocks him on the ground makes it a tough shot and leaves himself an easy rebound tipping I like the way m stovic is going about that skill guy we do a cres when we talk about it you dont know whats going to happen he gets in the way of his teammate but he makes up for it and the confidence now he just knocked down a three follows up with a basket here and thats five quick points and know some of the orange Alum right now are going wheres this team been but this is all part of this team growth and adjustments to whats going on and sometimes when youre on the road you dont play well the best thing for you to get home and get in front of your crowd and not a better crowd and not a better supportive group than here in the Dome amsol delich the Freshman from Bosnia and herzen is coming to the game for the first time for Pittsburgh M stovich meanwhile he was a very late addition to this roster he didnt sign with Syracuse and get here until August and the idea was he wasnt going to play a whole a lot as a freshman but he has brought things to this team that they have needed and desired and when he adds the scoring to it as he heads here this afternoon even more valuable on the screen and roll gets it back kick to the side for Bell that pass right there is an is a part of his game thats its why you want the ball in his hands he moves the basketball he passes it well the rest of his game is whether he gives you a ton of scoring you dont worry about it as much but hes growing hes developing on the switch cuff was up against it trying to defend Corin inside and so he gives up the foul and cam Corin who spent the last two years in Tallahassee playing for Coach Hamilton at the line shooting a one andone former top 100 recruit coming out of John Paul II High School in Texas heres our featured ESP PN 2 big Monday womens basketball matchup tahina poow and number two South Carolina in Knoxville to take on tayia Cooper and number 17 Tennessee at 7 eastern time the Gamecocks are now 19 and one they W 14 in a row big win over LSU over the Tigers their only loss was at Paulie Pavilion to the now number one team in the country in UCLA will the Gamecocks win another National Title Mr ch so well see you loseing injuries luse one of your better players to an ACL injury and not having a ton of time to practice I mean theyre as talented as anyone as we know you know what the the week of practice as Bell makes the three takes a deep sigh of relief and the orange back in front 2623 what did you see from Pittsburgh in their shoot around here at the dome last night they had a full practice in Pittsburgh before flying up yesterday theyre in the midst of the four game losing streak as L looks to attack whats your sense of hit right now I think theyre searching for an theres a theres a lack of confidence with the group and theyre competing right now where theyre defending but if youre a pit panther fan doing this stretch you also got to ask yourself its low its Leed and whos the third guy going to be and right now those two guards have gotten off to productive starts but again youre searching for the third score on this group right now and cam Corin has stepped up right here early with six points himself well this losing streak is their longest in three years they are three and four in the league to slide down the standings a bit still 12 six overall only the six losses here as were hitting late January is not bad at all the metrics on pit still very good theyre a top 32 team in the net and so they still very much have everything out in front of them as of this morning Joe still has him in the field as a 10 seed but they cant afford to lose what would be a quad three game here today in Syracuse oh you used up all your m is what you have yeah and now its its its everything matters it could be right now youre in danger if the season was to end the day that someone can steal a bid from you you dont want your youre futuring someone elses land well with Kyle cuff and JJ Starling both on the bench with two fouls each someone else is going to have to step up in that Syracuse back court and jquan Carlos says what about me and hes a guy I think needs to try to score more hes a willing passer sometimes I think hes too unselfish transfer from HRA has six assist a game a year ago and I think hes adjusted to the high level play the athleticism and what hes competing against at the ACC level he started the first 14 games of the year for Coach ay lanin leaves it short gets another Moses Malone opportunity couple the rebounds still comes away with no points second bunny I think lus Miss there I think you could be a little bit more patient another big turn where leged buries a three after a missed opportunity at the other end for the orange double figures for the senior last years Sixth Man of the Year in the Atlantic Coast Conference a game pitch you got to be happy your back court Del leads this team is off to hot start and the Syracuse team numbers creep up since starling came back from his right hand injury and not surprisingly they are now up over 30 this is a Syracuse team that will not be a excellent threepoint shooting team I wouldnt think the rest of the way but they should be better if Starling is out there well the more threes you knock down the more comfortable yard opens up the paint now heres another open look this time with Taylor Pittsburgh with it down by two 617 to go in the first half Panthers looking to snap their four game slide D and dun missfire Movic has given Syracuse good minutes he has and right now you want to see I think maybe play through Eddie lampin a little bit here JJ starting on the bench where do you get your offense from Taylor loses his balance gathers puts it up on the rim Lin after it hes just bigger than everybody in blue out there got to get more touches there that time and thats what you want from a big when you dont get it in the post go get it off the glass and as we talked about in the open low and starling those two guys are going to play whos going to be the next the third best player on the floor tonight is it going to be is Leed is it going to be Eddie lamin we got you know these guys are battling right now both are off the strong first half and for Pittsburgh one of the determining factors whether they win or lose this year has been rebounded in their six losses they have been dominated on the glass and so far today that has been the case with Syracuse out rebounding Pittsburgh 147 yes its a big par for pitch and its probably Jeff Caps history rebounding the basketball and defending the threepoint line has been instrumental in what the success the Panthers have had and overall theyve done it they just had a TV timeout segment where its been the 8 Minute Mark or 4minute Mark where they hadnt rebounded played well and its cost them the last three losses theyve been right there in those ball games that foul was undone hes already got three and is back on the Pittsburgh bench porn sets the screen for leget finds low filling from behind gives it back to leget still plenty of time with a shot clock low a deep range three in and out thats an excellent defensive possession there by the orange guarded multiple action stayed in front of the basketball and defended had pit shooting in contested three heres playing with JJ Starling on the bench with two personal fouls Bell goes into the lane gets tied up and the foul is called that is Jaylen low and thats his second foul so if youre Jeff cable do you keep low on the floor right now with those two its five minutes left and a half I think with the score right now I think hell take low out there no reason to risk him getting his third foul but I think that affect his aggressiveness in the second half and so well get our first look at the Freshman guard Brandon Cummings fourstar recruit who put 30 on Eastern Kentucky back in December what a night six of eight from Beyond the threepoint line earned ACC rookie of the week but his minutes have come and gone and now with Damen done back and healthy taking more of the minutes unless you have foul trouble he may not get in B gamees oh hes playing behind a All Conference backboard legging and low its just not a ton of minutes there but I know practice is great great learning experience for him hes been really productive as a freshman hes got minutes Austin though Lin with another rebound hes become one of the best rebounders in the ACC up to fourth in the league at over eight per game pass to the corner for Bell he puts it on the D left his feet with nowhere to go and turns it back over to the Panthers right now from pit wheres my offense coming from you know it its its you look at their line up on the floor right now this is I think some of the issues that coach C is dealing with right now if low gets in foul trouble the crowd is is reacting to that last dead ball situation its wheres the offense going to come from here its leage played well but who else can I rely on to get me points Del no eigh rebound for Eddie Lin hes averaging more than 10 per game over his last 11 my storage Deni off the Austin Block its lampin active inside again and the whistle will go against Pittsburgh and itll go against Zach Austin love the energy Im seeing out ofed Eddie lampin right now hes not getting in the post its not always its not always easy to find a guy and finding passing angles for big and honestly I dont think a lot of guys work on or know how to actually postfeed but when you dont hes not pouting hes going to get it off the glass love his energy and his activity on the glass and in large part because of him Syracuse maintains its place as the fifth best rebounding team in the league with Donnie Freeman out so you see he is a terrific rebounder able to get rebounds out of his area but uh he continues to receive treatment on that right foot and the university the team has been nonspecific about what the injury is and what his timeline is but even if he were to be cleared and healthy tomorrow it would take a while for him to get back on the floor and be able to be productive I would think yeah with a foot injury its also each day the conditioning becomes an issue timing and everything else that comes with it and his mobility and activity is a big part of his Applause game coring no great crash on the offensive Glass by Jorge Diaz Graham the shorter and younger of the twins known as a threepoint shooter but again we talked about that rebounding how do you impact the game you dont get it go to the glass get an offensive rebound help your team out great job by jge D BR How about if youre 61 and youre the short brother youre the short brother yeah right his twin brother is 7 ft and on the bench right Applause now Carlos has to retreat and get the ball in the back court 20 on the shot clock Jer Davis comes up to set the screen gets it back open three another a good look for the orange this one missed and now with three minutes to go in the half Pittsburgh can retake the lead good shot there for the orange you talked about the the Improvement in the shot selection is theyre not a great threepoint shooter team but the three three ball percentage will go up and you take open looks and you dont force anything it just comes naturally in the flow of your offense thats the issue right now pits having as we discussed theyre just buying time until low gets back out there Carlos no Taylor yes impact the game is how you decide how many minutes youre going to get plays arent designed for you offensive rebound effort defensive stops look at Carlos Pressman The Applause Freshman not everybody can score it everyone wants to score it how do you impact the game another way coming miss the runner another rebound for big number 44 Carlos the senior from Brooklyn New York playing bigger minutes here in the first half due to foul Music trouble to JJ Starling and also Kyle cuff J Ball spinning a lot of time on the perimeter Now look for a dribble hand off but Eddie lanin there is great job by Zack M blowing it up and Taylors got to fire it from the logo orange catch a break on the long rebound to L wait for the double team and then go around it and an offensive foul so thatll take us to break the orange have been without star Vine four offensive rebounds in that 12 and been really really active on the glass and I think hes been slightly better as the third guy and I think thats why see a threepoint lead here for the orange now movich leads Syracuse with six points eight different players have scored good Hustle by Jorge Diaz Graham to lay it in back to a onepoint ball game those are the 5050 plays you got to have right when when youre in a game like this and youre struggling and when youre not one of the main guys how do you get yourself going you go out you hustle your activity you manufactor points great job there Lucas Taylor goes to the left shoulder in scores what do you know you defend you get a few stops Applause the activity not only offensive in you get a chance to make a play this is where Lucas Taylor has to have a big impact like it over Taylor and then stares at his Defender after knocking in the shot its what we talked about its going to come down to those two guys hes a winner this this pit panther team has been challenged and right now he needs to be the guy on the offensive to the floor with jayen low on the bench with two fouls and hes carried this team the last 5 minutes to make sure they go in at half Carlos in comings not the point guard match up we were expecting due to the foul trouble Bell gets blocked the heave from about 80 ft away Off the Mark hes got a couple of hockey assists by creating and finding open guys and need one more to scor so great first half well after making their first three threes to begin the ball game Syracuse cooled off as cam Corin picks up to start the second half like he did the ball game with the dunk to put Pittsburgh back in front pit also closed that first half missing eight of their 11 shots but they quickly get the ball inside for a high percentage shot and thats frustrating because thats the exact same play they open up the game with and you saw it for the second time and the results are the same youre Syracuse youve got to make that adjustment as a guard you got to help the big out and even is Eddie lampin you dont have any responsibility of showing on the ball screen your defense has been chasing guys off you got to make sure you stay between your Defender camor and the the baset well lamin with those 12 rebounds is nearing his season high and his career high he should obliterate both of those numbers here is big number 44 second Defender comes Taylor for three Lankin with another offensive rebound Taylor this time gets swatted by Austin one of the best in the ACC blocking shots six on the timer Taylor attacks the orange had their first two of the second half again put the ball in Eddie lamins hands and youd like for it to be in the post but even on the perimeter his ability to pass make find the right guys underrated and so now JJ Starling just a minute 10 into the second half has three personal fouls its a big foul there its this remind me of guys I often say this youve got to protect your fouls that stealing that possession is not worth their time of you being on the bench and you got to watch now does it affect his aggressive aggressiveness on the offensive and defensive part of the floor hes got to stay assertive in this game hey missed it lampion with another rebound yeah Starling missed the last 11 minutes of the first half with Coach ay protecting him from picking up that third F and you pick it up like that situation where guards not even looking to score Starling open from the for for I think hes wor not worried about being aggressive at all you catch the next possession knocks down a three but hes guarding hes guarding is legged whos really aggressive and at some point Im wondering if they try to move him on a another God and not be off another dunk for cam Corin and that right there because of that third foul that defensive rotation was JJ Starling but again he has three doesnt want to put himself In Harms Way and he concedes the basket Starling Moore lanin Davis and Taylor the same starting five to begin the second half for the orange Corin Leed low Austin and GE Diaz Graham same starting five for pit Taylors got to go to work along the Baseline shot clock at one as Davis puts it up right here right here thought they didnt convert the shot but thats a good offensive possession there L great hesitation right to the rim easy two for pit and were tied at 38 tied at 3 when youre in a lot of ball games like this those are the baskets you cant concede great job by low just driving it but really a point blank layup there and a rare turnover for the orange they had just no check that they had eight in the first half Pittsburgh was the one that had only three in the first half so an unforced error there three minutes into the second half look at low after the pin down here set the ball screen and look for him to attack get in there low draws the second Defender into Corin back outside Diaz Ram nothing but net first three points for the seven foot Junior from the Canary Islands Pittsburgh up three its the largest lead of the day for the Panthers you get your main guy back in the game and you just run your offense through him and let him create plays and he didnt get the direct assist but the hockey assist but it started with Jaylen low creating on the ball screen Taylor uses the screen little strong on the pullup lanin gets it back and lays it in L so a new career high going past what he had done for TCU three years ago in the NCA tournament against Arizona and the orange back within a point you know Kelvin Samson we know is a great coach and with all those match up thats just a great slate of college basketball today and high level games talented and should be fun to watch well Auburn has won its last 10 the only time theyve lost this year was back in early December to dke in the SEC ACC challenge will deny broom play and if he does how effective will he be should be a great showdown in the powerful SEC later tonight another rebound for the big man Eddie lamin were already digging deep into the record book most rebounds for a Syracuse player against Pittsburgh Billy Owens in 1991 had 16 sadbe matched him in 2018 Lins having that kind of afternoon to go into the record books extra pass Kyle cuff looking for his first points of the day one and done for the orange on a nice defensive rebound by guo Diaz gr I bet you had that Billy Owens rebound margin memorized you knew that didnt I did not my guy Christian sitting to my left gave it to me good stuff working inside is Leed at 6 3 185 hes not the biggest guy in the court but he can work the paint as well as anybody that size he may not be the biggest but he very well may be the toughest like we talked about hes just a winner in a game like this if youre pit Panthers you got to have this like it came to play well he and jayen low putting up numbers not many others around the country can match in terms of backourt Duos Elijah Moore with his second made three and he draws the orange back to within a tie at 43 a piece anytime you can mention the great Billy Owens on a broadcast come on Applause absolutely his son by the way is a reserve on this Syracuse team Chaz Owens great time for you orange Alum but I got to tell you my favorite was always Sherman Douglas there you go growing up watching him and not much older than myself but boy did I enjoy watching him play basketball we know Sher still watches his Alma moer we were happy to both see him last year on Jim beheim day here in the dome when he came up to honor his former coach its a pretty shot along the Baseline I text him the other day thinking I was texting you getting prepared for this game that screenshot you said was beautiful hes like what hes like what he had no idea what I was talking about Im Im thinking Im texting Sherman Douglas no you thought you were Tex Douglas Sherman yeah yeah yeah you sent it to Sherman Douglas and Sherman Douglas responds to chill like what are you talking about talking about what do you mean you just called five straight games youre like a coach what are you talking about heres Moore off the fake got the shot blocked by low gets it back able to beat the puzzer long rebound grabbed by Davis thats a possession that pit has to deal with that that theyve struggled with the Clos games and when theyve been out rebounding what happens they switch so much thats on guards and if you see low and Leed get about 10 a game but theyre forced to because you see the switching right there with Leed on Jer Davis Syracuse gets a bailout with a shot clock down to one on the reaching foul as the orange try to make do without Starling and his three theyre going to have to play through him with JJ in foul trouble Starling back into the game he inbounds playing with those three foul out there with more and cuff on the perimeter Davis inside low done and Leed as pit goes with the three guard defense along with Cam Corin and Austin and Starling starting to heat up hes now got eight points thats just the difficulty in guarding him you play good defense but cant account for a 65 physical guard getting downhill B hands it off to low Applause 13 on the timer 1222 remaining second half and whats been mostly a tight ball game Syracuse LED early by as many as nine but the Panthers have hung right in there low with another two low is as good as youre going to find at reading ball screens hes hes just a lead at it and not a lot of guards are just how do you want to defend it hes going to have a counter to it keeping him out of the paint is impossible you just want to you definitely dont want him going left and he got hes got the floaters got three ball low with a block shot by the way I love what is legett just did defensively communicating to his teammates behind him and one for low Pittsburgh with a fourpoint lead its largest of the afternoon well jayen low first met Jeff cable when he was a middle schooler coming up in Texas he and his dad got an opportunity while they were on the road North Carolina while coach cable was an assistant coach at Duke to tour Cameron indor and go around campus and that relationship maintained and blossomed into an opportunity for Jaylen low to come last year as a top 100 The Troop and play for Coach Cable in the blue and gold of Pittsburgh Elijah Moore has it post away shot clock now down to five Starling glances that way fires it up and a foul on the rebound Lin and Corin we battling it is going to go against Cameron Corin just his first former top 100 recruit as well hes battling down there but hes got his hand full Eddie lamins a load and you got to get your body into him because once he gets a spot you cant move him Taylor in the corner being crowded by Damien Dunn spin to the Baseline good recovery by dun to make it a tough shot I should say that was Chris Bell not Taylor dun off the B able to get to his spot knocked down the shot and the Pittsburgh lead is six big difference in those two possessions I dont know coach alrey wants an isolation for Chris Bell and then pit comes down gets a dribble hand off and dun curls the screen and walks right into a pullup jump shots just part of their offense right now and its critical the ball continues to move like it did the first half Starling no here come the Panthers the other way low able to track down the long pass and lay it in Great pass great catch and finish there by low and right now this is the danger zone for cicu the ball isnt moving the first half I thought everybody was involved the ball was was moving from side to side everyones touching it right now its stagnant a lot of isolation a lot of dribbling s it great job there just King the C getting it to your offensive Center let the defense make a mistake and you punish the defense and not forcing anything low trying to answer cant do it Lin with the outlet Bell has it taken away Isle it with a big defensive play just past the midpoint of the second half as Pittsburgh tries to seize control both teams playing with the level of desperation right now both teams need this win obviously only one team can get it but theyre competing at a high level yeah the Panthers havent won since January 4th against Stanford lampin with another rebound you got to take advantage lows on the ground you got numbers attack the rim they find the right man open in the corner and cres Bell Cashes in he gets a high five from his head coach and the timeout comes 18 rebounds for Eddie lamin the 18th pays off in a big three at the other end you got to take advantage of a guard when he falls and great job by JJ Starling pushing it hitting Chris Bell in the corner for another three for the orange Music Applause wow pit used an eight nothing run to take a sixpoint lead not that moment about a minute ago Randolph you thought okay the Panthers are about to seize control but a big switch in a very short period of time for the orange great job there twice low got pinkt unable to finish and loow is he fell one time he didnt get back right away and he fell the last time and great job by the orange and Eddie L securing rebounds and Outlet it and the orange are getting a couple easy baskets and just like that when you think they were going to be out of it they could convert and now its a one possession game Austin giv some room Leed had Starling defending with the foul trouble and you get the sense JJ had to lay off just a little bit and leg it takes advantage 63 guard just goes in gets an offensive rebound among the Giants can post up Fade Away there you know Dylan Harper and Ace Bailey at ruter the two great freshman likely lottery picks are the only guard tandem in the country averaging 16 1 12 points and four rebounds per game along with Jaylen low and is leing some huge numbers Here Comes low Austin for three the tap back out to low when the when both of these teams are struggled these have been the type of possessions that theyve had you cant give anyone multiple possessions but right now this possession theyre chasing laate on screens laid on close outs bit making them pay in his fifth game back from injury Damen Dunn has been a good third option in the back court he stretches the lead to eight plenty of time no need to panic run your off no bad shot selection here for the orange get the balls in the hands of Eddie lampin B no Corin and he hands it off to low who will walk it up would like to see better offensive execution there on half court there and lets see if you can get the ball youll see the pit here put the ball in Lows hand let him operate do blocked from behind by Lin Starling comes away with it here comes the Junior with a full head of steam up and off the glass 5852 great hands there by Eddie Lampton with the block looked like cam corn was trying to get an easy layup there and a whistle and a foul off the ball thats going to go against you guys are everywhere the orange youre welcome well Pittsburgh trying toize control here with just over s minutes to go they only LED for a minute in the first half when Syracuse led by as many as nine but coming out of the timeout the Panthers have great ball movement and number 55 Zack Austin looks to the heavens saying I finally got one today great possession there for the Panthers alri doubles low coming off a ball screen just great ball movement open guy gets it takes shots those usually go in first three points of the day for the 42 threepoint shooter from Winston Salem prep JJ Starling 10 of his 13 have come since the break and Syracuse hanging in theyre down six I think he lost a little bit of his ability to attack when he picked up his third foul now he hasnt picked up one since hes able to stay in attack mode I think you got to get him going downhill because he creates for everyone Applause else for the basketball and his foul it looked like Jer Davis was going to come up with that 5050 ball and out of nowhere Corin comes away with it this is what Happ happens go after this ball with two hands you get it 5050 balls matters terer Davis a little upset he felt like cam corn had his left left hand and officials didnt call it but the ability to get 5050 balls and convert extra opportunities for the team the difference in winning and losing games when theyre close like this just 14 foul against Syracuse done with bell going flying out of bounds the lane was wide open and dun gets his easiest two of the day thats what the gamees boils down to when youre struggling to find a way to win possessions like that matter Pitt been on the other end of plays like that in winning games doing this stretch theyre trying to change the narrative right now and theyre making these plays giving themselves an opportunity here to end the losing Bell off the shot FL misses the layup Syracuse will keep B there just go up strong got a better chance if you dont draw the draw the foul if you once you start moving the ball around if theres contact you wont get the call so now lamin with his 18 rebounds comes in to replace Davis by the way if youre wondering the single game record for rebounding in Syracuse history was 34 by Frank red out way back in 1952 Jesse Edwards the last Syracuse player with 20 rebounds in a game Taylor in and out lampin with his 19th rebound and a chance for three hes been so good today I mean there he gets the ball the play started with him hes done a great job of this hes got a lot of hockey assists tonight sha goes up hes carving out space getting an angle on the glass I dont think he jump jumps very high but he carves out space playing with angles and once he gets a spot youre not going to moveing hes been amazing on the glass here today every bit of 611 265 and theres another double double FR L of his last six games hes had a double double big possession there 5 with 5 minutes to go now you got to get stops low got a step on Taylor creates the space and quiets the crow hes a closer he he requires extra attention and loves the midrange jump shot you cannot allow him to come off with freedom going to his left Applause hand over his last three games averaging better than 20 per game Starling no dun attacks the glass and is fouled by Movic just the sixth team foul against Syracuse so a non shooting foul the Panthers will have it in the back cour red archery I want to mention to my my star JJ Starling there we dont need long threes just get it in Rhythm get down heel hes going to get fou lanin giv up his body also picks up the foul to deny cam Corin from an easy two lamkins helping on the ball screen on that side thats Chris Bells fault youre the low man on the weak side youve got to come down and help him youre late and Edie lamkins gets the foul cam Corin played really well today as well hes chipped in early and often had his moments here hes been the third guy for the pit Panthers he and Dam and dun has been solid I love the idea that cam Corin is the only Pittsburgh player on the roster who was recruited out of high school by ACC school yeah of course he went to Florida State the other guys kind of overlooked undervalued perhaps and Coach Capel and his staff have identified them and coached them up rebound number 20 by lamin ties Ian shefflin of Clemson for the most in an ACC game this year that came against Kentucky back in early December talked about the the guys with the Panthers theres a level of toughness thats required look going to play for Jeff Caper down wide open got him back to a fourpoint game I think hes your playmaker in a half court you get in a game like this you dont get transition basket I think you need to play through Eddie Lan more hes unselfish he has great vision when hes not turning the basketball over play through him low got it theres that closer mentality youre talking about Randol hes telling everybody to calm down Im him great defensive possession there but just better offense if youre JJ starting here dont settle get it again they dont want to switch they want to keep a guard on you keep just get to the rim they got to fou you the whistle comes on the shot and they may check to see if that was a goal you know kind of go over things that you struggle with and I think it gives you a chance to work on situational basketball this team outside of the group game has been in very close games in their three last three losses and you see better execution here down the stretch theyre shooting 59 of the second half I think theyre controlling the paint either off the dribble or off passing the Cutters and I think thats why theyre leading this game here you notice Starling also has a wrap on his left hand now took the fall in the Wednesday game at cleans him so both of his hands a little bit compromised hes able to get one out of two from the line back to a fivepoint game and this Pittsburgh team that has a net ranking of 32 still despite the four game losing streak with the basketball on top by five big possession here defensively got to find a way to keep Leed and low out of the paint leg it in the paint Miss fires Taylor grabs the rebound for Syracuse three minutes left in regulation get a good possession here ball movement body movement no quick shots no need off the hand off from L Taylor going wh him and will shoot two Taylor frustrated with himself that he didnt make that bank shot but hell have a chance to get the two points at the free throw line run to dribble hand off with Eddie lampin and big doesnt want to help great job by Taylor there turning the corner drawing a foul big free throws here as he has a chance here to make it a one possession game smooth for the 85 foul shooter coming up at 530 Eastern on ABC our triple header rolls on with Celtics Mavs then the countdown crew will get you ready for Lakers Warriors at 800 couple of perfect squishes off the fingertip of the Ry North Carolina native its back to a one possession game ball gets back to low he finds Austin for three got it huge three and second in a row for Zack Austin great defense there but better shot low comes off and you just got to give him extra Applause attention and thats where the trust comes in right now dont feel as though you singlehandedly have to do it all alone L misses twice movich gets the roll 2011 to go timeout Applause Syracuse movich continues to give the orange a boost get by four late Music Music Music both teams have led by as many as nine points this afternoon Syracuse in the first half Pittsburgh in the second half as we have our game reset you see that the orange own the possession arrow what do you thinks going to be the difference Rand off over the final 2011 here in regulation obviously you get out of your reserve players but again I think its low and leged setting the table on the offensive end can you get stopped can you rebound the basketball to finish possessions I think their team right now both are in a rhythm the finishing possessions that with their Stars the ball and their Stars hands what the decision making of their stars are they forcing issues or are they trusting their teammates and I think pit right now low is controlling this game on the offensive end and on the other end I think L is doing a really good job for the orange six ties six lead changes you got to know 12 on the Tim you got to know whats coming the same play theyre theyre coming out theyre running to trying to get low on a dribble hand off get to his left hand great job defending the first action and you got to finish the possession and rebound it near ball starlings got it he attacks gathers misses the shot big rebound for Austin Corin and lamb can hit the deck both seem to be okay oh the crowd wanted a call there and I talked to Bill Covington after a game and before and he said he doesnt call those fouls if the defense is entitled to a spotting you cant just take a full head of steam and run a guy over you got to make a move and I think thats what they saw there in that last possession why they didnt saw the foul and now movich is called for the foul which further draws the IR of the Dome crowd third foul on myovich Applause and so a one and one as the Panthers have reached the bonus well Pittsburgh has shot the free throws very well this year led by the man who has the basketball right now 91 tops in the ACC its the first and he will shoot the bonus yeah hes not the guy you want to foul and put on the line and thats whats been so surprising with pit and their inability to close games because theyre a really good free throw shooting team and with this guy on the floor he shooting 90 91 you dont want you definitely dont want to foul him got to find a way to take the ball out of his hands and as of course I jinxed him orange down four under a minute to play Starling to movich bounc it inside Lankin poked Away by Dunn and he saves it for the Panthers defensive play for Double D great idea but if you cant throw a bounce pass to him you got to throw it up high you see Eddie lamin telling my storage there throw it up you dont pass it to a big guy at his feet you allow the guard to come around and get his hands on and thats what happened theres the aforementioned Bill Covington going to see whose ball it is on the sideline out of bounds big decision big call here what was the call on the floor I think it was pit called pit I think its all lcas Taylors foot so the call was Syracuse ball and like you I think that the left foot of Taylor lets see again Watch number three in white did he kick it out of bounds and was it touched there by the finger of low after it was off the foot of tailor my eyesight isnt that good I cant tell want my readers theyre not helping me either I cant tell if low touched it but it definitely hit Lucas Taylors foot and again since the call on the floor was Syracuse the officials have to feel comfortable that they see decisive yes to overturn it video evidence to do the opposite so that could be a huge break for the orange having gotten that call in real time its a big call here because if its pitched back basketball you got to foul immediately with 40 seconds left you cant let 20 seconds run off and youre down five Bill Covington confers with Tommy morresy and Justin Porterfield after review the play has been reversed blue ball he put 409 on the game clock 23 on your shot clock it looked like they got it right they did it looked like they saw Lucas Taylor put same thing we saw now youre the orange you got to try to find a way to get a 5second count I dont know if you can allow the shot clock to run out or let pit take it down cuz then youll be down two possessions with 20 seconds thats just if pit doesnt score here yeah now Pittsburgh has five good free throw shooters on the floor so whoever gets the inbound should be in a good position to cash in at the line if the foul is given low the ideal candidate if youre Pittsburgh the reaching foul by Taylor will send the lefthander out of Missouri City Texas back to the line I think in situations like that if Im guarding the inbound you got to do whatever it takes to not allow low to get his hands on the basketball when youre guarding players like that when they run away from the ball know that theyre coming back to it theyre getting some type of screen situations like this you dont want to put a 90 free throw shoot on the line a huge Miss for low the door is still open for Syracuse dont need a three just drive it staring draws the foul and will shoot two its going to go against cam Corin and now St who is a 70 foul shooter hell get a pair at the line now even for low we talked about how great of a free throw shooter he is hes missed his last two and now you got a chance with very minimal time went off the clock you make these two this is a one possession game and with a one second difference now you can foul again Starling with that little hitch in his free throw motion able to get the roll yeah hes doesnt get a lot of arc on it but hes a scorer and hes perfected his shot couple of big free throws and like you say rph back to a one possession game now offense defense switch against for pit Corin goes out the better free throw shooter GMO Diaz Graham comes back in and now I think youre string the game out right you dont need try to deny you deny low and you f oh dun has it knocked Away by starling pburg basketball yeah you saw the double team coming I wouldnt guard gun out of B gun out of bounds I would turn from my storage low cannot get this basketball make someone else step up and make these free throws you try to get it trapped you get it out of his hands but you dont you cant let a lot of time run off the clock here Kyle cck into the game for Syracuse he defends low gets it to Austin he throws it down 7368 staring down double fly by and big three pter good Gather By the Junior from conquered California great execution late there you make the mistake you give up to easy basket you dont get a chance to foul they wanted to foul you give up to dunk great play there by Bale shot faking not rushing it game on the line takes his dribble gathers himself and knocks down a three keeping the orange in this and see by his expression there hes been in his moment quite a bit twopoint game well his shooting numbers continue to creep up in what has been to this point a disappointing season for him now over 30 on the year for a guy who shot 42 a year ago so now anyhow Pittsburgh will get the basketball up two and if youre Syracuse what are you looking to do to defend that inbounds pass well ideally youd like to get a 5sec count if you you cant get that you dont have a ton of time to waste here you got to try to maybe get a trap and once the Trap happens you got to foul right away they got burned last possession they werent able to commit the foul they tried to trap and rotate when you rotate someones going to be open and Pits going to put five ball Handles in the game right now you got to be really careful there but theres a ton of time here its still at one possession game but the Syracuse you got to talk out all your scenarios now this is where your practice come into play youre out of timeouts so you got to kind of talk through every scenario possible here so now after the huddling Pittsburgh legot pulls his teammates together they have a brief huddle I like that and lets see how pit reacts to the moment putting length my storage is all over the basketball he needs to force it in the corner try to deny it force it in the corner right in front of the bench but you got to deny it Lo got the basketball and he is fouled by Taylor Ando who again is high percentage the best free throw shooter in the ACC goes to the line where he has already missed three this afternoon Miss this last Applause two so at this point it doesnt matter but there was enough time there to try to eliminate loow from getting a basketball but hes in this moment as hes collecting his thoughts keep visualizing right there thinking about the ball going through seeing it go through the ne absolutely its a great shot just calm your nerves relax this is what I Applause Applause do great job by him you see him give it back to the officials there when youre in these moments you want the ball when youre ready to take shot no one speeds your clock up thats hes so calm and collective in situations like this 7571 timeout Pittsburgh leaving the Panthers with one 16 seconds to go still not late enough in the game clock where the orange have to go for three no it gives you a another time now CC doesnt have a timeout so you get the extra 16 seconds left its a full point game no need to rush you put in a play where you got an option for a two or a three take the one thats open I think pit will be hugging the threepoint line they may switch any ball screens or any screens at all drive it get a layup ideally You like a foul but youve got to match up quickly well get you to Austin Texas just as soon as we are done here in central New York they are scheduled to tip off the aies and the Longhorns in a minute or two over on on the app and then well get you on ESPN 2 just as soon as we can with 16 seconds to go in regulation Adrien ay Syracuse Orange looking to get back to 500 on the ear pit meanwhile looking to snap a four game losing streak and hold on to what would be a 10 seed according to Joe lonardi at the moment in the NCA tournament field to 68 mustwin game if you pick youve got to end the streak you got to find a way to close this game out but the orange here if you score this basket I would if Im a storage I would guard with double low here I cant allow low to be single covered drive it drive it forc the offici call my storage lays it in 8 seconds to go inbound to Austin he holds and is fouled looks like itll go against Starling and so well walk to the other end of the Court for the 90 foul shooter now that goes against Taylor so that is his fifth yeah which is great in a sense of it allows you now take your time call the entire team over it essentially gives you a free timeout here for Adrian a to buy as much time as he need to make sure that his guys are know what he wants to execute here until he makes a substitution the last couple of games Adrien ays team has shot it better 11 threes against Clemson on Wednesday they made 11 again Applause Music today yeah so if indeed they called that foul on Taylor before Starling got there there would probably be some time for back on the clock and indeed it is the fifth on Taylor he is disqualified at the moment 72 seconds on the clock so Kyle cuff comes back in as Austin goes to the free throw line Al telling his group if he misses one he draw the play give his team a chance to three and then on the other end Cel is discussing with his group if the free throws missed if he wants to foul or not but big free throw here by Zach Austin that may ice this game if he makes it huge free throw back to a four point game inbound to staring the three is long has it he puts it up and Pittsburgh has snapped its four game losing streak with a huge 7773 Road win
