CLA Aubrey with Mark snner and Bill cumington Jr malawat and air maluk get us started and the Blue Devils in white control with James and Florida State goes manto man youre going see a lot of Florida State playing on top of the passing Lanes trying to get out create steal so they can get out and transition when they have to play in the half court West sometimes they struggle and who hasnt been struggling Isaiah Evans just rims out yep spins one out Jackson the rebound dayquon Davis The Freshman from Baltimore to Chandler Jackson with a floater and flag his first rebound of the night James ahead for malawat catch layup good two nothing D the native of South Sudan played the Olympics this summer Kamal malawat one of the best thing he does Wes he runs the floor like somebodys chasing him unbelievable pace and good athleticism at a full 72 really impressive Jackson the junr from Memphis hes a threeyear junor hes the oldest player really for Leonard Hamilton in terms of experience with the program Davis this is Taylor B Bowen four to shoot decoin Davis the runner tried to dump it to maluk Florida State to turnover and whenever you play Duke this isnt traditional Duke defense what I saw when I was playing West back in the early 2000s when they would get out and pressure the passing Lanes much more of a in the pass not in the passing Lanes but much more in the gaps this season because they have that outstanding size even seon James with the ball standing about 65 225 lbs running the one just makes their lineup different canle to spin oh my goodness got maluk in the air and the n one for KH kiple it pays to be patient KH canle everybody knows terrific threepoint shooter but good patience alir maluk F feet stay on the ground young fell you have good defensive position maintain your discipline doesnt matter K can nipple a born scorer Duke is the second best free throw shooting team Terren in ACC play at 81 kiple is 90 at the line 64 of 71 and the free throw is good hes coming off 20 on Tuesday night in Miami Oh What A Move by Watkins all the way to the basket malawat got a piece of it heres flag ahead for canle spotting up that got partially blocked deflected by Davis heres Watkins at the other end for the dunk in Florida State on the board this is exactly how Leonard Hamilton likes his team to play make this game a bit of a mess and youll have success but only if you stop Cooper flag cant have that happen two minutes in and Dukes got a fivepoint lead here at Cameron Blue Devils are 8 and0 at home 150 this season just 80 in conference play Monday night theyll have a chance to go a perfect 10 and0 and 17 and0 if they win here tonight when Wake Forest visits that ball got knocked out of bounds defensively Florida State if you get back you can find some opportunities nice look ahead and jir Watkins he knows what to do but Cooper flag heres the deal we talked to John Shire today this is one of those games because of the way Florida State plays you have to fight fire with fire if youre going to overplay the passing Lanes youre just going to have to take the bull by the horns and attack the rim exhibit a Cooper flag nice play to start this game heres Watkins with five to shoot and he stepped out of bounds over in front of Mark snner as he was trying to size up seon James second Florida State Applause turnover now B Bowen in the backourt to uh at least with some token pressure on the flag inbounds pass and heres James again against Applause Davis flag against Watkins short turn around bounces away malawat tried to get position Bo Bo and a nice job with the box out and malow watch commits the foul itll be his first its the first on Duke with a couple minutes and change gone kand malawat is tall on a floor full of tall people he is full 72 air maluk Hes listed at 7 ft and malawat Im not going to say dwarfs him but makes him look small here is maluk working into the lane Fall Away on malawat got bothered coach Hamilton T he talked to us a little bit about man its tough to start two freshmen thats not how Ive usually done things but at the same time Isaiah Evans just doesnt even think about it nope Catch and Release bounds away 3 minutes in fivepoint lead it stays for Duke NOS are one for their first five make it two of their first six and Watkins has got two dunks how about that splitting the ball screen getting to the cup jir Watkins showing up ready to play but you notice when theyre getting their offense its playing quick maybe not even a pass theyre being aggressive early heads up flag the lob and malawat answers hes got four and dunks at either end of the floor here early its an awesome pass by can nipple bounce pass get it into the seam throw that sucker up malow watch knows how to handle those B Bowen misses the three Evans drawing his first career start tonight here is flag trying to get to the glass oh my gosh and malow watch the rebound and John sh wanted a foul Cooper flag wanted a foul a hell ball is going to go to Florida State we get a the timeout at Cameron Fast and Furious here early to hey two tall teams attacking the cup jir Watkins why not welcome to camera and on the other side terrific scam pass throw it up Mala watch throw it down nearly the case however uh here in this game today because of the way Florida State plays youre going to see him be a little bit more aggressive in the first half because the defense likes to extend out and then whenever they overcommit hes going to be able to find some of these and some of these plays around the R I use the word unselfish you use the word feel yeah unbelievable feel because you look at the guys on the floor like Isaiah Evans is he going to create a ton at this level right now in his career probably not that he needs to move and the ball needs to work for him K kipo he can make some things happen sure but Cooper flag uh he can do anything at any time but he understands these other five guy or these other four guys excuse me those things those guys need to touch the ball to gain confidence throughout the course of the game all right offensive foul on maler maluk by the way for the pick so hell pick up his second with 1542 to play and that means that Christian Neu has checked into the lineup now for Florida State you see Malo go to the bench for the seal and Ne to the 611 freshman from whitne in Southern Ontario is into the lineup now and so is Patrick gangba by the way for Duke along with Cale Foster and kiple for three and he got it out of the corner half dozen now for kiple and the Duke lead quickly to eight here I love that play design John shy setting the down screen understanding Florida States going to try to jump it excellent read by kiple getting out away and terrific passing shot so gunba flag kiple with James and Caleb Foster who knocked the ball out of bounds itll stay with Florida State here and we mentioned that NE has come in the lineup a young man whos only playing about 5 minutes a game against conference opponents Davis in the corner against Foster whos been playing well as of late off the Blue Devil bench sophomore from Harrisburg North Carolina look at the activity off the ball Cooper flagging a corner stunning same with seon James now you got to find the guy Jackson the pullup jumper tapped around Bowen couldnt get it to fall heres flag ahead for James seon trying to get it to Cooper does strong against NE to Second field goal for the Freshman Wes youve had a bunch of games with Cooper flly it my first time doing the dke game this season have you seen him in a rush because on film he doesnt Rush ever he has never lost his composure feels out of place its really remarkable to see for a player so young heres Jackson in the corner lead 10 for the Blue Devils Watkins on a rck took a bump from gunga and thatll be a foul on Patrick gangba 611 freshman from Northern Virginia his first and the second on the Blue Devils Tio I I think the comp that the word composure is perfect I mean slides over comes protects the ball with his body and when you have guys flying at you all the time and you have a senior guard in seon James that can get you the Rock be careful now hes on the way to rewriting some things too how about this first ACC player 500 points 100 assists 30 blocks in the regular season in the last 25 years seems good yeah not bad pull up at 16 for Watkins oh and the nice Follow by n who got to the rim Christian Neu who played five minutes had two points against Carolina last Monday night in Tallahasse I like Christian NE to plays with an edge good size at 611 has some skill lefthanded hes got a chance Foster out front standing three and it bounds away gangba and last Touch by the nolles so theres Clare arur and well get another look at Christian Neu on the follow here saw him play for the first time for up play Canada just his activity level is what stands out especially when he comes in and plays for Coach Leonard Hamilton his activities there like I said plays with an edge got a contestant a shot a little better than that oh look at gunga Chase the offensive rebound down and heres flag on the attack through traffic put it up on the glass and finally pulled away by Neu hes now playing by the way with Jerry Deng number seven for the nlls hes a transfer from Hampton University whos coming off a season High 16 points against Carolina heres Watkins to work though skips it to D long three out of the corner rattles in for Jerry D hey Im a big fan of Jerry Dan good size shoots a really nice ball transferred from Hampton hes got that in his game how about Foster on the drive couldnt finish it dang pulls away the rebound fivepoint lead for Duke here are the nulls with Jackson now for NE theyve also plugged Justin Thomas into the lineup he wears 25 and hell take the ball in the corner and then flip it right back to Jackson tend to shoot Watkins at distance and and going to get a foul called here and its going to be on Caleb Foster his first and the third on the blue doubles they say pass makes the shot jir Watkins a little bit high on the swing terrific hands Jerry Deng grabs it with one up and over he hes got a nice looking stroke he doesnt start for the seminal team but he very well could we were noting today during their walkr that Jerry Deng and Christian Neu both have for for big guys have excellent shots absolutely air maluk as well I mean you talk about three guys with a lot of potential problem is as Leonard Hamilton alluded to it when he talked to us today like just young players so youre still teaching habits in February to where if you had an older team like hes accustomed to youre on to different things at this point in the year shot clock at four heres Watkins long three front rim Miss and James clears ahead for kiple Applause Foster foul on area gunga Gillis is checked in for the Blue Devils wheres 18 kiple with 15 to shoot finds his way into traffic and tapped around by Gillis finally Thomas had it lost it NE cleans it up this is a small thing but number 14 for Duke cion James watch his activity off the ball hes always in the gaps hes always communicating and as soon as I say it he misses a rotation how about that W AJ switon missed a layup Gung by the rebound Dukes missed their last five now from the floor and still holding to the fivepoint lead oh Foster a little shot fake Caleb challenges had it blocked and Away comes Watkins two on three Watkins against James and a foul on cion James thatll get us to a timeout first on James fourth on Duke trailing 10 a moment AG go NOS to five on the deficit free throws when we come back found it no question no question and even going back to my days when I played like he had a certain type of player I I mean those guys played hard they were up in the passing Lanes he liked them he like these jumbo Wings yeah and the thing is to Wes I would run into him I usually run into him at the airport going to the final four every year Im like coach this is 2 or 3 years ago now were on our way down to San Antonio and he was like I was like are you going on vacation at all he goes I dont take vacations I was like coach come on you youve done a good youve done a really nice job floor State you can take a vacation hes like no Ive always its always the next thing and then today walking into shoot around you and I talked to Coach Hamilton coach you going to take a vacation now no I got stuff to do yeah so no vacations for Leonard Hamilton even after his coaching seven nothing run Watkins hits the free throws what was one its a 10point lead now down to three for the Blue Devils he did talk about some of the outside interest Beyond basketball that he does have and things like that that he will tend to a little more closely than hes had in his time as a coach and theres a foul and thats going to end up being on Boston Holt I believe and flag hit the deck now we couldnt quite see from our perch in The Crows Nest what happened here but Coopers still down looks like he got poked in the eye at least from our vantage point were going to take a look here on the Baseline as you see oh yeah B Bowen and so Cooper flag is still down and the foul is on Jerry D itll be his first its the third on Florida State Leonard less than thrilled Cooper flag though now on his feet little scratch there below the nose oh its from earlier excuse me so Jose fona in now his 20th year as the Blue Devil basketball trainer out to uh tend to the Freshman this is earlier in the game West takes one wow cross the face and then here poked in the eye nothing in intentional here but somebody get Cooper a helmet so I say this seeing him walk off the floor and it looks like hes going to be okay so yeah at the Coopers expense looks like hes fine so flag and Jose fona will talk through this and Jay Lucas off John CH staff down to check in and theres his folks who have uh his twin brother Ace who by the way has captured a State title at greensbor Day School for the legendary Freddy Johnson this year hes won three state championships w1 in Maine right I think last year at Mont verd and then at the Greensboro Day School unel Fred Johnson Freddy Johnsons a winning as high school coach in the state of North Carolina by the way hes done a phenomenal job a lot of good players out of that school yeah one of his star pupils uh LED Virginia Tech to a win today Jaden young had 26 he played at greensb a day for Freddy so flag to the bench the foul on D Gillis Evans malawat James and a three out of the corner by Evans is no good common cleans it up couldnt get the roll got it again puts it to the deck oh Gillis teas up a three it bounds away look at malawat fight for it they go to the deck heres canle sitting on the basketball saves it to Gillis Evans thought about it and Dukes got to calm it down a little bit here maybe 11 to shoot and Gillis into traffic with the right hand hell draw the foul thats Boston holds first how about the ball changing sides of the floor twice after an offensive rebound gets over to Mason Gillis nice drive gets a little bit of Leverage I I think the biggest thing that sticks out about this Duke team this season Wes is their unselfishness as a unit and when your best player is your most unselfish player theres a trickle down effect to the rest of them and Im a big fan of this young man right here Mason Gillis terrific role player for Matt payner at Purdue last year shot 40 from three but I talked to him before the game and Matt payners much different in how he coaches his team than what John shy is and paint likes to set up his offense he calls every single action every single spot on the floor where sh told us he likes this whats the right word mixed results whatever you can do the spontaneity because hes got the talent and thats been an adjustment for Mason but you look at him now like hes going to potentially play with two straight national Player of the Year absolutely and two the do in two different ways B bow and a three he can do that yep 25th three of the year for the 610 sophomore from Vermont Taylor B Bowen and its a twopoint game with 10 and 1 half to go in the opening frame Duke by the way has missed their last nine shots from the floor Gillis tries to snap the streak and does five in a row for Mason Gillis thats a terrific play by K kiple coming off a ball screen and reading that bottom guy finds the open shooter in the corner Justin Thomas sixthe transfer from Baton Rouge Louisiana to B Bowen attacking on the dribble skip out dang a three right wing and malawat had a hand on it James finally controls it for kipple KH all the way to the basket and the foul canle now with eight and a chance to make it nine if he can hit the free throw two big time plays by KH kiple coming off the ball screen reading that bottom guy late switch out Mason Gill easy shot and then in transition the K can nipple show amongst the trees you got to get that ball high off the glass not an easy shot Wes nope and here is kiple at the line he is the number one threepoint shooter in ACC play at 42 hes already knocked down one of those tonight and here he goes with another free throw so hes got nine in the first half and the Duke lead is quickly gone back to eight on the efforts of Gillis and canle AJ Swinton Justin Thomas on the floor with B Bowen Boston Holt and Jerry D and the L for Deng and a foul Clare Aubry is going to ticket seon James here for his second and the fifth on the Blue Devils in this first half and a moment ago Cooper flag had headed to the Blue Devil locker room for some extra attention thats good not good hopefully Coopers okay yep so Baseline for D you see James scoreless now two fouls with 929 to go first Blue Devil with two air maluk has two for Florida State hes been on the bench since about to games first five minutes heres hul wraps it for Thomas pull up three and Evans had it couldnt control it itll stay with Florida State Here Comes Darren Harris into the lineup for the Blue Devils quick reminder to you that a week from Tuesday the 72nd annual AC mens basketball tournament presented by T Ro price starts at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte weve got all three first round games for you here on ACCC Network and the ESPN app pregame coverage tips from the floor of the spectrum center with nothing but n at 130 Eastern Time fourth turnover on Florida State and with that dayquon Davis is back and so is jir Watkins for the simol here Duke has yet to have a turnover tonight Florida States got four I think Florida States length is bothering Duke a little bit theyre not having to overh help the two times they have overh help theyve ended up in wide open jump shots for Duke y but around the rim and a foul on Davis will be his first freshman from Baltimore sixth on Florida Applause State now Mason Gillis he needs to make sure he understands like he cant run the Baseline right now spot throw in and here comes NE to to replace Jerry D the Florida state way substitute in length for more length you know Duke satal team in the Country Florida States the fourth tallest team in the country so and not only that really athletic are the simal they do a nice job but they switch everything and they put so much pressure on you because they dont have to overh help boy kipple went all the way to the rack couldnt finish and here is Davis right back the other way tried to dump it back to NE It ultimately got there Watkins jab step on malat oh nice pass base line what a hand in the lane for Darren Harris too hey if youre a freshman and youre not playing that many minutes you better do it on the defensive end John Shire told us he was going to get that opportunity and Im not sure this was off of Harris looked very much like it was off to Quan Davis tough call yeah stays Baseline with Florida State trailing eight and Bill cumington Jr a foul and its on Isaiah Evans itll be his first at six on the Blue Devils Florida States got six as well with 849 to go in this Applause Frame no Tyrese Proctor no Malik Brown for Duke no Malik Yuan for Florida State tonight too strong off the hand of Applause Watkins little bit of a force I like the fact we get to see KH kiple handle the ball at the one yeah heres Gillis quick look for Evans Showtime slim has not found the groove just yet great cut Harris the catch and the score and one Darren Harris just his 10th field goal of the year and the foul is on KN to its his first and the seventh on the seals nice cut away from the ball Cooper flag makes his way back sees him with one eye but thats all you need Darren Harris is a nice player and I think sometimes you know it gets lost in the fact that kkan nipples here and Kanan malawat like Darren Harris has struggled to crack the rotation but what a rotation it is this is a guy who scored a lot of points in high school throughout his high school career and has just struggled the correct rotation so what do you do you get the opportunity you play defense too strong off the hand of Evans dukes back to their largest lead of the game 10 and gunga stuck a hand in the pass Lane heres kiple with Harris right corner Evans three ball nope how about Harris from the front Wing nope how about a third crack with kiple maybe something a little closer nope back for Evans three yes sir ready shot ready forget about it one of six that was his first one finally able to get a rhythm a couple of notes behind it Dukes on a 133 run theyve assisted on eight of 10 made field goals in this first half so to your point theyre only shooting 35 12 three of 13 from three but its a details game again for John Char tonight it absolutely is but but you notice too as long as they get into the paint when Florida state does commit or overcommit theyve been able to find some of these shots its just a matter when they stay on their man thats when you have to and weve started to see a little bit more of that with kiple especially in transition theyve got nine points off five Florida State turnovers as well heres Davis that got blocked by gangba and heres Gillis kiple back for Gillis a three in the Run yes eight for Mason Gillis and here comes the run you get out in transition Mason Gillis thats where he finds his best looks knock down Chandler Jackson tries to sneak Baseline pushes it up in Junior from Memphis averages less than six against the conference on the board for the first Applause time 14point lead Blue Devils have been on a 110 run prior to the Jackson basket this is not a game Wes where you set up a lot of offense this is a game where you just figure it out against pressure and you just try to get downhill Evans trying to see if he can angle Watkins oh not nice pass Gung by the catch and layup really nice pass and even better Patience by Isaiah Evans whos looks like hes been a little sped up I think him getting his first career start the butterflies got to him a little bit but that three seemed to have calmed him down of course he started for Tyrese Proctor tonight Proctor had started 37 consecutive games Watkins an air ball clad door wow A Little Too Deep I I think you know Florida state has found some offensive Rhythm when the balls popped and then theyve attacked and I like his aggressiveness but Isaiah Evans gets to the middle of the floor and gunga uhoh theres Evans a layup when it rains it pours when it rains it pours with Duke they get they get ahead of steam and keep in mind this with Cooper flag on the bench yep need to working against gangba Watkins quickly for Davis tend to shoot Fall Away over Darren Harris is good for daquin Daviss first basket sometimes good offense beats good defense and that was exhibit a dcoin Davis The Freshman really thrives on his competitiveness sometimes it gets the best of him but somebody better get Mason Gillis Gillis A Long rebound and B boen had it knocked away and it will belong to the simal back to Davis here terrific skip pass and the one more giving Davis an angle if youre John sh you live with that defense you cut him off you contest Darren Harris Im okay with that Davis played at overtime Elite in Atlanta a year ago prior to that a year at St Francis in Baltimore the year at St Johns DC heres Evans after the Florida state turn over and going to be a foul Music its going to be on Davis theyre going to call it on Davis theyre going to take a look at it for a clear I dont know if the correct terminology is clear path or not but yeah so were going to take a look he loses his footing Davis gets downhill loses it grabs a hold of Isaiah Evans cant do that so Davis the foul here second its the eighth on Florida State and Bill cumington and Clare Aubry are at the Monitor and thats tough because man flags leaving again dont forget the Ally oh hold on a second get a little interpretation the previous play was reviewed we have a flagrant one foul two shots all right two shots point of interruption ball end up on the side after two free throws a flagrant one is called not a basketball play and I think thats a good call Wes yep Im with you on that so Isaiah Evans is going to get a couple of free throws and then Duke will put the ball in play in the back court and before we get to the free throws the Alli ACC womens basketball tournament start its Wednesday afternoon in Greensboro all first and second round games and two of the quarterfinal matchups well be for you right here on AC Network and the ESPN app first round coverage starts at 1230 Eastern on Wednesday nothing but net crew willll be live at the coliseum in Greensboro with the Ally womens tournament Id watch just for Kelly gramley why Tigers you know tend to stay in the same pack free throw by Evans is good it does bring up a question by the way as Evans knocks down Shooters its mentioning you and John sh see each other today and its like a shooting conversation breaks out right away so Kelly graml Terence Oglesby ridiculous question and I love Kelly this isnt the business she wants not bringing the smoke for Kelly thats not what she wants no not what she wants to contest for shooting okay speaking of Shooters though yeah Isaiah Evans one of six from three whats the last thing you need to do to a shooter to get his confidence going put that man on the free throw line so dont be shocked if you see him end up with a jump shot at some point here in this possession but jir Watkins is not going to let anything happen yeah Isaiah Evans has got a sixpoint half hit one or two at the line and heres a three ball and knocked out of bounds itll stay with Duke I think Thomas the 67 sixthe transfer from Baton Rouge pushed it last I think the lineup size on the floor is the most jarring shortest player on the floor is Chandler Jackson right now at 65 I I mean this is a grown man game in terms of size athleticism and Marner I think juggled the ball before kiple could officially put it in play here is Evans now as we work towards five minutes to play in the Blue Devil lead is 17 Applause gangba had it poked away Evans Scoops it up right back to the basket and that got knocked around they play on with Applause Watkins Im a big fan of Isaiah Evans thats a spot where you can see where his physical maturity is really going to come into the play Jerry dang a smooth stroke for another three six for d and a 30se second timeout for John shy as the blue double lead is cut to 13 Dangs knocked down two triples here in this first half for the simol the last one cleanly stroked from the right wing back to Cameron in a moment Music Applause Music so here in Durham the side note we Cooper flag took a inadvertent finger to the eye and you see with 1127 to go in this first half hes now coming back from the locker room Jose fona I think was taking his mom back to that locker room area underneath the stands here at Cameron Indoor Stadium theres one thing I know Wes its that Mama makes everything better thank goodness he didnt need Mama though glad to see Cooper back on the bench so back to the bench area 14point game with four and a half to play Applause can nipple what jir Watkins is a Min defensively he has bothered everything has done five to shoot and a foul will be called it traffic I mean when jir Watkins is on the point of attack defensively he is keeping Duke on one side of the floor by himself and whenever hes doing that theyre having a hard time getting the ball past half court and struggling to start that sequence of actions and what I mean by that is when Duke breaks down the defense or they call an offensive set that ball changes sides of the floor two and three times sometimes in order to find open looks or driving Lanes Gillis to shoot two first away sir and it rattles out dont forget nothing but net crew will be in Greensboro for the Alli womens tournament Wednesday through Sunday right here on acc Network you get full coverage pregame halftime postgame shows throughout the tournament previews highlights analysis and game breakdowns as well all of that starts Wednesday about 1230 eastern time from Greensboro at the Ally ACC womens tournament should be a terrific event by the way Gillis got the back end of the free throw hes three for four has nine in this half hes averaged four and a half points in the last couple of ball games hes had three double figure games against the ACC including 12 against Miami the other night heres the drive and Jackson wow the answer circus shot four for Chandler Jackson I said Gillis had 12 it was against Miami earlier in the year not the other night in the win at Coral Gable look at Watkins I I mean that his defensive ability has stood out but what a Applause play number three back to work for you Tio I love it find out more at the intermission here flag has been out since the 1127 Mark Dule had 1411 when he left the game theyre on a 27 to 12 runs since to take this uh 18point lead on Florida State and the Blue Devils playing a pretty clean game as well no turnovers too its amazing really I I but thats not where Florida States bothered him its been at the rim and its been in their shooting percentage up until this La latest run everything around the rim against Florida States difficult here is Chandler Jackson with four to shoot trying to find a path and the long rebound for seon James let drive it all the way again and score look I know hes 66 and 220 but when he takes it down the floor on a bounce he looks like a box safety he sure does trying to gun the Run AJ swiat a leaner against Gillis the rebound and had it rejected by malawat another look at seon James on a runaway track tough shot leads to transition buckets and seon James directing traffic sees an angle thats a strong man and if youre Taylor B Bowen for Florida State you need to get your hind Parts back on defense why because it happens so quickly when you play against the Blue Devils Watkins against kiple who did a good job just taking his arm straight up James ahead for Evans Baseline and couldnt get it to go Gillis tried to collect he got ripped away and we got a scrum just below the foul line it has been physical yep and Chandler Jackson looks like hes taken one across the bridge of the nose here Leonard Hamilton getting after the officiating crew pretty much the whole first half hey the fire is still there oh no question it hasnt gone anywhere right Z Evans trying to get downhill again kind of the physicality portion for him I think youre going to see a lot of improvement over his career just getting stronger putting on a little bit of weight look hes a hes in oh man right to the face Chandler Jackson thats just two teams playing hard in February or March excuse me tapped away malat and a foul so the foul will be on B Bowen its his first that is 10 now on Florida state with a minute 57 to go so couple of free throws here from malawat so you have common malawat who is from rbec in the South Sudan you have Taylor B Bowen born in an Egyptian refugee camp but parents were from the Sudan air maluk adds to the international flavor of this lineup tonight he has not played because of some foul trouble early in the first half but in particular Tio and you follow the game internationally as well this part of the world is starting to produce lots of talented basketball point well and they also had car Jones former Louisville point guard running the show for that team in the Olympics so you look at you know the impact and and keep in mind too not a player you just mentioned that has seen minutes in this game is below 610 so tall people in that part of the world obviously but that is a big Time developing area of the world in terms of hoop and what a shot by Jerry Dan who is also his mom is from the South Sudan and Jerry Ds got eight hes been as impressive as anybody wearing the garnet and gold in this opening frame he sure has James another drive into traffic couldnt get the roll Watkins The Rebound with 75 seconds to go catch and shoot three from the perimeter is good for AJ Swinton The Freshman from Cabin John Maryland just his eigh three of the year didnt look like thats going to be his 83 of the Year shoots a pretty ball consensus top 60 player think Leonard Hamilton got a good one in Swinton look at the defensive pressure left side for Evans tes up a three spins out on Isaiah Evans piple saves it Mala watch fouled on the deck by Boston hul no continuation two shots for common malow watch on the second foul against Boston Holt the senior transfer from Portland Oregon Johns not going to like it I actually like the call on the floor youre going to get two free throws anyway but KH canle what hes done today has been yeah see the fouls way before even dribble and John shy doesnt love it and as we both know Wes Duke never gets the foul call so he I say that factiously but at the same time uh K can nipple today hes guarded really well on the defensive end of the he stayed in front he hasnt lost his discipline he canest straight up he comes off hes having to play the point guard because Cooper Flags out seon James gets two fouls quick malow Watch the free throw hes got a hes got 10 now kipples got nine points five assists four rebounds to your point to my point so hes come off ball screens hes made hes made the read on the most important guy the Mig thats underneath the rim and hes knocked down some shots so I mean you talk about a guy at 6667 strong build hes not going to rise up on and dunk on too many people but skill right now especially at the next level preferred by everybody yep 19point lead toward the final half minute to play Duke a little two3 yeah how about that actually thought they were defending pretty well little curveball before heading into the half here is Holt Watkins 12 to shoot Baseline switon rolls it in five for AJ switon off Leonard Hamiltons bench and the Blue Devils get the last shot of the half up 17 K nipple with 6 seconds against H hell take him on the drive stoping lane push it up it rolled off and the horn sounds nonetheless at one point it was a fourpoint game early pill to climb flag starts the second half on the floor for the Blue Devils and jir Watkins travels but he might have been fouled question mark little bit of both but the foul is called zero turnovers for Duke is the thing that stands out for me was I mean seon James gets too early Cooper flag who does the bulk of the ball handling typically in the first halves and and heres the thing points in the paint against the Florida State team that is massive as well 22 to8 yep Davis out front B Bowen had just the three in the first half comes in averaging almost nine against the league five to shoot Watkins in the corner Davis off balance threw it up draws the foul and that is on kiple itll be his first second on the Blue Devils here in the half 67 freshman from Milwaukee got beat here on the bounce should have played up and he wouldnt have gotten the foul call but that off arm there good job dquan Davis feeling the defense yep hes able to get the line Davis is an 83 free throw shooter he is 10th best in the Atlantic Coast Conference Florida State who at one point was upper 70s as a team a couple of years ago he has kind of been fighting the free throw line they are 734 in conference play that is 13th they are 715 regular season that is 16th in the leag hard to win close games when you cant shoot free throws theyve been in their share of them this season Y Davis hits the first and the second hes got four now does the Freshman from Baltimore you know its been kind of a strange game Wes and that it its lacked Rhythm and Duke has just found ways to score offensive foul on James there too it is and he ran the defender right into come on malawat thats just Im a little stronger than you pushes and then malawat has his feet spread out a little too far first turnover by the way on the blue devs in the ball game flag defending Davis heres Chandler Jackson against James into traffic malow watch shut it off kick out for B Bowen three thats good 610 sophomore can really St broken he sure can and even better play Chandler Jackson getting into the lane hes had a nice game so far stats arent that loud but hes been one of the few guys for the seminal has been able to put pressure on the rim five in a row for Florida State theres a flag skipping it for James in traffic put it up off the glass got knocked around kick out for Evans shot fake and now the three hello the lid is off for Isaiah Evans and thats dangerous you see your first one go down in the second half confidence Builder three threes for uh Evans hes got a dozen and a bump and a foul on flag will be his first and the fourth against Duke very quickly here in about the first 95 seconds nice job seon James not forcing the issue John shy not pleased with the foul situation so far yep but not forcing the issue in finding your Shooters on the perimeter and as a righthanded shooter West I was always really comfortable getting to my left hand for one dribble and then pulling perfect example right there Watkins and the follow Malo couldnt control it here is James Evans three away nope too strong and last touched by jir Watkins he didnt even look at the rim and if he would have he would have seen malow watch wide open Isaiah Evans is three for 11 from behind the line four for 14 now here again the shooters Creed keep shooting right thats it and heres the thing if nothing else West like even if hes not hitting him the threat of him hitting it is spacing the defense out so hes not doing his job if hes not looking for those shots James to put it in play and flag the catch against Jackson seon James into traffic against B bowan and one that is seon James saying Im stronger than you yep simply put no help because Cooper flag SS the screen hes got the middle wide open put my shoulder in your chest you can forget about it 66 I think hes listed at 220 try 250 that mans only muscle James got six looking for his third double figure effort in the last seven games he had 14 points six assists in the Big Win here against Stanford hes got seven tonight on his first free throw lead is quickly to 18 after it looked like a little run for Florida State to start the half Watkins against kiple skip for Chandler Jackson missed everything malow watch the rebound flag has two field goals tonight by the way of course went to the bench after the injury now working into traffic takes the contact and a whistle and get a foul on Florida State its about time Cooper got a call Chandler Jacksons first and the second on the Nolls here in the half and I know a lot of people are going to roll their eyes when I say that he has been attacking the lane and getting clubbed every time down and they have their hands all over working against maluk and flag scores off the glass the creativity and the understanding where he is on the floor is just another dimension of his game and thats going to be a foul I believe on air Malo thatll be his third and the Third on Florida State and another look at the flag pivot look at I mean he goes up he gets smacked in the face again but he credit to Cooper flag though he gets back hes complaining now but he never does so in an overly demonstrative fashion so look he is getting foul so the lead is 20 eight nothing Duke run here Terrence the mans bleeding can nipple along the Baseline and thats going to be on B Bowen thatll be his third and thats four on Florida State I love the the aggression by can nipple there and what does he do he takes away the defenses athleticism by attacking their chest on the ground so here is kiple at the line looking for his 10th point and the first one is good dont forget our coverage of the 72nd T price ACC mens basketball tournament starts a week from Tuesday will be at Spectrum Center in uptown Charlotte all three first round games for you on acc Network our coverage starts with Taylor tanom and nothing but net at 130 eastern time on Tuesday March 11th from Shar kiple with 10 hes three for three at the line and making four for four 11 points for K kiple the lead 22 its largest of the night now for the Blue Devils second time its been to this margin NE has comeing the lineup long three pounds away off the hand of Watkins flag for kiple against Davis thats a mismatch skip out for Evans three from the left and the rebound pulled out of there by dayquon Davis not a thought of passing nope Jackson into traffic over malow watch flag Applause gathers down the floor goes flag lob coming the hammer handling it against pressure seeing the help come over and N to just had it rejected by flag heres kiple weaving around Jerry Deng shot fake in one how about you get out in transition throw it up Mala watch knows how to put some Rim pressure on and then Mr patient K can nipple able to get the and one and Duke off and running Cooper loves it I do Music too for John Shire third team here in his Alum Mar and a win tonight based on some of the other elements Duke Clemson and Louisville would all lock up first round buys by the way Duke had it the other night after the win in Miami Clemson and Louisville basically put it on ice today Louisville by the way be picked Clemson will win at Virginia Ian sheflin on his birthday 21 points and 13 rebounds hope the Cakes good and hes been really good all season the top three in the ACC can do some real damage in the NCAA tournament Watkins the spin and jumper hes got eight in the ball game 6237 that stops the Run by the Blue Devils at 15 in a row yeah it feels like thats the way were going to go to Charlotte doesnt it with those three and an offensive foul on cion James as he tried to drive to the basket thats four now on James so now John shy without Tyrese Proctor in the lineup tonight James handling the ball anyway and immediately Darren Harris The Freshman from hearnden Virginia is back into the lineup for the Blue Devils on the Blue Devil second turnover Harris by the way played five minutes and had a couple of points in the first half the clarity of Duke is easy to see by the way in relationship to that discussion about the NCAA tournament Blue Devils arguably going to be one of the four top seeds that could change of course somewhere along the way in the rhetoric but I dont see how it does I dont either but you never know out of the corner the Neo triple bounds into Harriss hands feels like Duke is definitely a number one seed though in my opinion just with their body of work and the winds they posted especially the Run theyve been on as of late I mean what they did to Illinois in New York City oh my gosh I mean well and theyre staring at a first round opportunity right down the road here in Raleigh potentially too to here goes flag into traffic thatll draw a whistle and a foul Cooper will go to the line know its funny Wes like you watch Cooper flag and obviously he does so many things that Intrigue you as a player but you you watch how he gets by Defenders and I was I was looking I was I was trying to figure out why it is because it looks so easy he never really looks like he hits the turbo button mhm but he changes levels as well as anybody Ive seen in the last 10 years and what I mean by that is he can go from standing straight up to attacking to penetrate and have his shoulders in the opponents midsection so fast and his legs are so flexible and his steps are big that by time the defense realizes what happened hes completely controlling everything the defenders doing so on that last possession he gets to the cup from the left 45 and hes able to do so cuz he just understands leverage so well well and he is the focal point of an offensive explosion that has happened here for the Blue Devils knocks the second free throw look at the last four games here and again John sh said in January and later in the month hey look were pretty steady defensively we got to continue to evolve and get better on offense and how about Watkins lob just kind of rolled in for it and theres a foul on Boston Holt for a hold Mark snner called that from across the far sideline thatll be the third on Hulk and the seventh on Florida State so game was incredibly physical in the first half and it was a hold Caleb Foster trying to get over you get a handful of Jersey I mean thats about as obvious a call as you can make yep so Caleb Foster will get one and one but Wes we saw in the first half how physical this game was referees obviously go to the locker room say hey we need to tighten up just a little bit first point of the night for foster Caleb the sophomore from Harrisburg playing about 12 minutes a game tonight in the first half came off the bench played just better than four and hes got a couple of free throws here in his sequence in the second Applause half 66 39 heres Hol against gangba and a foul on Patrick gangba his second thats six now on Duke and so Boston Holt draws the foul of the big freshman from that very talented Paul v 6 program man thats been a feeder program for Duke over the past few years right Darren Harris Patrick gangba from there Trevor Keels yep here is H into traffic for Jerry Deng he lost it on the dribble and theyre going to go to the deck and look at Gillis and D get wrapped up and alternating possession going to belong they going to call a foul thats a good thats a good thats a good call were going to be able to take another look at it Gillis comes over the top youre going to see the ball gets loose and Im not saying that Gillis has him in a headlock but take a look here good effort to get there look at this thats GRE o Roman right there and then John obviously a little frustrated here but yeah leans back on the table and they have called it tighter and to be honest yeah and theyve needed to I thought the first half as fun as it was lacked a little bit of flow because it was overly physical heck of an officiating cre here today too Jerry Deng trying to reach double figures for the Third third time and it spins out in the last eight games 6 minutes into the second half both teams are in the one and one and Duke by 26 and here goes flag yes sir yes sir just silly 68 40 kind of blessing is it for John Shire to just call up a wrong way screen and just let Cooper go to work Watkins had it punched away and thatll be a foul on flag his second its the AP on Duke heres another look at the whirling dervish of Cooper flag Quick Step Up screen up under not a traditional Up and Under I know Jay billis would not be happy with me saying that but nonetheless Big Time finish you see the spin thats close West Watkins at the line hes got 10 four here in in the second half for the senior from Trenton New Jersey transferred into the program from VCU and last year averaged 16 points six rebounds and shot 47 from the floor for Florida State but again this goes back to something you mentioned in the first half by any definition of Leonard Hamiltons tenure at Tallahassee this is a young basketball team absolutely is and you look at Watkins whos one of the older players in the program its only his second year in the program so their way of doing things takes a little bit of time Leonard was still red shirting guys as of 56 years agoel exactly so he had his T chance to put his hands on guys and really teach them heres Gillis a three and itll hit the top of the glass and bounce back into play Watkins took an unbelievable ran into a screen in the back court from gunga and heres Jerry dang from Deep on the right and scores man he can shoot the basketball third three of the night for D 12 in the ball game for the young man from Norcross Georgia who played at Hampton a year ago Applause and spent some time as a prep player in South Dakota flag fouled on the drive I believe thats Watkins and jir Watkins first foul of the night and a little look at Jerry D on the other side Watkins shaking and baking a little bit Dan doesnt need much room and you see the rotation on that basketball 69 can really shoot it athletic enough talked to a couple of the assistants for Florida State hes finally getting in better shape and you can see it in his production transferred from Hampton Hampton didnt use him as much as what he probably could have right at his size and skill level but it certainly there Gillis out kiple returns well in this look the storyl line with Florida States been realized Leonard Hamiltons retiring at the end of the year and we know what the transactional nature of college basketball is Terrence sure and Michael offord is going to hire a new headmans basketball coach in Tallahassee but the timing on that is going to be fascinating because as you know portal comes open and guys are going to get in heres H back Runner with a right hand off the window and in first points of the night for Portland Oregon native Boston hul I will say this though the portal opens after the second weekend of the NCAA tournament correct and Florida State for all intents and purposes not going to the tournament the ad is going to have plenty of time to hire somebody right before these guys can enter so you know do you keep some of these guys sure you probably add one more piece probably a pure point that can make something happen mhm but theres a lot of natural Talent on this team and another guy whos naturally talented Darren Harris who hasnt gotten a whole lot of love this season he can score it back to 25 again 7247 oh my gosh and that ball got thrown away into the end zone seats almost a heck of a player made in the second much more and of course it goes back to document not only the national championship game against Vegas in 91 but the one the next year in 1992 against Michigan and the Fab Five Terren sounds like must watch TV to me Wes my goodness it is terrific here is gangba working against aluk or maluk rather and a foul is drawn thatll be the fourth its been a tough night for air maluk who is still 18 years old reclassified to come to Florida State and hell come out of the ball game on his fourth foul with a 1131 to go 34 to go rather he had a season high in minutes the other night against Carolina and had he not gotten into foul trouble he was going to play another season High here tonight gunga missed the front end of the one and one the rebound inside flag will draw the foul feel bad for air Malo because this is probably the only floor hes ever been on in his life where hes not the biggest player on floor like the crazy part is as you look out there and gunba is 611 much wider and then you look at Kaman malawat whos basically half a head taller than him so its the collective size of this Duke team I mean you see the effects of it happen throughout the course of the game theres a wear down effect of playing against bodies the size of this blue Devils team and the fact that theyre so unselfish too we got four guys in double figures and Mason Gillis has has nine Cooper flag got 14 10 here in the second half after he knocked down both free throws Duke by the way shoots two free throws on every common foul the rest of the way B bow and caught it almost traveled gangba knocked it away Foster saved it boy fell into the bench area and then gangba was over there in front of the Florida State bench and I believe Mark snner is going to award this to the NS but we got to clean the deck first Foster oh he hit it off it was off gunga GBA yeah barely touched him but it did nonetheless see right toward well from that angle its deceiving but and does Bill Covington want to have a look here oh theyre shock CL sure thats what it was that was the look The reason they went to the monitor so here is switon to put it in play and the Cozy confines here at the venerable building on the west campus you got to give him a little distance on the inbounds Thomas working against Harris dang here is Hol trying to beat canle and a hand check foul on kiple will be his second and that is nine on the Blue Devils dont forget Wednesday afternoon First Horizon Coliseum in Greensboro the Alli ACC womens tournament starts our coverage will begin at 1230 with nothing but net and then all the first and second round games and two of the quarterfinals are right here exclusively on acc Network its going to be a big Sunday the final day of play in the Atlantic Coast Conference in the womens card is tomorrow and you see Terren you have four teams that get buys but theres a mess from Carolina Florida State Duke and Louisville and Carol Austins team who got a win here the other night against Carolina is in Tallahassee to see Brook wofs simol who won at Notre Dame the other night just a terrific win not an easy place to play nope and they had Tania Latson and all that in the victory at South B so sets up for a great final day of the regular season tomorrow on acc Network and certainly Wednesday from Greensboro Harris on the recovery and out of bounds it will go to Florida State thats a young man in Darren Harris who whos realizing his opportunity trying to make something happen but where itll be easier for him he gets into the lane off a nice move kick out you had guys open make the easy play B Bowen working against Foster tried to wrap it through traffic here is flag Thomas in front of him Cooper on the layup and the tap follow got knocked out gunga Harris a three missed badly and flag recovers winds through a double team got it back stayed with it and a hell ball will go to the Blue Devils thats a micro effort the effort of of Cooper flag is phenomenal it its been phenomenal for both teams but this is kind of a microcosm of this game right like its weve lacked some flow guys are trying to get out and run but its been offensive rebounds hustle points and thats how they found their threes Y and and they have been unselfish dont get me wrong and they theyve made nice individual plays but as far as flow is concerned this game doesnt have a ton of it yeah and each coach has had to dive into depth get the bench involed a lot of combinations and here in this second half I mean weve had 20 free throws in this second half so and almost 20 fouls almost 20 fouls sure halfway home here in the second kiple hanging jumper and finally controlled by jir Watkins Ill say this about jir wat Watkins the dude can guard I mean his on the ball defense is going to get him a shot at the next level Applause yep here is Foster Caleb trying to beat swin to the basket skip for Evans Isaiah fights through traffic and lays it up parted the Red Sea I Isaiah Evans attacking the cup as well not something hes done with all that much 14 for Evans tonight hes got his fourth straight double figure game and this is where Duke can get you these is where these runs happen they get a couple of baskets you get frustrated you take a quick shot they cant do that theyre going to call Boston H for the grab on malow watch right here in this second half thatll be the fourth on Hope by the way Evans one of three from three sees the defense attack strong move right through the middle you have to close that Gap if youre Florida state that cant happen so just ahead of nine minutes to go Dukes going to shoot free throws 27 and 28 with common malawat who is four for four tonight and has 10 points and the free throw good hes got good hands I mean for 72 the ball comes off his hands nicely when he shoots a free throw hes got a 9 foot 8 in reach good dang near fly I mean thats crazy but look at the ball how it comes off his hands good good hand placement on the ball comes off his index finger and his middle finger I I think hes going to be able to develop into a guy that can pull his game out and shoot the ball from Beyond the AR dark a little bit Davis the floater hes got six four here in the second half 27point Duke lead inside nine to Applause go Florida States lost two straight three of four and seven of their last 10 with a trip to Virginia on Tuesday and then SMU next Saturday to close the regular season flag for Evans three ball the easiest shot Isaiah Evans has had all day yep Isaiah Evans has got 17 now and Cooper flag with the steel and here he goes lay it up my gosh the ground covered off two dribbles is absurd after making a terrific pass hes rewarded with some good defense as well and Davis fouled on the drive by Foster second on Caleb Foster hey this is something where a lot of guys will put one one dribble on the deck and fire away nope not Cooper flag hits Isaiah Evans and then Coast to Coast two dribbles my gosh I mean the athleticism and the flexibility in the legs I mean so so good plays with such good pace and lower body strength I think thats the underrated portion of this yeah 16 now for flag hes one of four Blue Devils in double figures tonight 17 for Evans 14 for kiple a dozen for malat with eight rebounds and and here is Davis at the line and hes three for three you know were going to get around to a week from tomorrow with the all ACC ballots thatll be cast sure and Cooper flag is easily first team easily the Rookie of the Year by historic portions hes easily the player of the year and easily the player of the year lets go ahead and cut the nonsense I I think the national discussion I think hes right there with he and Janai broom is fascinating too Foster malat just throw it up there in the vicinity 14 for common six in the second Applause half Davis wrap around for switon and a foul will be ticketed here and thatll get us to the under eight and when we come back how about a little historical comparative with Cooper flag in the best freshman seasons of all Applause time of the Applause Music team as far as impact is concerned I would do that Zion right there as well I I think you know Zion even to this day and its he was he is a onetrick pony but that one trick is unbelievable sure hes just stronger than everybody else on this planet and he gets to the cup I I think you know Carmelo was great at a point where guys were in the mid post creating isolation the game has changed obviously since Carmelo but I think the impact of Cooper just because of how he affects the game in so many ways hes got my vote as far if if it were down to those four mhm its between him and Carmelo for sure malawat lowered to shoulder pushed it up and scored offensive foul on common malawat before the basket against B Bowen second on the Freshman from the South Sudan I get the call she had the angle doesnt mean I have to like it third turnover on the Blue Devils 30point lead for Duke Tio you see this game as much from a national perspective as anybody I know or work with does he have to win a National Championship to cement his legacy as the best freshman season potentially in college basketball or at least be in the Carmelo discussion I I I think you know Carmelo did win a National Championship at the same time Carmelo didnt have near the defensive impact as Cooper because he sat in the back of the two3 zone so so to me I would like to see him deep into the second weekend or the final four which is very much in the realm of possibility and even likely but at the same time you know I I feel like just his overall impact is just cant be overstated yep little 131 by Duke yeah and a kick out three for Davis malow watch the rebound you know what I John sh went have set a two3 in late in the first half right well thats what I was going to get to like thats one thing about John Shire Ive really come to appreciate about appreciate about his coaching style like earlier in the conference season he needed a curveball he goes two three so were heading into postseason play now theyre tinkering with something else just to give him some variability so a quick 131 to give a an opposing team a new look were going to get a timeout here I agree with you on all fronts about that step aside Duke by 32 when we continue from camp Applause Music of support Applause Music oh Music Music a Music Music Music Music Isaiah Evans will be at the free throw line the foul was on AJ Swinton as we went to the break Two Shots coming for Evans The Freshman from fville North Carolina who by the way last year at North mecklinburg High School averaged 28 points and had a very Terren Oglesby like 62 in a playoff game I went for 57 in high school one time was it a playoff game no it was not Evans has got a season High good for him started off a little rough just kept at it yep I thought he let the game come to him a little bit better in the second hes got 19 tonight nice performance Tyrese Proctor goes down you need somebody to step up iner Isaiah Evans whos been playing really well yep heres Watkins ahead of six minutes to go kicks it for Davis Watkins over gangba off the window and in8 and a half for Watkins 14 in the ball game still a 32point Duke lead as we go inside of six minutes to go Blue Devils who have been on a tear scoring 983 in their last four are in that range again tonight Baseline Sheffield hell draw the foul from Davis you know there was a period in the first half where offensively Duke kind of hit a low MH outside of that Wes its been Death By A Thousand Cuts because its just the consistency the ball movement the open shots the transition the consistency in their play yeah cam Sheffield to the line grad transfer from Alpharetta Georgia came to this program from rice and the free throw is good thats his first free throw attempt of the year in his 10th Applause game air maluk checks back in playing with four fouls hes been riddled with foul trouble all night has the big seven foot freshman and Sheffield missed the second one so 90 57 Watkins open three good there hasnt been a whole lot to pick at for John shy and his staff that one right there is going to get picked at I Promise Too open well way too open and Gung Bud takes too long to get up on a ball screen and you have a guy like jir Watkins who hasnt had the best night offensively you have to get up and show knowing that hes averaging 18 points a game heres Foster thought about pulling the trigger on maluk and cross the Baseline knocked out of bounds I think Swinton touched it last for the nolles five to shoot for Duke on a spot throw Applause in Foster to put it in play this Baseline out of bounds for Florida States a bit confusing cuz it looks a little bit like a guy on the ball 131 behind but at the same time just like the corners are open theyre going to send a second guide to you so you have to get the ball in and get it out Applause quick we got to get Jerry D back down the floor to put it in play here Applause snon in trouble against Sheffield 15 to shoot and heres Watkins on the attack again and off the glass so Watkins is providing the scoring punch here for Florida State in the second half him and dcoin Davis have really been the only players that have been able to create anything off the bounds 19 Foster took some contact first shot second tap nope Jackson one dribble and feeds dang spot up three short and theres the Scramble for the ball in the paint and a hell ball will belong to Florida state that did not look comfortable nope and AJ switon helped to his feet and here comes anastasis roas into the ball game from Greece well done West 13th appearance of the year has not played in the last three played a minute in the home loss to Clemson and the chance of we want Spencer yep the man who can tear the roof off Cameron Ender he tore the roof off of Madison Square Gard a 58 grad student Spencer hover as Watkins gets fouled and scores the bucket and when we come back free throws for the NS on the basket by Watkins and too got a story on Leonard Hamilton explains it he goes to a couple of tournaments and he sees a young man named fly Williams well fly agrees to meet with Leonard to talk about coming down to Austin P so Leonard goes to his house in the middle of New York meets with his mother who sits and talks with him for the better part of two hours fly doesnt come home and its about 10 1100 so flys mother goes to use the restroom he goes fixs up and he turns the clock back two hours cuz keep in mind this is before cell phones right so he comes up he turns the clock back 2 hours he had to do it three more times the sun was coming up when fly comes back home he ends up recruiting fly Williams signs him at Austin P and if its not for Leonard Hamilton the chant the fly is open lets go PE never becomes a thing there you go so thank you for that but a relentless recruiter his entire career he has never taken a vacation as he alluded to us we talked about earlier and has done I I mean thats a funny story but you look back at what hes done for the game of basketball throughout his career yep and I have the utmost respect for Leonard Hamilton who has coached for the better part of his life with that exact scowl on his face yep and I always thought it was funny how can you get ahead and that way to get ahead for him was turning fly Williams Mamas clock back there you go and then it was on to Kentucky and then yep of course Gran his own programs in Stillwater Miami the Wizards for a year and then the last 23 have been in Tallahassee and you see Mike sheski looking on tonight and Jake Morton and here is Spencer hubard bringing it front Court the 58 grad student from Los Angeles California who is playing tonight in his 24th career game kick out and hubber dont let him score cuz this place will explode well exploded when he came in theres Sheffield on the drive hell draw the foul with 303 to play so very quickly Dukes line up has Darren Harris on the floor and there is Spencer and you see 7even foot Stanley bordon Neil begovic is also on the floor and Cameron Sheffield who will shoot the free throws thats the fifth foul on Boston Hol and he will come out of the ball game with four points and into the lineup comes Jason Simpson senior transfer from West Palm Beach for the simal so Ras and Neu on the floor along with Jesse Jones a senior transfer from Claremont Florida and also air maluk and field gets his second free throw the night his only points have come from the line anastasis and the rebound for Harris thats to your point Spencer hubard scored a week ago at the Garden and the place went crazy hes just dribbling in the place is going crazy yep he got off the bench and they erupted heres haris and the three for bordon or begovic rather and theres hubber missing the follow it makes me happy when these guys get in the game they work so hard on Scout team and and I can assure you as a guy who is the ga at Clemson for Brad Brown Al scout team is no joke no joke not at this level at this level it is labor it it is not easy because youre going against the first team the second team team and then usually a third team and youre having to defend all the actions and ju and me just attempting defense Wes yeah is a burden thats it yes and labor for that matter thats right heres Harris coming up on two to go Dukes got 93 points tonight and shooting 48 in the half Sheffield a deep three and last touched by the Blue Devils says Bill Covington Jesse Jones battling for it with Florida State but Duke touched it last take away from this game for me and just seeing Duke in person okay the size the switch ability and you notice in the first half you know comman malawat his switch ability and the ability to guard perimeter players on the perimeter is something that I certainly didnt see coming Harris all the way to the basket Darren Harriss third field goal and while I say I dont didnt see it coming his lateral quickness at that size uhoh hover the steel the basket it gets the people going Spencer hubard electric Dukes got 97 and finally Florida State controls heres Jones with 10 to shoot throw Aus Simpson tried to lob it inside bordon knocked it away theyll go to the deck and the shot clock was it recovered before the shot clock insired Spencer hubard in transition defense leading to offense a little toughness a little Lefty come on man gets the people going the Finesse the senior from modern day in California a Powerhouse in its own right look at sh and Johns okay with it yeah my favorite part Spencers laying on the floor after he laid the scored the basket mean mugging to the bench forgot to get back on defense yeah so 19 seconds on the shot clock is where we landed here and a foul called on Sheffield and all that will buy his free throws here for Simpson Jason Simpson is Applause a transfer from St Johns he is the younger brother brother of the former seminal Scotty Barnes there was a first round pick by Toronto lottery pick by the way Simpson of the year yeah terrific player dont forget were number one celebrating Dukes first two national championships follows us here from Cameron first free throw of the year for Simpson playing in his eighth game tonight and here is is hubard front court shot clock is still in play set that man a ball screen and let him cook dur two benches standing hub for three come on let my man cook spiter hubard fourth 100o game of the year for the Blue Devils last time they did it they won a national championship dribble it out thatll do it I cant take it anymore 17 and one the Blue Devils are in the ACC 26 and3 overall and tonight the margin is 35 for the Nations number two team their ninth win by 25 or more hey slide them up a spot this is the best team
