Center Florida state is 9 and3 and 42 in conference play and the opening tip is controlled by the seminal 7270 at Wake Forest on Wednesday they shot 45 as the team Taylor B Bowen had that key threepointer with 15 seconds to go proved to be the winning margin and Florida State woned along the Baseline Yuan steps out of bounds good hands by lacking on that Drive getting uh yous off Rhythm a little bit to uh force that turnover there is the intimidation factor with lock and he is the leading shot Blocker in the ACC what an addition he has been to the Clemson program he has man he started the game off really well against Way Forest hit four threes in a row so maybe well see some of that today 22 points and a game high for locken against North Carolina and the Tigers on the board with zero in the Box Score Florida state was big on the boards at wake on Wednesday as well they outrebounded the deeps 37 29 they LED for all of 15 seconds in the second half as Zachary knocks that one out of bounds another good uh solid defensive possession for Clemson 14 seconds left Florida State theyve got to get a little more energy offensively especially against this CL team who thrives on defense shot clock is inside of 10 Jackson hopping into the paint bounces off youan had a hand on it locken comes away with it Chase Hunter brings the ball up what can you say about number one in Orange although Yan locked his Applause shot even though the shot was blocked John Chase Hunter has scored 131 points in his career against Florida State thats the most of any ACC opponent for Hunter he sees the Florida state Jersey he seems to get a little happy Yan Zachary comes for the help aggressively shot clocks at four Yan Drive Yuan tried to lay it in and he got it beautiful Patience by Yan right there waiting for the double team to leave and then driving to the middle thats is a veteran big knowing what he wants to do Malik Yan over 14 points per game in the fourth leading rebounder in the ACC this is Dylan Hunter brother of Trace hits the front rim nolles try to save it it ends up with Chase shefin is open for a three thought it might have been deflected but shefin made the shot anyway in practice yesterday coach Hamilton said you know shefflin is going to hit a three out there dont be discouraged fla state has to just keep playing Yan got it back had it knocked away quick hands of Chase Applause Music Hunter Hunter locken twoman gain locken going to the free throw line lets take a look back at the mark of a fighter moment brought to you by Modello nice blocked shot by Yuan he dribbles it up to keep offensive going he takes a nice drive to the left he can finish with both hands down there coach Bell said hes got really soft and good hands and he shows you right there what coach was talking about 71 from the stripe on the season for locken Rich Senor from Applause Russia we mentioned his 22 points and a gain High and a win against North Carolina made four threepointers in that game as John mentioned had five blocks as well loan also had 22 points to lead the team against he is on a heater is what we would call that absolutely spent 3 years in the Cincinnati program and hes playing in his 117th Collegiate basketball game Watkins B Bowen fla State cant get impatient offensively this is the Clemson team that for forces opponents to hold the ball 19 seconds per possession which is leading in the country somehow Jackson picked it up and scored its not the prettiest offensive possession but you got two out of it John patience is key against his Clemson defense they do make you hold the ball for a long time Jackson Who averages just over seven points per game only had two points in the comeback win against Wake Forest shot clock to 10 for Dylan Hunter on the drive Hunter aggressively to the rack that five men switching for Florida State Yans got a put up a little more resistance on that drive against Hunter Dylan Hunter almost six points per game on average this season B Bowen hops into the paint tries to put some touch on it sheflin fights with Yan for the Board Hunter again hes got eyes for the rim not this time turn back by Watkins shein tries the other side of the rim maybe he didnt need to Johnny had good position thats just the length of Florida State ball Bing bothering him kind of in his head a little bit B bowling for three locking over the top of the rebound had a good look at it though playing extremely well lately gos are going to go in get no shots Zachary Catch and Release you went on the weak side Sav it on the Applause Baseline yeah bu Bowen has the green light from three by percentage hes the top threepoint shooter on the team gliding to the rim and he couldnt finish frustration after the shot good drive just you know tough finish right there John were at a break neck Pace here as Zachary goes all the way some of the players are winded out there Im looking at the guys yeah theyre a little winded but you got to fight through the L lockin you know reaching for air as well Im grabbing my shorts here over at the broadcast position Watkins tried to spin he poked it away to Hunter active leader in ACC steals that is what he does Hunter could not chisel his way to the rim lock and thought about three pass Yan DBS it off shefin drops it in ys got to be a little more fundamentally sound defensively right there thats two direct drives leading to layups on his part Ian shefflin has battled back spasms for the better part of the Season you saw him prior to the game he had that brace which he wears in pregame hes a warrior he sets the tone for his Clemson team they need him out there yeah then he went out against Kentucky and had 20 rebounds tied the School record Shot clocks up for John once three by Watkins hes very streaky a very capable threepoint shooter going back to that back issue of shefflin once the back gets warmed up uh its easy to go its kind of when you sit down on the bench uh for a little bit thats when it starts to tighten up I was joking with him before the game like you wear that brace just so the other team thinks that youre hurting Dylan Hunter offensive glass after the Miss by Chase talked about in our pregame Sky Ry Keys Florida state has an imposer will right now Clemson looks like theyre putting their brand of basketball onto this game with the offensive rebound and the tough def defense on the other end Watkins who had that three his 135th of his career had it Stripped by locken another turnover right there its not what you want to do against this Clemson team I mean John how many balls have we seen poked Away by the Tigers here in the first half all security is key right here another unselfish play by lock and calculating the angle is he in Shin nice high arced shot right there thats not an easy shot right there over the length of B bowling well take a timea tournament three time ACC coach of the year the last time in 2020 you remember that Co season his team was the number one seed at the ACC tournament because there was no tournament Championship was awarded to Florida State if youre Florida State you have to limit turnovers you have four turnovers they have seven points off that thats been the story of the game and right on Q they throw it away and they had just nine turnovers in the win against Wake Forest battle on the glass Wiggins and its taken in by FSU and dang Davis trying to carve his way great help defense right there so Dell Jones is in there 10 in Orange Fosters in there six in Orange for the substitutions Hunter has the rebound Justin Thomas also into the game number 25 Hunter tries to go around him around the defender got knocked out of bounds how about the challenge for Florida State defensively collapsing it was aier maluk if you are Florida State it is theres no resistance right now defensively Florida state has to put some put up some resistance against his Clipson team see the turnover is right now the issue for Florida State the Morgan Stanley game stats and leave him open Hunter hes 6 feet behind the line trying to utilize his speed the kick Zachary Jones shot loocks at five Jones got it away and hit the shot and that was over Mal just a tough drive you cant give up middle right there unfortunately b b Malo Malo tried to come over there and block that couldnt get to it and when youre jumping like that you cant swing down cuz thats when the refs going to call a foul got to go straight up and just challenge the shot if anyone would know it be the twotime defensive player of the year in the ACC John Henson I will I dont like to say much but I will I say I do know a little bit about defense all ACC performer for North Carolina dang free ball weak side knocked around to Hunter good pass right there by Thomas if there is a weakness in this Clemson defense it is the corner look at the Hustle by Thomas couldnt get it hunter able to come away with it Jones Slams on the brakes Jones Hunter fires away long shots are create long rebounds and uh Florida States got to box out right there guards got to crack back and get those long rebounds off those threes johu Wiggins into the box score for the sophomore from Grayson Georgia he was high school teammates with sheflin and then we had activity in the back court its going the other Andy Enfield and what a job that Brad Brownell has done 20 and5 we talked about the backtoback wins North Carolina and Duke theyre 40 against teams from North Carolina thats never happened before in Clemson history 7771 last Saturday against Duke Clemson finished on a 70 run Duke had won 16 games in a row and then they turned around and beat North Carolina also have a win against Kentucky on on the resume when Kentucky was number four in the nation watch out for the shot clock Wiggins look out Jones trying to he saved it somehow 5050 balls matter in a defensive game like this was not going to be a lot of possessions good defense by Florida State theyve just got to finish this possession zachory determined to get the shot away that is a veteran player right there after his years at Bost College got to keep the ball out of the middle good teams when they get the ball to the middle good things usually happen and thats whats going on right now with the Clemson offense Jaden Zachary had 16 points in the win against North Carolina was six of nine from the floor Mal close range freshman get some valuable experience against a top ACC team coach Hamilton talked about in practice hes got five freshman that hes trying to figure out how to mix in so they can get some experience and continuity in their program yeah maluk the sevenfooter from Baldwin Pennsylvania seeing in his 24th game this season Foster tries a spin seems like clss trying to go at the Young fell right here great defense swalling up another middle Drive might not end well for them trying to beat the clock and its Wiggins who was open for the Jay talked about that got to keep it out of the middle Clemson is killing them right now on that middle Drive finding their open name Thomas Holt is in there as well he has the feet inside and the layup dang no communication right here Zachary couldnt get the shot away fight for the loose ball was Swinton did get the pass off here comes FSU Boston Holtz whistle on the shot Applause fouls on Hunter right here jayen middle Drive nice thats a warm up thats a warm up jump shot right there good on Zachary getting to the middle collapsing the defense and kicking it out yeah the Tigers as a team one of the better shooting teams 47 fifth in the conference its um kind of scary right now state is down now 12 points and Clemson is one of eight from three so they better reain that in quickly or uh Clemson will against start hitting shots Clemson is the second best threepoint shooting team in the league 39 they make about nine per gameon already going deep into his bench right now trying to get some energy and shot making out there the second unit has been playing well to gets the 87th alltime meeting Clemson has won five in a row in the series including earlier this season in Clemson South Carolina you got to look at locking right there he has a mismatch especially when switching one through five Dell Music Jones Hunter elevates and scores another Drive kind of Hesed a little bit mid drive and froze his Defender pulled up for the jumper nice shot by Watkins at the other end score the basket and to the free throw line Jones picks up the foul thats what he does he gets to the line almost 10 times a game he puts pressure on you defensively every single possession test of the NBA draft Waters worked out for a few teams seems to give him a little confidence coming into this season his final season as a Florida State how about Watkins John thats his 177th free throw attempt this season as a 74 free throw shooter that should translate well to the next level being able to draw fouls get to the line the reason why hes scoring 18 points G he only got to the line twice and missed them both against Wake Forest in the comeback win again the NES were down by 16 in the second half against the deakes they create the turnover Justin Thomas tried the scoop deflected by Wiggins fight with the loose ball Watkins lock and tapped it away keep that ball with the seminal this is kind of what Florida State wants to do they want to turn you over and get CLS is on the best twoyear run in program history in this new age of basketball yeah what did he tell you John when we talked him before the game about keeping your core intact thats kind of the pro model what youre going to have to do nowadays youre going to have to keep your core and build around those guys with Savvy vets and maybe a a a really good freshman impact freshman coming in despite the turnover a 2614 lead Tigers had a chunk of about 5 minutes where they went on a 143 run to create this lead on the road against the seminal trying to win their fifth in a row on the road in the ACC B Bowen nowhere to go tries to find some daylight off the glass challenged on the shot slow to get up hes okay but trailing the play good job for State getting up on the shooters John how about this Chase Hunter zero points so far 0 for four from the floor you know down 12 due to turnovers but you know in half the court defense theyre not playing half bad State maluk might have got a piece of the drive by Applause locken Holtz off the glass just bounced out volleyball around hi High breeder got it tough day inside a lot of InNOut shots for Florida State on layups you got to keep attacking those shots will eventually go in they are high percentage shots both teams shooting the ball relatively well 54 for Clemson just around 46 for Florida State Miss from shefflin this game half a Florida State field right now I know the score isnt indicative of it but Florida States playing their game right now B Bowen scraping the the Raptors now hes missed a couple of Threes John his last nine games he been shooting 53 from Beyond The Ark you know law of averages but hes shooting with a lot of confidence and he cant be mad at that Dylan Hunter with three and thats right in front of the ns bench you know Clemson would eventually start hitting those threes and the chef with the steal another three thats what he does games Dylan had a couple of made threepointers in the win against North Carolina in the most recent game for the Tigers that was Monday so theyre well rested they won 8565 and they shot 50 against the tar Hills Florida State right here you need to get a good shot right here kind of stopped the bleeding a little bit Watkins on line too strong John you had mentioned the struggle by the Tigers from three Dylan Hunter heard you obviously listen this is a team they shoot the ball really well theyre eventually going to go in especially when you shoot it so well poor guys shooting 40 are better I mean they made 12 threes against North Carolina on Monday Hyde breeder this is his specialty knocked around to B Bowen the work was done by Justin Thomas up ahead Yan tied up by Hunter held ball situation in the arrow favors the Clemson Tigers do you right there you kind you kind of got to just go to the left he went right into the defender its being a sixyear guy Chase Hunter knows what to do in a POS in a position like that gets his hands on the ball gets his team another possession just two points so far for you and John hes only attempted one shot Clemson has shot the ball nine more times in Florida State right now D the turnovers and offensive rebounds Steel by Thomas even though the seals lost the meeting this season with Clemson Yan had 15 points and 10 boards team was down 18 floor state to W four so theyre not out of it by any stretch of imagination they came back with down 16 with 8 minutes left a wild come back in the Applause game wake force was at the free throw line with a chance to tie at the end of the game cam hildr couldnt convert and that big threepointer by bull Bowen with 15 seconds to go was the difference modest two game winning streak for the nolles Jackson stumbles cant get up you get up its a traveling violation Justin Thomas drops it off oh B Up and Under you in on the offensive glass that pulls off man this you know thats how the quickie crumble some sometimes you have to keep attacking two InNOut layups you cannot be mad at that two good shots by Florida State the laws of gravity not applying on the no Rim shefflin backing down on the Block too strong off the glass for shefflin Watkins good split by the double team and kick out perimeter work to Justin Thomas good job on Clemson to turn that fast break into a Swing Swing in corner three I mean theyre putting on a defensive clinic right now Florida state is just one of eight on threepoint chances Jamir Watkins has the only made threepointer of the game so far for Florida State five on the shot clock Zachary uncorks it B Bowen has the position got to get the ball to the big Feller right now hes got ready for that double team bad ball placement by Thomas right there hes got to throw to the big Fells hand when its out there extended shefin from Hunter and that lead has swelled to 20 look at the Run 22 to7 if youre Florida State you cant let your offense dictate your defense thats what theyre doing right now things arent going well offensively and its its hurting them defensively on their effort and energy R right here hes got to be more aggressive and find a body looked like B Bowen its stepped on the sideline yeah the null struggling as you saw o of their last nine and again 14 points off of turnovers for the Clemson Tigers 10 of them for Florida State in the first half scoring out of 6 minutes almost 6 minutes before the state theyve got to get the ball inside to the big fella since they are double teaming and hes got to make a play or score the ball nice pressure pushing the offense out by fla State W cant give him middle good defense by Him Zachary around the edge shock boock at one not going to get it away John that is what mot state does to you they defend at a high level if they could rebound give Clemson one possession every time I think they can get back into this game the the ball will start to fall for them they will not be shooting 28 for the rest of the game theyve just got to keep plugging away I think coach brell was probably thinking where are your teammates in that instance you got to be yelling shot clock at that point right communication is key especially for older team like Clemson you would think Watkins free throw line old Bowen flying in it ends up with loin theres a lid on the rim right now for Florida State John when you were a player at North Carolina I know it didnt happen very often you run into drops like this how do you recover you get the ball to your best player and you run your favorite play which you know Clemson being had to have older guys thats a favorite play right there to lock in cant finish probably has a little more experience Florida States got 10 new guys they still learning each other as coach Hamilton told us even in February trying to get better Justin Thomas might have been looking for Jackson on the Baseline it did not materialize Yan Watkins steps inside the line another crazy bounce Here Comes B Bowen Watkins show and go gliding by the defender basket for the NOS good basket by Florida State just getting the ball to the hole sometimes thats all you need to see the ball go in get a little more confidence Watkins is their guy that attacks every possession hes got to carry this team offensively until they can figure it out thats your leading scorer just over 18 points per game and thats an easy layup thats a layup line layup from Jones uncharacteristic of this Flow State Defense right there they dont give up layups they block shots and they get Ste so at halftime coach Hamiltons going to have to reset regroup and and tell this team to get back to who they are defensively final 15 seconds the shot clock is off first half has not been up to the Florida state standard threepointer from the corner Justin Thomas he hit two big ones at the end of The W force game to kind of get him back in strike we crank up the second 20 minutes on CW Courtside Saturday Tom wormy along with North Carolina great John Henson foul committed looks like Chase Hunter will be whistled for the foul for the Tigers Davis might have been a little fortunate on that live play kind of threw it blind I sure couldnt see uh to the foul on the back end so fortunate for Florida stay right there another Collision foul against the Tigers this time its locken Davis hasnt played his usual aot of minutes he was kind of limited in practice yesterday so going to be interesting to see if this second half he plays a little more they need him hes really their only true point guard hes got the little brace on the left ankle that black brace Watkins trying to work off the UN screen leaning in and scoring thats what I want to see I want to see Watkins and Yan playing a little twoman game for this Florida State team back down to 15 they need to get a couple stops put a little pressure on Clemson Applause offensively so Watkins now with nine leading scorer Florida State Applause got a mismatch right there locking on Watkins punter had a big first half with a couple of Threes hes got a layup sometimes when you switch one through five which SP state does you do get a little little bit lazy on those switches and and sometimes defending them that was too easy 14 points now for Dylan Hunter and a foul coming up right here Watkins here trying to draw the foul leaning in Nice Shot by him tough shot as well so the NS maintain possession early moments of our second half so glad that youre with us Florida State nine and three on its home floor this season looks like an adjustment Florida States made offensively is more ball screens instead of just that motion offense that usually run watch the shot clock down to three Davis Baseline attacks the rim Collision in midair mind you kind of climbed the ladder a little bit up there thats shefflin whos rolling around in some discomfort hopefully hes okay looked like a growing kick by The Freshman guard and thats exactly what it was I dont know if you can change that call and I dont know if thats the flagrant either so it might just be a common foul cant overturn it well well see what Bert Smith Tommy morresy and Isaac Bennett have to say you got Bert Smith and Isaac Bennett over at the scorer table taking a look at it I mean this is the way to get involved in the play C for dayquon Davis freshman from Baltimore Maryland Tommy Mory is coming over to talk to John Henson while I have a sec lets take a look back at that Mark of a fighter moment brought to you by Melo its Davis against sheflin o could have dunked that right there I dont think he expected to be that high the ref just came over I think theyre checking for contact prior to zeros on the clock I think thats all theyre looking at we can tell you that it was Davis on the drive shefflin remains in the game thats good news for the Tigers Ian shefflin youve heard this a million times before most improved player in the league last year and he has kept up his level of play here in 2025 especially right here looking at the see if the clock is out it looks like the contact was made before the shot clock did expire this might be good for Florida State to stop this momentum by Clemson kind of like a little intermission a little timeout here for both teams as the officials continue to deliberate told you the Tigers have won five in a row in the series but Florida state has won seven of the last nine home games regular contact and its going to be a two shot Applause foul common foul Davis to the free throw line Applause Davis at the free throw line 82 free throw shooter 11th best in the ACC something to kind of look at Clemson is playing looks like a sixman rotation theyre playing with their guys a lot of minutes down the stretch havent seen a whole lot of free throws in this game as well Dylan Hunter has been exceptional pass to lockin What A Catch and jam double fisted Rim Bend locken great pass by Dylan Hunter the number one number one in Clemson history the assist a turnover ratio showing right there nice wraparound pass to a locking did you say number one in school history John number one in school history I mean we mentioned theyve been playing basketball for over a 100 years in Clemson South Carolina amazing what a contribution the hunter Brothers have made to this program sh clock at seven T state would love to see B Bowen get going thats off the side of the backboard for Davis B bow put his point guard in a bad situation close pass they trapped in the corner of the clock running out when we used to play We called that a grenade you dont want to have a grenade at the end of a shot clock no sheflin TR to get past Yuan Yan tried to poke it away this is straight oneonone muscle on muscle shein had it knocked Away by you and got it right back Zachary pulls up bounces off shefin sends it right back out to Hunter doing what he does all ACC having an all ACC type of year with the sore back but hes a warrior knocked away and a fouls coming up against Florida State thats Watkins who picks it up you would think that the way back for Florida state would be get to the free throw line get Watkins going get y going right John we havent said his name a lot on the offensive end and that was kind of our keys for Clipson contain Yuan and Watkins and thats what theyre doing Force bowl b and its the supporting cash to beat you which they have not done a good job of doing that today credit to Clemsons defense and game plan and imagine Chase Hunter scored in double figures 22 times this season John he hasnt scored in the game lockin from Dylan Hunter nice finish good job by lockin just being available down there in the middle when they are switching as an outlet for his teammates B Bowen one one dribble one shot no pass possession Florida State theyve got to rain it in right now now its its a crucial time right now for the seminal if they want to get back into this game theyre just 32 shooting for the game right here just a nice pass B Bowens got to be there put a body on them make it a little more difficult seven footer that close to the rim thats a bucket every single time so locking coming out of the game see if the nolles can chip away with locking out of the lineup Wiggins is in there for the Tigers number seven in Orange they try to dump it low to him shefflin and Wiggins couldnt collaborate but thats because a foul was called looks like he grabbed him on the hip a little bit Wiggins trying to cut and and this Clemson team for for their leading score not to be playing well and up 20 points thats a wrest P for success in March when you can win in different ways against teams like Florida State March was pretty good last year for the Tigers all the way to the regional F final against Alabama up the wins against New Mexico bayor in Arizona they create the steal that was after they had lost in the second round of the ACC tournament to Boston College right Dylan Hunter I mean hes hes showing shades of Chase Hunter today with how hes playing they Loop it into Wiggins Watkins better in that oneonone defending situation dont know if Watkins is a guy Target for a post up down there hes a good good Defender Watkins will have a chance at a threepoint play they had to come from behind win at wake also won here against Notre Dame on February 4th by seven points to stop a four game losing streak Applause right now Florida state is 5 for 18 as a team jir Watkins is 5 for n someones got to come along with Watkins if they want to create another comeback like they did against W forest tigers let it by 17 at halftime 3619 they cough it up Yan has just two points John two field goal attempts Applause Davis Jones right up on him Chandler Applause Jackson Watkins will fire away deep in the shot clock they just couldnt get in the offensive flow John could not that drive you wonder if if Davis is hurting a little bit he didnt look like he had that usual Burst when you and kicked it out to get into the lane and and that allowed Clemson to recover defensively and make Watkins take a tough shot from three driving Jones shefman fought for it with B Bowen Yan and Watkins officials deide its Tiger basketball so Yan and Jackson exit Justin Thomas has come in Malo is in as well again we just mentioned y the two points so far tough break maybe for Florida State a looked like that was off shefin on the rebound Chase Hunter will go to the free throw line on the drive Justin Thomas who just came into the game picks up the foul also credit to chase Hunter for not forcing anything and playing within himself just a you know sixyear guy that understands who he is and what his team is and hopefully getting on the board with this first free throw best free throw shooter in the ACC oh the CW has a brand new dramedy series coming soon called good cop bad cop starring Lon Easter as part of an OD couple sister brother detective team who dont always see eye to eye kind of like me and Henson dont miss the series premiere of good cop gu cop this Wednesday 98 Central right here on the CW okay sorry about that chase Hunter you called me out John you didnt waste any time on that that hurt Im trying to do promos here it was it was immediate too still hes into the box score with that free throw sheflin reaching for the rebound zacher slicing his way comes up short B Bowen owns the board could have maybe hit Wiggins down there on the fast break but you know credit to him trying to get a just a good shot at The Rim theres a little burst from Davis nice burst from Davis theyre going to need him in the second half I think theyre going to play him a lot more and hes you know going to have to play to that coach Hamilton might have asked him can he go uh a little more in the second half and hes a football guy so hes not sitting out unless he can walk we are far from done here in Tallahassee hunter in the paint nowhere to go maluk defending him shot clock down to five for Jones angling to the rim B bone came over turn around Jam Wiggins Wiggins right there with the nice rebound and finish that was all cost by Dell Jones getting into the lane and collapsing the defense and then you dont have your assignment as a Defender and boxing your guy out right here he gets to the Lane collapses the defense now look whos boxing out Wiggins easy dunk for him right there motor States got a try to show some life right here this is a crucial stretch right here where they need to get this lead down to under 15 to have a chance theyre looking at Applause Zachary Jaden Zachary picks up the Music foul so thats going to be a one inone situation for Florida State chance to make up some ground from the free throw line joh we got 13 minutes to go this is good especially for a Florida State who attempts I believe the most free throws in the ACC per game so this could be a way for them to come back slowly with the clock stop putting points on the board Jamir Watkins a senior from Trenton New Jersey played a couple of years at Virginia Commonwealth thought he was part of the Atlantic 10 tournament championship team that went to the NCAA tournament for VCU I remember that team they were really really good time Walkin really good on the glass for Applause Clemson it appears John that the pieces for the Tigers fit really nicely this season yeah you know they kind of kind of echo the sentiments of that Duke team you know coach sh saying they built around their core rather than just recruit guys and uh it seems to be working well Wiggins trying to go over the top maluk knocked it away Wiggins is all of 610 jumped as high as he could maluk still got his hand on that pass thats kind of what Florida state does defensively looked like locken picked up a foul in the process this is a way to to to get back into the game clipon got to get their hands away and stop fouling this is kind of the only way that for is going to be able to come back by getting to the line and uh they seem to be doing that especially their their best guy at getting to the Music Applause line tough tough couple misses by Watkins thats three points left on the board but you need to kind of come back with this big lead by Clemson four of nine from the stripe in the game for Florida State Clemsons only been five times to the line theyre two of Music five D picks up the foul for the sophomore from Rochester New York is first with this Florida State team on the court right now you figure you need to get the ball to Watkins and then have these shooters spread out Clemson just keep doing what you do attacking the paint finding your Shooters Wiggins misses thats Thomas over the top this time were staying at this end of the floor might have to get Yan back in there right now lockin kind of imposing his will on this smaller Florida State lineup especially the Freshman Luke hes a load down there 10 rebounds eight blocks in the last two games Dan guarding the inbounds hes the s for from North Cross Georgia oh man inside locking patience and the dunk bouncy finish by locken right there call those J legs hes got two or three dunks in the game challenging the shot from dang thats going to be a two usually a threepoint guy I have in my notes bold shooter so got to get out there on him look at all those he did a lot of work there John Henson got final exam got to be ready for anything had a triple overtime game last week I I need a lot to talk about hey you know I was waiting to go to work and youre still doing your game at Boston College with the triple OT Wiggins three 40 threepoint shooter on the year when he plays well it increases Clemson ceiling hes a long athlete he is their ex Factor Watkins tough Runner maluk got it Thomas got it back Thomas cant hit it another chance Davis maluk thats five chances on this possession and none of them falling for Florida State and theres the afternoon in a nutshell tough break from maluk you know the hardest thing is a young big is patience and he seemed a little rushed down there Mal hustles back gets the board at this end learning experience from the Fresh we just got to take his time he will learn as time goes by easy layup Applause Thomas just 33 from the floor in the game for Florida State John looks like coach Hamilton is going to another young guy me seems like hes going to get his guys experience in the game that he may think his team you know isnt putting up the fight to come back hunter in traffic got it to Wiggins shock Haw at five for Chase Hunter Chase Hunter looking for a field goal cant find it Wiggins got it Dylan Hunter Dylan hunter three ball money for number two he is playing so well hes looking like Chase Hunter out there his brother today shooting threes running the team Dylan has 17 points Chase has one Dylan hutters got three made threepointers in the game and 17 big ones for the Tigers John right here such an unselfish player hes what the ACC is all about as far as success and making the most your opportunity you know hes telling Dylan keep it rolling keep it going hes seen this before being his brother hes probably seen him play a lot more than anybody in this gym so he knows what hes capable of and deferring as the offensive guy I me thats just winning basketball thats why Clemson is 121 in the ACC on the verge of potentially clining the championship if they can keep it rolling theyre going to use the clock now certainly as we countd down to 9 minutes to go in regulation Foster with a three Applause and then he he put it at the front row yeah I was going to tell Foster to flash and tried to go a high low for shefflin but thats old school we shoot threes nowadays so credit to Clemson for getting that ball to him in the corner Fosters a grad student who just made his fifth career threepointer I watched him in warm his stroke did look good so not surprised at all trying to guard Davis he committed the foul Fosters played in 137 career games John that was his fifth career made threepointer and he had a little conversation with the front row after you know when youre playing sometimes you the three sometimes a fan yells something and when you hit it you turn around and see who said it and let them know there are four freshman on the court right now I think coach Hamilton has decided to give these guys a run try to get them some experience being a 24point game uh so this will be good for uh Florida State you know down the stretch if they can keep their guys their core have these freshman grow well take a look at todays game stats brought to you by Morgan Stanley where old school hard work means bold new thinking who would have thought this prior to the game John yeah two you know Premier players on both teams not scoring at a high clip but you know it is early it is Saturday I mean Malik Yan was coming off his ninth double double of the season with 14 points and 12 boards in the come from behind win at Wake Forest he played 37 minutes in that game and you know coach brell was effusive in his pra for youan when we talked to him and that probably was a key emphasis in practice to contain him and go from there Dylan Hunter had it knocked away fla State tries to run the floor shein runs it down and thats a learning thing right there for the Freshman switon you cant make that pass home run pass on a fast break something that Jaden Zachary did not do coming down to this end as an older guard with a lot of experience Christian NE is in there the Freshman number 11 in garnet and gold hes got nice size can handle it can defend multiple positions Canadian player in the lineup for Florida State tried to shovel it to Swinton and then hi breeder fell it happens coach BR branell said it we talked about it before the game he said look sometimes the shots dont fall theres nothing you can do about it and seems like thats that bug has hit Florida State today at this you know earlier game Davis is at the free throw line Florida state is two of 13 on threepoint shots and the look from coach Hamilton might say it all this afternoon looks like coach brell is not going to call off the dogs he is going to play his guys and uh this is very very Val experience for these freshman as we said before playing a top tier ACC team a top tier team in the country Hunter runs it down slows it down waits for the reinforcements and throws it Applause away Davis need Applause two tough break for the young fella right there like I said the hardest part as a as a young big is is patience and taking your time down there and floor state will learn their young bigs to eventually slow it down a little bit and kind of take a Quee from Yuan who is very patient down low so the Tigers trying to win their sixth in a row in the series and third in a row on the ns home court NE to had it Stripped Away hide breeder on the backside looks like hes going to pick up the foul youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by all stay youre in good hands this was game one of CW Courtside Saturday were going to blackburg for game two brenman and jinsky is standing by Virginia Virginia Tech here its wormy and Henson along with our outstanding production crew on the CW and Ray Sports a little uh little coach Eng gamesmanship right here coach hon was youre not going to call out the dogs Im going to put my big dogs back in so here we go B Bowens coming in Yan Watkins is back some good run by the Freshman though I will say its its always good experience I I for one didnt play a lot my freshman year and games like this where I could get some minutes was valuable in my career coach Hamilton will wrap up year number 23 on the bench fifth winning in head coach in ACC history three times the ACC coach of the year today though Brad brells crew these tigers have come to play Wiggins score in the favor of the Tigers right now they win it itll be nine wins in their last 10 games only loss against Georgia Tech and that was Triple overtime John on February 4th ne2 knocked away Jackson hit the court awkwardly and slow to get up tough for new he cant be discouraged though man he was active he ran the court had a few good plays I like I like what he what he does for Florida state with the length and size with Jackson holding that right foot training staff out to check on Jackson Junior from Memphis Tennessee being helped up by his Applause teammates tough break for Jackson just like just an awkward Landing fall oh need2 steps on it exactly John youre right unfortunately hopefully hes okay Davis stepping into a three tough for Davis with the ankle injury you dont get the right lift and and and things like that when youre shooting a three and I think thats affecting his uh jump shot today unfortunately but credit to him for fighting playing through it yeah Davis is now over four from threepoint real estate shein tries it and owns it shefley came up to the wing with a lot of energy I knew that was going up being a big man that started shooting threes later in my career I I love when I can get a chance to shoot a good three with no pressure shein who averages close to a double double with 12 and a half points and n and a half rebounds second leading rebounder in the ACC and second on the team in scoring behind Chase Hunter shefin now with 12 points right here roll the replace right here getting behind the defender vision shooting the three hes a capable threepoint shooter youve got to keep an eye on him 12 and 12 for shefin means his 10th double double of the season and 22nd of his Music career B Bowen tough sledding for him today finally to get one to go in not indicative of his aggressiveness hes just had a rough day hes played well as of late hes kind of how a cookie crumble sometimes in this lovely sport you and the steel shat lets him go Applause by game two of CW Courtside Saturdays coming up then at 4 Eastern xinity series racing from Daytona start those engines unfortunately the engine started a little late for the NES in this one and its been all tigers and this guy oh he tried to do it again locking in a crowd shefin Rim Bender for shefin just a beautiful Swing Swing just a team thats together man just beautiful basketball right there by Clemson off that offensive rebounds Applause Tigers one here a season ago on the Nolls floor in January 7867 the margin probably going to be a little bit more this time around SE something interesting to think about with the net rating and you know how the ACC is right is that one of the reasons why Clemson still has their foot on the gas right here trying to up the resume in the tournament and the and and statistics for the uh rating you know when they are seated Zachary the Music jumper time out on the court and it has been all tigers coachs its not smiling yet season when they beat Kentucky which was number four at the time John sheflin had 20 rebounds in that game tied the school record and most by a Clemson player since 1999 on the glass and Kentucky has a lot of size and athleticism and thats just toughness by shefin and remember this Clemson team as Watkins scores they lost backtoback games in overtime earlier this season and they lost the triple OT game to Georgia attack you know uh sometimes it takes a a kind of a a loss to open your eyes and realize that you know you can be beaten and I think for Clemson that that was that moment the Georgia Tech loss in triple overtime the nolles had so much promise after they come from behind L against wake this week with Winston Salem North Carolina of course coach Hamiltons from Gaston County Hunter did not get it away its a shock clock violation all right lets take a timeout with two although some of those fans might not agree Clemson fans everybodys getting to see a team that is is going to be a problem in March remember they went to the regional final last year Yan second Applause effort Clemson made its first Elite eight John in 44 years last year that is tough and Im on board with you coach Brownell doesnt get the credit he might deserve for what hes done with the Clemson program sure just you know having the your core stay intact and also building you know with Zachary who has kind of got the impact of you know how Joe Gerard was from Syracuse last year PJ Hall part of that crew too Clemson this program is on the rise amazing 12 and two Chase Hunter hit the floor and hes talking to Tommy morrisy he said look at it he he asked ref to look at it looks like Justin Thoms May shot him a elbow and you know we discussed it every Point matters pit was a 40 in the net ranking and did not make the tournament last year Clemson sitting at 29 these points kind of matter in the scheme of things this might be a little so Wiggins thats thats Yuan little chicken wing right there spicy chicken wing H I dont know I think you have to call that man I thats not a basketball play frustration a little bit oh without without question I will say though maturity and Coach Leonard Hamilton said the word maturity to us when he was referring to the Clemson team so it is a mature group and there was no retaliation from Hunter theres more basketball coming up tomorrow here on the CW The Womens side womens Hoops in the ACC instate Showdown number 23 Florida State on the Road Coral Gables to take on Miami 23rd rake seminal and head coach Brook woff against the U tomorrow 2 pm Eastern 1100 am Pacific its only on the CW with the officials at the scorers table yeah we can do that so this is what this is what the officials are trying to parse out right here here just woo thats close BT Smith Tommy morrisy Isaac Bennett think you may let it go I dont know after review the p is going to be upgraded to a flagrant one file for Unnecessary contact to the Clemson player were going to shoot one free throw to finish our one and one and then were going to shoot two free throws for the FL file and take the ball out of bounds flagrant one U definitely unnecessary by Yan its kind of a frustra play right there excessive and or unnecessary definitely unnecessary those are the key words flagrant 2 the keywords are extreme Andor unnecessary so excessive flagrant one Wiggins on the line looks like theyre taking you and out as well coach Hamilton they may be finished and it gives Hunter a little couple couple chances to get on the board a little bit see the ball go in now games like this you want to play well towards the end so it carries over to the next game so Clemsons got a still two minutes of playing well you dont want to build some bad habits and it carry over to the next game this is important Applause yeah John we were just checking because Wiggins was at the free throw line well I I think he made it because Chase no one went for the rebound so either way the flagrant was called on Florida stayed locking for three now John I understand the talk about the net and trying to improve your standing so weve got less than two minutes to go and youve got the vast majority of the starters still in for the Tigers I I dont know you know um its all kind of on what you want to do as a coach but at the same time you have to make sure your team gets to the tournament and um you know with the ACC not being where it usually is in the past years wins like this and points May matter as you dont have a chance to get a lot of quad one victories the only thing I would hate to see is some sort of injury and it looks like coach is finally bringing his guys in but you definitely dont want to see injury for either team either team especially in a game thats kind of done for so coach brell and the Tigers were up by 17 at halftime its going to push them to 13 two 21 and5 I mean what what are the things about the Tigers John that you like the most as you watch them play well they shoot the three well and then they defend uh they talked about him Coach Hamilton talked about him practice yesterday they show their chest and they hit you every time youre coming into the lane he was trying to get his practice guys to simulate Clemsons physicality and uh he said it was going to be a game where the toughest team mentally and physically was going to win and obviously Clemson showed that to us today and it looks like the Tigers have great support pieces that come off the bench as well yeah having a guy like Wiggins Off the Bench is big can also go small as well play different ways I mean hes shooting pullup threes at 611 thats tough to Applause handle chirping at the crowd a little bit its been quite a day here in Tallahassee final minute tigers are on their way John theyre going to be 21 and 5 13 and2 in the ACC wins against North Carolina Duke and Kentucky in the same season and they started the year 101 in ACC play they tied a School record from the 2023 team as uh B Bowen steps out again as the Old Coach told me the course been the same size for 100 years hes got to kind of be aware of that and the rim and the basketball how about the Kentucky win highest ranked nonconference opponent home win in school history we keep saying attached with Clemson school history this school history that incredible season for the Tigers and now theyre going to win five in a row on the road in the ACC and John you said that hasnt been done for the Tigers in a long time thats not been done since 1987 so another record breaking stat for Clemson seems like weve been saying that all day Jones leans in I mean hes coming off the bench Jones Wiggins this team is is deeper than you might think final seconds are going to tick off here struggle from the floor all game for the Nolls gone 34 and two of 15 on threepointers so they made the huge comeback on the road at way couldnt do it at home against Clemson its finally here todays the day CW comes the exclusive
