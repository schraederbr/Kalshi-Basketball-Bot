how good of a Defender Couture is he was a little late coming off that ball screen but he made up that time to block the shot The Freshman Ryan Archie the first minutes of his career Two to shoot Ryan hoist one up its an airball maai long excellent close out there on defense really good defensive possession it started with Mel potit jumping in on the ball screen and stopping the basketball cin would like to get into some pressing but uh so far they havent been able to extend the defense well see if that goes they Fallen back in into a two3 right now and give it a little Zone look see how the hokes respond to Applause that UNC transfer nickel open three it is short from MJ Collins hes got a long rebound MJ Collins needs to knock some of those down hes such a solid player he handles the ball really takes care of it he defends got to knock down some of those long shots nichel on banked it in offensive rebound you mentioned a couple of those transfers for Tech theres Tyler nichel started his career in North Carolina he is the alltime leading scorer in the history of the Virginia High School league yeah played up in the valley where you hear the the likes of Dell Curry some like Ralph Samson there he is getting to the rim hes Music Applause fou Music first player from East Rockingham High School to play division one yeah I dont know how long East Rockingham has been there but uh back in the day it was uh Elon out in that area but uh but yeah the valley has the Valleys come up with some some players the the lambot brothers from up in that Music area he goes two of two and its the hokes out to a early sixpoint lead we are glad to have you on your Monday night nean news M McCarthy our entire outstanding ACC Network crew college basketball is back cant stop saying it enough ran Archie freshman another another good talented freshman getting a little time for comp State Hunter Couture playing a little point guard for the hokes right now he has shown he can do that throughout his career Music seven to shoot well Teardrop Is Good Toto back benley yeah transfer from Morgan State hes from London Music England long dumps it off well that thats classic attacking this two three Zone ball goes from the wing to the high post to the low post and Cen State collapsed and kept the shot from going Music up that goes off of the hands of ly kid and we talked to Coach young about kid hes very pleased with the development and the strides that hes made over the last couple of years but he really likes the group that he has that can play inside this year yeah they they they have some depth and they they have more depth in size than any other team that that coach young has had since hes been a Virginia Tech Second Chance opportunity Ryan Archie fou now this Tech Team you mentioned the dep I mean M opportunity for tech fans to see tonight all the different pieces and options they have they can go 89 deep yeah not only the fans are seeing it but the coaches are seeing it in under the lights for the first time and looking at all these combinations which ones work which ones dont Applause Music work Archie from Clinton Maryland Donalds all America nominee at gwin Park High School average a little under 20 points per game he goes 0 of two this Tech defense has held Cen state to just Five Points early on here you see that press even after after a missed shot they they can get into that press be interesting to see how the hokes handled that Couture wide open three hes got it I think they handled it just Applause fine broke to press flattened out the defense and kicked it to the trailer coming down the floor a turnover chance to turn defense into offense Collin cant hit from the elbow greig Spurlock a starter on last years copin State team that only returns less than 15 of its production heres Tekken transition nickel his first points a first field goal in a tech uniform and a timeout from Larry Stewart and compin state good steal by Collins that time got out into the fast break 145 hoky lead Midway through the first half were back after Music these Castle Coliseum and what was the first home game for Coach Mike young yeah that first one always means a lot and and I think it meant more to coach Mike young cuz grew up coming to Virginia Tech games and and dreaming of coaching here and Castle probably dreamed of playing here first but well what a way to start your career there you see the series history fifth alltime meeting between compen State Virginia Tech two teams last played in 2020 and were back underway here on this Monday night inside of Castle Coliseum a great turnout on hand okis defense been really good theyan Copeland with the Miss he also transferred from Morgan State with along with Coach Stewart and fact benley the Englishman Jaden young his first minutes throwing it inside of Robbie Baron that was last touched off of Music Baron H weve seen the hokes go to their bench early here in this first half yeah a little little look at the Freshman with Jaden young right there from goldsbury North Carolina out of greensbor day scho played for the winningest coach in the history of North Carolina Freddy Johnson ninepoint Tech lead battle has 10 seconds to work with M benley with three hangs in the air and misses and its Harrison who gets it right back yeah sloppy play by Robbie Baron right there and the layup good to cut the deficit to seven s Harrison hung around got that ball got the ball in the basket one of Coach Youngs pet peeves anything thats sloppy out there he does hes not a fan of and that was Music sloppy padulla with space foul line right block and a layup guard he can really create some offense average 15 points game a year ago Tech forces the turnover its Couture up ahead for padulla nichel Baron the triple look at the hustle from Tyler Music nichel foul on the floor kid pulled down the rebound lots of opportunities on that possession there was a lot of effort a lot of hustle and very little production on that possession Music actually I think padulla on the initial fast break was looking to throw it back to nickel and nickel wasnt in a good position so then he misses the layup and then the chaos ensued Tech now in the bonus was dayquon Copeland kids got got to improve that a 58 free throw shooter a year ago priest Ryan turnaround jumper wont Applause fall that push padulla slows it down nickel wide open Couture padulla yes thats so good Tyler nickel was open penetrated kicked it out quick reversal to badulla at the top of the key really good share in the basketball thatll bring a grin to Mike Youngs face under 10 minutes left in the first Applause half Harrison looking for a screen has 5 Seconds long three on the way well short padulla the close out yeah I compin has had trouble getting good shots they their effort is really good theyre cutting hard nichel there hes it do that that time with a little hand in his face by Copeland didnt bother him at all you cant be the leading scorer in the state of Virginia history high school basketball and not be able to make shots right no doubt about that you mentioned some of the elite company he passed to become the alltime leading score yeah that was just the folks from the valley padulla up ahead through the lob and baron says Ill take the easy layup pulla with a big grad on his face I threw it up two guys could have dunked it nobody did hokes on a 10 run their largest lead of the first half yeah Cs got to work hard down here and get a good shot trying to find a matchup that works s done a good job communicating switching when they had to Ryan with the mismatch Baron brings the crowd to its feet hes got the rejection Brie Ryan had the advantage but Robbie Baron came down and helped out here we go Padulas got the disadvantage But Here Comes his Music help that gets the crowd and the castle guard into it 4 seconds on the shot clock Harrison doesnt realize I it and a shot clock violation I say it didnt look like they knew when they threw it in bounds its one those things again putting all these new players together very few back from last year got some transfers got got some freshman playing significant minutes ma what have you liked about Virginia Techs defense early on well theyre staying between their man and the basket theyre helping each other they seem to really be communicating well Music potit finishes at the rim size Advantage right there took his time love post players that are methodical down there good job again on the ball screen by Music potit going the other way offensive foul got an illegal screen young has always been known for the threepoint shooting offense you see a couple great examples right there the Freshman knocks the bottom out heres a look at the Tor bridge on the campus of Virginia Tech its the opening night of the college basketball season were glad you joined us hoky leading copen State 26 to7 was a double header tonight and the eighth ranked team in the country the defending agency champions te womens basketball took care of business they took care of business in a big way against High Point University and of course there was a celebration before the game with a rings and uh and a banner hung from the final four in Dallas Texas last year first time the Virginia Tech hokey women have been to the final four great crowd on hand for that over 6000 fans inside of Castle Coliseum you see Hunter Couture a little shaken up after that play looks to be all right talked to him before the game back I said Hunter one word to describe how youre feeling right now he looked at me and said ecstatic you know after what he went through last year especially being injured and that kind of thing I know hes excited to be healthy and back out there now coach Mike young talked about in the offseason first time in his career he let a player install a play did you hear about that yeah that was interesting that was interesting you know he wants to be a when his playing Days Are Applause Over 28 to7 hokes Bishop Moore in Orlando great great basketball school a strong take to the rim lay up for Ryan Archie yeah theres that explosion that Applause Music Applause athleticism heres Brandon re Steiner The Freshman point guard backing up Sha padulla is an interesting player he plays really hard hes physically strong um hes a little rambunctious on the offensive end from what Ive seen in practice so far but uh very talented can shoot the basketball itll remind you a little bit of padulla theyre theyre similar I think coach would love to play them together some and have pulla be off the ball with you know hes always had a scoring mentality but free him up over there to play without the basketball in his hands at all times MJ Collins at the foul line he had to play extended minutes in a lot of games last year coach talked about how for MJ Collins that would pay off for him down the road challenged him in the offseason back to be able to defend the opponents best player Applause Music little over 7even minutes to go in this first halfies have been really good against ball screens thats something that usually takes a little while to get the hang of and communication down Hier arching triple Off the Mark Nichols activity level has been really good K through contact no problem again calm didnt rush himself it had been easy to travel right there or turn the ball Music over another cop and state Miss they have struggled four of 19 from the floor the doulas spins it inside pretty pass but a travel first just after I bragged on him Music copin had a couple better looks here let see if they can continue to to get a decent look knock something down its frustrating they they havent let it affect their defense so theyve continued to play really hard on the defensive Applause end T Harrison handling the ball over there those tough Philly guards Philly guards have a reputation you know they oh yeah they theyre theyre you know theyre tough kids always play really hard and he fits right in with that he was injured last year transferred from St Francis PA hasnt played in almost a year that is a back door pass nice idea not executed padulla up ahead long with the layup see what I was saying about MAA along he hes got a great motor nothing spectacular just works all the time he led the Sun Belt in double doubles last year with 11 thats a good basketball conference you see how good he is tenacious on Applause defense and thats banked Music in Priest Ryan The Freshman from Pittsburgh yeah he has that kind of uh ability he he hes gotten into the starting lineup because hes so energ IC off the turnover Ryan lost the handle thatll stay with the Eagles three on one throw it ahead to Long finish through the contact really nice play by the Old Dominion Music transfer long had a double double against Virginia Tech last year in the Charleston classic thats right Music thats still in play long again has that knocked off his leg now itll stay goodle with the there really nice hustle right there by Cameron Sparrow another freshman see all these young kids getting time for Coach Stewart this will be valuable experience by the time they get into the conference schedule Music pick to finish seventh in the Mak heres padulla gets by all the Defenders all the way to the rck hes got the left hand layup thats so good protect the basketball extend with that left Applause hand Sparrow The Freshman long jumper unable to hit that tough shot contested shot right Music there so over four minutes until halftime padulla Rising Fire its short look at that box out and a foul on comp State you can see padulla just kind of fell to the ground Horton maybe got a hand around his neck yeah that was thats tough call right there two guys like two NASCAR guys going for the same spot on the track incidental contact but the foul on cop I Cant Tell You Folks how happy M McCarthy is to get a NASCAR reference in in this broadcast I know you were watching the uh final race yesterday the championship yeah thats right Ryan blay uh whose Uncle played right in this building Dale blay played he was a point guard for West Virginia continued NASCAR reference here whenever you meet M who is his backcourt mate you need to know that back court of blay and Huggins wow two big guards both 65 great tribia with m Music mccarth like benley handed off not a perimeter passing for the Music Eagles PO with his outstretch arms able to force the initial Miss but the tip in there on the second chance good stay in after it again coach Stewarts got him playing hard just really struggling to get the ball in the basket on a consistent basis pulla fires a fast ball Baron drops it off for poti but its stripped by V benley here he is in transition Euro Step and hes fouled trying to go Coast to Coast yeah in fact Bley is hes got some creativity to his game M hoks out to a nice start opening night of the college basketball season were back after these messages went to the transfer portal they made some excellent additions into the off season and M those additions they were coached by some really great coaches yeah its one thing to get good players but if if they dont come in ready to jump into your system it it affects their you know their transition but Jeff Jones at Old Dominion Hubert Davis at North Carolina and obviously Chris Collins all great players but all outstanding coaches so these came these kids all came ready to understand and be Music coached and all of those transfers have made immediate impacts in this first half and there you see some pressure almost a turnover cin soaring high goes flying to the deck yeah four on two like to get that in the basket right there but uh copen was able to get their press set because they finally scored good defensive play right there challenging that shot like Cameron Sparrow got up on that one the Northwestern transfer Robbie Baron skips it inside but nobody there Archie full head of steam itll stay with cop at State we talked about coach Larry Stewart earlier in the broadcast his first game is a head coach one of the best players in program history what he thinks going through his mind on this opening night as a head coach oh I think hes learning a whole lot about this team you know its one thing to practice and see him do it you know against each other but its another thing against live competition with the lights Music on Archie little step back jumper does it fall coach Stewart has learned more tonight about his team than he learned all fall I can assure Applause you eight different Hokies have scored Collins its knocked down and when we talked to Coach Stewart last week I asked him I said well there be any you know emotions on this night returning to Alma moer and he said you know I kind of got that stuff out of the way the first month or so I put that away the all the texts he got the congratulations yeah it was a really popular hire you know we talked a little bit we mentioned the legendary Fang Mitchell who took the team to the in I think he had three four maybe five different NCAA appearances uh but they were winning big when Larry Stewart was a player there but they havent they havent won in a long time had a win hadnt had a winning season since since 2011 havent been back to the NCAA since 2008 and uh he would like to change that sooner the better you got to know coach Fang Mitchell a little bit I did we were we were coaching about the same time he was winning a bunch at copin we winning our share at Chattanooga great personality great personal funny guy very entertaining Storyteller and heck of a basketball coach Harrison finds Ryan and he finishes at The Rim through contact a chance for a threepoint play just a freshman this was a good s for Coach Stewart you can see that this young man has some talent and a and a tremendous upside coach Stewart said when he enrolled in August he has had the same energy from day one all the way up until today yeah and hes got a good Freshman Class you know Spar is in that class rys in that class and Arion Jones khil Horton who started in that class Prescott got a good group of freshman hes that full court press again after a made free Applause throw ma as a coach what is the number one thing you stress to your team when youre being pressed I think to be aggressive you know not you cant be passive you got to you got to want to Music attack kid with an overhead pass Couture padulla catch and shoot Hunter Couture you Music Applause back holding the pose you think about some of the great threepoint Shooters in the history of this program hes going to be right up there at the top I cant see him not getting to the Applause top T to shoot back benley spins it low its turned over hokes can push Collins wont go foul on the floor itll stay here Collins making those shots in practice got to convert him into game and again hes a guy that coach young can count on to to take care of the basketball to play really hard to always play great defense he can defend about any position out there certainly on the perimeter just to get that ball in the basket Music Applause Music some six points and six rebounds in the first half for Lyn kid Music a lot of players on the floor for both sides as Ryan lets it Fly padulla can push it this is where Virginia Tech is dangerous Couture extra pass Collins Mike Youngs teams will always make that extra pass and you inevitably get a high percentage look Applause I mention a great crowd at the womens game earlier and how about the castle guard filled all the way to to we got the bacon they were here they were here at 330 they were here early but every time the doors open they were here everyone excited for basketball season great time of the year Crossover with fall Sports two years ago the men win the ACC Championship the last year the women win the ACC Championship and make it to the final four Ryan in and out foul on the hokes yeah its its been a good twoear stretch for Virginia Tech basketball yeah it really has both both coaches doing doing a good job they do things a lot alike you know they theyre really good on offense but probably a little underrated on the defensive end and theyre very creative offensively both of them love to to have their guys shoot the three great kids in both programs some of their kids even get along out here like Hunter Cure maybe he took that family thing seriously didnt were all a family getting engaged in the off season Miss Chloe Brooks congratulations to them little change up right here cop and go Zone working now work that shot clock as long as they can padulla with four nickel for three two strong shot does get off at the horn but it doesnt fall and thatll do it for the first half the season opener really hard and here we go with a second half underway oi again with a great job on the ball screen little miscommunication right there they left a shooter between padulla and kid but nice execution on the pick and roll by cop and state coping in a little bit of two3 Zone again see if they can slow the Hoke down Okies didnt really shoot the ball well from three just four for 13 Baron the transfer little short from the corner hes got that kind of range will remind you a little bit of basilly from a year ago its so weird to see Virginia Tech play without Justin mutts Mack yeah yeah he was a lasting impression with his athleticism and energy and Music enthusiasm confin States come out of halftime knocked down their first two shots its the Freshman Ryan first there Spar on yeah really nice job and again the you know he sign this recruiting class Lyn kid the twoand flush and then a little miscommunication to play in two three Zone lined up wrong somebody cheated toward their man ly K wide open under the basket compensate off to a better start here on the offensive end though back to back jumpers what do you think the biggest message was for Coach Stewart to his group at the break I think I think just you know keep doing what youre doing we just got to execute a little bit better on the offensive end set screens a little better cut a little harder beautiful pass from padulla and the Finish from link King he have found some holes in that two3 zone kid up to double figures hes got 10 points Winston get its by Baron but a foul Collins came across on the help side I dont know if he didnt get outside the arc or was just a little bit late new rule youve got to be in position before the foot is planted that youre going to Spring off of that is a key rule change glad we brought that up here on the first broadcast of the year it should clean some things Applause up and it should be an advantage really for the offense either youre going to get a foul a blocking foul or the defense is not going to make that effort Justin Winston one of the best players on this copen State team didnt play a ton in the first half only seven minutes yeah he is certainly their best player though the transfer from Robert Morris for red shirt Applause senior kid tried to throw it back out to Collins unsuccessful pass there yeah a little out of control right there here he gets behind the defense nice job by Pulu eyes up and here he is again behind the two3 zone Winston draws the foul on Robbie Baron its two quick fouls in the second half on the Northwestern transfer yeah hes hes had some I dont know if you call him Ticky Tac but hes had some marginal fouls hows that is that the right word from the collegate school in Richmond Virginia great School the Music 804 a stretch Four Strong Defender hes actually reunited his sister Ann Maria is a student at vcom here so Barons are here in Music Applause blackburg little 131 mixing up the Zone a little bit and sort of fall back more into a two3 kind of coverage give you one look and then they then they play it actually is a two3 nice pass out extra pass long in the corner kid and padulla both fighting for the ball that was a good extra pass got a wide open shot maai long can shoot that three shot 36 last year when he AED that double double for Jeff Jones at Old Dominion Applause Music he stepped out of bounds yeah long came in for Baron and did a really nice job defensively that time against Justin Winston hoki leaded by 22 were certainly glad to have you on your Monday night college basketball season back Music underway Collins slashes in pretty take and a great finish Music Applause G priest Ryan kid swats it away padulla dumps it off for long and a foul before the layup nice job by padulla they didnt really have a great Advantage but he waited and waited and waited until long broke open when this Tech Team Gets In transition they are fun to watch yeah got a lot of options people that can finish at The Rim as well as people that can spot up and shoot to three anytime you can get in transition is usually higher percentage shot than playing five on five Music padulla fouled This Time by Harrison number two and malija potit set the check in hes providing a nice spark Off the Bench tonight checks in for Lyn kid whos had a really nice even yeah kids been very active uh same to seems to be a little bit more active than a year ago not that not that he didnt play hard but uh hes playing with a lot of confidence long dumps it off here is poti back outside padulla step back contested three nothing but Nets thats just a big time play defense was right there he backed him off just a touch just enough to get the shot off hes the second player rather the third player tonight for Virginia attack in the double Music Applause figures padulla surveys the floor Couture just short ma long always around the ball Hokies might get a third chance on this possession and they will when we come back well we are C State 5427 theres aai long overhead past Couture back out padulla potit the offensive rebound Collins turns around tough shot in and out Techs getting a lot of good looks in this second half yeah you can see the frustration on Colins face he made a really nice move and the ball did everything but go in Harrison gets by padulla good switch right there good aggressive switch by Applause Collins Toto F benley thats a tough shot and he knocks it down hes got an unusual game you know each shot has been a little bit different hes got some Talent you mentioned earlier he is from London England has 11 siblings wow and wants to be when his playing days are over an author or a Music screenwriter second transferred in from Morgan State alongside dayquan Copeland yeah coach uh coach Stewart got to see them all the time and didnt play for a variety of reasons some injury some just you know stacked up in positions but he was really excited to bring both of them with him to cop and State padulla open pass Couture able to knock it down he does it just so effortlessly was a good play anytime you can penetrate the gap of a Zone and draw two people to you somebodys going to be wide open Shan padulla did that on that possession to cic loses the Applause handle Couture no look pass padulla inside po the exclamation points no reason no reason to run a fancy play when you got sha badulla creating like he did on the last two possessions Pooky lead it by Music Applause 30 Archie the Freshman tough shot itsit the bottom of the net that was really good defense and better offense what have you liked about compens State here in the second half ma again the energy that you know they havent let the fact that shots didnt go in in the first half bother them at all they continue to change defense theyve communicated after after they got the defense straighten out they communicated a little bit better beautiful passing Collins cant Music hit a foul in transition passing has been crisp tonight for the Hoke theyve been very creative with the basketball yeah theyve done a nice job heres the penetration draw the defense Music potit that is a rim Rattler see how the Freshman runs the offense out there Rex ster in the game got a couple freshman out there Jaden young also five players off the bench on the floor for Mike young how big is this smack for a head coach the coaching staff especially early in November cant simulate this you can do whatever you want in practice until youre playing against someone else with the crowd with the lights on with television in the house with the great MC mccarth be in the house okay I mean that wholeheartedly ma Kai long right hand flush almost he finished it that would have been all over Sports Center he is fouled wow takovic contested it 1 you could tell they were on a collision course couldnt you they were going to meet at The Rim at the same time great effort by both guys always a little scary when you when you get up there like that and get knocked to the floor good to see uh for hokei nation that Ma long is up and at Music him one thing coach young mentioned a losing Justin muds and some players in the front Court he said hey were not replacing ing them necessarily with freshman we went out and got experienced players that have a lot of experience three at that spot really with Tyler nichel M long and and obviously Robbie Baron Baron hadnt had the opening night he wanted nichel and long have had pretty good nights for Mike Baron on the bench with three Applause fouls and Rex Steiner one of the top point guards coming out of the state of Georgia long great take but hes rejected at The Rim Ryan will take it himself and lay it in for Music two conversion block shot leading to a layup on the other Music end long back out nickel inside poti is fou again good passing by Virginia Tech quick ball movement reversal and inside hok leading at 6033 against confet State Elijah poti to the foul line when we come Music backov in the happy opening night of the college basketball season thanks for being with us EV Hughes M McCarthy our our entire outstanding ACC Network crew lot of good spots on campus man beautiful campus I know Im a little bit partial but uh there is some great scenery on this campus the duck pond Castle colum drillfield still my fav okay I think its a a good choice you cant go wrong with Music that elel potit was fouled before the break he goes one of two really like the combination tonight of of potit and kid at the five yeah uh you know and depending on matchups you know one night one may be better but uh if they can both play 20 minutes or so and give you great effort theyre both really good players Winston has it knocked away young up ahead to re Steiner The Freshman conne get his first basket and an assist from the other freshman Jaden young another freshman priest Ryan hes into double figures very impressive hes done a little bit of everything hes hes going to be a really good player for Coach Stewart and compin state Rex Steiner hell try a three and knocks it down with a good step to space there behind the top of the Ark they say dont shoot it if you hesitate he hesitated he was just fine wide Music open on the other end right back at a Malik battle the red shirt senior who started his career at South Georgia Tech now here at Cen Applause Music Applause Music States young hell try a three back and forth we go young can shoot the

lighting it up anything you can do I can do better right and both coaches saying guard that guy lets see if theres a three on this possession Rex Steiner off the glass wont fall Music Z Brandon re Steiner was talking with Tech mens basketball Sid Brian Cox who does a great job and he was telling me about the work ethic Brandon Reiner hes a guy of routine he gets up about 435 am every day he looks like it he looks like he he comes from pretty good stock from working out Music right every hokey has scored now and 10 have played tonight for Mike young Applause Squad and a lot of Subs including Hunter Couture and Robbie Baron playing with three personal fouls he comes back Music home and the whole starting five is coming back in duel waiting on Rex St to knock down the free throw with Baron back on the floor his role this year what can he bring to this team from an offensive and defensive perspective Robbie be he he could bring an awful lot hes a really good threepoint shooter he understands how to play hes a good Defender really nice play there again this time Ryan Argie another freshman but Robbie Baron is going to be a key for the for this basketball team and the production from that four spot is going to be really important off the turnover battle is Applause fouled see copin State getting more confident as theyre starting to make some shots now and I I think coach Stewart is going to be pleased with some of what he sees you know the fact that theyve continued to really give great effort theyve continued to share the basketball and be Music Applause unselfish check back for you think about Coach Stewart and we talked about the beginning of the broadcast but all of his accolades you mentioned being an undrafted guy the first to ever be on the all rookie team in the Music NBA and stepen his brother and assistant M Hall of Famer he he talked to us the importance of having a lot of Cen State alums and people who have been around the school on staff yeah you know it it makes a difference that you you understand where youre at Music I think coach young has some of that he didnt go to school here but but he grew up in this area and understands Virginia Tech kid an emphatic flush Cameron Sparrow closing out a great pass too from Applause Music pulum Music Applause Collins as that knocked away might have been fouled on the Baseline but ly kid has had himself a great night 12 points 10 rebounds and this dunk kid with the emphatic flush hoky lead at 7643 hes been so versatile hes been really active I dont know if anybody has improved as much as ly kid since hes been in Virginia Town coach Mike young praising his work ethic his development over the last couple of years after starting his career at Music Clemson nichel has to go into the back court to grab that padulla in the near Corner yes padul wow I mean he a hand in his face 15 points knock down three threepointers and a good pass by MJ Collins along the Baseline reest Ryan had a nice night with 12 points contested three on the other end for Cen state that wont fall from Archie kid kid continues to pad his rebound stats and his points beautiful F and the finish and that was shaan Padulas 10th assist giving him a double double the other way with 12 points and 10 rebounds 10 assist excuse me desan padulla scored in double figures the first 18 games of the season last year first hokei to do that since ACC Player of the Year Eric green Music and a lot of great guards who have played for this program over the years yeah all the way back we mentioned Charlie Thomas earlier and he played with a great one Nam Bobby Stevens couple guys Larry Cook was a was an incredible second round draft pick way back in the day and play with a guy named Dave sensal who was a great player here you go all the way back bimbo Kohls and you going back into the 70s when you got Lloyd King look at you comes Ellis folks hes not reading off anything right now this is just just being old not at all Tyler nickel will pick up the foul that is the 17 Music foul three throws for Justin Winston started his career at St Bonaventure now Hokies will have a few days before they go to Charlotte take on South Carolina Lamont Paris and his second year at South Carolina has accumulated a really talented roster lots of newcomers on that roster be an interesting game down there what a great opportunity for tech fans CU you know Ma there are a lot of hokeys in Charlotte oh yeah for sure we see the women on Thursday night in Charlotte against Caitlyn Collins and Caitlyn Clark Caitlyn Clark and Iowa what a game that is going to be as re Steiner nearly lost the handle Couture with four niichel stops pops and delivers a lot of confidence late in the shot clock nobody rushed nobody panicked knew exactly how much time was left good pass by Couture a midrange pull up thats an air ball and the castle guard will let him know young in transition tried to throw it down but he is fouled tag benley running the Music floor to see our first look at at John Camden tonight attorney from last year after transferring from Memphis hes gotten bigger and stronger in the off Music season the depth really showing at this point for Mike young Squad sometimes you look at a team you think were going to be a little deeper were going to be a little bigger and I really turn out that way you know the depth didnt quite what you thought minutes dont work out quite but this does look like a team where where coach young might be able to play 10 maybe even 11 its hard to play its hard to play 10 or 11 guys we look at the preseason poll in the ACC ma four different teams had a first place vote its going to be a really fun year yeah very interesting you know then Virginia there of course theyve got a couple great players coming back but they only have three players returning for uh you for Tony Bennett which uh you know running that system and the continuity that you need that thats going to be a really interesting team to watch but Duke is certainly loaded again and and theyve got the number one recruiting class in the country for the next year too beautiful drop off pass from Rex Steiner and its maai long with the dunk really nice pass by Rex Steiner drew the defense head his head up Winston the hand in his face doesnt hit the Applause rim Jaden young to his other freshman re Steiner way downtown in and out yeah I dont Im not sure that was the one coach young wanted transition triple that spins out from Archie couple of freshman trading threepointers they attempt Music you can see the the confidence is there from The Freshman oh no question they theyve both had a lot of success John Camden knocks down a triple some coaches dont want you to shoot the ball the first time you touch it John K said I got this i got this so hard to pass up a open look in the corner yeah and he can really shoot the basketball too Oki forced a turnover long will push Rex Steiner beautiful feed young another Virginia Tech triple we told Applause you hoky near the centy mark leading 93 to Music Applause Music 48 youve talked about it Mac every player that has played for Virginia Tech has scored balent scoring effort tonight it makes for a happy locker room Applause two seconds to shoot Archie got it off drills it he can make a shot with somebody all over him he kind of arches his back leans back a little bit Ryan Archie all Metro point guard have wholesale substitutions for Coach Stewart here beautiful bounce pass and transition Sparrow will go to the foul line nice job attacking with numbers and it will take us to our final media timeout of the second half hoky leading here at Music Castle Music for Military Appreciation Night TI off is set for 6m at Castle you want Miss thees for tickets and more information visit H sportscom or the H Sports mobile Music app Music coffin State picked to finish seven yeah its always an interesting league and uh you know inevitably uh youll see somebody appear toward the top that maybe wasnt picked there uh like every other league in America the pundits sometimes get it wrong but Howard is going to be really good Kenny blaty the coach there Music its Cameron Sparrow at the foul line somebody that coach Stewart has said he has coming he has been a sponge as a Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music freshman and for cop in state too you know opening game first game for coach Larry Stewart being on the road in an environment like this Im sure thats a great learn earning opportunity as well itll pay dividends he he can get a lot out of this fi potit aggressive gets it to fall off the window thats very nice took his time created a little contact to give him some space and then use his body to protect against the long B Ling Horton who started Music tonight cic pass intercepted by Young T can turn defense into offense re Steiner gives it to go splashes it home he can drill it he he will remind fans a lot of padulla they do a lot of similar things four hokeys in double figures re Steiner one of Applause them be such a cool moment for freshman when they get to so much work from a ball travel high school you get to play that first college game cant replicate that feeling Im sure and theyve had throw so much thrown at them but Ill tell you one thing that really helped as much is going on that overseas trip that that accelerated the learning process they were all over the place they were beautiful Applause pictures the couch it started his career at Oral Roberts second year at Cen Music Applause Music State Slovenia Applause native Rex Steiner he has been one of the highlights tonight Camden traveled Music hes had a good fall like you said been in that weight room hes gotten a little bigger a little bit stronger than he was a year ago hes always been able to shoot the basketball Rex Steiner fouled by Applause battle compensation zero SC Music Applause Music 18 ma these minutes 90 seconds left gameo in hand like you talked about earlier cant replicate this as important minutes yeah I mean again you you cant do this in practice playing against each other where everybody knows the plays everybody knows intimately about who theyre guarding every single day but uh Id say reiners had a successful evening 10 points in 10 minutes and fixing to add to that its also thrown in three assists for good measure and been pretty good on the defensive end he gets down the stance hes got good quickness hes got a big smile there at the foul line yeah he hes not really hiding his emotions very much he hes a pretty uh hes a pretty energetic enthusiastic basketball player and the crowd loves it pokies 100 points Applause 100 I know he hopes for a whole lot more of those kind of highlights the crowd still engaged with 60 seconds Applause left one minute to play one minute to play and the flush from back benley nice on the ball screen and roll to the rim and that was old textbook old school stuff right there Camden spins steps back tough shot wont fall a great job creating his own shot Applause Music there Id say Mike young thinks this has been a successful evening had a much stiffer test coming up on Friday in Charlotte no doubt neutral sight great venue great chance well be on the radio call we will final possession for copen state battle from way downtown and that will do it Virginia Tech scores 100 points in the season opener as they knock off copen state to 55 the final score two great coaches meetting
