win both games at the buzzer and missed both gamewinning shots Jim larranega finalist for the naysmith Hall of Fame for the first time Leonard Hamilton a repeat finalist 1300 plus career wins between the two with a tremendous amount of respect between these two coaches officials TV Ted Valentine Jamie lucky and Clarence Armstrong at Florida State controls the tip a Seminoles team that started the year one and nine they had a disastrous nonconference theyve had some injuries had some absences as Darren Green knocks down the jumper theyve settled down in conference play in fact theyre 54 in the ACC only a game behind Miami in the standings they absolutely have settled down and theyve been able to do it playing guys more minutes than coach ham is accustomed to doing so Jordan Miller able to draw the foul on cam Corin down low this Miami team coming off a tough road loss at Duke theyve dropped three straight off the road and something to watch as Isaiah Wong he has been under the weather battling a sinus issue coach laronega telling us to shoot around hes had some difficulty breathing he plays 30 plus minutes per game and thatll be something to watch Ive got a chance to talk is a pregame and he simply just said I have to breathe through my mouth Im not used to having to do this but at the same time he wants to make sure he gets it has a strong performance today he said he does feel better than he has in the past two games not 100 percent but hes going to be aggressive here tonight starting lineups for Florida State Matthew Cleveland is the teams top scorer in League Play Green a sniper and corn The Freshman who picked up the foul playing with more confidence of late Caleb Mills swimming under cant get it and North Shadow Meer with the rebound actual pack is shot at Wells late 50 from three over his last four Wong just three of his last 16 thats the last two games of omir averaging his DoubleDouble working down low on the Freshman two strong Miller had the rebound go off his hands Applause comes Cleveland Worley just settled down to the point guard roll and goes to the left hand for two and part of whats different for Florida State Worley again getting more comfortable as that starting point guard yeah Jalen Worley didnt wasnt the starting point guard to begin the season Cameron Fletcher was in the starting lineup and they really played Kayla Mills at the Run as William Hopper steps up and knocks down the midrange jumper but now after the injury to camera Fletcher worthy takes over at the point as you mentioned hes becoming much more comfortable in that role and he fits the bill of what Leonard Hamilton likes that big point guard at 66 Here Comes Mills the runner two strong Poplar there for the board and you talk about the size the agenda Nega told me pregame simply said that this is probably the smallest Florida State lineup that hes played against as Nigel pack the smallest guy on the floor steps up and knocks down a huge three and he was 13 of his last 26 from three hit four over the weekend in the loss against Duke Applause and you talk about settling into that point guard roll pack has been doing that of late and was an adjustment for him according to his head coach he was more of an offball guy at KState but a lot of that because he shoots the basketball so well good opportunity to see Nigel back and again the confidence that you have to have in transition to pull up from about 25 feet and knocked down the three ball right in front of the posing teams bench the Nigel pack does not lack confidence in any way whatsoever First Team all Big 12 at KState last year Applause heres Wong guarded by Worley now picked up by Mills right now this is a possession where you would normally see Isaiah Wong being super aggressive trying to get to the basket with his second to three Wagga Poplar sophomore who has started every game this year after coming off the bench a season ago and he really does a lot more on this end of the floor defensively where he normally makes his impact green with the block and then a foul at the back end there is one of Poplar to your point he had six steals in a game against Georgia Tech earlier this month and Pablo after knocking down two threes early in this game is doing it but he continues to do all season long for Jim larenega getting out in the passing Lane trying to turn defense into offense but even though he doesnt finish Isaiah wall gets an opportunity at the free throw line to put two points on the board and then hes talking to coach ham pregame he simply said that normally when he plays against Miami and coaches against Jim Lehr hes concerned about their offense but today its been about their defense he says they really get after you they really guard you hes been impressed with what the Kings do on the defensive end of the floor shut down its an 80 run for Miami Cleveland the Fall Away not there tipped out to Wong FSU getting back Poplar catching shoot rebound Miller pack from the outside and that goes another three for Miami that is four threepointers early and an 110 hurricanes run needless to say the canes are comfortable in Tallahassee theyve been spent a couple days here and got acclimated to their time from Miami and theyve got a 144 lead two of those threes made by Nigel back early popular getting involved in the mix as well as Miami very comfortable here in Tallahassee why is that Corey well its a little bit based upon their travel schedule in the East to you instead of going back to Sunny South Florida on Saturday after their performance at Duke a noon game they stay in Durham and then on Sunday they fly to Tallahassee they have this off day on Sunday they stick around they practice Monday and prepare for their game on Tuesday unconventional yet for a rivalry game against a team that youve lost to nine straight times sometimes you got to get out of conventional ways to do something different what does that tell you this game means a little more Corey with Florida State after that one in nine start whats different about this team has constructed right now well one of the major differences is you mentioned earlier Jalen Worley at the point guard position I believe has settled them down they dont turn the basketball over as much as Nigel paclines have been knocked down a third threepointer here to start the game and hes cooking with hot sauce early thank you Applause heres grain he can hit it up clear the other way ahead of the pack Nifty move to the bucket very nice finish for Wilco popular and you know one of the things that Leonard Hamilton talked to us about pregame was the fact that they could not allow Miami to want this game more than they did but early 194 it looks like Miami has a little more motivation than do the nose were only looking inside for corn its not there instead Court screws to the rim and lays it in now Leonard Hamiltons words were they dont want to wake up tomorrow open the paper and see that theyve lost 10 in a roadoffs absolutely and you know nobody opens the paper anymore but heres the thing Florida state had the same type of advantage over Florida earlier in the year they had a seven game win streak against the Florida Gators playing on this same floor up 19 points in the first half allowed the Gators to come back and beat them and so this team may not quite understand the Rivalry that Miami does right now but simply because you have a lot less experience in this Florida State uniform for the guys in the personnel the foul on Cleveland and entering the game the highly touted freshman from Mallorca Spain 11 in white Baba Miller just his fourth game of the season suspended the first 16 and missed his second game back with tonsillitis says omir works the inside that was the Sun Belt Conference Player of the Year a season ago with Arkansas State and North adamir is making a big time impression for Jim lerneria who loves him from Nicaragua lost it on the way up here catching the basketball in the post area undersized but yet has great footwork the pump fake gets the shot blockers in the air and gets the easy bucket and Miami has not had a guy like that the last few years they have not of course have played with Sam wardenberger a season ago whos completely opposite of Ramirez Matthew Cleveland steps up and knocks down to three ball where hes much improved this season much needed for Florida State and now the Seminoles pick up Miami full court thats been a challenge for Leonard Hamilton with the injuries and the younger players he hasnt had the ability to play the way he wants to press Applause sub a lot of guys in omir fights for the rebound wins the battle Poplar from the corner and he hits that is the influence of omir you see a great offensive rebound and more importantly knowing he is undersized in the post keeping his head up finding his Shooters on the perimeter omearas had at least 13 rebounds three straight games Miller contested too much Annie looking to push wand Catch and Release got it whatever Jim larenega did to change the schedule it has worked thus far for the Hurricanes who seem super comfortable here in a place where they havent won in five seasons Miller thought about it theres green contested three and itll be Miami ball all hurricanes 279 Keynes are six of eight from threepoint range early on and this is a very good shooting Miami Hurricanes team and you know we talked about you know Jim larenega and the way that they play will be four guards on the floor Jordan Miller at six foot seven is a guard and capable of making plays off the bouncer shooting as well they spread you out and put the pressure on your defense in handling the basketball extremely well eight assists zero turnovers make that nine thats Off the Bench Bensley Joseph finding the cutter Anthony Walker but one of the things about Miami everyone knows their role Bensley Joseph knows his role is to come in and make plays as well as the defensive side of the floor Florida state turns it over also checking in for Miami Harlan Beverly five and green in two of the last four games both wins for Miami BC and Syracuse hes been the best player on the floor he absolutely has been that and not only because of what hes done offensively but what he does defensively as well but when you look at the Kings theyre sharing the basketball extremely well building a 20point lead early on the road meanwhile Florida State four field goals and four turnovers Music Tammy gives it up here comes Cleveland accelerates sand swoops in and hes one of the things thats going to be the Telltale sign as to whos able to get the win here tonight is going to be points off of turnovers turnovers Force theres important factor for both of these teams thats the first opportunity for Florida State to get an easy bucket off of their defense Jordan Miller drops it off Walker shot blocked by Bob Miller States defense ramping it up with Miami last year Florida State and Miami played twice both games came down to the wire both games decided by a single point in the first meeting Raekwon Evans at the deciding free throws Isaiah Wong had a chance at the end did not come close second game which was 11 days later in Coral Gables Florida State jumped out to a 26 point lead Miami roared back had a chance to win it at the end it was Isaiah Wong one more time however the canes could not complete the comeback and Florida State would extend its win streak against Miami to nine games theres Wongs game winner that fell a little short 6160 and you dont have to keep saying it but this is a rivalry its a game that matters Leonard Hamilton knows that his team has been the dominant team the last four or five years and Jim larenaga said its important to get a win thats why they got to Tallahassee early it absolutely is that Anisha I had opportunity to do both those games a year ago those bump Point losses as we see the shot clock getting down to five Applause and Miller beats the shot clock with a three Miami seven of nine from Deep well be talking about those two games for everything that Miami did a year ago Elite eight it still bothers Jim larenegger that he lost both those games to Florida State even again this that shows you the level of rivalry this is and there is additional fuel to the fire from the fact that Leonard Hamilton was a coach at University of Miami hes in the UF Hall of Fame as nahee McLeod a seven foot four big guy gets the basket inside and now theres a different Dynamic here too Florida state with its 713 record theyre a much better team right now than the record indicates but again when you look at net rankings and tournament resume if you lose to Florida State now as Pittsburgh found out over the weekend that digs your resume pretty hard its fair or not it absolutely does just that but when you consider the fact that mahim McLeod Has Come Off the Bench and had an impact early in this game but would you consider the fact thats something that no one has ever talked about Florida State especially coming to the top and saying thats a bad loss to be able to come and lose in this building where theyre 529 over the pass you know five plus seasons and ACC play so hard to imagine this being a bad loss Beverly through some rush hour traffic 3415 Miami with a 19 point lead Chandler Jackson The Freshman guard in there for Florida State green still looking for his first threepoint field goal set a few of them try to the Lane and tested its a byproduct of the fact that hes already knocked down three threes in this game you got to contest him way out beyond the threepoint Arc giving those driving lanes and because Miami shooting is so well everyone from Florida State hesitant to help games at 65 from the Field Cleveland green lights of three in and out McLeod knocks it back chased down by Miller be working quickly Beverly on the drive Miller got his hands on here comes Miller in transition against the smaller pack and using that Euro Step through two but that just shows you a small bit of the skill level that Baba Miller has and why Leonard Hamilton is so excited about getting him back into the lineup after serving that 16game suspension he was six foot two and a guard at age 14 and then at age 18 he was six foot eleven and he has a lot of the skills that you see in a guard back hes feeling it his fourth three hes got 14 in the first half five of six from the field but the degree of difficulty for that three shooting it over the seven foot four McLeod makes it even bigger theres green to answer and thats in and out you know the one thing he needs right now for Florida State they cant get caught up in trying to get them back everything on one shot Joseph the Thrive lost it a cloud comes away with it Jackson whos given Florida State some nice minutes the last two games careerhigh eight points against Pittsburgh and we get a foul its offensively Joseph his first Music that is just the first team foul on Miami right now at least there is no 22point play so Florida State just has to try to find a way to chip away at this lead but its going to start on the defensive end of the floor you mentioned earlier coach ham told us hey Im more concerned about their defense than I am the offense well that is Switched here early in this game because Miamis offense has been firing on all cylinders Miami cant miss Florida State looking for an answer Music Cleveland contested and hits turning into his level player hes played his best ball here in ACC play this season he absolutely has done just that and really became more of the leader of this team once camera Fletcher was injured in the Virginia game continues to get better and better Beverly is feeling good about himself today you talked about the fact that he has up and down days and right now today is up he is on the load Management program hes got a back injury it still flares up but hes been a big time contributor and two of Miamis wins recently Boston College and Syracuse Mills back in there Ducks under Beverly and we get a whistle 97 Eastern in the 90s Gino Pat you saw some of the great names there Candace Parker Rebecca Lobo Diana Taurasi elevated the whole Sport and those two coaches fire brands in their Heyday absolutely and in my opinion two of the four coaches on the Mount Rushmore of college basketball you consider of course the great Pat Summit Geno ariemma alongside Mike shasheski and John Wooden in my opinion those are the four greatest to ever grace a sideline in college basketball Corey for once I actually agree with you I need to change my list now Beverly denied at The Rim Applause youre only getting a pick from McLeod theres the roll he missed the dunk but gets the foul Applause Nigel pack finding Beverly who finished the dunk off earlier that time Florida State waiting on McLeod as well as Cleveland there for the block shot in the niche one of the things that we have to remember and Im sure this is something that Leonard Hamilton will remind his team of a year ago the second time they played in Miami Florida State got out to a 4319 lead in the first half Miami stormed back in the second half of that game ended up falling by one point to that one so again even though there is a sizeable lead here in this first half the nose are not out of this game and McLeod whose minutes have been down of late with Cam corn getting more playing time has been productive Off the Bench for Florida State today Jim larenegger talked to us about that pregame he said hey normally this is a huge Florida State team theyre rolling out seven footer half percent this is somewhat of an average size Florida State team hes playing more skilled guys than he has in the past in comparison to the size Joseph had a traveling call and Isaiah Wong getting ready to check in and theres another luxury for Jim laronega right now with the big lead you dont have to exhaust Isaiah Wong whos battling that sinus issue which is affecting his breathing and one of the things of course Jim Leonard let us know early is the fact that hes going to stagger his minutes to try to get him shorter stints on the floor to give him that opportunity to be able to rest and not tax his body when he cant breathe as well on the floor Wugga Poplar back in there for Miami as well heres green just one of five so far make it one of six and without a field goal from deep and youre talking about a guy who has three games this season where hes made five or more threepoint field goals so green one of the best Shooters at 42 percent in ACC from Beyond the threepoint Arc he has 14 games in his career with at least five threes he can shoot you back into a game quick omir down low no and the rebound to Green the UCF transfer down low and there is McLeod whos been a bright spot in this first half thats been otherwise forgettable for Florida State he absolutely has been that in the game again at 19 starting to become a little more manageable Florida State wants to continue this momentum headed into the halftime locker room Naim McLeod making a difference on both ends of floor contesting the dunk opportunity for omir and then running the floor at seven foot four out running everyone else and getting the Finish you know hes not even the tallest guy in his family dad is 75 so hes got dad calls a little fella little fella that time he cant hit hes got 10 points thats his high in ACC play Mills going around the back driving inside too strong pop through the rebound Jordan Miller and cam corn getting ready to check in pack was fouled on the drive Music Caleb Mills picks up the foul thats his first Mills was a little frustrated that he didnt get the call on the other end of the floor sprinted back still trying to make it play gets the contact on Nigel pack who has had a spectacular first half in his first taste of this rival we have to remember that many of these guys have played this rivalry before but Nigel back this is his first time being a part of it Pax got 15 to lead all scorers hes been playing his best ball as a hurricane of late Jim laronega said the big adjustment for him it wasnt as much being the primary ball handler and point guard it was also defending the other teams primary ball handler that takes a lot out of you its taken him a half season to adjust it really has that and of course hes a smaller point guard as Daniel Warner gets in the basket but no result comes away with a mislayup on that possession and a crucial point of the game where you need every possible basket omear almost traveled long from the outside to strong offensive rebound omir and the soft touch in the paint and thats a fourpoint swing you miss it lay up with one end of the floor give up offensive rebound and allowing omir to get this second chance points the rebounding Advantage 165 for Miami Mills left and off balance Music the fact that Mills went back to the well though in comparison to pounding about the fact of the last one he attacks once again and gets the bucket 15 second to chance points for Miami a long three thats off the mark Wong battling for the rebound Another Second Chance opportunity for Miami Denise at this point we would have to say that Miami has wanted more as long attacks the rim drops it off to Amir for the Finish Miami has wanted and more for the first 16 and a half minutes of this game 170 Second Chance Point Advantage as corn misses on the three and right now Florida State just not in any kind of offensive Rhythm Miami mean while making the extra pass its not just that the shots are going in theyre getting Great Looks theyre getting great looks and theyre winning to all the 5050 balls all the hustle plays have gone in favor of the game oh mere great position and Taps it in Another Second Chance bucket for the canes you talked about Amir and his double doubles and he may be a guy that ends up with a double double here in the first half continuing to pad his own stats hes had three double doubles in the last four games Florida State meanwhile does not even have an offensive rebound Miamis got seven heres green and still cant find the range Poplar down low drops it off to Miller posting up Mills kicks it back out to Wong hell line up the three and knock it down Isaiah Wongs got eight its a 28point Advantage for Miami and this really difficult to defend any team that is making the threepointer at this level 52 points for Miami right now is a season High giving up in the first half for Florida State this season theres corn with the crush and 52 points theyve made it look so easy yeah I had a game on Saturday where neither team went above 52 Clemson beat Virginia Tech 5150 right now Miami making it look easy on the offensive end of the floor 52 already and they have are showing no slides or slowing down Mir lost it and Adam back to Florida State Clark 52 go in this first half Florida States nine game win streak against Miami in serious Jeopardy relapsing the ACC boys he doing some work on the glass tonight and hes also probably the smallest big man in the ACC so it shows the level of heart effort and determination that he plays with eight points five rebounds already in this game you get an opportunity to look at his last five games the double doubles outside of the one point away from duke it would be four double doubles in a row but he has been dominant for the kings in the painted area he gets a little bit of a breather here eight points five rebounds and a couple of really nice assists yeah and a lot of those assists coming off of offensive rebounds and of course everyone gathering around him keeping his head up finding his teammates on the perimeter knocking down the threes the Kanes building a 26 point lead still 152 remaining here in this first half Florida state has to find a way to get something positive going into the halftime locker room Mills finding Miller Miller dumps it inside to Corn back out Miller rainbow three no corn flew in too quickly and now Wongs got the rebound Applause Anthony Walker cutting to the rim and draws the foul thats not a made basket but again it was great passing great look and it results in two shots and it was all done by a guy who was playing great basketball you look at Jordan Miller dropping the dime in the painted area sharing numbers that have only been experienced over the last three seasons by ACC Player of the Year winners when you look at his impact on Miami how would you qualify what he means to this team I believe Isaiah Wong is their best player but I believe that Jordan Miller is their most important player and the reason why hes their most important player because at the fourth position he is a guard a six for seven guard whos a very good rebounder very good passer hes scoring over 15 points per game and more importantly hes defending guys much larger than him on the other end he can defend four sometimes five positions on the court Green Oh for six from deep in the first half and we get a foul its against Poplar and one of the things you have to appreciate about the canes and these is the fact that even though theyve built this huge lead theyre not resting on their balls and stopping to defend they are still getting after defensively the same way they were to start this game and again thats a byproduct of the way Jim larenegger coaches his teams and more importantly knowing that theyre all of their last nine against this team this is an important game Florida state has not had the threepoint shot today just one of 11 they were 10 for 20 over the weekend in the win against Pitt did a lot of the damage in that game in the second half Miller the runner a little Visine there and its 5228 I just want you to know that I appreciate you for calling that a runner and not a floater and being lazy as we see oftentimes in your position so again you know I work with you long enough youre starting to learn a couple things youre starting to wear off on you a bit I almost called it a floater did because you want you want to argue you dont want me to compliment you and tell you that youve learned anything you caught me off guard I said what is this a compliment from Corey come on what year is this 5428 final 10 seconds opening half orally on the drive throws it up with one hand tipped against the Glass Long the rebound pack lets it Fly its good if it goes and off the backboard that was his first Miss from three dont count it in the first 20 minutes I know it pains you it doesnt count it 16 points for Nigel pack Miami shot 61 percent in the first half nine of 14 from three Keynes trying to show a gym there reminded his team of that at halftime to make sure they continue to keep their foot on the gas pedal that was a one point loss for Miami last year both games a season ago decided by a point in this rivalry Miamis got the ball first to begin the second half pack 16 points to lead all scores welcome Poplar had 10 and Miami turns it over on its initial possession and thats something that Miami did not do for the majority of the first half it took them probably about 10 to 15 minutes of game action to have their first turnover Cleveland posting up the smaller pack missed the shot and it goes back to Miami and Denise is a small thing but on the first possession that bucket would have gone a long way for Florida State you know just coming out of halftime locker room after that speech from coach ham if you get that one to go down it changes the way you think about this game Isaiah Wong eight points and 16 minutes in that first half pack turns it over up ahead Here Comes corn ahead of the pack and fouled from behind by omir his second like the chase down by omir to not allow cam corn to see the basketball go through the basket corn does not have a field goal yet in this game forgive him he does have one but at the same time you dont want to see guys get easy looks make them earn it at the free throw line but two backtoback possessions where it ended a turnover for Miami to start the second half corn is someone thrown into the fire going into the season he was their third option at the five you had Jalen Gainey twotime ivy league defensive player of the year the transfer from Brown hes out for the season he had Camp Fletcher who was their top rebounder hes out for the season so coren almost by default has started to play major minutes and again theres some being a Freshman being green theres a little bit of a learning curve but hes had his moments played well earlier this month against Virginia absolutely was ACC rookie of the week after getting a careerhigh 18 points against Notre Dame in their first matchup so hes shown some flashes but the inexperience throughout the lineup not just for corn but throughout the entire lineup for Florida state has been part of their demise throughout the season Applause Poplar beats the shot clock I dont know if youre a baseball guy but theres an old story you do know that Im a baseball guy Paul Wayner Hall of Famer toward the end of his career hes in his 40s hes playing outfield for the Yankees and a fan yells at him why are you out there and his response was because Joe DiMaggio is in the Army cam corins out there because Gainey and Fletcher is hurt and theres really no other option right now I mean somebodys got to keep the seat warm right somebodys got to be there to play until you know of course Joe DiMaggio gets back same thing here but cam corn is gaining valuable experience right now and hes going to be a goddess much better for this Florida State team in the future as the Knowles have now forced three turnovers here to start the second half and corn is able to finish this one off points off the turnovers and three turnovers already for a Miami compared to zero for Florida State to start the second half is that human nature kicking in big lead you rest on your laurels the other team remembers its a rivalry game Wong puts up a three his third three of the game and hes got 11 and one thing for certain Miami did not cool off from the shooting standpoint at halftime locker room they havent handled the basketball as well but the shooting is still there Wong the previous two games just three of 16 football movement Mills puts it on the floor swivels through the defense and finishes tensley Joseph Anthony Walker now at the scores table ready to check in Jim larenegger is not liking whats going on with his defense here to start the second half and you talked about resting on your laurels making sure they continue to play with the same Pace they did in the first half Poplar bobbles the pass air ball Here Comes Cleveland Knowles looking to push Poplar staying with Cleveland and they whistle like a poplar for his second foul Jim larenegger having a conversation with North adamir coming off the floor and wanting for Bill Courtney assistant coach to have a conversation with them and allow them to know why he was coming out of the game making sure that the whatever the mistake was gets corrected Cleveland driving to the hole another foul against Miami Music and one of the things when you look at the conversation between Bill Courtney and nor Chad omear on the sideline you know what the mistake was made based upon the fact that you know Miami is one of the very few staffs to have coordinators so when you look at their staff and you say Bill Courtney is the offensive coordinator so it was an offensive mistake that when you see you when the guys coming over and talking to a certain coach the office whether the offensive mistake or defensive mistake or a scouting mistake youre always able to tell simply because coach L has a coordinator system on his staff so essentially you know whos fault it is you know you know where they messed up lets just say that Here Comes Wong splitting the defense and able to draw the foul last foul against Miami by the way was on Anthony Walker Garen green picks up his second Isaiah Wong whos been one of the best of the ACC attacking the basket his entire career at the U and hes one of those guys as a scorer he gets to the line often and takes advantage of those opportunities normally when he gets there of late hes been up and down part of that is due to an illness but in three of the last five games hes been held below 10 points just four of 27 shooting in those games and Miamis one and two in those games hes the eye of the hurricane he absolutely is that Jim lehranaga made it very clear to us we cannot win big games especially on the road without Isaiah Wong being productive and he has been that here this evening Marine is not found the stroke today hes someone a Florida State can get him going he has a chance to make it interesting he can shoot you back into the game but Miami making it look too easy on the offensive end with Anthony Walker and outside of the turnovers to start this second half Florida state has not been able to defend Miami and thats been a problem getting out in transition Anthony Walker just sneaking behind the defense Nigel pack with the presence of mind to throw over only his teammate can get it Walkers able to finish it off through the contact and opportunity for the M1 second foul on Worley free throw no good Applause Clevelands got eight three on the way by Worley no tapped back out Mills tracks it down that may be Florida States first offensive rebound of the game Mills inside and draws the foul asserted effort by Florida State to attack the rim in the second half absolutely well the threepointer was not falling for them in the first half so you see they had that intent on getting to the rim and more importantly getting to the free throw line they make free throws it allows them to set up that full court pressure which Leonard Hamilton has dialed back a lot this year because they dont have the depth but in order to get back into this game you know down 28 here in the second half theyre going to have to find a way to speed up Miami and turn them over following our game we take you over to ESPN another ACC Clash tonight at nine oclock Armando baycat and North Carolina last years National runnerup taking on Syracuse good post match up baycott and to Jesse Edwards Joe Gerard coming off a big game for the orange and it seems Carolina when they play through their big guy when they play through Armando Bangkok they can beat anybody but they are not a good team away from the dean E Smith Center Hubert Davis has said that has nothing to do with it but the proof is in the pudding it shows up that North Carolina has not been great on the road and its always difficult to play at the Dome omir gives it up Mills Baseline cant get it to go omear snatches the rebound another one of those missed opportunities for the no Joseph inside to Miller and thats too easy another fourpoint swing we talked about that we saw it in the first half multiple times you miss an easy layup and Miami comes down on the other end and scores and at some point Florida state is going to have to stop the bleeding and get some stops four and down low over Omar University omir down low and able to draw the foul its on Worley the hurricanes have been able to get out into transition sharing the basketball continue to share the sugar Anish you have to love it Bensley Joseph attacking the basket dropping it off Jordan Miller the easy bucket leading Florida State 6539 how do you like SEC Big Ten challenge Big 12 challenge at this juncture of the season I love it why the reason I love it is because now youre seeing teams for who they really are when you have the challenges in November early December teams have not really become who theyre going theyre telling me teams evolve and get better you know what Im actually going to say that Im going to go out on them and say teams do get a do a ball They do change they do get better as or get worse is that reflected in the uh net rankings um it should asking for a friend it should be reflected in the net rankings but I dont know that it is and you see teams get the conference Play constantly and either take off or start playing worse because of the familiarity of the opponent we look at UConn UConn Who got off to a great nonconference start then they lose like five or six games in Big East play because their opponents know them doesnt mean theyre not a good team but their opponents know who they are and what they do Clevelands strong to the tip Im still trying to figure out and I dont know if its still true as of today but it was true a day or two ago how Virginia Tech was higher in the net rankings than Clemson because Virginia Tech had a great nonconference they only have one loss and knockoffice play as Bensley Joseph tries to thread the needle and thats the reason why Clemson had a number of tough losses losing to Loyola et cetera in nonconference play but in my opinion I think that conference play should be weighted heavier throughout the country not just in the ACC but for every conference it should be weighted heavier than the noncompetent Clemson also beat Virginia Tech and Blacksburg for what its worth well theyve actually swept them for the first time right in in the since uh Virginia Tech has been to accs Caleb Mills is able to knock down the three which has been rare for the Seminoles here tonight only their second made three Florida state two out of 15 from Deep ER got off to a fast start Donald Miller in there with that Long Reach Poplar drives on Miller might have got a piece of the shot from behind it will stay with Miami but another Second Chance opportunity for the Hurricanes North Channel mirror involved in the mix continues to be aggressive attacking the offensive glass Harlan Beverly back into the game and nearly stolen away by Cleveland last touch though off Isaiah walk a great job by Matthew Cleveland getting out into the passing Lane everybody Worley drops it off Cleveland could not get it past omir who sealed up the paint Music another missed opportunity for the canes does Miami take advantage of it here looks like they will beer draws the foul you talk about the fourpoint swings another one and has continued to happen in this game and it starts with Florida State not being able to set their defense because theyre missing layups and again no one on the team expecting for the layup to be missed Florida States a team that picks up 94 feet so guys are up expecting to be able to try to find their man in comparison to getting back defensively off of what should have been an easy finish how many shots now is that at The Rim that Florida state has not converted I would definitely say we have to use both hands to do it its more than five so we it again still counting on fingers I know you and your Syracuse degree you have to do that so communication major Hey Hey listen you and I go way back I know math is not your thing I need the Abacus I need the calculator the the ti 100 TI85 I text you the other day too did you give up the T9 texting do you no longer have the flip phone I got rid of the flip oh just just as its making a comeback no I saw the other day ticktockers are using the flip phone so just as I give it up it becomes a thing see which explains a lot you know what youre absolutely correct Here Comes Baba Miller inside using this size Corey he hasnt hasnt played a whole lot what is the ceiling for 11 in white well I mean the ceiling hes hes going to be an NBA player the question becomes is he going to be an NBA player after this season or does he stick around and get better and get more prepared for the next level you know staying at Florida State and learning how to play the same way that Johnson Jonathan Isaac did the same way that Buffon kamigelli and all the different Florida State players have done over the years which allows them to be successful once they get to the NBA play clock a rather shot clock running down and its a shot clock violation Baba Miller using his size in the post area setting the screen and then facing up Anthony Walker and just using that size to finish over top of the niche its a small Milestone but right now Florida state with an opportunity to get this lead under 20 which we havent seen since very early in the first half Miami has led by as many as 28 Mills with the right hand and he draws the foul on Long thats 21 Isaiah Wong and thats one way to call back get to the freethrow line score with the clock stopped absolutely and youre putting Florida States career best free throw shooter on the line so you would expect for Kayla Mills to go to the free throw line and knock down both of these and then allow the Seminoles to be able to set their defense with the media timeout coming up at the next dead ball most likely Leonard Hamilton could be a little more aggressive right now because he has a chance to get his guys a quick blow on the next dead ball Miami only committed 3 fouls in the first half six now in the second half so Florida state in the bonus from here on out Mills has now reached double figures in 11 straight games and you jinxed it no it was not me he made the first one you were talking I wasnt talking about his free throw percentage doesnt matter free throw prowess Applause Miller staying with Tack and pack able to get around the six foot eleven freshman clever play by pack to fake the pass keeping Baba Millers hands down and then going over a player who was about a foot taller than him to finish it off our gamehigh 18 for Nigel pack lob down low for Miller stolen away and a foul is Wong tried to bring it up over half court the foul on Florida State its on Worley his third Miami holds a 22 point lead over Florida State Seminoles and we want to appreciate all our guys college sports communicators membership Appreciation Week want to make sure we give a shout out to Alex Schwartzs Sid for Miami and of course to go hes the best Chuck Walsh long time sports information director for Florida State and congratulations to Chuck Walsh the US basketball writers association recently gave him the 2023 Catholic twin award recognizing his contributions he will be honored in Houston at the final four Chuck telling us that will be his first trip to the final four he is not just one of the best in the business he is the best of the business absolutely well deserved congratulations to Chuck and very few people enjoy their job as much as Chuck Walsh does and congratulations to him being honored long Applause how Caleb Mills tried to sell it I love the no call there thats just basketball I got TV Teddy Valentine right on top of it just puts his hands up like theres nothing there guys lets play basketball Florida State gives it back Isaiah Wong getting out in transition and you can see he dips the left shoulder Caleb Mills getting into his area and again if there was a call there it would have been a blocking call a foul on Kayla Mills I love the fact that Ted Valentine did not make a call and award either player especially with long making the bucket Chandler Jackson The Freshman from Memphis picking up the foul Jalen Worley by the way has four fouls so hes on the bench for Florida State Miller too easy over Cleveland and the lead is 7347 we come up on 10 50 to play here in the second half and Miami sharing the basketball extremely well you look at the 78 percent Frugal shooting here in the second half as nahim McLeod continues to have an impact when hes on the floor but the problem with that at this point now when youre down 24 points battling Twos for twos isnt going to help the nose at some point theyre going to have to start stepping up and making some threes in this game Stan Jones who over the years has worked magic with the Florida state big man and Raheem McLeod sophomore who began his career in the junior college ranks hes one of the latest projects for Stan Jones and hes lost minutes of late but hes been a little bit of a bright spot today he absolutely has a lot that has to do with Derek green Jr who steps up and knocks down his first threepoint field goal of the game and more importantly allowing Florida State to set their defense pick up and see if they can put some pressure on Miami first three of the game for green Florida States leading scorer just Five Points two of nine one of eight from downtown omir lost it out of bounds and its back to Florida State Seminoles have made their last three from the field six of their last state and a chance to get this lead for this deficit under 20 again Cleveland thought about the three puts it on the floor and he was bumped on the drive Isaiah Wong with his third foul with 1005 to go in the second half Miami still up 21 Florida State to the freethrow line when we come back its cozy season at Tommy John with everything since the last time these two teams played A Tale of Two Cities quite literally it absolutely has been that you look at Florida State who started out last season at six and one in ACC play in first half I mean first place in the ACC after that win against Miami and Coral Gables and from then you look at the record for the Knowles they got bit by the injury bug didnt not qualify for the NCAA tournament only nine ACC wins since then including this season where theyve been five and four so its been a tale of two stories but both these coaches from a year ago when they played against each other and while theres a lot of respect between these two Jim larren egg is not going to feel sorry for Leonard Hamilton because his program went through that for a couple of years where it just seemed everybody was getting hurt nobody could stay healthy and Miami was barely playing Seven guys sometimes and and Jim larenegger also had to watch Leonard Hamilton continuously take his team to the NCAA tournament an elite eight finish for the nose as well as a couple of sweet 16 finishes as well so it was truly a virtual of forces between these two programs and offensive foul no basket Marlon Beverly for the perpetrator you know and what I would love to see and again its not within the rules right now in college basketball but you see Harlan Beverly releases that basketball well before the foul I would love to see the basket count you still call because the call is correct Clarence Armstrongs right on top of the cause correct it was a charge but I would love to see the basket actually count even though Beverly picks up that foul here is green left it short Cleveland from the elbow too strong and now pack pushing Stripped Away from behind by Mills Jackson the other way Cleveland driving on a Wall Kicks it out green for three and it spins out its been that kind of night for Florida State it absolutely has been specifically for Darren Green who had 42 percent one of the better Shooters in the ACC from Beyond a threepoint Arc but just has not been able to really get it to fall here especially in big moments where his team could truly use a basket ranges two of eleven one of ten from downtown he came in on a heater nine of his past 16 from three entering play Wong over the 74 McLeod so youre gonna take credit for that you spoke up heater so you felt like Isaiah Wong it was time for him to go with a little bit of heat check all right listen 18 points five out of six from the field four threes and great to see Isaiah Wong back the guy that weve grown to know and love throughout the ACC Mills driving on omir McLeod look back 11 points for nahim McLeod four off a career high pack for three rebound Mills you need someone behind us is yell whyd you let him shoot you take that shot its nothing you can do to stop Nigel pack from taking that shot its something about whether he makes it or not omir playing defensive back down low and we get a whistle thats like saying why do you let Isaiah Wong shoot well hes sizing up a seven foot four Center but still dropping it nothing but net from the top of the key to snap a ninegame losing streak against Florida State Isaiah Wong Miamis leading scorer after a couple of down games Jim larenegger said he hasnt been himself due to his sinus illness for the last week even though hes still dealing with that today hes played a pretty efficient game he absolutely has done that and when you consider Isaiah Wong his level of attention that you have to pay to him on the floor gives his teammates so many opportunities you dont want to help off Isaiah Wong because he is a K4 shooter shooting over 35 percent from three but hes so dangerous with the basketball in his hands attacking the rim getting downhill getting to the freethrow line he truly is the best player for the Miami Hurricanes not always the most important player but they cannot be successful without him being successful uh you saw it in the NCAA tournament during that Elite eight run the number of big shots that Isaiah Wong hit for Miami and the poster we will always remember the dunk he was out there catching bodies on much bigger players once he attacked the rim Kanes got to the elite eight they had a six point lead against eventual Champion Kansas in the regional final that was a halftime League Worley back in there with the four fouls Cleveland thats a three air ball into the caress of Poplar Music pack is four of six from three tonight 17 of his last 32 theres Miller hes the only Miami starter not in double figures long trying to get separation picked up his dribble shot clock down to four omear blocked from behind by McLeod and Cleveland comes away with it green shot fake Cal fires tipped by omir right to himself Wayne has just not been able to get it going as long attacking the basket and again drops it off to Pat great ball movement for Miami and this is normally one of those plays where you see them end up with a wide open three but Nigel pack actually slowing it down making sure they get a quality opportunity a cloud out on the perimeter pack shoots over him everybody wants a piece of the seven foot four big guy now they have been picking on my God nahim McLeod from outside that time he won the battle but unable to finish off the attempt at The Rim all right as a guard speak truthfully you see a big guy come that far out drive on him or is it bonus points if youre able to shoot over him like Isaiah Wong did a little while ago Im blowing his doors off Im going to the rim and again so many better things can happen for you once you go to the rim theres normally going to be help you find one of your teammates or you can go try to dunk it and then of course if you catch the body there you got to highlight you find yourself in top 10 on Sports Center so its many better things can happen for you when you go to the basket one catch and shoot Id say put you on a poster but thats so 90s now its YouTube right or yeah you turn into a meme yeah not really sure what the correct term is now I think Ive kind of aged out of that demographic Miami right now content to run some clock not going to rush to find a look early in the shot clock and be as play as fast as they did early in the game pack now with the shot clock at seven driving on McLeod Miller the Thunder case in point you blow his doors off one of your teammates comes in and catches a body the nice fine from Nigel pack as he decides this time hes going to go past nahim McLeod the help from Jalen Worley allows Jordan Miller to Dunkle on the seven foot four nahi McLeod and we dont know if the poster we dont know its a with the nft were not sure really like that you like it I like it okay all right were not sure what it is but either way its gonna go on Jordan Millers mixtape please believe it five Miami starters and double figures now Keynes shooting 61 percent from the field 11 of 23 Caleb bills thats one on the other Edge I love the attack by Caleb Mills but this is at the point to where I say why didnt you do that on the other opportunities you got to the rim where you didnt finish we know you have it in you and again if you do that in the first half maybe that builds a little more momentum for your team Wong lets it fly in and out rebound Miller thats a tough shot but Isaiah Wong is a tough shot maker as Miller maybe got away with the travel right there in transition Mills open for three offensive rebound Corin bullies inside cant get the roll and Miller knocked it out 8256 it has been all Miami since the opening tip Music car insurance at progressivecom Miami three minutes and 52nd is away from ending a ninegame losing streak in the hands of Florida State it has been all Kanes really from the getgo 8256 and both of these teams came in in that amoeba at the top of the ACC youve got Clemson sitting there at number one and then a number of teams at six and three and five and four Florida stated five and four might surprise some people they started the season one and nine overall theyve been better in conference and Miami preseason number four in the ACC right near the top almost beat Duke over the weekend this is a strong Miami team that has a chance to make another Deep Run in March it absolutely is that health is the concern for the Hurricanes as it is for every team in college basketball but they do have a bench they got a strong rotation about eight guys where Jim larenega can play different ways but of course theyre going to need Isaiah Wong to be at his best all season are you sold on Clemson staying in the top spot of the ACC I dont know necessarily that they stay in the top spot because Chase Hunter being out Im not sure if they can maintain their level offensively but I am definitely sold on Clemson being a top four team that gets a double by in the ACC tournament I think theyre good enough that they can and hold things off until they get there starting that Court back with PJ Hall Hunter Tyson both playing First Team all ACC level basketball throughout this season a collision down low is Poplar drove he is fouled by Jackson the way the league has functioned this year I dont see anybody running away with the ACC I dont think that will be the case and there are a lot of good teams in the ACC this season and again many of the metrics wont show that based upon what you know happens in November but there are a lot of quality wins available in ACC basketball play which takes me back to my point that we talked about in the first half this every year but not just but but more particularly this year you have to judge this league based upon what happens during conference play and the reason you say that to me because its always been the excuse for the last you know five ten years oh well this is what happened in the ACC Big Ten challenge well the ACC happened to win the ACC Big Ten showers this year the final one the ACC wins at 86 youve got Pittsburgh going on the road blowing out Northwestern youve got you know so many different Wake Forest goes to Wisconsin and beats them these are big wins but I dont think that nationally the agency is still being recognized the way it should be on a grand scale and the refrain that Ive heard from a number of coaches in the League this year is that in this league you see so many different styles night in night out you play a vintage Florida State team theyre going to pick you up 94 feet theyre going to rotate out a lot of guys and pressure you force you to turn over speed you up Syracuse with the Zone Virginia with the pack line Georgia Techs got its fun house with trick mirrors defense that prepares you for the NCAA tournament far more than some other leagues and its a big reason why last year the ACC didnt have very many teams in but three of the five that got in got to the elite eight you get to March and now you got small turnarounds and you go into your scout well this team reminds us of Syracuse this team reminds us of NC State this team reminds us of Florida State The Scouting Report is there it absolutely is that and again that Ive been preaching that for probably the last three seasons as the ACC since 2019 has been one of the conferences with you know lesser teams in the NCAA tournament but the reason why you you preached that is because just like you said when the ACC gets to March and they get to the NCAA tournament more often than not teams are successful theyre bouncing into the second weekend you go back and you even look at last year Notre Dame got two wins in the NCAA tournament a year ago the 15 so you know everyone outside of Virginia Tech got wins for the ACC once they got to the NCAA tournament a year ago and again iron sharpens iron from December when he was not playing conference games this conference gets better for the majority of the teams heading into the ACC tournament what happened last year was that the conference was written off in large part at this juncture of the season so teams were getting better its just that nobody outside really noticed until we got into the NCAA tournament and normally other conferences have older teams to start the season because the ACC has so many guys leaving to go pro youve got more Pros in the League than you do normally in a traditional year than any other league and so many of the teams are starting over now you of course bring in the transfer portal to be a part of that as well and teams in November arent as good as theyre going to be when they get to March so who are a couple of those teams in the ACC right now that they took their lumps in nonconference certainly we know Florida state has won I guess Syracuse would be another thats my first one I talk about Syracuse playing with a freshman point guard in Judah Mintz and Syracuse is getting 40 plus percent of their scoring from their Freshman Class those guys are better today in the late January than they were in November where they were taken love so they were losing some of those nonconference games at home even if you look at a team like Virginia Tech maybe on the outside and surprise people that they beat Duke the other night they werent as bad as one in seven in the ACC they get Hunter Couture back and thats the heart and soul of that team he makes the defense better that is a team that is much more talented than its record indicates in college it absolutely has been that and they have lost close games begin you know they went into the game last night against Duke at one and seven in the ACC play John Shire made it very clear they could have easily been 52 in ACC play thats thats the how close the games theyve been playing look at Miami theyre winning you know take this game out of consideration theyre winning close games they lose by two at Duke theyre playing in close games they can go either way how about Robinson with the Nifty move to the basket jakai Robinson redshirt freshman former top 100 player whole teams got a lot of their bench players on the floor final seconds here in Tallahassee and this has been an impressive performance by the canes as Robinsons still competing comes up with the blocked shot to end it from Miami as they walk away from Tallahassee with a 23point victory over the Rival the first win in the last 10 meetings between these two instate Rivals Miamis first win against Florida State since 2018 its the Kanes first win in Tallahassee since 2016 and it is the largest
