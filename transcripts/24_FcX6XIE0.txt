Dayton and playing in the Horizon League They lost in the Horizon League quarterfinals last year Went 15 18 a year ago And Wright State wearing the black here tonight Won their opener at home as they clobbered a division three school Franklin College 8637 on Monday They shot 49 They had 27 assists in that game And a three that rims out from Logan Woods And Cal controls the rebound They have numbers if they want to push it But look for Cal to push the ball Theyre doing that a lot differently this year Every possession theyre trying to get the ball off the floor and get something going before the defense gets set Same five for Cal that started Monday against the Road Runners And a couple of guys out tonight for Cal No Dewan Campbell again whos nursing a groin injury And hes daytoday Cal hoping maybe theyll have a Monday against Cal State Fullerton as Chris Bell the Syracuse transfer pulls up and gives the nights first points Thats a good start for Chris Bell Roxy because he struggled really coming out of the gates the other night Its always good to hit that first basket cheering Michael Cooper cut off in the lane The freshman Shot clock approaching 10 for the Raiders of Wright State Cross the key Flipped up in the miss from Michael Omaribe And here comes Cal back the other way with Justin Pippen Pippen had a strong game Didnt shoot it well from the line but he had 157 assists on Monday night of the opener Here is Lee Dort backing his way in and a foul called against Wright State and its on Michael Omar And and and we will see more of that as the season goes on Lee Dort not afraid to post up get his guy in the block But theres our scoring leaders Roxy Really good balance four guys in double figures in the opener and 16 of Day Ames 18 coming in the second half and it really seemed Cal found a rhythm in the second half against Bakersfield money It was a little bit disjointed in the first half Well I think defensively the Cal picked it up and showed you what they could do but you know first games first game I dont care who youre playing and where youre going to have to get some jitters out and get yourselves organized get the chemistry going Heres Logan Woods on the kick out Solomon Callahan didnt play in the opener for Wright State Was dealing with a thumb injury Probably could have played nothing against Franklin College but had the competition been a little bit stiffer he may have played in the opener And they were just playing it cautious And Callahan making his season debut One of the top performers for Wright State Here is Lee Dort backing his way in Cut off by the double team Finds Chris Bell rattles out the three and the rebound grabbed by Brian Atunu a transfer from Marramac who made it trip to the Bay Area last year with Marramac They played over at Stanford Its the second straight year that Brian Atunu gets to play in the Bay Area The Sugarland Texas native cheering and the foul is on Justin Pippen of Cal Well keep an eye Roxy on Cal defensively They do a really good job coming uh in defending ball screens They jump way out Their big guys hedge hard They make you throw it back Theyre not letting you turn the corner Thats something they didnt do as well in my opinion a year ago but theyve kind of solved that this year Opening night they held Bakersfield to 36 shooting Yeah theres Dort out there stopping the ball Nice job Michael Cooper a talented freshman on the drive and a fadeaway in the baseline from Cooper That wasnt as effective that time Bell left his left the ball a little early and guard was able to turn the corner Cooper who won a state championship in Indiana last year at the 4A level A 106 rebound starting the opener Wide open for three Justin Pippen And the rebound there is Michael Lamari Bay for Bright State cheering Shot clock approaching 10 Cooper from deep and Michael Cooper is all five for the Raiders So hes playing with confidence Roxy I mean thats just a confident looking shot He stepped back let it go and he knew it was gone He knew it was down from Jeffersonville Indiana The freshman who is in some ways a recruiting coup for Clint Sergeant in Right State to get him And a foul will get Lee Dorton the line for California Yeah theres Cooper who turned the corner Roxy and he was able to get there again Bell didnt quite stick around long enough to help but then he steps back shoots it over Justin Pippen I mean hes confident Hes got one inside one outside Tough guy to guard Second foul on Michael Omari Bay And two shots for Lee Dort And he missed the first He went five for six from the line on Monday in the opener And a couple of subs coming in for the Raiders Amari Bay needs to sit with the two fouls And Sam Alamutu checks in A transfer from Vermont who is a really good player solid player for Vermont made three trips to the NCA tournament with Vermont And also checking in is Andre Holden a sophomore from Hamilton Ohio as Dort splits the pair Well heres that press and Cals been working on that Theyre trying to extend right now They go to a one two Theyre not really looking to steal Trying to get some time off the clock then go back and play and play on defense on a shorter clock Really good strategy in my opinion Thats something from the Dana Alman playbook Dana loves to do that Well I like it too because it takes away like the time I mean you cant get it in your best players hand too late Here is Cooper Tough fadeaway Good defense from Day Ames And the weak side rebound grabbed and pulled out by Andre Holden for Wright State And inside the roll for Logan Woods Yeah youre not going to see a lot of offensive rebounds That was a pretty good offensive rebound and a second chance reload for right state Cal pretty pretty good on the first chance rebound Heres Justin Pippen down the lane and it falls off after a good move and the rebound grabbed by Alamutu for right state Nice pass Michael Cooper and a foul Its on Dort sending Brian a two much to my dislike I might add But uh just a tough guy and hes really good with with players Hes a players coach but hes tough Look look at his his his background I mean hes not only done the job as a player Roxy hes done a job as a coach hes had a good career at Utah Valley and you can see what he did Twotime NBA champion as a player And both free throws missed by Brian Atunu And Cal turns it right back over and Justin Pippen was trying to tell Roger Ays over there that it was off of TJ Burch One of my pet peeves dont bring the ball up the sideline You got a second defender Bring it up the middle of the floor Justin Dont have a lot of margin for error over there Cal just one of five from the floor to start this game And a deep three on the way And Brian at two And the rebound grabbed by Chris Bell for the Bears He has Cals only field goal and now grabs another rebound Here is Justin Pippen backing his way in against TJ Burch Gets the call and the roll and one Justin Pippen Now good perseverance by Justin Pippen because he was getting banged pretty hard Referees letting him play but he just waited and picked a spot I mean theres one bump you know theres two And he just up and under and draws the foul and with some strength able to knock down the shot for a threepoint opportunity Heres another look Good job Ball State transfer TJ Burge called for the foul as the N1 free throw Pippen went just four for eight from the line Uncharacteristic for him on Monday and gets the threepoint play and pulls Cal to within one Yeah hes not going to miss many free throws Hes a darn good free throw shooter Oh and a turnover And Reed is Petritus with pressure on the perimeter forcing a bad pass He forces turnovers Roxy Hes Mr Energy But what I like is that Cals playing so aggressively off of ball screens They really make you back it up You cannot turn the corner Youre taking a retreat dribble and you dont see the floor Thats a Thats a trifecta right there Petrit is coming off the bench after starting the majority of last season as Sam Alamutu called for the foul The Vermont transfer Well what has Rita Petritus done in less than 5 seconds Hes gotten the steal and drawn a foul I mean he just hes always around the basketball knows how to play A real luxury for Mark Madson and the staff Fourth team foul on right state Milos Ilich in the game Big Serbian 610 transfer from Loyola of Maryland Here is Pippen stepping back to the ark Too strong on the three The long rebound falls to Kellen Picket a freshman for right state Ball knocked away recovering the Raiders on the drive to the bucket and the runner missed by Dominic Pangonis and Cal counters back the other way Here comes John Camden Pippen attacks Pippen hangs drops it off to Reus Petritus Those are the Thats we were talking about Roxy I mean unselfish team Looked like a sure layup by Pippen but he drops it off gives it up for Reus Petritus Nice move some of that teamwork which you were talking about the Bears moving the basketball Heres a three on the way TJ Burch too strong John Camden the rebound Cal controls Here is Pippen backing his way in in the key Too strong and the rebound tipped around Elich keeps it alive for Cal John Camden challenged on a three Good defense Andre Holden lunged at him Oh really good challenge Heres Kell Picket backing his way in And a whistle and a foul whistled against Cal Well lets watch Justin Pippen Roxy Hes very explosive to the basket but watch him draw two defenders and Rita Petrus seals off the backside Thats just great hustle but great recognition There it is again I mean its a good guy to have on your squad Reus Petritus He He knows how to get open Burch missing the first Interesting to watch right state now Theyre kind of going away from some of their ball screen action and trying to isolate trying to go oneonone against Cal because Cals done such a good job defensively One more for Burch Right State struggled from the line against Franklin on Monday One of the only things they didnt do well and Bur goes one for two But Wright State in the opener against Franklin College went just 9 for 21 from the free throw line No they shot it better from three They did the line I mean and thats pretty uncharacterist in characteristic of this team as well Theyre a very good free throw shooting team They didnt look like it opening night Game tied at eight Day Ames Reus Petritus left open missed the three and the rebound tipped out of bounds by Kellen Picket will stay at this end and a Cal ball Yeah Cals hard to keep off the glass Roxy I mean thats one thing that coach talked about with us today at shooting round You know hes going to have to theyre going to have to find a way to put bodies on Cal and not let him get second chance put backs and opportunities off the inbound Heres Camden from the corner and John Camden nails a three Hes confident I mean thats what he does Hes no stranger to the threepoint shot He has knocked down threepoint shots in the past Hes hes knocked down 41 of his shots last year Took 230 of them Went three for seven in the opener against Bakersfield from outside the arc with his game high 22 Michael Cooper on the drive gets to the basket He is a talented freshman for right state Yeah he knows how to get into the seams and get to the rim You got to put a body on him stop him early Once he gets going hes alone He has seven of the Raiders 10 Nolan Dorsey in and out on the three And the rebound Solomon Callahan for the Raiders Here is Cooper A step back from Cooper and the rebound Reed is Petritus and Cal controls I think Cal will cheering give him that shot The step back fade away until he proves he can hit it Yeah Well he and then youll adjust maybe On the baseline slithering in Nolan Dorsey the reverse laying Well nice layup by Dorsy but even nicer look from John Camden John Camden can throw some passes Hes very adept passing and an errant pass and right state with a turnover Bears starting to get it going All right Well lets take a look Roxy Here heres that pass to Camden whos very comfortable from the three He could sack State Theyll be here in a couple of weeks to play just great I got a chance to spend some time with Stefon Marberry knew Scotty Pippen back in the day with my Nike affiliation Good guy Day Ames a spin and a whistle Mark Matson wants a goend and frankly I agree with him and theyre counting him after the officials talk it over It is Yeah good call The goalend and one give the hoop to Dames Well he can and he can do this Roxy You watch him change his speed I mean look at that whirl move with the foul and the contact Gets it up off the glass Thats a big time move Second foul on Sam Alamutu and Clint Sergeant the head coach questioning the call about who the foul was on and they have changed it Its not on Alamutu its on Solomon Callahan as Ames hits the free throw But watch Cal as the game goes on Theyve had the ability to get to the free throw line Thats another trait that comes in handy especially in the late game They they really get there often And thats something they did well last year is they led the ACC in free throws made per game Yes they did Three on the way heal the rim for Dominic Pangonus and John Camden pulls it down for Cal Yeah nice rebound by Camden Good seal off day Ames who had that strong second half on Monday Too strong with that one off the heel of the rim and the rebound tipped to Logan Woods for right state You can see right state theyre not setting as many screens now Theyre Late clock they will Heres a three on the way Sam Alamu comes up empty and Cal with the rebound Thats how Cal wants to play They want to play one and done Back door for a cutting Reus Petritus and hell get to the line off the lead from Milo Elish Oh thats a smart play Roxy I mean that was Youre being guarded trailed Watch Rita Petritus He doesnt get the ball but he back cuts cuz his mans trailing him and good presence of mind Look at the pass He knew exactly where to go and get draws a foul He He can do that Hes a very heady player Miss from Petritus Two for two from the line on Monday and one of the key returners for Cal Lee Dort whos looks like just a different person in his last go round of college basketball this year And Mark Matson hoping to get Dewan Campbell back maybe as soon as Monday against Fullerton Hes daytoday right now with a groin injury Petritus missing both and the rebound falls to Right State So theyve got three good returning players but fortunately theyve got a couple of newcomers with big time experience And Sam Alamu fumbles it away Threeonone for Cal Petritus to the basket Missing the laying Justin Pippen on a put back Has it knocked away Theres Lee Dort trying to clean it up Dort again And theyre calling basket interference Well I like the perseverance of Cal I mean they missed shots Roxy but they were all over the offensive glass I mean holy smoke Theres a turnover Look at the pass Petritus who just misses it Then theres a tip up Dont get it Theres another one Theyre just keeping that thing alive Sixpoint lead for Cal Right State has just one for their last seven from the floor Off balance Tough leaner banked in by Brian Atunu Thats a tough shot I mean there wasnt a lot of margin for that shot Last year Atunu was the MAC the other Mack the Mack right defensive player of the year He led that league in block shots In fact he was 14th in the country in block shots last year And the quick hands and a steal for Andre Holden for right state Nice job by Holden He used his feet to get around Lee Dor moved his feet excellently And a three rattles in for Bryant A tunu Timeout Cal Well Mark Madsons going to talk to his team about gambling because they gambled and what happens They give up a three here Heres a gamble and a help and a shot I mean they just playing pretty tough right now Here it is Central Arkansas 9454 music Caleb Wilson led North Carolina 22 in that game in the preseason poll The Heels were picked to come in third in the ACC with Duke of course picked to win it But if you check it out tomorrow night not only watch Carolina but Darren Peterson the amazing freshman for Kansas as well Thatll be a great matchup tomorrow night Great matchup for both teams Justin Pippen to lob for Lee Dort How about Pippen Dort We might be seeing some of that this year Great great play coming off a drive in a lob Shot clock down to 10 for the Raiders Michael Cooper Dominic Pangonus on the drive and using the window I thought Cal came out really hard defensively Just let up a little bit at the end of the shot clock there And a block Its on Pangonus for Steven F Austin transfer the native of Toronto Yeah you talk about a little bit of preseason chemistry Roxy these games are really important Theres Pippen doing what he does And great look because Pippen had a lane He could have used it but instead he just gives it up Nobody really stopped him but nobody stopped Dorton so he took the easier path I like that decision by Justin Pippen Calab the bonus now One and one for Chris Bell And one more for the Syracuse transfer Last year the Orange averaged over nine points per game and he shot his threes in ACC play at 44 last year He can really shoot the ball Well hes a hes a marksman I mean thats what he does Four for Bell He had just five in the opener against Bakersfield on Monday Bell who played three years at De Losal before transferring to Wasach Academy in Utah finish up his high school career and then three years at Syracuse Logan Woods Here is Pangonus in the corner and a three for Dominic Pangonus Well Cals just I mean theyre playing hard Roxy and theyre doing a great job Theyre just just at the end of the shot clock giving up the three because theyre putting a lot of pressure on the ball Doing a good job there Third three for right state is Lee Dort off balance using the window Yeah he got pushed That should have been and one Good finish by Lee Dort Good strength Right State has made their last four from the floor Ryan Atunu rattles out a three and the rebound Lee Dort Cal looking to run almost an over and back Nolan Dorsy looking to get it to Justin Pippen Here is Dort and the pass broken up stolen by Andre Holden Here comes right state Dominic Pangonus and a block is called and free throws coming up for Pangonus Yeah heres heres a play There was the bump He got away with that one Gord so strong and always thought that Roxy when youre a strong player Reminded me of Leon Po a little bit He got fouled all the time But I said Leon you got to fall down once in a while And and same with Lee Dort You know you if he falls maybe he gets the call but hes such a strong kid that hes not going to get some of those They called the foul on Dort It was not on Dort The foul should have been on John Camden And I think theyre talking about that now Rogers over at the at the scorers table Hes going to go to the monitor to make sure that is in the discretion of the officials They can do that And thats thats when he wasnt sure about who the foul was on and they have changed it to John Camden but originally they had called it on Dort Yeah he he was nowhere near the play So that was good that the officials corrected that Roger is a veteran official Final Four official Hes going to get it right Six off the bench now for Panggones And one more for the native of Toronto Was an all Canadian prospect a couple of years ago Went to Stephen F Austin one year there and now at Wright State Lee Dor pulls down the miss Roxier Cal right now You got to try to find a way to get to the basket I think theyre stronger They can get to the rim and if they have to they got to live at the free throw line Theyre just bigger and stronger Day Ames Strip from Justin Pippen Pulled down Dominic Pangonus TJ Burch spinning Burch falls off and the rebound grabbed by Chris Bell for Cal Heres D Ames in transition and he gets knocked down in the second on Dominic Pangonus And Ames will go to the line I like that Roxson when youre not particularly shooting the ball well and and you get letting great state kind of get settled in Watch this transition basket Thats twice now that Day Ames has gotten past his defender and drawn a foul Hes really tough to guard in the half court but hes extremely tough to guard in transition And right theres an example of the new rules in college basketball this year the continuation Last year that would have been a foul on the floor and a oneonone for Ames They called two shots because he was in the act of going up to shoot And that is part of the interpretation this year The way the officials going to call it more of a freedom of movement and the continuation play is back in the college Yeah I allow the NBA but thats exactly why Cals doing a good job and making an effort this year to get it going in in transition because they want to try to beat you to the basket and get those calls But heres a one two again Again just trying to pressure up TJ Burch breaks down the D Now Right State will set it up in the half court Yeah no harm no foul there They able to get some time off the clock cheering Had to stay solid right to the last play Andre holding the handoff Solomon Callahan on a step back Tough three And the rebound there is Camden up over everybody to pull it down for the Bears That was a tough shot Chris Bell left open in and out on the three The offensive rebound underneath and the put back is blocked One more time for Elich has it blocked again Milos Elites one more time Cant get it to go and its pulled down by Wright State Well he did a great job Roxy The only thing you might have thought him was just trying to draw a foul I think he was worried about getting a shot blocked Andre Holden the floater Yeah and thats tough cuz you do all that work inside but you got to take the ball and your arms up through your defender and get that foul if you can Hes big and strong Hell get that down Onepoint lead for the Bears approaching four minutes to go until halftime Day Ames pull up rolls in and crawls over the front edge Yeah you get the feeling he can do that almost at every possession Thats something that both Justin Pippen and Day Ames can do cheering They can get into the paint and go up over at the top of you and get a good looking shot on balance Ames leads Cal with seven and an errant pass Its thrown away by Andre Holden and a cow ball on the other side of a timeout 338 left in the half and Day Ames asserting himself for the Bears here A little bit more oneonone They had big time scores I get it But this year a lot more distribution and its paying off This will bode well for Cal as the year goes on 20 assists in the opener against Bakersfield on Monday And that 8760 win for Cal with a Golden Bear shot 54 for the field in that game They had 50 points in the paint 50 of their 87 came in the paint Thats big But you know on nights when youre not shooting it you got to find ways to score easier baskets Now heres Wright States version of the 122 Theyre going to try to see if they can get something going push Cal out a little bit Theyre staying in the zone 131 Chris Bell corner three short and the rebound tipped out and grabbed by Logan Woods for the Raiders Yeah good change in defense coming out of the timeout Heres a three and thats short from Solomon Callahan but kept alive by Wright State and Logan Woods cheering Solomon Callahan Shot clock down to seven Pullup jumper Logan Woods and the rebound John Canton Cal running Good defense by Cale Good job in transition Wright State getting back and a foul on the perimeter and its on Brian Atunu of right state and that will put John Camden at the line for Cal The 19 foul of one and one Roxy when you play good defense good things happen What I mean by that is you get a chance to get out and get your transition game going hard to run after a maid you know but when you get either a steal or a hard really solid defensive rebound you get it out and go you can get numbers and thats how you beat teams before the defense gets set One more coming for Camden You know Mark Madsons talked about that I give Mark Madson credit in the offseason He worked really hard on trying to find ways to improve his team and hes done that Hes a student of the game I mean really does a good job in the staff of finding ways and trying to give his team an edge and hes done that defensively Cander remains perfect at the line this year now seven for seven and its a fivepoint lead for Cal Michael Cooper back on the floor for Clint Sergeant and right state cheering inside 10 to shoot Kell Picket and the rebound Justin Pippen and Cal pushing Heres Day Ames John Camden drives Camden gets inside Is Clawber will go back to the line and shoot two Theres your defense in offense They got it down the floor Couple of good passes and found a driving lane First on Kellen Picket Cals a hard team Roxy to keep off the free throw line You can talk to your team about it but theyve got guys that can knock down the three although they havent demonstrated that as well as I know theyd like to but they also have guys that can really put it down and attack you off the dribble One more for Camden I mean everybody on the floor that Cal has on the floor right now is really lethal putting the ball down and just driving I mean they really can get there So is the guy over Mark Madsons left shoulder Matt Bradley Former Cal stand out He was a steamroller I mean you you had no chance of guarding him to the basket as strong as he was but if you gave him the outside shot he would put it in your face There he is in the right side of the screen Great to see Matt back with the Cal Bears One of my favorite Cal Bears Largest lead for Cal Solomon Callahan three and the first points for Callahan tonight Uh hes happy to be back in in the game after sitting the first one Callahans got the ability Hes feeling it Hes confident Milos Elich Hes bent over and trying to tell the officials that he took a cheap shot there boxing out looking for the well potential miss And thats what he was complaining about And frankly I dont it its a real big break and he just wait Yeah he reaches around I I dont know that that was anything like you say upgradeable or malicious So well see Looks like Yeah good call I I I I agree with the officials Again veteran crew here Roger didnt spend a lot of time there but he talked to the both coaches and I think both coaches agreed That doesnt make Illich feel any better No it doesnt But it again there was nothing malicious It was a basketball play Yeah In terms of he was trying to box out and seal his man in case the shot was missed Yeah And he just happened to make contact with the midsection unintentionally of Milo And in fact they just went and shook hands there I think thats great sportsmanship right there Nothing nothing intended Day Ames turns the corner pulls up in the key and Day Ames leads All scorers now with nine but he makes it look easy I I dont know if anybody on the floor can make that play look that easy Hes done it two three times tonight Ames who played at Virginia last year played his freshman year at Kansas State and Chicago native with 18 on opening night Michael Cooper Logan Woods from deep and the rebound tipped free and the hustle by Sam Alamutu for right state Logan Woods fumbled it away Pippen dives gets a Cal Threeonone back the other way Camden has a shot blocked cheering and theyre calling an offensive foul And the charge on John Camden in his second foul Well what the only thing I didnt like about that play Roxy youre twoonone and you got to stay wider at the lane line They came both two players came down inside the paint and thats letting one guy guard two and Solomon Callahan clearly was outside the took the charge but if you get a little wider on a twoonone veer off ride now veer off to the right now hes got to guard the ball handler or stay at home on the on the drop off guys So theyll theyll get that right but its kind of a staple for a twoonone Showing the level of respect Cal has for Michael Cooper the freshman for right state They put Nolan Dorsy on him and Dorsys their best defender He can defend oneonone Hes tough Last year was the defensive player of the year where he played Callahan Tough pullup jumper and the rebound and a foul going for it Its on right state Yeah Dorsy had the inside position Last cheering year was the CAA defensive player of the year and its Michael Cooper called for the foul and Dorsy will shoot at the other end You know Roxton theres the play again I mean you see the the calls made and yeah the push off No question But if youve got guys that are former defensive players of the year thats thats a luxury for your team because youre going to need guys that you can put on the other teams top scorer slow a guy down or just a guy that can get you a bucket You need to put a good defender on him And Kells got that One more for Dorsy who started his college career at New Mexico Two years at Holy Cross two years at Campbell including a red shirt year and now the grat transfer in his final season of college basketball playing for Mark Madson Well I like not only Dorsy but you got Petritus out there and Reitus has his way of guarding people I mean hes a hes a problem And to see those two guys out there defensively that improves Cal immensely Largest lead for the Golden Bears Petritus have led Cal in steals last year Hes tough Cal has a foul to give if they want See if they recognize it Dont want a foul on the shot Solomon Callahan drives and draws a foul with 3 seconds left in the half Yeah dont want to foul on the shot Maybe you take it earlier but Im okay with that You dont use the foul early now Just play solid defense Here it is Theres the drive The help gets there just a little bit late and and doesnt go straight up Got to get there on the block with your hands straight up Foul was on Reedus Petritus his first and two free throws for Solomon Callahan And one more for Callahan 81 foul shooter last year was on the Horizon League all freshman team Well Kells been seven points a game Yeah and Kels been able to build this lead up Roxy you would have liked to see a stop there maybe going in to lock with a little momentum but they still have 32 two to get it up the floor See if they can increase this lead before the half Now theyre just going to make sure they dont allow a running start here Heres Day A cross mid court Be the Heave and its off the backboard and no good And Cal is up 3428 at the half Day Ames leads everybody with nine points The Cal defensively holding right state to it Weve said this Mark Madsons teams have gotten to the line and they were there 16 times and they converted 13 So thats really pretty much been the difference of the game I think that would be a good formula to continue to do Hopefully some shots fall but when theyre not like it doesnt sometimes early the season get to the line Same five for Cal that started the game opening the second half Day Ames penetrates and cant get it to go And here comes Michael Cooper out of the pack for right state Yeah he just missed that one He was point blank at the basket Thats not like Days Michael Omar Bay who was saddled with foul issues in the first half The kick out Brian Atunu missing a three And here comes Justin Pippen for Cal Day Ames from deep and a three for Day Ames Well when he gives you that Roxy hes unstoppable He can get to the basket get to the rim get to the free throw line and shoot it But thats a big time take because now you got to guard him at the threepoint line Largest lead for Cal Ames his first career three in a Cal uniform after an 0 for three from outside the arc in the opener on Monday Michael Amari Bay trying to wheel his way inside and a long rebound tipped out to Solomon Callahan but shot clock rolling down Michael Cooper a desperation HEAVE RATTLES IN for three Great recognition from Michael Cooper I mean Roxy you got to know the time the clock at all times And he knew it and he nailed it Second three for Cooper Hes got 10 now And the lead down to six Chris Bell cutting the basket and a pretty fine from Day Wow what a great curl cut Thats a great read The mans on your hip You dont come out on the floor You curl to the basket 67 his size Thats a way to play Firing a three with some space Brian Atunu but the offensive rebound The kick out Michael Cooper missing a three There is Lee Dort hustling for the rebound Cal controls Ames who took the game over on Monday in the second half and asserting himself early in the second half here against Wright State and a whistle away for the ball and its Solomon Callahan holding Day Ames Well Cals moving well without the ball and theyre causing right state to foul When you move without the ball on the off side you know defenders have to get in you and and thats how they drew fouls Foul actually was on Brian Atunu as Justin Pippen gets inside then missed the layin Made a pretty move and just didnt finish And that will result in a foul on Lee Dort his second And that will put Michael Amari Bay at the line for Right State Yeah you talk about Za Ames and and Justin Pippen getting two drives to the basket just kind of hurrying themselves again taking their time drawing a foul if you want it I think players playing a little quick a little bit out of control early in the season but theyre veteran players Theyll get theyll be theyll get that Michael Omari Bay a transfer from Houston Christian Two shots for Amari Bay Second year at Wright State after one year at Houston Christian and two years at a junior college for Amari Bay cheering And he goes one for two from the line His first point of the ball game He had 13 in the opener against Franklin College on Monday Justin Pippen drives and Justin Pippen that time gets it to go Yeah night and day Roxy took his time used his off hand went under control Well he you know what when you go to the layups Roxy you got to go up You cant go out You dont broad jump to the basket You high jump He ele elevated up high off the glass Much better look screaming cheering There is Michael Omari Bay Backing in against Lee Dort Blocked by Dort Pulled down John Camden Yeah tough guy to go over the top of Nice defense by Dort Day Ames hits the trailer CAMDEN WIDE OPEN THREE IN THE TRANSITION Trailer and the bucket from Camden Thats a weapon Roxy When he trails a break and they push it up he trails Youve got to get out on him He will destroy you from threepoint Largest lead for Cal cheering So but Cal made one three the entire first half Theyve made two in the first three plus minutes of the second half Michael Cooper cheering left open Michael Amari Bay way off on the three and Chris Bell grabs it for count Justin Pippen too strong Lee Dorothy offensive rebound Hes got a mismatch against Solomon Callahan Looks to take it at him and he was looking for a call Didnt get it And the rebound pulled down by Brian Lunu for right side Yeah youre right Roxy He did have a mismatch Probably could have gotten a little deeper into the hole Michael Cooper has it blocked Stolen Justin Pippen weaves his way up the floor A good job by Dor going straight up verticality Great job John Camden Fade away and the rebound Michael Cooper for Wright State Cooper looks to attack cheering in the corner Left open and a three for Solomon Callahan Timeout right state Yeah great play Dribbled penetration spot up in the corner Roxy thats texting But how about Lee Dort holding his own up front going straight up getting a piece of the ball How about that And how about Camden from three trailing to break Just nothing Ames tonight 12 points Ninepoint lead for Cal and Ames leading all scorers with 12 after Ames had 18 in the opener And now some fullcourt pressure from the Raiders Go Here is Justin Pippen and a foul on the floor on the drive Its on TJ Burch and the second foul on Bur of Wright State 1504 to go Cal by nine over Wright State music in Berkeley Darien Williams the transfer from Texas Tech to NC State as Day Ames had a clean look and the rebound pulled down by Sam Alamutu for right state Dominic Pangonus on the drive Alamutu cant finish the rebound Justin Pippen then gets tied up and the help ball will stay at this end and a right state ball Yeah good hustle by right state Smelled an opportunity and kept the possession alive Baseline throw in 20 on the shot clock for the Raiders And the foul is Andre Holden driving and its on Milos Elich of Cal his first Yeah thats the one I think if youre right state the one area you might attack obviously trying to get Elich you know oneonone and then drive because you got four other guys in the Cal defense Pretty tough Stepping inside and a whistle and Andre Holden is fouled A late call the right call second on Reedus Petritus and its Andre Holden at the line for the Raiders cheering First trip to the line for Holden He was 0 for one at the line against Franklin on Monday cheering And one more for Holden as the foul line issues continuing for Clint Sergeant and Wright State Theyre five for 11 from the line tonight Yeah they just they werent very good in their opener and its continuing to plague them cheering and Holden splits the pair Sophomore from Hamilton Ohio Cals got a pretty good size lineup on the floor Chris Bell and hes fouled on the pullup jumper and hell get two free throws Now thats a hard play to defend if youre guarding Chris Bell Roxy he comes off that curl cut and hes 67 So you can be on his hip trying to guard him but hes going to get the ball and go over the top of you I mean lets watch him He He knows hes being guarded so he curls sheds his defender gets up in the air and hes up there and you have to chase him from behind Thats a good good call by the Cal Bench and its also a good play by for Chris Bell Third foul on Dominic Pangonus Bell now three for three at the line Hes got seven Just over 14 minutes to go as Wright State playing in California for the first time since they played in the NCA tournament down in San Diego back in 2022 when they lost to Arizona Yeah remember that They got there twice in NCAA in the recent couple years Theyve been four times to the division one NCA tournament as Wright State elevated back in 1987 from division 2 Chris Bell pulls down the Sam Alamutu miss They were a division 2 power They won a division 2 national championship back in 1983 Theyve had some really good coaches come through their program as Clint Sergeant in his second year now But Scott Naggie who is now at Southern Illinois and thats who Sergeant took over for Ed Schilling is now the coach of Pepperdine Eddie yeah Eddie was at Wright State Paul Biancardi ESPNs national recruiting director and Ralph Underh Hill who I coached against Uh really good coach I mean back in the day when they transitioned and Brad Brownell coach their rights day and theyve got quite a homecourt advantage there You wouldnt get to Dayton I wish theyd play Dayton Im going to shout it out right now Come on Coach Grant Come on coaches Make it happen Double figures for Bell Three rims out for Brian Atunu Cal whos equal their largest lead 1320 to play on the drive Justin Pippen as its stripped by Michael Cooper will stay at this end and it belongs to the Golden Bears and Fairborn Ohio Thats where Wright State is from just outside of Dayton Yeah right there I mean thats and they get a they get some following Thats its a great basketball town as you know A steal Here comes TJ Burch for the Raiders Goes to the basket and a nice move by Burch How about TJ Burch Roxy And and thats not a fluke He averages four ste I mean he gets about three four steals a game He he can do that four in his last game Transfer from Ball State the Dallas native Justin Pippen going back at him Bumped off balance Gets the roll and one Justin Pippen Well hes determined Roxy He got to the rim the last couple times and didnt complete it like he can But he showed you this ability even in the first half to absorb contact gets his man gets his defender in the air Hes clever Gets a piece of his body Good body control Scores it Chance for a threepoint play Third foul on TJ Burch Pippen who has seven points tonight six rebounds four assists And and one free throw coming up The transfer from Michigan You know Cal continues to show you their ability Roxy to parade to the free throw line They did it as you mentioned all of last year And theyre doing it again with authority this year And Justin Pippen buries the free throw And dad is here again tonight I know he likes what he sees Speaking of defense one of the greater offensive players of our time in the history of the NBA Largest lead for Cal Michael Cooper cheering and Justin Pippen breaks up that pass It goes out of bounds Nine on the shot clock for the Raiders Well you want to get down to a a short clock The last thing you want to do is foul but you know you know the teams going to put up a a shot You just got to contest and then rebound Michael Cooper off the inbound Rims out a three Justin Pippen pulls it down Reus Petritus attacks gets to the bucket What an opportunistic player Roxson Weve talked about that He just comes in Hes instant energy Energetic energizer Michael Amari Bay goes baseline powers his way up and one for Amari Bay Well thats a big time move there A lot of strength States going to depend on him as this year goes on to do that Hes strong Third foul on Reus Petritus and the N1 free throw for Amari Bay One for two at the line tonight cheering And the rebound Justin Pippen for the Bears Heres a 131 zone again deployed by Right State Justin Pippen launches way off of the three Goes right to John Camden who puts it in Well thats the danger of the 131 Sometimes you dont have great rebounding position because you got a lone player along the baseline You got to crash from the wings Thats applause on Cal very cheering often if you missed it Michael Cooper the floater and a nice move by the freshman Well you get the feeling he can do that pretty much anytime he wants as well Good looking freshman Roxy He leads the Raiders with 12 131 again Theyre going to try to trap out of it this time John Camden rebound Liberus Petritus has it blocked and pulled down by Michael Cooper for Wright State Good hustle by Wright State I thought they were done on that play and they managed to stay in it And the roll it goes for Logan Woods Youre Mark Madson now You might want to call a timeout Well see what he does Lets his guys play which you can do too And a foul a bump on the perimeter Second on Logan Woods 1043 to go 5544 Cal leading right state How to use it music Why doesnt that surprise me All right All right You could help me Well if you had the ESPN app on your phone you could see the leading scorers for Cal There you go Day Ames John Camden 12 points each Three in double figures as of now Cal with an 11point lead here 10 and a half minutes to go Reus Petritus bumped in the third on Michael Lamari Bay and Mark Madson letting his guys kind of play through when right state starting to make a little bit of a push As a coach when do you look to take that timeout maybe to stop a run Well thats a great question and you know I didnt suggest that he should have called a timeout And in retrospect he was probably right because he knew he had the next TV timeout So you do want to let your players play through that but you know theres no magic number You Its just a flow and you got to know your team And I think Mark Madson knows his team But I I think that was a good move The TV timeout came and now they can regroup It is Petritus now 0 for three from the Lion Michael Omari Bay isolated backing his way in against Dort and then lost it going up Last touch by Dort Right State with six on the shot clock Yeah Dorts done a great job Roxy I think a year ago he fouls His discipline his ability to stay calm under pressure and just play smart You can see the difference Theres a two3 on out of bounds under open three short from Brian Atunu and Cal the rebound The Bears push it and look to attack in a hurry I like this hurry up offense after the miss I really do Right State is 6 for 26 from three They have shot 26 threes but only 22s tonight Mismatch inside Lee Dort guarded by the much smaller Solomon Callahan as Day Ames gets to crawl off the front edge of the rim cheering applause State wanted to travel there Saw a little bit of that foot slide but thought otherwise And a foul on Cal on the outside and its on Lee Dor his third You know its interesting Roxy watching Cal play defense and Lee Dord reminded of Mark Madson cheering Well heres a replay You can see yeah he might have been a little bit of slip and slide but Mark Madsons going to let his guys go oneonone in the post unless they cant And that was a Mark Mike Montgomery trait He really believed his post guys could guard you oneonone So if they can and they can defend you that really puts less pressure on your on your teammates to have to come out there and guard people on the perimeter And a foul on the inbound pass And its on John Camden of Cal his third Foul starting to mount for Cal Canton has three Dort with three Reus Petritus with three Well the good news they have depth Bad news you dont want to put right in the bonus to let them climb back in this game Corner jumper short from Solomon Callahan And here comes Nolan Dorsy Dayday Ames has some space and knocks it down Roxy hes been lethal from back there You go underneath the screen against Dayday Ames hes saying Huh you cant do that against me Im going to make you pay And he did Second three for Ames tonight 17 now for Day Ames And that one missed from Dominic Pangonus on the reload and a three Michael Cooper Who else You give him an opportunity hell hell destroy you from the perimeter He can knock down shots as well And the freshman leads the Raiders with 15 Yeah hes had a good good basketball game tonight Army Lee Dort cheering attacks Roxy how about the show and go Now you see me now you dont Great deception Back the other way Solomon Callahan for the Raiders cheering Throws up a wild shot Pulled down by Dort Cal running cheering Dorsy down the lane John Camden in transition Rattles out the three and the rebound pulled down Logan Woods for the Raiders That had brought the house down in that shot Great look in transition Mari Bay slides inside and lays it in Timeout Raiders All right big fella Show us Show us what you got How about Lee Dorton on the drive to the rim Nobody at home Thats two the easy way was the one who initiated it and he changed his diet and he really made an emphasis on wanting to be in the best possible shape for his senior year Well and the coaching staff will tell you you you you can draw a map for the players but they got to follow it Its got to be on them and hes done that He really took pride himself Aaron passed by Pippen a steal and then Pippen cheering strips it out of bounds as Dominic Pangonus going up for a layin Well he had to make that steal just to make up for the for the turnover And hes mad at himself Roxy Uh just a little bit relaxed A little errant pass and could have led for a basket which would have cut this deficit big time Brian Atunu from deep and a three for Atunu Second three for Aunu tonight 10point game inside Seven to go Yeah John Camden so clever against presses zones He knows where to get to on the floor as a passing entree Heres that zone again by right state See if to shoot for Ames John Camden fires and the rebound grabbed by Wright State and Andre Holden Good defense by Wright State going back to the zone You get a bucket here It gets a little interesting cheering And Pangonus off balance will get to the line And a foul on Cal Well right States doing a good job Roxy of attacking And when Cal comes to help theyre finding open guys But you can see heres the penetration And thats the fourth on Lee Dort Well thats a big foul and hes probably going to have to sit down Youre not going to want him to go out of this game with with six minutes plus to go So Elich is coming back in to spell him cheering One more for Dominic Pangonus Yeah I thought that Lee Door did a pretty good job you know early avoiding picking up fouls but you know when youre the big guy and youre the last stand at the basket you got to kind of pick up your teammates but you can get in foul trouble Rattles out and the rebound There is John Camden for Cal Well they had Dam streaking down the basket Missed him Right State back in the man of man Jay Ames drives Ames and cheering one Roxy Theyve had it pretty good recipe when Dao give the ball to Dayday Oh my goodness Has he had a basketball game today getting to the rim is he just changes speed so well I mean the the hesitation Watch his ability to lull his man and then just take off to the basket Its so important if youre a guard and Justin Pippen does it too You change speeds Dont play at one speed Third on Logan Woods And here is Ames at the line So after Ames had 18 in the opener hes got 20 tonight He put up a careerhigh 27 with Virginia against Pit last year cheering Cal good cheering job pressing getting back to hand man Switch ball schemes cheering And a three for Logan Woods Well they didnt get out on that one Roxy They had been switching ball screens That was not a switch And they paid the price Woods is a good shooter Yeah hes a great last year 46 on his threes Chris Bell goes baseline and met at the rim and a foul And Bell will shoot a pair Oh I like the aggression Roxy He He didnt come down with the with the dunk but he said You know what Im going to get there Im going to put this one poster somebody Posterize somebody Here it is He took off and a fourth on Michael Omari Bay Now that was a good foul You cant let Bell go to the game go to the line and put this game away with a big time dunk Calls in for Chris Bell Cal again just continuing Roxy to get to the line and maintain this lead Theyve done it both halves and Bell hits both Theyll get a breather here Cal up 11 521 to go Well right State just wants to get this thing again under 10 cheering you know single digits two or three possession game Cals trying hard now not to let that happen Right States been operating relatively deliberately tonight using a lot of clock At what point do they need to pick it up and start playing a little bit more aggressively They will Amari Bay and one they will Roxy but they you know again youre not going to give Cal youre not going to press Cal because theyre pretty good with the basketball and then give up easy shots So theyve got to you know they got to play pretty much deliberately on offense not give it away Thats It could have gone either way there Thats a charge Good job trying to sell the charge but referee say Nope play on Threepoint play opportunity Called the foul on Elich his second but it really was Dorsy that should have been called for the foul Yeah And Amari Bay hits the and one free throw Well theres the we talked about now Its a two threep possession game So if youre Cal you got to really try to score again or get back to the free throw line And El cant handle the pass Cal a turnover cheering This is their eighth tonight El didnt like it in his ankles I think he wanted it up top That pass will get delivered probably a little higher as the year goes on but he was wide open It was a good look Might have been deflected as well Michael Cooper a deep three and the offensive rebound Brian Aunu in the kickout reload Logan Woods missing from deep and cleaned up by Dominic Pangonus And now you got the two possession game we talked about This is just where Right State wants to be 420 remaining cheering Justin Pippen and a foul on the drive and Pippen is hunched over and grimacing a bit Double bonus for Cal the 10th team foul in Wright State Yeah thats a foul He doesnt call a foul Thats a travel But the foul caused the travel cheering And once again Justin Pipman is at the free throw line Second on Michael Cooper And I like Roger just whispered in Justins ear say Hey take your time Get your breath back Veteran official Rattles in for Justin Pippen Wish officials were that nice to me and my players Roman was Roger when I needed him But thats a big time You were stuck with guys like Dave Libby No Dave Libby was actually pretty good to me But I I got to tell you better on the road by the way But uh No I The best is when he tried to give you a technical foul here because of an earthquake Yeah I said Dave theres an earthquake He said Oh my bad Nobodys having cheering Yeah I said theres a technical Theyre moving the basket I said They should be Theres an earthquake You remember that We had fun cheering and applause Nice pick and roll And Amari Bay is clobbered Go to the line And thats a good foul because he was about to get a dunk or a basket Got a good one Free throws coming up for the Raiders Four minutes to go Cal 69 Wright State 61 Night before big game Sack State Mike Bby the head coach of the Hornets And then a showdown over the Chase Center in San Francisco against UCLA And it rolls in for Michael Amari Bay cheering Nine for Amari Bay tonight cheering And he hits both And its a sixpoint game Two possession game Roxy Cals in the basketball game And in danger of a 10second call Justin Pippen gets the timeout A heady play to realize that two days early They were here Theyre resting So with the timeout fresh 10 seconds to get it across if they wanted it Yeah another zone Another one 131 Look Justin Pippen splits it and the kick Chris Bell missing a corner three and the rebound tipped free and grabbed by Michael Amari Bay for right state Well the 131 has done well for right state They had good looks Chris Bell from the corner wide open three Theyll take that cheering Dominic Pangonis cheering and an offensive foul on Pangonus Lower the shoulder into Chris Bell Thats a big time play by Chris Bell I mean they were about to get there for another score I mean he gets beat on the drive slides his feet stands up straight and takes the charge Big play by Chris Bell Huge fourth foul on Pangonus cheering And just getting it across avoiding the 10second call Heres Chris Bell Drives Bell leans in and an offensive foul on Bell Well they may review this one Roxy I I think the defender was in the cylinder I dont know now if they can hear this This is uh interesting Yeah the foot He was inside Lets see Id like to take another look at that one Wow First on Bell And it goes to Wright State with three minutes to go in a sixpoint game Yeah thats a thats a tough break against Cal cuz they scored that one Michael Cooper Pull up from the elbow by Cooper Roxy hes a player I mean he just goes into traffic and scores it Now Day Ames the oneman press break right there Well youre up four now You want to get a good shot or see if you can draw another foul Heres Bell AMES LEFT OPEN RATTLES IN a three cheering Day Ames with 23 Roxy thats a huge huge shot by Days He misses that Right State can come down and narrow this thing to two or one Heres Cooper again Michael Lamari Bay cheering Lee Dort playing with four fouls Good defense And the rebound kept alive by the Raiders Theyre smart to go with Dort Heres Amari Bay and the cutting Dominic Pangonus rams it in Tremendous find for the you watch John Camden out there talking to Justin Pippen Two new players but theyre talking the game about where to go against the press Its a luxury to have a player like John Camden whos going to find open areas but you just dont want to turn it over You got to be sure with the basketball and try to get a good look to the basket on on the offensive end Heres press fullcourt pressure from the Raiders Pippen gets it across and a foul is called on Michael Cooper And now well put Cal the line for two Thats the last thing that Wright State wants to And you can tell coach Sergeant not happy about that He just You just dont want to foul there You didnt get the steal Youre along the 10 you know And I think hes going to the official side I wasnt trying to foul No you werent trying to foul but you did So third on Michael Cooper and Justin Pippen now five for five from the line Well we said this before but if Cal can take care of the basketball they can salt some games away They got guys that can knock down shots at the free throw line And Justin Pippens one of them 23 for 27 from the line tonight for Cal Yeah thats thats been the difference in this game I like Cal kind of upping the pressure a little bit cheering Theyre not sitting back making right steak take a little time coming up the floor Michael Cooper on the baseline Lost it Nolan Dorsy comes away with it and hell look to milk a little clock Smart play Looked to see if you can get an easy one You dont have it now Clock Day Ames Yeah good move by Day Bring it back out Wheel this thing Get the clock down as far as you can Ames drives Tries to drop it off for Dort and throws it away Yeah I should have shot it Here comes Michael Cooper for the Raiders Final minute Cal by seven Dominic Pangonus launching and the

Dort And Dort fouled and Michael Amomar Bay has fouled out for Right State Yeah cant worry about fouling out Cant worry about you know do you get a steal dont get it You just dont have enough time left in this game possession wise So you got to foul Again this is early in the season Teams will get this coach a long way from the action He cant You can yell it out as a coach Foul foul foul But your players have to know that you you go over this in practice You cant yell this out late game situation you know youre down 30 seconds You got to foul and play the foul game uh and try to get back One more for Lee Dor You know again Roxy Cal is going to you know get this game and they had to work and theres nothing wrong with that You games arent supposed to be easy You think they are but

strong on the three Justin Pip in the rebound and hes fouled with 26 seconds to go and Dominic Pangonus has fouled out for Right State Yeah nice game by Pangonus But Right State will learn something from this game as well Roxy they they played hard They gave Cal all they wanted in this game and they can take this back home and into their league Theyre going to be tough They come from a good conference but this is going to be a team you got to reckon with Two shots for Pippen And one more coming as Justin Pippen now seven for seven from the line And Cal has been knocking down their free throws tonight And he gets the roll Were you nervous for me after I talked about how well theyre shooting from the line Well I told you theyd come around cheering D the rebound Thatll do it And the
