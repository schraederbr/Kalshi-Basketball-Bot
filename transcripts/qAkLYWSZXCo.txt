Clemson coming in 21 and 10 Boston College 18 and 14 you always wonder in tournament Play When a team already has a victory whos wearing the slipper I tell you what it worked out well for the wolf pack earlier today Im sure the Eagles are trying to get some of that similar magic here in DC Clon coming in to number six seed BC the number 11 Joe Gerard zipping the pass and off the front of the IR and that wont drop great execution by the Tigers on the first possession however got a great look for Jack Clark from Beyond threepoint line just unable to knock it down Zachary picking up the dribble the point guard post with the first one got that one to go that was smooth but I love the aggressiveness early by Quinton post putting PJ Hall on notice this is what its going to be like between us tonight however Quinton post not defending PJ Hall back out heres Hall and he answers with a triple and as much as I love Quinton post initiation I love the response by PJ Hall if anything you can do I can do better because Quinton post was for two PJ went for three they played right into your open the BC starting lineup that includes Mason Madson and quinc post along with mofin and Zachary and claudell Harris and Boston College getting it to the big again to take a 43 lead heres Gerard averaging 16 points a game Joe Gerard former Syracuse star really had a fine season for the Tigers off the back of the Iron by Hunter and we want to talk about fine season the accs most improved player Ian shefflin doing what he does best an offensive rebound getting his team a second chance opportunity hes got it backing it down into the lane over the top but post really stuck with him Applause and a collision and thatll go the other way in the first two minutes of play these two big guys going toe to toe and trying to top each other yeah they opened up action going at each other Quinton post with the jump shot over top of PJ Hall to start the game and then taking it to the block already four points with Quinton po but he picks up a first foul on PJ Hall with a great defensive stand Clark gives it up for Hall Gerard on the curl trying to slice inside he hits the deck no whistle there Bill cumington Clarence Armstrong and Mark Schnur are officials here for the last game of the day Zachary back for post this is way downtown theyll get another chance at it post hits 44 from three by the way rebound comes to Gerard Obie let me tell you who has the biggest advantage throughout this game as Joe Gerard comes off unable to knock down the three that would be one Boston College eagle head coach Earl Grant who was an assistant for Brad Brownell before taking over the job at Charleston so he understands a little more about what Brownell wants to do post again that glance is off thats right spent four years there yes he did alongside brat and a slam on the other end by Hall on a massive strike by the Tigers however when he was there Brad Brownell they didnt have PJ Hall so theres no answer for what he does contesting the shot getting out in transition in great hands to come up with the big finish they did have KJ McDaniels they had a lot of good players they had a lot of very good players KJ McDaniels Elite defensively post nice pass and mat in the finish that is and you can see both these teams play through their bigs youll find their big men at the top of the key making plays for themselves and for their teammates on many their offensive sets well they met once this season Boston College lost to Clemson in January 8978 but Quin post did not play in that game he was out of the flu thats a big Miss heres Gerard with a feathery touch hell knock it down to put the Tigers back in front and I have said about both PJ Hall and Quinton post at some point this season these are the best two players that no one is talking about nationally now you have opportunity to see these two guys go at it theyve got gotten off to a great start man you look at their numbers and how valuable they have been to their teams they should be talked about post looking for Zachary to get free shot clock down to three Zachary someones got to get a shot in the air he does and he cant hit it theres a whistle and a foul in the paints and we are under 16 for the timeout Quinton post getting the party started not only with the scoring but also dropping the DME confidence team that they can make some noise in this tournament theyre using their Mantra that theyve used all season gritty not pretty when I talked with Coach Grant he said this is a Fighters place he understands that if youre not gritty its hard to survive in this league he said I have a team thats full of Underdog so he said theyre not highly recruited as players he said they understand how they have to do this together how they have to play with a chip on their shoulder every single night and trying to do that in this tournament guys OB I believe that you can be both gritty and pretty I I would like for them to go together for me personally you know you and I over here were gritty but I than fretty also I thought I was gritty and you were I thought thats how people referred to us as a broadcast team gritty and pretty I had no idea well I well say angel is both then well allow Angel to be both about that okay fair enough Boston College on top 87 quick start out of Quinton post the two bigs have shown up Hunter outside RJ Godfrey now in the game heres hunter from the corner got a good look ta to Applause Post BC a team that takes good care of the basketball only about 10 and a half turnovers a game a solid offensive unit and the point guard will knock it down zadan Zachary its about 38 Jaden Zachary at 62 OB the Eagles and I refer to him as J j z feel free to call him JayZ whenever you choose he he will answer to JayZ which means that we can call him that on TV in my world theres only one JayZ but thats okay off the front of the Iron by sheflin expecting this one to be a dog fight between these two as post off the fake will kick it Applause out shot clock to 10 Madson back to the big shot clock at three a loose ball and never got a shot up great defensive stand by the Tigers now with numbers trying to get something to transition Miss Wiggins under the basket wide Applause Music Applause open Wiggins hes 610 and theyre going to say an offensive foul on him on chony Wiggins the soft bar of Grayson Georgia T Wiggins ran the floor and was wide open under the basket they missed him underneath and then he has to go into backing it down as you mentioned hes 610 however hes not a post player hes a shooter a perimeter player with a lot of skill and you see gets the offensive foul trying to get into scoring position did a big win early in the season against Memphis he had 19 in that one so he can really be a factor tiger with some very impressive wins post straight on will drill another one hes cooking early he is a miscommunication defensively in the pick and roll coverage giving Quinton post too much space and you cannot allow him too good of a shooter nine points for the BC star nice tip there by Zachary yes into the corner for the jumper and too strong clud Harris Off the Mark but theyll get another opportunity post for Harris he finds the lane and hell draw the contact he was really hunting that he was love that decision by claudo Harris of course as the three has fallen for him but deciding to attack the basket and thats exactly what Earl Grant wants thats the grit part of it not trying to do it on the pretty standpoint and if anyone knows about that Brad Brownell would be the coach now in his 14th season as the Clemson head coach this year does not have to worry about being on the bubble his team is in the NCAA tournament a great great nonconference had the best win of the ACC in the nonconference going to Alabama and knocking off the Crimson Todd on their home floor also beat Duke also beat Memphis some really nice wins they should have gone last year yes they should have gone last year but that that has been part of the narrative and I love the fact that Brad Brownell had the conversation with Scott Manel really unveiling the secrets of how to manipulate the net yes you said you look at all those big 12 teams theyve been doing it for a while Im glad you called him out so I didnt have to Ive been doing it all year long BC on a 10 nothing run Tigers trying to end that under feeding the post and thats going to be waved off bill cumington has a stoppage in play and a whistle and a personal foul thats going to go against post and thats his second thats going to be his second foul and thats Quinton post was so surprised by that call bra aty North Carolina Duke Clemson Virginia Virginia last four in wake at the moment first four out but they won today and pit among the next four out Pits a very dangerous team I believe they absolutely are and again this is a without the narrative you talk about that there being at least seven teams from the ACCC in the NCAA tournament God for a second chance uses the glass nicely now when you want to talk about an interior presence it would be RJ Godfrey he is a man in the paint its 68 looks bigger than that plays bigger than that Music Applause yes haris with a long rainbow but it wont drop rebound Tapped Out high for the Tigers heres Hunter try to close this Gap 16 to9 against Boston College get out of here Hall had to chase it Wiggins from the corner much too strong Boston College after thumping Miami last night 8165 ended the hurricane season Miami ending the season on a 10 game losing streak yeah impressive performance by the Eagles and impressive by JayZ coming off the screen no help there is able to raise up knock down the midrange jumper Quinton post at 30 and 13 in that one not a bad nights work OB no sir on the spin Godfrey will draw the foul as he went hard to the goal hell be followed pass thinking ahead one two passes ahead and saying its going to come from this better angle you also want to see where his feet are in the paint to make sure that he has a no move needed look to the rim Angel as a point guard what is The Telltale sign to when the big man is supposed to get the basketball what is it that that you look at I look at his feet the angle into which he wants the ball and you have to look at the numbers if you cant see the numbers from the side it is not your pass exactly but when you see those numbers square that big man working so hard has to get the basketball as a scoring point guard even I know that that was the only time I would throw it otherwise you come out here you set this screen from me OB its my time to rock I I knew that without ever playing with you you know its amazing how that happens but thats a thats a great tip about when to throw that yes great tip you see those numbers they have to get it they have worked way too hard to not give them the basketball BC by eight and the Music Applause Music Applause basketball Zachary will launch this one rebounded away by the Tigers the winner to face the number three seed the University of Virginia 930 tomorrow knocked down by PJ Hall coming in at 19 points game and a great feed when youre talking about the big to Big passing not quite a high low however Godfrey delivering it on point to PJ Hall who made one of those quick moves as Angel was talking about he was ready to go as soon as he got the basketball in his hand BJ a finalist for the Kareem Abdul Jabar award which goes to the top Center in college basketball and Junior gives it up shot clock at Music five leag bay and blocked tough defense by Godfrey Gerards been pretty quiet now getting noisy thats more of my type of play right there OB when you come down the floor there is no big man in the lane clogging it up however the defense retreating and you see them backpedaling you know thats a perfect time to pull up especially when youre a guy thats made 389 threepoint field goals in his career 2000 points boy its a tough angle by Mike cant get it to go VC with another chance in the corner the long one that wont drop off Target by hand on the basine Oh missing the slam a Le B got to pick him up in the lane and a whistle as Beetle will draw the f with 949 to go in the half thatll go against Mighty his first great find as you see Godfrey catch at the center but look look at the numbers you can see 24 clear as day hes got great position RJ garrey delivering the strike to PJ Hall who has the nice turnaround touch knocking down the bucket puts the freshman at the line Josh Beetle and he will drop in number one Ian shefflin coming back on now for the Clemson Tigers accs most improved player and all ACC honorable Applause Music Applause mention and Beetle makes the pair so this is become a onepoint game an eight nothing Run for the Applause Tigers but this has happened remember Quinton post picking up that second foul hes been on the bench going to be interesting to see how long Earl Grant feels as though he can go without his Star Center who got off to such a great start here in this game eight to shoot Madson curls in the lane probably should have shot that down to two underneath oh Big Time block at a whistle as that one is knocked out and a foul on the play tell you what that foul had to be with the body cuz from here it looked clean up top all with a personal take a look DJ Hall coming Music across I guess it was some some arm in there I guess okay M glockton makes number one hes a 71 foul sure give that one another look yeah lets look at it its a whole lot of basketball though regardless but he does get him with the body Deon mton the 67 sophomore drains that Boston College by three Tigers a solid offensive team 78 points a game theyre another team that doesnt turn it over much Gerard Gane had it stripped heres Han junor finding the lane pretty play he drove it all the way in yeah Donald Han Jr attacking the reputation as a shooter but you see has the ability to go off the bounce young man playing in his first year after tearing his ACL last season on the Baseline that one tipped away Clark couldnt get it to go and Eagles doing a great job keeping Ian shefin off the offensive glass got one early but theyve done a great job keeping a body on him when shots go up BC playing gritty as angel said that was the directive and they certainly are Zachary looking for someone to open up here with five on the shot clock hes going to have to drive it got it inside and a clean block that time by Hall and great job by Hall going straight up not allowing those arms to fold over and pick up a foul ball will turn and fire off the front iron one and done Applause there Boston College trying to build on a 2217 lead this our last game of the Music day here in our nations capital at Capital One and looking to drive and no basket there is f before that cuteness on the screen right now these two were locked in earlier on the screen not their personal screens but our screen when they got a chance to see themselves on television now working their tablets yes just adorable 747 to go 2217 Boston College and leading without Quinton post whos been out for a chunk after picking up a second foul BC Leed 167 got the ball back again the turnaround thats a nice shot by Donald Han who comes in averaging only five points a game but he can hit shots 37 beyond the three point line and he was on the finishing lineup for the Eagles in yesterdays Victory Earl Grant trusting Donald Han down the stretch and Donan Jr delivered a number of big plays for the Eagles Hunter on the drive but nope rebounded Away by claudell Applause Music Applause Harris BC trying to make it two for two and DC Madson way off balance he gets gets it back yeah mlin got away with a twoand push off in the back and it rattles in for Harris and it pays off Brad Brownell not happy about the fact that there was no call on that possession as mlin pretty much just pushed Chase Hunter out of the way nine nothing run sheing gets the entry working hard hell draw the foul as hes hit by Elijah strong and a 10point lead for BC and we talked about Quinton post with those two fouls but if youre Earl Grant and theyve extended the lead now what was nine now a 10point lead you keep Quinton post on the bench with those two fouls as long as you possibly can if you do not have to put him In Harms Way of getting that third foul before the second half you keep him on that sideline exactly what hes doing shefin with a second one coming 77 at the line makes one of now what I would say OB though if you get a dead ball with about 4 minute 20 seconds remaining on the clock and you know you got that media timeout coming I may try to get Quinton post into the game just to make sure that he has some type of Rhythm remaining in this first half going get two stale locked it up top finds Harris shot clock to seven Harris with a little floater for two to Harris has been aggressive hes always aggressive on the offensive end though take taking his opportunities but I like the way hes attacked the basket not just settle for jump shots throughout this game tell you what Boston College looks very comfortable to be on this floor well Earl Grant had success coming into this tournament he was 32 in his first two years in the ACC now picking up another win of overall 42 and looking for another one here shefin needing help but he travels with it and thatll be turned over to BC theyre on top 2918 without their best player for such a long time Quinton post because of that second foul subbed out at 1301 with two fouls as you mentioned since BC has outscored Clemson to open up a 2918 advantage and thats a luxury to be able to keep your star on the sideline and not be concerned about your lead withering away while hes got those two fouls Harris with a triple yes the transfer from Charleston Southern the number two scor for the Eagles forces a timeout for Clemson itll be 30 seconds a 14 to1 run for BC in DC Brad Brownell can still rest assured that his team will be in the NCAA tournament they come into this tournament with a 26 net ranking five quad one wins which is second in the ACC tied with Duke only second in North Carolina to has six long way to go yet but that ones going to dribble out and thatll be off of BC with 526 to go in the half so brell looking for his team to respond here in these last 5 and a half minutes and OB as I say that Brad branell does not want to lose this game and he theres never a time he is one of the most competitive people you will meet he wants this win and every win that they can get winter faces Virginia thatll be tapped in control by the Tigers and Godfrey and OB to be completely honest Virginia has to be rooting for Clemson because its an opportunity for Virginia to get a quad one win Hunters triple will drop and Virginia right now sitting on the bubble if they get an opportunity to play against Clemson and Come Away with the win that would help their chances Applause Music significantly mlon Harris gives it up Applause strong hand now with a shot clocked down to four and he left it Music short Tigers looking for some flow on offense usually that means better than that where they usually dont turn it over another turnover for the Tigers as we look at Clemson the projected six seed right now but Virginia last for in so Im sure Virginia will love an opportunity to play against the Tigers they won their only matchup this season between the two going to Clemson and escaping with a onepoint Victory after building a huge lead North Carolina and FSU will get the day going at noon tomorrow in the quarterfinals Dan and J will have the call of that one and Junior clean block right back out for mads thats in a dangerous threepoint guy heres Harris as we approach the 4minute mark hell take a long shot cant drain that and itll be out here at 358 to go and we have a timeout at Boston College 3218 on the Tigers wait well I mean again if anyone knows how to get get that done it would be you my friend and of course you are more than the foodie you know all the the great spots to visit in whatever City youre in and as you often say of me if its free its for me so Ive never said that about you un four minutes to go off the inbounds look at it a quick strike is Harris but rebounded Away by shefflin well Earl Grant talked about be the Killer and right now Claud El Harris trying to deliver a killing blow right there out of the timeout all on the low block will get two to go just named First Team all ACC but they need a lot more of that I believe thats where they need to go play through PJ Hall especially with Quinton post on the bench with those two fouls make sure PJ Hall touches it pretty much on every possession offensively so 32 to 20 about three and a half minutes to go you wonder is ear Grant thinking about bringing post back in again its fairly comfortable right now shot loock down to two Zachary gets it from threepoint land well when youve got JayZ stepping up and making big buckets you can keep Clinton post on the sideline and I know now why you will not refer to him as JayZ because you met the the original the original I was thrilled now when you met the original did you tell him that you were the notorious do because of course his guy was the Notorious BIG but funny it didnt come up off the Iron by Hall but I was so impressed to whistle here now thats going to be the second foul on PJ Hall number two on the senior so hes going to have to step out but those are the fouls he has to stay away from understanding you missed a shot so be it but youre not going to be able to compound anything other than the mistake by reaching you have no chance of getting that basketball PJ you got to stay on the floor to help your team get back into this now 15 down Applause M glockton looking for help strong picked up the dribble as well heres Harris Harris with a Nifty spin the reverse wont go though that would have been a thing of beauty in transition Chase Hunter Airborne that wont drop it a whistle 22 to go and Clemson whenever you see a young man or one young woman playing this game and when theyre holding the back of their head after a fall always concerning RJ Godfrey looking as though hes okay but taking a hard fall sophomore from Swani Georgia the son of the longtime NFL linebacker Randle Godfrey gy attacking the offensive rebound oo yeah staying in the game I think that toughness runs in the family I believe so by the way his dad was a Dallas Cowboy so of course of course youd mention that naturally follow is up andand in 3522 sheflin with the bucket thats always one of the things at the top of the Scouting Report when you play against the Clemson Tigers youve got to find a way to keep in shefflin off the offensive glass get Second Chance points on that Applause possession going to be knocked out of play by Clemson off of Clark in the end 143 to go before the Applause break and the two star big men are on the bench PJ Hall and Quinton post post has been a long sit after picking up his second foul with about 13 and 12 minutes to go but being able to rest comfortably as his team still holds on to a 13point lead haris way downtown clangs away but whenever you follow you a shot like that batt it out to Harris Clemson could not convert on The Fast Break Zachary finds the lane opening up thats its going to be blocked by shefflin itll stay on this end shefflin with a tough defensive play PJ Hall staying vertical playing to this basketball intelligence and then not a smart play on this one knowing how important you are to your team just trying to reach over picks up that second foul and now has to miss the remainder of this first half while his team is trailing by double digit smart play there by Ill call him Jaden Zachary just this time Jaden Zachary to get the foul and get to the free throw line Godfrey his second personal Zachary good foul shooter 83 had 16 points in their victory over Miami in round one such a reliable point guard he hardly ever turns it over just 62 of them all season long thats in 32 games minute 19 before halftime and the junior makes the pair so BC ahead 3722 you see eight of eight from the free throw line OB thats another ADV manag this is a good shooting team and when theyre shooting the three well is when theyre really spectacular turns and fires and drops it in like rolling out of bed for him yeah speaking of shooting the three well this guys done it now for five years in the ACC four for the orange and now one for the Clemson Tigers all ACC honorable mention Joe Gerard how poetic was it that he went over 2000 points in Syracuse against the orange scored his 2000 point at the free throw line he led the ACC in free throw percentage this season haris with a step back and pop and an answer for Boston College DCs had an answer all night if theres anyone who has not minded Quinton post being on the bench its been Claud o Harris cuz hes gotten of a lot of looks but its taken advantage of a number of them as well 13 points now for Harris in this first half Boston College has played a terrific first half here on the floor of Capital One Arena Gerard looking to get hot here at the very end just hit a triple heres Hunter shot clock down to one Gerard trying to get it up there he did and he hit the shot the triple and thats the end of the half Obie we saw a similar mistake in the first game was buil a double digit lead Boston College LED 16 to7 when Quinton post went out with a second foul but BC without him still outscored the tigers by three points after that interesting to see how they approach this second half as he gets the basketball in his hands but 20 ft away from the basket nice F yeah quick strike getting it downstairs to glaudell Harris and a nice way for the second half to begin for the Eagles and we mentioned that both these big men will play a lot at the top of the key as we see PJ Hall doing the same initiating offense for their team almost playing as Point centers Gerard will dump it downstairs Clark eventually got it to go and to hang on the rim a little bit there to make sure too Austin College 18 and 14 they were 8 and 12 in the ACC they were often a handful post leaning in with a hook Here Comes Gerard out of the pack Clark will lay it up he cant finish it thats one you would love to see Jack Clark go stronger than that I understand the right foot right hand try to finish however I would have must prefer to see him take off with the left and dunk it as he tried on the last possession Eagles the number 11 seed the tigers at the number six seed so the Eagles looking for an upset here in round two and in pretty good shape post opening up in the second half lineup hell hook it up there and drop it in just great Touch by Quinton post not as strong down low as PJ Hall however tall baller and able to use that touch to get the bucket in the paint sevenfooter excellent shot blocker gets about two a game getting it downstairs for Hall as he tried to go to work and a whistle on the other side of the iron we enter this game looking at the big man matchup and you see them wrestling as Quinton post is trying to get post position does just that and then takes his time no help coming he can get to the jump hook able to finish over good defense of PJ Hall better offense for Clinton post Mason Matson with the personal to put Clark to the Applause line first half numbers Clemson their largest halftime deficit this season post with nine despite the limited playing time of the two fouls both sitting for the last last 13 minutes the largest deficit that Clemson has ever overcome to win an ACC tournament is 11 points they Trail 4635 in the first half in 1996 and beat North Carolina on a Greg Buckner dunk March 8th 1996 of course the great Tim Beret who supposedly retired but continues to send me information I appreciate that so much for retirement Tim but thank you heres post not there for him clar with a big Applause rebound Hunter racing up the floor back for Hall lets see if he gets hot here in the second half thats one way to do it he can be an absolute handful down there Harris with the catch on the other end and Zachary will set it up now for the Eagles now you see a 32 zone for Brad Brownell defensively trying to confuse the Eagles and then one thing about Coach Brownell you do this in the second half so Earl Grant cant prepare for it at halftime post Zachary Zachary with a midrange yes sir nice response moving the basketball Jaden Zachary continues to stay hot 10 first half points now gets his first bucket of the second half the averages 12 per game so hes right there Gerard hard from 17 for two Jo jard makes it look so easy especially you get to the 15 footer of course hes a 90 three free throw shooter so getting to the free throw line that is money for him Boston College by 10 Harris on the wing Deon mcglockton who averages 10 and six gets it back to Harris shot clock down to six BCs got to get a shot in the air heres Harris hes got a launch and Gerard Flags down to rebound thats important for the Tigers to limit Boston College to one shot in the first half of this game BC missed 21 shots however they got 10 of them back sheflin wants it it wont drop though got it up on the 10 it wouldnt fall BC looking for their second win in the tournament after beating Miami handily 8165 last night oh saw that one com oh oh my that was mcglockton going down hard and he gets back up thats three fouls now in PJ Hall thats going to make it a lot tougher 4636 BC off of the off of those offensive rebounds as well so he was saying the challenge to them was making sure they clean that clean that up it is tough seeing that PJ Hall picked up his third foul right before that break but for this team the challenge is to have more heart on the glass and see if they can contain them moving forward Angel as you watched that first half does this team look like a team thats content on the fact that they know theyre going to the NCAA tournament and they have not prep have not approached us as desperate as Boston College I think that that may be the case but I really do think think this is a team that understands that when they dont have PJ Hall on the floor as well and theyve really been disrupted on the offensive end you got to credit the Eagles too for being gritty something that we were talking about at the beginning of the game who wants it more and right now theyre fighting for a chance to be in the NCAA tournament as well and Zachary dropping in another one yeah OB I think theyve been gritty and pretty cuz theyve shot the basketball well theyve had style points to go along with their toughness now in the first 25 minutes of this game they show no backdown their coach Earl Grant talking before the game about that that theyve got nothing to lose everything to gain and this the first time Ive really seen Earl in somewhat of a defensive stance normally hes in the stance for the majority of the game Torres Achilles Last Summer so hasnt been as active on the sideline another tried to get it up there sh the will and sheflin with the basket the 68 junr for two shefin now with his third offensive rebound get some Second Chance points off of that one accs most improved player 10 points 10 rebounds a game post looking for help and draws the foul that one will go against Godfrey number three on RJ Godfrey Wake Forest with with a victory over Notre Dame 7259 today FSU impressive over the hokes eliminating Virginia Tech 8676 jir Watkins what a game 34 points 11 rebounds four steals in that victory yeah FSU record 34 points no seol has ever scored that much in an ACC Tournament game and when you think about the seols you got to go back to some Heavy Hitters you start thinking Sam Cassel Bob s Doug Edwards a lot lot of great players have put on that simol uniform but jir Watkins was able to do something today that none have ever done and NC State ran away from Syracuse in the second half in 83 to 65 EJ burns with 15 EJ horn with 16 and Jaden tayor with 18 they got really good balance rebound comes out High to BC on top 49 38 so we get ready for the quarterfinals and the top four seeds All In Action tomorrow on this Music floor and a whistle here and a foul which will go against Boston College Prince the league Bas 67 sophomore is Applause second and North Carolina will start it at noon time the number one seat against FSU then pit in Wake Forest at 230 and thatll be Duke and NC State and then Virginia and a winner of this one OB North Carolina started ACC play 9 and0 but if you go back to December the 2nd myself West Durham Jim beheim on the call Florida state had a double digigit lead in Chapel Hill Hubert Davis went to a full court press and thats how they came back and won that game and of course we watched North Carolina become a elite defensive team throughout this season but it all started in that game versus Florida State where they were down big and needed the pressure to be able to get Applause Music back Ill tell you what if that version of Watkins shows up it could be problems Quinton post backing in on sheflin good ball movement back up top for Harris got an excellent look hung on the iron but it wouldnt drop for him and out of Play It Goes Clemson just lost it but thats been the story of this game the Eagles have just been quicker to the 5050 ball for Bill self and the jhawks however hes hoping to have them back for the NCAA tournament where of course when youre the Kansas jhawks that means a lot more than winning a big 12 Championship Godfrey just picked up his fourth foul Brad brell not too happy with that and here comes PJ a 610 senior First Team all ACC back on the floor and this game is far from over 1302 remaining 11point game for as poorly as Clemson has played theyre still in Striking Distance Harris on the Spin A Little Fall away thats a pretty shot that is nice by clo Harris taking advantage of his size over Joe Gerard going into the post area and then the turnaround jumper Zachary sticking right with Gerard and the big fella got it up there Hall drawing the foul will be off to the line to shoot two where he makes 79 Clemson one of the best foul shooting teams in the ACC number three they make 79 as a team claudell Harris with the foul as you look at the Star Music Stories all this season with 28 20po Music games and we drop in number one and 13point game this season for PJ Hall is often times you would see hall and sheflin walking out of the game with double doubles these two guys were of force on the glass throughout this regular season however that has not been the case for them him this evening as Boston College has been the better team with the rebounding num now Halls best game of the season against Georgia Tech as you mentioned 31 points in January 17 Music Applause rebounds we still have plenty of time 12 12 minutes post Applause Zachary who played such a steady game off to Harris hell lift and knock it down claudell Harris can shoot it he has 20 tonight he has been the story here especially with Quinton po going to the bench it was claudell Harris that carried the Eagles in the first half and he is not slowed down at all in the second Chase Hunter looking to penetrate lost the handle and theyre going to turn it over its a 14point lead for Boston College showing no signs of backing down quarterfinals hold the rest of this one though still about 12 minutes left and Boston College has thoroughly outplayed Clemson to this point they absolutely have that as Quinton post comes over to hand me a piece of a pom pom off the floor Im not sure why why I was I mean but again I guess he figured what all the snacks and everything that I have over here and the trash over here with my trail mix and thats what he did he was cleaning up the floor yeah hes cleaning up the floor and just brings it over I thought he was coming over to I almost left him hanging I thought he was going to you know give me D but I was concerned Quin can you sign an autograph or something exactly 7 foot grad with it up high looking for Z nice pass Harris will lay it in how often have we seen not just Quinton post but PJ Hall also these two guys that the top of the key orchestrating the offense for their respective teams but post has dropped a number of Dimes throughout this game OB and one of the things weve got to mention when you start talking numbers PJ Hall who only had two rebounds Saturday at Wake Forest as we see post is doing it all hes cleaning up the floor he comes over to us and I think hes handing it to me Im like nah Im good Im not going to take that but he puts it on our table I guess this looks like the trash can right now be well I not sure how to take that yeah but PJ Hall no rebounds throughout this game so only two Saturday and none today those picked up foul number three by the way rebound popped around thought El Harris a big one for the Eagles to this point with 22 to lead the way and theyve got the ball back again BC theyve got their biggest lead once again playing through your big man at the top of the key allowing him to be able to set screens and if he would have got that one back I think he wanted to get a three up on that possession just wasnt giv the ball back in time looking at that shot clock down to two he Slams on the brakes and fires that didnt touch anything never got to the rim not many turnovers though for BC thats for sure they only had two in the first half theyve handled the basketball extremely well and Clemson has not been really able to put any type of pressure on them forcing them to miss handle the basketball therefore getting very few fast break points in this game so Zachary the point guard and Quinton post who is all ACC second team they get a chance to rest a little bit here ear Grant gets them out with a sizable lead lets see are they going to count that on the way through and they will not 1019 to go itll be foul number two on mton and Josh Beetle now in the game The Freshman for the Music Tigers so Clemson to check it in Chase Hunter well do a little work on the floor first a 16point lead for Boston College May 40 points for Clemson team that averages 78 points a game inbounded to Music Hall see the numbers he has to get it and theyll head to the line for a threepoint play yep PJ Hall showing the 24 now Quinton post on the bench and you see PJ Hall you can see the front of his jersey and as he sees it in shefflin knows that his Guy is available he puts it up to where only PJ Hall can get it all able to finish through the contact an opportunity for the M1 number two on Mason Madson Brad brell still working over there on that sideline knows theres time so Hall looking for the threepoint play 79 at the foul line and Applause Music connects Manson trying to get it across nearly turned it over Thon wanting a travel when Madson was able to Coral the basketball took a couple steps Madson can hit the triple not this time hes 41 out there another offensive rebound for ML they been doing that all night thats going to go the other way though the foul against BC Joe Gerard hit the deck and thatll be on mton third Obie this was a accidental offensive foul though Joe Gerard did not step in there to take that contact he just happened to be in the right place at the wrong time and got drilled by McLaughlin very gingerly walking up the floor there for the Tigers he earned that one 13point game but Clemson with the ball see if Gerard gets rolling here comes a long one and hand with the Applause rebound so under n and 1 half minutes remaining the Tigers just unable to make a push to really climb back in this thing at least yet yeah Quin post coming back into the game which will make it even more difficult oh thats a very pretty pass Harriss give leads to a foul really had a strong game he really has and not only scoring facilitating as well getting downhill dropping it off and coming up tonight 1130 Eastern the ACC Network the nothing but net crew will have a complete breakdown of todays second round ACC tournament games they will have at it on what has been a very busy day here in DC late night for the Hall of Famer Jim bayam however he doesnt sleep Obie he stays up watching basketball all night so therefore doesnt get much sleep and hes locked in not only to this game but Im sure hes watching a basketball game on his phone right now this man watches more basketball than anyone Ive ever been associated Applause with shefflin for Beetle Manson closed him out heres Hall ball to his right makes that shot a lot and Boston College right now choosing to guard PJ Hall with Devon mcglaughlin in comparison to putting Quinton post on him this is the way they started a game where PJ Hall was able to get going early well see if PJ can do the same here down the stretch he has 18 points tonight Mason Madson at a tough night last night he was two for 10 and a whistle thatll get Beetle for that personal trying to reach in FSU an impressive win over Virginia Tech today 8676 NC State knocked off Syracuse 8365 and Wake Forest defeated Notre Dame 72 to 59 thats a giant win for wake it absolutely is that because it puts them in position to where now they have this showdown with the pit Panthers both teams in consideration for an at large bid however someones chances are going to be Slimmer tomorrow because they have to one has to knock the other out pit is the number four seed gerardi defending got a hand in a lane and plct it free no Obie Im no bracketologist however I think both of them are NCAA tournament teams I would agree thats an eye test for us yeah many people are looking at it as an elimination game one will get the other one out but I dont think thats the case I think when the committee looks at it theyll see just how quality of a season both these teams have had I dont think anybody wants any part of a red hot Blake Hinson no they do not like in the first round of the NCAA tournament or hund Salis or Hunter Salis thats for sure follow away oh he really is having a great night claudell Harris has really been the man for BC 24 Applause points hes made some terrific passes too yes he has and he has been aggressive B downtown that was in and out so the lead up to 15 the tiger showing no signs of cutting into it yet BC has been on their Applause aame they had a 10 rebounding Advantage at halftime and they had only turned it over two times so a really clean game theyre up 13 on the rebounding chart right now shot clock to three was forced up there by Harris thats still alive that basketball hit the rim and it was out of bounds in the end off of so hes led the way for the Eagles trying to pick up their 19th win of the year at the expense of the Tigers who beat them Boston College beat them earlier this Music season on the Move heres Gerard to Hunter he cant hit it out 60 to 45 as that one rolls out Brad brell wants to bring the full core pressure but Jaden Zachary is seeing what I see right now you got a long of Quint post goes he would have had a dump on that possession puts it into the corner and off the fingertips of Donald hand and out of play ham was thinking about whether he was shooting that or if he was going to waste time on the clock and not take a quick shot and because he had that on his mind mishandled the pass dropping it out of bounds Wiggins working hard gave up the dribble heres Gerard theyve done a good job on him in the second half they really have hell go downtown and Miss oh big rebound had it slapped out of his hands the first rebound of the day for PJ Hall as he tracks down the offensive rebound however unable to get it back up on the glass boy is that a bizarre stat the 610 senior averages about seven boards a game Gerard clanged away hell get another chance heres Clark again surrendering to dribble Hall shot clock to seven and a kick ball Clemson just fortunate that that basketball hit clao Harriss fo it he was trying to go get it that was another turnover in the making for the Tigers shot clock set to Music Applause 20 they hand off for Hunter back to Hall ranging inside they take it away from Applause Music him so BC forcing another turnover and looking really comfortable here holding Clemson just 45 to this point downstairs and Han will draw the foul a freshman out of Virginia Beach lown High School state champion alongside my nephew my biological nephew Chase Turner who will be representing the Hampton Sydney Tigers tomorrow in the final four of division three my sister the family flying out Fort Wayne Indiana very nice yeah Wiggins with the foul and had a nice game last night coming off the bench seven points five rebounds against Miami yeah and he is be he is getting more and more trust from Earl Applause Grant you know when you start finishing games and youre playing late minutes as such coaches start to respect what you what youre doing Chase Hunter on the attack draws the foul claudo Harris waiting for someone to help him up as they all run over to help up McLaughlin as you see clao Harris getting knocked down Devon mcglaughlin after the block attempt goes down teammates help him up they forget about claudell Harris laying in the middle of the lane hes been carrying him offensively OB should be the first guy to pick up M locktons fourth foul incidentally so hell take a seat with 525 to go and Prince aligue Bay will make an appearance with Hunter at the line really good foul shooter 86 in my opinion Obi hes the key chase Hunters the guy that makes this Clemson team go when hes playing well they are much more difficult out in comparison to a game where tonight where he hasnt really been much scrum here a jump its going to stay on this down with the possession arrow yeah hasnt been very effective offensively or defensively in this game as a matter of fact Chase Hunter only two points in this game you just saw both of them at the free throw line 0 for nine from the field and 0 for four from three usually about 12 points per game he has it again looking to make a move they swarm on him Hall goes down he slips the officials realize that not a traveling violation as he slipped and fell they come out immediately to work on the floor take a look yeah PJ Hall I believe the floor collects that foul but claudell Harris does have his right arm in there so you could have called that the foul the whistle came later once he goes Applause down they do call a foul here not a popular call to the Boston College faithful in attendance so Hall to Applause shoot and will shoot again Applause 79 now the BC faithful enjoying this tournament very much and particularly how their team has worked at the foul line 12 for 12 Clemsons one of the best foul shooting teams in the ACC overall 79 but hes in and out with that one and Clemson trying to set up the pressure however not everyone on the same page Brad Brownell wanting his guys up Jack Clark doing the right thing but no one there to trap on the Music Applause wing Aris leading the away with 24 for the Eagles Zachary got that one on a difficult angle driving the lane one of the things that youve seen this year when Clemson has struggled is teams are attacking Joe Gerard and that was absolutely the case right there by Jake Zachary getting to the rim Clark with a scoop on the other end but Harris and Zachary Zacharys got 17 another player goes down Clark with a slip but maintained it heres Gerard around and out just hasnt been his second half right at the end of the first half he hit some shots and you thought well maybe hes Off to the Races and he had a three at the halftime buzzer that we felt like was going to give Crimson some momentum coming into the second half however Boston College up to the challenge to continue to play as the desperate team Zachary continues to add to a really nice night with 19 points comes in averaging 12 its 16 against Miami yesterday so hes putting together a tournament yes he has and he has been excellent with the basketball as well not just as scoring but also facilitating and making sure that the Eagles dont turn it over very often Clemson just unable to cut in here in the second half and a whistle with seven on the shot clock entire game they have kept the pre the foot on the gas pedal the entire time continuing to keep a 15 to 16 point lead girls spending four years alongside Brad branell as a Clemson assistant coach knows him very well Clark will go to the line with three and a half minutes to play look at a rebounding Advantage for BC they have had that all nights and Clemson with only eight turnovers one less than what weve seen from the Eagles however Boston College with the advantage 54 field goal attempts to only 48 for Clemson but the four the difference has been the four made threepoint field goal four more made threepoint field goals for Boston College eight in comparison to Clemson four post is going to take a timeout as he was doubled up right near the Clemson bench so we will take the break as well 328 on the clock Boston College sailing here against the Tigers to put it in play some pressure here by the Tigers in the back court Zachary needs help and got it to hand he will attack and draw the foul and I love that play by Donald Han especially when you have advantages two onone he and Quinton post going to the rim and when teams are pressuring you you do them a favor when you stop being aggressive while you get the basketball across half court youve got to make them pay for pressuring you especially late in the game take advantage of those easy opportunities with a personal who talked about the tigers being such a good foul shooting team but Boston College real solid there 74 as they look for their 19th win Earl Grant year two first year 14 and 18 lost to Miami in overtime and title game appearance in 06 but looking to go two for two here in this tournament that title game back in 06 that was Tyrese rice and Craig Smith Jared Dudley all those guys playing for Al Skinner back in the day who of course is a legend in the Boston area had a chance to see coach Skinner and Earl Grant having lunch when I covered the Eagles in New York City back in December and again on the Move flips it up rather wildly Gerard with a rebound thats hand should have dropped off DE mlin running with him would have had an easy dump all stepping in to a triple but no and theyre going to get Hunter over the back for the foul against the Tigers BC to get claudell Harris back in the game here in a moment who has been the brightest star for the Eagles on this stage tonight here in DC we will head to the other end and hand will shoot BC closing in on a date with the number three seed Virginia at 930 tomorrow night in the quarterfinals right here and their only matchup of the Season Virginia survived at Boston College at a time where Virginia was truly struggling coming off of a number of Road losses yeah was 7268 yeah go to Boston College get a win to stop the losing streak believe that was after we had Virginia only scoring 44 points against North Carolina 7053 BC with two and a half to go hunter trying to bring him a little closer post with a Applause rebound now the game in front of that will be Duke and NC State thatll be at 700 pm in the day sessions at noon North Carolina and FSU follow by pit and Wake Forest some great basketball coming way in the quarterfinals yeah it is going to be rocking in Capital One Arena when you think about Duke and NC State getting it on here of course the following for Duke as JayZ knocks down the big three and stars down the front row those remaining here watching this strong performance by the Boston College Eagles 22 points for him so 7353 Boston College really from the opening tip a terrific effort and theyre going to play their way into the quarters Angel gray told us Earl Grant wanted it to be gritty not pretty but that has been pretty from Claud El Harris Jr as he knocks down another three three give him 27 Clemson all for eight in the second half from threepoint land BC just filling it up and running away with this now down the stretch and their fans are loving it in Washington DC well its been really the Boston College back court we came on the air talking about what a great big man matchup this might be and for a while it was between PJ Hall and Quinton post but post got into foul trouble and its been claudell Harris and Jaden Zachary Harris with 27 and Zachary with 22 and if youre Earl Grant and you consider that you could get 49 points from your starting back court youll take that anytime especially when Clemson only scored 55 points so not only offensively but give the Eagles a lot of credit for with the job theyve done defensively as well Quinton post with 11 points by the way in the game came in averaging Music Applause Music 17 so the final half minute of our last game of the day under with a fall away and that wont drop Boston College really terrific on the boards that they didnt turn it over much and their back court was Sensational strong performance by the eagles they did exactly as their coach asked pregame to come Music out and give the energy and the effort necessary to knock the Clemson Tigers out of the mix and they have done just that Earl Grant now 5 and two in his two plus ACC tournaments and for the Boston College eagles they are dont feel like theyre done yet well theyve got Virginia coming up next they win it tonight 76 to 55 they were plus 16 on the glass so when he was talking about grit and heart and all of those things it really came out on the backboard it absolutely did it was gritty but it was also pretty when you think about the performance from their back court 49 points between those two guys they showed up in a huge fashion tomorrow
