Tech you got to generate easy offense you want to shoot the three but you got to make sure that you get Steals and get out early to get some early buckets the opening tip controlled by Virginia Tech theyre in the white Syracuse in the road Orange Virginia Tech is 12 and 16 on the season s and 10 in conference play still fighting for seaing for the tournament coming up in Charlotte North Carolina wont be long now potite trying to muscle his way in against lekin and thats a match up that Im going to keep my on between potit and lumpin you got two big big solid bigs there going to go at each other all afternoon Migel potit just under 10 points per game missed the most recent game with a right knee bone bruise and that game was a loss at home on Tuesday against Louisville the number 19 team in the country for Virginia Tech the orange will maintain Music possession use coming off a victory on Wednesday at home against NC State 7460 theyre 12th of the season they are 6 and 11 in ACC play Shifty move inside diving across the pain for jier Davis and Davis does a good job of being able to go oneonone get to his position finishes good around the rim well both hands What did Coach Adrien arry tell us Davis has to be big today for the AR orange as theres a foul called right at The Rim Jaden young was attacking the rim is Adrien ay former Syracuse player in his second season as the head coach taking over for the legend Jim beheim 47 years as the head coach for the orange 12 years as an assistant and he was also a former assistant right here in blackburg Jaden young is at the free throw line 77 on the season for Jaden young the sophomore from Goldsboro North Carolina hit double digits against Louisville in that loss at home earlier this week made three threepointers at 11 points threepoint shot was not a problem for Mike Youngs team Mike uh he they made 11 there yeah and and it was more turnovers against that Louisville team its one of the things theyve got to take care of the ball especially against the Syracuse team that often times hit droughts offensively Brian they had 22 turnovers that led to 26 points for Louisville in the 7166 Music victory orange pupping up the three ball and the Miss from Starling Mike young is in his sixth season last year they made it to the second round of the NIT back in 2022 Champs of the ACC where they defeated Duke in the title game that was played in Brooklyn the lone ACC Championship in school history Rex Steiner behind the Applause line Carlos on the dribble tries to Loop it inside to lampin tough catch and turn and jam for lampin and nice read by Carlos realized that he occupied two guys get the ball right over the lumpin lampin hes been playing well this is a guy that is threatening with a double double every night again we talk about the bigs from both teams showcasing their talent today how about 12 double doubles on the season including one against NC State for lampin and heres a steel a near steel Burnham went after it couldnt get it lets take a look back at that Mark of a fighter moment its brought to you by Medela and you see the big guy with great feet work down there trying to get the ball and finishes at the rim and lamin is one of those guys that youll see him time and time again get the ball in the PO and does a great job of being able to operate is a playmaker as well see those rebounding numbers he had 23 at home against pit third most in a single game in Syracuse basketball history lamin just pounded it into the floor Brian double team somehow gets to the rim Burnham goes up to the Applause rebound Rex Steiner midrange comes up short on this one so hes missed a three and now stepping inside the line cant find behind the Mark Davis trying to work on burnam Drop It Low lampin against potit lampin wins the fight and Virginia Tech was so preoccupied by trying to make sure that Davis didnt get to the rack they didnt see lamin get seal positioned down on ptit underneath the rim good pass a good finish by lamp this is Young on the handoff trying to go down the lane spins it off lampin grabbed it JJ Starling 184 points per game leads the team fifth in the ACC theyre going back to the well Brian but thats one of the things that you see is that you see lamin doing a great job of being able to seal Pos got to do a better job pushing him off the bench CU right now every time he gets theyre giving him opportunity to let him cook line for Syracuse 44 Eddie Lin Jr Eddie lamin Jr 62 from the line hes now started 28 of 29 games this season for the grad student from Houston Texas its been a year at Colorado and three years at TCU the regular season ends tomorrow weve got a special CW womens Hoops double header first the hottest team of the ACC number eight North Carolina host Virginia then in game two Georgia Tech heads out west to take on Stanford its the season finale of CW womens Hoops tomorrow beginning at 200 pm Eastern 1100 am Pacific its only on the CW thought it funny you and I talked in the pregame about North Carolina as much as people were talking about it could have been a down year they put themselves in a position where they could actually have a double bu we talked about that so many teams the last three games playing for a lot of a lot of things as far as position in the tournament Duke Clemson and Louisville have clinched double buys that fourth double Buy the tournament still up for grabs with a week to go wesler inside hes free and he scores wesler did a good job of being able to just rotate and fall down love that soft touch right there in the rim on on the dive twopoint lead for the orange after the wesler basket for the red shirt sophomore from Matthews North Carolina Davis cut off on the Baseline the follow a is money for Davis and I find it interesting that you see JJ Starling is basically giving Davis an opportunity to get his offense what youve seen he does a good job of be able to get to his point and get separation with that nice little feathery touch Hammond gave it up Tyler Johnson trying to Chisel his way wesler grabs the loose ball its a shoot with the shot clock at six its deflected at a held ball situation and the arrow will favor the orange so Syracuse has a four point lead on the road on the Music CW in buckets over in Italy in 200 2003 I was trying to think where what was I doing yeah Carmela Anthony and that group man what an amazing run therell be another Anthony wearing a Syracuse uniform very soon too his son cayenne and cayenne hes the deal that kid man he can go out of Long Island Lutheran High School in New York well have the orange on next year lampin wears the legendary number 44 hes already got six points Carlos turns around and gets a nice soft bounce and and nice move by Carlos realized that he had a taller player on him and went to his cross got his footwork together and i love the shot selection from Syracuse I thought it was interesting we talked with red alry early he said thats one of the keys for them shot selection and youve seen that they have not default in shooting a lot of Threes this afternoon Jaden young trying to work his way cin gave it up young Baseline angular rebound several players had a chance at it Carlos comes out of The Fray determined to get to the rim spun himself into the court and lost the handle that previous shot by Carlos much better Brian and you see the crossover realize they get a little separation thats one of the things if you find yourself in the pain against bigger player get a little separation and so far Carlos other than that turnover has done a great job because red archery talked about the fact of ball security a lot of that starts with your point guard play and then getting you into your offense Carlos who had eight points on four five shooting and the win against NC State thats Hammond with a three ball Carlos got fell asleep pass under that screen and basically you saw Hammond make him pay for it freshman Ben Hammond from Fairfax Virginia his 15th made three of the Season he shoots 47 from Beyond The Arc when he shoots him Davis got it back from Carlos jumps into a three ball Hammond up for the Applause rebound Virginia Tech has lost three of its last four they are four and four in their last eight and thats going to go out of bounds shoot stepped on the line so Virginia Tech trying to get a transition early three for shoot thats the guy that they really need as you see substitutions coming in Chris Bale Chris Bale is one of those guys that since he has gone to the bench has really been lighting it up Bell almost 10 points per game 98 15 of 34 from threepoint distance in February as we turn the calendar to March and the madness Bell tough shot High degree of difficulty and just dont key I mean you talk about the fact that a guy thats come in has got a a level of comfort with his offense love the fact he comes right in gets right to it little pull up jump on the Baseline Hammond back to poti calculating the angle off the backboard and in and youre not going to have LW as as a post presence I think that theyve got to give potit a little bit more touches because again for a team that wants to shoot threes youre going to have to force Syracuse to have to come out and play which you want to get the ball to potit and let him cook down low Mahem McLoud has also comeing into the game for the orange this is Starling my stovich for three and he knocks it down my stovich is one of those guys that you allow him to set his feet he he hes a streaky shooter you see that last time rotation was late by poti and gives him a chance to get that three up freshman from Serbia just his fifth made three of the season its a big one for the orange in the first half and then he comes up with the steal Bell great catch up against Burnham who got a piece of the ball but also a piece of Chris Bell so a foul on the play against Burnham the NIT the last two years from Mike Young Who earlier this season Brian January 29th at Tallahassee against Florida State got his 400th career win with a 10 Point Victory against the nolles Chris Bell is at the free throw line 74 youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State youre in good hands you talk about Chris Bell and the fact that since hes gone to the bench has uh found his offense and I thought again you look at two games ago against pit had seven threes talk about someone that needs a shot in the arm as far as a offense he has been the guy as a play from Syracuse those S threes just one off his career high of eight again hes shooting 44 the month of February as we move to march from Beyond The Arc for Bell an offensive foul is called I think thats against Burnham it was on Burnham and again when youre running your offense and youre trying to get to your second and third options you got to have that discipline to set screens and not moving so now for Burnham thats his third foul going to the bench not what was looking for on senior day and and it never is because I remember eons ago when I had my senior day theres a ton of emotion talking about the fact that youre playing in front of your family and and this and the fans you have an idea how you want things to go out of the corner with a threepointer for cup Jr and good ball movement talking about getting to your second and third options it seems right now that Syracuse is being able to get the shots that they want Virginia Tech theyve got to find a way to manufacture some offense huge Blow by not having Toby law in a lineup yeah Toby La out with illness wasnt feeling great in the game against Louisville in fact hes their leading scorer and rebounder for Virginia Tech he only had two points in the loss against Louisville Tom I dont know if you got a chance to see him play in person this guy 68 hes got a 45 in vertical or if not long higher but talk about a dude that puts his head in the rim my goodness thats Brian Oliver elev right there yeah I went from a 45 to like a to a five in vertical from the Virginia Commonwealth program played two years there hes a junior from London England but we wont see him today on the bench with illness this is Hammond inside the line and I like that pick and roll action Hammond is one of those guys that will not shoot a ton of Threes but I love the fact that you get down and then youve got to rotate on potit but he does a good job of being able to get that midrange you see the big fella come up with the steal take it back and put it on him Music got a little excited there anytime I see big guys you know get that steal good Hustle by potit he did run into the stanson after laying it in but he braced himself and everythings fine McLoud was trying to get back to defend it might be a little reach in there against Virginia Tech talk about Virginia Tech needs some offense and you see malaja poti get there and the big fellow goes down and finishes at the rim and again wanted to go for the it looked like he threw it up he knew that he was he had to brace himself he was like you know what Live to play on another another day good good move hes already got six points perfect from the field so poti gets a breather the orange go back to lampin Carlos Loops it to lampin going to back his way in cant get it off the square it goes out of bounds and we stay at this end of the floor that last possession defense I thought wesler did a good job of being able to body up against lamin was able to defend without fouling because lamin is a guy thats going to bully you and beat you down must did a great job of being able to challenge that Music shot Lampa who shoots 57 from the floor this is Davis right near the free throw line and Davis has been cooking I like the fact that hes basically found sweet spots hes in playing inside the threepoint lane and then Syracuse doing a good job of him to move him around that last time get him an uncontested jump jumper right inside the free throw line he and lampin six points a piece Davis hasnt missed the field goal attempt either this is Hammond trying to feel it a little bit and he does from the free throw line and we talked about the that second chance opportunity getting right inside for that pullup thats his sweet spot if he can get down and then get that uncontested as a smaller guard thats the offense that Virginia Tech and Mike young has been searching for so Hammonds already above his a season average of 51 hes got seven and that jumper looks silky smooth from number 11 they try to get it to cuff and tight quarters its fumbled Applause away wesler on the offensive glass got tangled up with Davis off the Miss out of the corner from Young B Syracuse 13 CW Sports Saturday rolls on as the NASCAR exfinity series races in Dakota for highspeed thrills then we wrap up the day on the hardwood as Notre Dame faces Wake Forest CW Sports Saturday continues next only on the CW wake is part of that group of teams Brian right below the top three that still has a crack at that double bu with a week to go and they definitely need to be able to have a good showing the last three games and then going to the ACC tournament theyre one of those teams that still need a little help theyre going to make it to the NCAA tournament lampin reather spins on the Block Davis is wide open for the Layin and heres the thing we talk about the fact that as a big man he does a good job of being able to gather himself and it passes the ball really well hes got great hands good good first half so far by Eddie lamin lamin is certainly a capable passer and Davis was willing and ready and now hes got eight points for the orange the lead is nine in the first half shoot drives and kicks three pointer for Tyler Johnson and thats what Virginia Tech is at their best when theyre able to hit that Baseline forc to help and make better passes and you get a wide open three that play was start by shoot Starling musling his way to the rim got tangled up with Hammond Virginia Tex number 11 thats his first person Virginia Tech made 11 threepointers in the losing effort they shot 42 from Beyond The Arc against Louisville the big problem for Coach Youngs team was the turnovers Brian 22 of them they trailed at Halftime by eight and could not overcome that deficit and its one of the things is they climb back into the into the game doing a better job of climbing back in ball movement getting to your third option Force this Syracuse defense to have to shift so heres JJ Starling 73 for the stripe on the year second year in the Syracuse program after transferring from Notre Dame and he is from Baldwinsville New York just outside of Syracuse leading score on the team fifth in the conference had 17 points a team high in the win at the Dome against NC State this week but whats impressive is thats thats his first point of the afternoon and theyve been able to get other guys going as you see him miss the the second of that two shot foul is that Davis and lamin have been carrying this offense and youre up by seven and your best score has only got one point remember Starling had a hand injury in practice in early December and he missed seven games early shoot dropping the three ball and you see Virginia Tech starting to get the three ball to go and I think theres a lot of it because of their penetration and then you got guys that be able to get rolling huge three by shoot lamin trying to get around potit and he does it and P got his hands full because Eddie lamin you know hes a guy thats got great footwork does a good good job of being able to use his body that last time maneuvering to the other side of the rim for that little jump hook over his left shoulder shoot on the handoff after the threepointer trying to get to the rim Scoops it up and in great blow by by shoot because lamin had to come out and honor the fact hes a threepointer shooting he got around the corner and got for that layup shoots got the last five points nobody takes more nobody makes more threes for Virginia Tech than Jaden Sho hes now got 54 made threes on the season and just had that last bucket so are you trying to say hes a good shooter he is definitely he is an exceptional shooter lamin wants that one back and hes a great story too Jaden shoot number two in white a knee and hand injury kept him out of action Brian for 599 days from 2023 to this Applause season you see both the pace for both teams picking up you see red alry telling his team to slow it down I thought it interesting he said that hed have a hand and making sure certain Junctions of the game he made sure that they stayed solid with their offense where it avoids turnovers it is a fourpoint game as Davis tries to back it on down had it slapped away and recovered by Johnson hoks on the run shoot Catch and Release way to turn good defense and offense and you see crowd letting him hear it fast break opportunity from Hamond the shoot Virginia Tech climbing back in ag go here in blackburg shoot eight points and he did it in a hurry too Brian and I think that they did a better job with their offense of being able to to get the open plays instead of trying to SC off the first possession for for Syracuse again you see penetration and get down by Starling I thought it was just a matter of time again we knew that lamin and Davis were carrying the load but this is a guy that can give you 20 25 easy last time coming out of the timeout decided to put the ball down and get downhill Rex Steiner working hard to bring it up Carlos defending him how about these shooting percentages Virginia Tech 61 the orange close to 70 shooting in our first half shot clock to eight Rex Steiner still looking for the range Starling lampin that teammates right there and hes really good around the rim and you saw that last time doing a good job of being able to get the ball in and turn but Starling did a better job of being able to occupy two Defenders realize as soon as you got two youve got your big man rolling into the basket Eddy lampin now into double digits hes got 10 points 18th time this season hes accumulated 10 points or more in a single game for the orange hes got 12 double doubles including against NC State earlier this week shot clock to five Virginia Tech turns it over young lost the handle Starling an extra gear poti got back to defend it the tip by lampin second effort easy layup but that play was started by JJ Starling and the fact that no one from Virginia Tech stopped him different shade of orange in the building for Syracuse the maroon and orange of Virginia Tech trying to defend the home court onor day Ben Burnham the lone senior being honored also team manager Conor Patrick a senior those are the initials that you see at midcourt as play goes up and down Castle Coliseum Court he saw before the foul um shoot coming off of that little handoff Id like to see them continue to run that handoff between he and and poti because the cloud around the threepoint line is not going to be able to stop that curl action youll be able to get past him and get get downhill the more you put him up in pick and roll thats going to Ben benefit Virginia Tech Lucas Taylor just left the lineup for the orange with his second foul shoot driving Davis came over to knock it away got a piece of shoot will walk to the free throw line Syracuse number moud theyre going to give the foul to McLoud put shoot at the free throw line told you about his comeback from knee and hand injuries played one year at Duke back in 23 had eight straight points for Virginia Tech earlier this half looking for a Cable News Network which respects all Americans then you have a new home with news Nation see why news nation is news for all Americans to find news Nation on your screen go to newsnation nowcom since Jaden shoot has coming into the game I love his activity we talk about the fact that you know he knocks down those threes but hes putting a lot of pressure on the bigs but his attacking the rim and again theyre going to get back into it they need to continue to try to give him opportunities to turn the corner and then attack the big especially if theyre going to drift out and shoot just hit double digits with those free throws that shot by Starling contested by wesler in transition oh nice pass and the jam nice pass by Hammond with a little bit of a no look was able to freeze the defense and call Johnson on the backside for the Finish now remember in the winning effort against NC State Syracuse did not allow any points in transition and is and and Virginia Tech has doing a good job of being able to to lock up defense and then get those possessions that ball will stay with Syracuse but weve got a threepoint game here in the first half Brian best way to get into the game is to be able to get to your no look to your big fella to finish at The Rim Virginia Tech CL back into it Syracuse and math is not one of your strongest point Im going go ahead and break it downia owe you one for that now Georgia Tech stle 10 and one six and four combined you mean break it down in fraction you just never know whos going to show up and show out give and go double fisted Rim rocker a great re read by Carlos realizing that you get a big like that you just put the ball all he wants to do is keep it high mlau was able to get that ball and just finish it and flush it right at The Rim the senior from Philadelphia Pennsylvania his second year in the Syracuse program after two years in Florida State and one jam and hes above his season average of just a half a point trying to guard poti this is a heavyweight matchup and great great move by potit I still think for Virginia te even though you got the three ball you got to give potian opportunity to be able to work down there because because he can bully McLoud because hes got the girth and he can get the separation potit is 69 260 from Reedville North Carolina Sirus gets a Bucket close to the basket and Davis talking about bully ball I mean Davis all afternoon L they give them ball in that mid post right there did a good job of being able to put his head down and then put Johnson underneath the rim for the Finish Jer Davis the senior from Newark Delaware the floater Hammond Hammond does a good job of realizing that McLoud is not going to show gets over to his spot pick a roll action allows him to be able to get that thats something they may be able to get back to and great dime again to the big fella how about the dimes from Carlos realizing that on that pick and roll you occupy potit you got McLoud on that backside big fella just throw the ball to him hell dunk it prior to today McLoud had attempted 15 shots All Season hes gone Dunk Dunk in a series of possessions for the orange Hammond too strong from Hammond Davis grabs Applause it Starling Carlos big time box out and that might go against Virginia Tech and potit on Virginia Tech I tell you you know what you cant teach length and so mlau does it good job of realizing give me the ball anywhere near the rim Im going to go ahead and give you an easy assist and watch this pass by Carlos gets it right there big Feller just keeps it high doesnt bring it down quick four points from McLoud as he get to goes to the free throw line Cloud the senior 7 fo4 265 lb hes only attempted five free throws All Applause Music Season Syracuse was led by as many as 11 in this first half Music stay tuned for todays halftime show presented by Subaru love its what makes Subaru

basketball ACC basketball fan you want to get to Marg and have all games be meaningful and then again if you talk about the tournament starting today I mean you know that Duke Clemson and Louisville are going to have the top three and then as you look at the bracket myself along with Bobby kerms and Johnny mcneel and Carl Brown we won the ACC Championship still boast that ring at the crib actually know what my dad has that ring right now defeated Virginia in the title game 70 to 61 in Charlotte the MVP in the tournament 43 seconds shot clock to 27 the MVP of the tournament Brian Oliver all the way to the final four in Denver Colorado 1990 I appreciate you giving your boy those flowers Im Im going to chicken it old school Im going to cash app you about 50 bucks oh you know I forget youre fancy I got to zel you this money oh and by the way you should have been an AllAmerican also with your teammates okay if I was voting for that at the time since I was still at Syracuse in 1990 but well how youre an AllAmerican in my book How is it that you still look so much younger than me thats makeup and good lighting alliver makeup and great great technical crew great producers directors got thats what youre telling you got people I got people you got people taking me 30 years to get that group together but they are humming along doing a great job its not how you start its how you finish time thats right back to the game I mean with 30 with 43 seconds left to go Virginia Techs got a great opportunity to be able to to get a a two or three I I like what they were doing as far as getting downhill little pin down action for shoot and then maybe that pick and roll put lamin in a pick and roll try to get downhill this is Hammond Starling trying to defend on young they grind that shot clock down to 10 shoot off the screen wesler great finish by wesler again what you did you put lamin in the pick and roll you forc him to come out because shoot is the threepoint threat get the ball over to W wesler and he throws it from under his hip to be able to finish it however you can get it done doesnt have to be pretty cuff lampin nice right around the rim again Brian and that is right at the horn how about that Lam get some balls uh some shots to go down as well so Virginia Tech will start with the basketball in the second H half Tom wormy Brian Oliver our outstanding CW Courtside Saturday production crew with you from blackburg Virginia young going down the lane and Tom we keep talking about the fact that for Virginia Tech you get down to your second and third options you shift the defense that last time you got Johnson a Blow by opportunity get right down to the rim and finish stolen away trying to get to the rim was Tyler Johnson he was fouled in the process lets take a look back at that Mark of a fighter moment brought to you by Melo and again watch the curl action by Johnson you see him get right down in the midst of The Bigs and finishes with the off hand excuse that was young that finished it and then for Virginia Tech you got to get stops you want to be able to manufacture offense you see Johnson going right now opportunity to get two free throws first free throws of the game for Tyler johnsonuse number four Chris B Jaden young the sophomore from goldsb North Carolina he averages about seven points per game hit double digits and the loss to Louisville this week couple of free throws from Tyler Johnson The Freshman from Orlando FL yeah again for for Syracuse you did a great job of being able to isolate isolate Davis allow him go one onone you know Burnhams already got three fouls Id go at him and then obviously you always got the big fella and lampy to throw the ball down to reginia Tech has the first four points of the half they have cut the lead to five and a steal Rex Steiner Carlos tried to tie up Rex Steiner who hit the floor Applause on Syracuse number five Jak play before I thought Virginia Tech did a good job where they were sending another man over to to double lamin even off the post they sent one over and he throws the ball out and you get get that turnover Syracuse only had four turnovers in the first half Virginia Tech had only six in the first 20 minutes Rex Steiner still cant find the range Carlos on the gidd up and the bounce pass Bell who went for the jam and then hit the Applause court goodness gracious well again for Syracuse theyre going to run every time they get a chance and you see Carlos pushing the pace he realize hes got potit and then Chris bell comes in with bad intentions and again you see right now Bale with the opportunity there call for the foul bti was not having it although he did pick up his third personal foul so Bell at the Applause line B has made all three of his free throw attempts Mike young six season spent 17 years as the head coach at wford College in spart andberg South Carolina over 400 career victories and now poti is a spectator to watch re Steiner bring it up Ben Burnham back in he picked up three personal fouls in the first half with a senior from Fort Mill South Carolina young steps into the three volley balled around to Carlos wants to run spins on re Steiner too strong Applause Applause Music wesler tries the opposite shoulder series of moves lamin holds his ground defensively heres the thing where for uh wesler he wanted to get to his left hand he he didnt realize that he literally could have gone to his right to finish Davis got two defenders in the air and Davis did a good job of being able to not muscle one player but two players even wesler on the help was still able to muscle that one up to get the bus the bu so Davis with 12 they go inside and sliding in behind the D is Jaden young he good pass by russer realized he was able to see young on the the back pass on the back door fell a nice little dime lead is seven for the orange whistle stops play who says big guys dont have a touch hes like Eddie lamin you think youre nice with it I am good with delivering the ball and you see that last pass from wesler Over the young great look at that play to see how it develops in the vision and the collaboration of teammates that only happens through hours and hours of practice in the gym but it does help when youre like 7 13 and you can see see over everybody wesler 7 250 Matthews North Carolina Applause lampin quick Ball moving into the corner for bell for three bring it up but the difference was that Eddie lamin last time he waited for the double team to come and it resorted in a turnover he saw the double coming gets the ball out pass pass and you get an uncontested three by Chris Bell thats nine points for Bell coming off the Syracuse bench young rattles it off the rim Burnham is there trying to clean up the mess and Burnham had it deflected tried to get it back wesler got it Burnham does a good job of being able to give them opportunity you see wesler right there with the soft touch big man is coming in and giving Virginia Tech some really good minutes this afternoon six points now for Music wesler orange stopped the threegame losing streak with their win wins they get the Dome against NC State thats a Davis spin westler trying to clear house he got tangled up with Eddie Lin Jr Syracuse talked to red he talked about ball movement is a key right there and you see good pass pass up a good shot for a better shot to get a uncontested three by Chris Bill talked about Eddie lamin and his playmaking skills for a big did a good job of not waiting for that double team my stovich comes in for the orange he had a threepointer in the first half I thought that Virginia Tech at certain junct of the first half was able to use that pick and roll to get downhill like to see them get back to that Hammond weaving his way drops it inside to Johnson might have lost it on the way up foul was called so there was a foul on the play well sort it out when we come back to Castle Music Coliseum for Syracuse told you hes got 12 double doubl second best in the ACC he h double figures for the 18th time this season in scoring against North Carolina this year for lampin 26 points a careerhigh and a losing effort with Johnson at the free throw line for the hokes Virginia Techs got to find a way to to get some offense going again they have not had anyone consistently in this second half Step Up only shooting 37 versus that 60 in the first half Applause Syracuse still at around 65 shooting well above their season average of 44 10th of the conference steel Burnham two on one and he got tied up by Carlos hey going back to the defensive possession by by Virginia Tech I thought wesler did a great job of being able to front Eddie lamin and not allow him to get the ball and thats one of the things I think that if theyre going to get back into this game they got to get those stops get in some transition you saw that last time Burnham come up with the foul great opportunity right now for Virginia Tech to try to get a little run going the lead was nine at halftime for the orange and thats the guy you can tell right now hes Come Back Off the Bench picked up where he left off love that going run a little backside pin down action for him he comes in and narrows this Gap to only four now 13 points in his third made threepointer of the afternoon entry to Applause lampin my stovic able to grab it goes up strong off the heel tried to get it back scooped up by Burnham the senior backto back defensive possessions for Virginia Tech see if they can capitalize on it Hammond to the floor with lamin and Applause Carlos if it is in fact a held ball the favors the orange second year head coach Adrien ay 94 Syracuse grad played 121 games in three trips to the NCAA tournament Syracuse just wants to solidify a trip to Charlotte in the ACC tournament absolutely and theyve shown that with the team that they have theyve got great point guard play they got a guy that can score in Starling and theyve got a big inside as you see Starling with the blowb can come up you mentioned Starling Brian just three points so far in the game for their leading score and one of the best in the ACC F in the conference but Tom I love the fact that hes not forcing the issue he understands that right now you got a guy in Davis and lamin that can get it done for you and for scores like that is that I remember when playing is that if I can allow my other guys to get growing my offense will come a lot easier because the defense will not be focused on you see great backo pass to Cuff by Starlet shoot picked up for foul going up with cuff whos made a couple of Threes in this game hell go to the free throw line Kyle cuff Jr the foulon shoot 79 for the body of work this season from the stripe for cuff Jr Richard Jr from Harlem North car uh from Harlem New York WWE NXT is the baddest brand in sports entertainment with the best female Division and this weeks smackdowns Chelsea Green and Piper nen take on Soul Ruka and zarya in womens tag team match for the ages dont miss WWE NXT Tuesday 87 Central right here on the CW you see nahem MCL come back into game I thought that he gave Adrian all treat some many huge minutes in that first half and allowed him to rest Eddie lamin and like I say is that you got a big thats got good footwork and does a good job of keeping that ball high those guards are going to find you orange two and three in their last five games the wins against NC State and Boston College that was Triple overtime and Georgia Tech followed it up with a triple OT win at Clemson shoot away and so what shoot did he did a great job of realizing that youre playing him to come up that down screen because you know that he can shoot the three gets a back cut gets over that gathers himself get a little separation with the fade away 15 points now for shoot and documented this earlier he had six total points in his four previous games before this afternoon for shoot Davis Carlos threepoint real estate rattling around came back to Carlos cuff in the corner money spot for cuff and cffs been huge and Kyle cuff Has Come Off the Bench and have given them huge what is it 11 points now I think he had a couple of Threes And knocks down that one it is 11 for cuff stop and start re Steiner coughs it up cuff other side of the rim sliding in Syracuse doing a great job of expanding this lead turning get those turnovers and you get out and you see pressure right now Mike young showing a little frustration there calling for a timeout this second half has been all serious getting out in transition has been Kyle cuff coming up with the big afternoon second game of our CW Courtside Saturday double header is coming up potit tough twisting shot and well defended by mlau and mlau did a good job of being able to force him out of his comfort zone and again force him to shoot over long contested hand off balanc shot thats against the orange number and heres the thing if youre if youre Starling you want to talk to your big guy and tell him dude just stay solid because that last time you set a good screen and it allows him to be able to break the paint Brandon re Steiner is a guy thats thats got to get going and I think that jaquans Jin Carloss defense has hold him to a a goose egg they really need need some production from him Burnham thought about the three reloads could have been a nice moment for the senior to knock down a three about what cuff has done Brian 13 points hes been huge Off the Bench and again hes come in and has been the recipient of being able to get some wide open buckets you saw him close out that last break to be able to get to get a fast break opportunity this is Davis on the Baseline spins and misses Cloud shoot fighting for it that is off of Virginia Tech an official you see Syracuse need someone to get gruin and KY cuff said three ball shorts can you believe that that actually came back in the play we went from the tight shorts back in the day to the long shorts now to the short tight shorts again yeah these Trends are all cyclical you know how that goes going back to Charlotte this year out of the corner its Starling rising up now the gun look at it initially ruled a twopointer for Starling and good out of bounds play because that last time again you give Starling an opportunity to come off of a screen Syracuse has done a good job of being able to execute their offense one of the things that Adrien alry talked about is that qu shot quality was going to be key today its an 80 Run for the orange and this matches their largest lead led by 11 in the first half and nine at halftime and how about the floor game of jquan Carlos today hadnt scored a lot but I think that hes done a great job of being able to get steals get them into their pass and then know hes been the guy that has gotten them easy opportunities hes dished out eight assists in the ball game for Applause Carlos this is Davis trying to work on the Block up against Johnson those two guys going at it the foul against Johnson is second watch this screen and you allow what possibly is going to be a two look like his foot was on the line and then Starling again for him to be your best scorer takes his time and allows it to come to him Davis is at the free throw line 61 of the season this Monday an allnew AllAmerican on the field both teams are on a hot streak but off the field KJ and khil are each pulled in different directions catch an allnew allame Monday 87 Central right here on the CW we got some drama right here at Castle Coliseum although the orange starting to pull away a little bit here Brian Midway through the second half and I I think that Virginia Tech you got to find a way to get some consistent offense you know Jaden sh was the guy that came in they give him a shot in the arm but Syracuse has done a better job in guarding him much needed Bucket from young young is one of those guys also superar athletic can get to a spot good pullup right there J Techs got to get some stops Syracuse right now doing a good job job of being able to execute their offense and get what they want eight points for young Starling draws a lot of defensive attention they find cuff he does not find the rim for the first time in the afternoon good good close out of Virginia Tech to forceing the shoot over High contest trying to go inside to poti Davis came over the top a lot of contact with cloud in the vicinity as well thats third third on moud and heres the thing the more if youre Virginia Tech the more that you can put a big and McLoud in a high pick and roll opportunity is going to give you runs at The Rim because you dont have any shot blocking at the rim and then someone like petite does a good job of being able to rotate Migel potit is at the free throw line some reinforcements coming back in for Virginia Tech including Ben Hammond petite has a chance to get the double digits with this free throw missed that game during the course of the week against Louisville with a right knee bone bruise looks pretty good today and hes gotten it to double figures and hell get a breather wesler is coming in for Mike young and wesler has given Mike young some valuable minutes on both ends of the floor and again for Virginia Tech you got to get some consistent and consecutive stops try to see if you can get some early fast break opportunities or get that three ball rolling Music Carlos is now up to nine assists they try to work the interior Davis fighting on the offensive glass Hammond takes it away Johnson is open for three its offline wesler tries to save it cannot do it I thought Ben Ben Hammond missed opportunity he came off that pick and roll when he found out that M that lamp Lampton did not show could have pulled that up you saw earlier in the first half had two OPP unities I know he wanted to pass the ball over to Johnson ended up in an air ball so now five of 15 threepoint shooting for Virginia Tech one of the better threepoint shooting teams in the league they are sixth in the ACC lampin to Carlos for two and great recognition by lamin he realized that he was going to try to bully his way on wesler found out that he had Carlos wide open does a good job with being able to dump the ball guards appreciate that so is Burnham Nifty dribble against Davis over Davis off the back iron and lampin pulls it down hes got eight boards the orange can slow it down now Brian were going inside of nine minutes to go in regulation and and heres where it comes with good guard play as you realize youre on the road youre up by 11 the clock is your friend you want to get some execution and then like I say Syracuse done a good job of being to get their looks Starling stopp and start and and Starling at last time on the penetration with a little bit of a hesitation realized that baram thought that he was going to pass that ball and then was able to get it right underneath for the Finish they go back door basket and foul Jaden young and wesler found him we see both teams doing a good job of executing their offense and for Syracuse hes said last penetration and then anytime you get a big guy that looks out for the little guy is always a good thing because the big guys are always the guy and then when you see penetration and then the finish by JJ Starling and then again watch the big fella and wesler he sit back and he like bro I see you in the back cut I feel you I am nice with the ball Jaden young to the free throw line for the old school threepoint play it seems that whenever Syracuse seem that theyre going to really expand this thing and and blow this thing away Virginia Tech gets a stop right now got a string to go another couple consecutive stops Syracuse doing a good job of being able to spread the ball around backto back games with 11 points for Jaden young after the free throw tough pass and catch for lampin down by his kneecaps and Burnham gobbled it up you remember we talked with Adrian alter he said there were certain junctures of the game where his team has those turnovers thats one of those things right there you just stay solid with your offense 10point lead for the orange Burnham trying to cut it to eight on the Baseline Virginia te doing a good job again in theyve strung together a couple of stops right now cutting this thing down to eight good penetration and finish by Ben burner first points of the afternoon for Burnham and theyre important to cut the lead down to 8 6961 7 and 1 half minutes to go in regulation lampin just barreling down the lane movich grabbed the loose ball and he got fouled so the orange will be at the free throw line theyve got the Dominos Pizza for the year and I was like you can shoot your shot or let me shoot it for you I shoot it nothing but cash and then the guy wins Dominos Pizza for the entire year jeez I remember they made you shoot some free throws too oh that was at the Harlem Globe Trotters game remember that oh yeah they did Summer they did when we did the glob Trotters in New Jersey my stovich is at the free throw line but we digress a great opportunity here you see Virginia Tech fans into it a stage with opportunity to silence the crowd just a 52 free throw shooter one of two and the lead is nine Johnson just fell over got tangled up with cuff Johnson gets it back young few feet behind the line and hes ripping the ropes for the Virginia Tech hes and and good play by Johnson because again that fze that froze the defense just enough to get the ball over to Young you get that three ball going Virginia takes did a good job right now they already willed this lead down to six 14 points now for Jaden young the lead was as large as 13 for the orange Carlos with a globe trout or dribble almost had it knocked away got the shot away lampin comes out out of nowhere Carlos grabs it Carlos does a good job of coming with that rebound realize you got 17 seconds you run another play talk again youre up and the clock is your friend shot clock to five for Starling got the handoff Escape dribble poti got a piece of it big defensive stop for the hokes Hammond just beyond the free throw line for Virginia TCH and Tom we talked about that that last time you have lamin thats sitting down in the lane you run that high pick and roll and then that allows Hammond to be able to get that time that that free throw shot and then you see red alry opting for a time in timeout to Rattle to get his troop together the hokes are in the midst of a 10 inside to lamin because hes been able to win that that match up between he and B Davis has 14 points and hes got the basketball Lankin Applause now Chris Bell Starling shot clock to five Starling suffocating D leans into the shot and with2 seconds left on the shot clock of fou is call wow what a bail out because you had a very good defensive sequence you forced them for their first two two opportunities watch this last play and you see good good defense there there was contact watch right there Starling he leans in and then Hammond gets him across the right arm a really close call with Starling leading into the shot Music Applause Starling now one of three from the free throw line I thought Johnson did a good job at the beginning they were trying to get the ball over to Davis he blew that play up by being able to front and deny the ball into Davis and right now you see JJ Starling whos your top scorer want to be able to knock this one down one more free throw for Starling and and heres the thing is if youre Virginia Tech you realize you almost dodged a bullet because again thats three points that can extend this lead up to seven JJ Starling already missing the first two comes up empty from the strike fourpoint game 5 and A2 minutes to go seven points in the game for Starling after the misses from the line young elevates and hits and that was a play because again on that pick and roll you had to stagger you pull out lamin lamin doesnt show right now Virginia Tech on a nice run right now throws this thing down to two zero field goals in the last 3 40 minutes this is a 121 run for Virginia Tech and the lead for the oranges to shot clock at seven Starling put the shoulder down and lost it to Hammond On The Run drops it off to Johnson and were tired of 70 Virginia Tech doing a great job of being able to turn good defense and offense the momentum has shifted for Syracuse into Retreat right now fans here Castle Coliseum are going crazy again if you want to be able to get back in this game come up with the steal the young the little fell Ben Hammond gets out drops it off to Johnson Johnson finishes right there there and then again the good defense you go on a 10 run be able to turn your defense get out and transition to finish miles be able to tie this game back up all the momentum momentum is shipped it back to Virginia Tech what a play by Ben Hammond the strip the drive the dish and were tied at 70 this is just game one of CW Courtside Saturday later on today after racing Notre Dame and Wake Forest from Winston Salem North Carolina and the Joel see its Infinity racing from Austin Texas in between we have drama were going down the stretch here in blackburg well and again momentum has shifted in Virginia Techs favor because again theyve been able to get some stops for Syracuse youve kind of let go of the Rope you got to be able to execute right now you see this 14 to one run in Virginia Tech favor I still would go back try to get that ball over to Davis if youre Davis you got to do a better job of being able to to ask for the ball and not allow Johnson to stop you from getting your position both Davis and lamin both have 14 points a piece this is Davis being guarded by Johnson and a foul is called on a spinning Davis and watch this last play again you talked about for Davis gets the ball and then right there you see what looked like a foul by Johnson watch the left hand as he swipes the ball he gets his Music Applause arm Applause Music 13av so Davis whos made his only two free throw attempts in the game and 14 points for Jer Davis Senior from Newark Applause Delaware 13 of 19 as a team for the Orange from the line you see Davis here all afternoon long I like the fact that hes been able to understand that that match up between he and Johnson he can put the ball on the floor and he can try to bully him and get to a spade has had really good footwork opportunity right now to extend this lead to Applause two couple of big free throws from Davis it was after Starling it missed three in a row after being fouled on a threepoint attempt and it seemed that young has been the hot hand again you run him up that stagger and let him create theres young creating but not scoring Ed Lampkin with that rebound also has a double double Brian is 13th of the year and this is where you have a a coach and and red alry hes going to go back to Davis and let him continue to work because again he understands that thats a matchup that he can win Hammond knocked it away got it back on the Run Hammond around the defender plays it in score the basket and one action by Ben Hammond how about these Hokies pwing back into this game using their defense to get out and transition Ben Hammond coming up big young little fella giving them opportunity grab the lead well coming up with consecutive steals at the line right now for possible goahead hes got 13 points and five dimes and a chance to give Virginia Tech a onepoint lead at the free throw line Hammond trying to complete the old school threepoint play cant do it either way were tied up what a comeback from 13 down Syracuse has not had a field goal Bryant since the 1215 Mark of this second half and if youre Syracuse you got to regain your composure this has been a game that youve been in command of for most of the game in to this recent second half collapse you got to run your offense continue with your spacing and value the ball Starling had it knocked away in midair mind you there was contact it appears good penetration by Starling now lets remember also staring going to the line for two he just recently missed three consecutive so your JJ Starling as a as a as a scorer you got to sit back and you see him right there there working on his form 73 on the season for Starling from the strike just one of five on free throws in the game the first three I thought I saw a little bit of a hitch that last time even though its an unorthodox shooting style took his time and got that up got that one up to go yeah very deliberate move as he brings that ball up past his chest staring at The Rim got him both too clean free throws again from Virginia Tech there are a couple of things that have been working for them a little pick and roll action you know Jaden young is one of those guys that give him a look and allow him to cook Starling now has nine points for the orange poti on the block off the glass and good and were tied up again at 74 and good seal by potit that last time he had lamin on his backside was able to give him just a little bit of a push dislodged him finished up again not it back in 74 poti has 12 points Starling what a midair maneuver by Starling as the basket Falls and hes going to the line and weve talked about this at the gut of the game you want to be able to put the ball in your playmakers hand watch JJ Starling gets right into the chest of poti hammers him across the line of the arm gives him an opportunity you see to gather himself maybe took a shot in the chops opportunity to get the oldfashioned threepoint play either way Starling has got the double digits now with 11 points double figures 20 times this season 44 times in his career remember he missed seven games earlier in the year with a lefthand injury Syracuse playing without Donnie keman as well missing his 15th straight game hes out for the season with a right foot injury and Marling has the free throw so after missing three in a row hes now made three in a row and going back to Virginia Tech right now you got a lot of different options here give potit a touch and then yeah we talk about Jaden young as of late Pote now playing with four personal fouls burnam Davis all over him shot clock at seven young forces it up and hits and during that little play you you had young come through there the cloud a little late didnt know whether he was going to play the ball or try to shift over to bti how about Jaden young with 18 points were about to cross the twominute threshold in the second half Davis down the lane vernham denies him Starling in a onepoint game stepping back Starling misses the three Davis comes over the top tapped Away by Young good d by Hammond not allowing JJ Sterling to turn the corner and get downhill forc him in that difficult threepoint shot a onepoint orange Music lead too strong out of the corner from Young goes out of bounds and the officials theyre going to take a look at it remember last two minutes regulation and overtime as far as possession the officials can go to the Monitor and determine the proper call on possession we watch this last the floor with Syracuse ball under shes listening like what are you doing the point is though Brian right in all honesty lets get it right absolutely lets get the call right absolutely get the video evidence make the call right and now its over turn back to Virginia Tech so SHO inbounds N9 seconds on the shot clock interesting to see what does Mike Young have drawn up cuz you desperately need a bucket how about five players in double digits for Virginia Tech in this game Hammond right back to shoot got the defender in the air and he lays it in and great play by shoot realizing normally with n seconds you rush to get in there makes the defender part of the parachute Club make sure that hes get that now Virginia Tech up by one first lead to Virginia Tech LED four to2 in the first half early on very early one minute to play final minute lamin down by one against poti lost the handle shoot dies for it Bell tries to save it cannot do it back to Virginia Tech how about the solid defense by potit realizing that lamin had nowhere to go watch this inbound play again Tom wormy and again with N9 seconds watch Jaden Su shoot right there it was able to basically go back door and it makes Chris Bell part of the parachute Club finish that up to allow them to take the Applause lead heres the thing as for youve got three different options for Virginia Tech youve got Jaden Shu you also got young and then at worse you can throw the ball inside to potit and allow him to be able to go Hammond on the handle guarded by Carlos Applause young Around The Edge on the entry lampin staying with him what a roll for potit and the soft touch and you see time out right now Syracuse down by three you give the big Kai scoring Virginia Tech led by the 18 for Jaden young theuse Des L needing a victory trying to punch a ticket to Charlotte remember the bottom three teams in the league do not make it only the top 15 Carlos driving finds a window got it back from Bell thats a three comes up short Hammond as the rebound 132 seconds on the clock in Castle from here Syracuse you got a good look I like the play they were trying to get Chris Bell a wide open three Virginia te does a good job of being able to contest he has to pass ball over to Carlos Carlos comes up short now big free throws for Ben Hammond 11 Ben Hammond is 0 for one from the line in the game Virginia Tech as a team 10 of 12 enormous free throws to make it a twopossession game for Hammond and not a lot of time on the clock Music again you know Hammond could have sealed it sealed opportunity you see Mike young over there is like both coaches sweating this one Music out fourpoint game fourpoint game and if if youre Syracuse you got to you got to score quickly Starling trying to spin to the rim too strong got it back laid it in twopoint put back is was good time called Adrien ay and Syracuse 14 points for start you want to go for a steal and if you dont get the steal then you want to foul and then you want to try to stretch this game out and make Virginia Tech make free throws Burnham the lone senior honored in the final home game for 2025 on the inbounds to shoot who got dumped and bumped for the personal foul shoot with the opportunity with 45 seconds left to go you knock down these two and you basically seal the Victory and again if youre Syracuse you have to understand that if he does miss one of the two red alry obviously get set substitutions into the game thats his FAL foul so Lucas Taylor is fouled out Mike young who went over 400 career victories earlier this season at Florida State hes got 104 wins as the head coach of Virginia Tech if they can pull this one off and he gets 105 coming back from 13 down and and also sitting at seven and 10 this is key for Mike young and his team because we talk about the positioning this could possibly be the first year since in his Virginia Tech ten that hes gone under 500 as far as games one in the league a 163 run in the midst of this second half will shoot at the line leaves the door wide open for Syracuse and heres the thing make or Miss players on the floor have to have an opportunity to decide on if youre going to go ahead and call a timeout you see the officials go back over still going to be a one possession game shoot if he can make this second free throw makes it a threepoint lead and hes got a total that will tie his career high with 18 points again if shooting makes this free throw and seals it how about the afternoon and the comeback the second half for this Virginia Tech Team when it seem like it was all Syracuse second one for shoot 8279 Che for Syra numberer back for the hook so a Timeout on the court and a half seconds to go so far in the game Music the orange are five of 12 on threepoint attempts the scoreboard in the arena says 8179 our St statistic scoreboard says 8279 when shut made the second free Music throw I think they corrected it now it has been changed inside the arena thats a big point that they put back up on that clock and on that scoreboard and now who do you if youre Syracuse who do you give a chance to shoot it I mean obviously I think statistically you think of Chris Bell Im not sure if I dont try to run a play for Kyle cuff hes made three threes hes made three threes and I think that if Scouting Report with till you see cuff over in the corner I may use Chris Bell as a decoy these are the things you work on in practice right trying to get that open three in the the closing seconds Davis will throw it in and the last thing you want to do for Virginia Tech is to get caught fouling contesting on this three they get it to Carlos final seconds pumps up the three car baby ties the game oh man 06 seconds on the clock Chan Carlos Syracuse got the look and then they send us to overtime tied at 82 wow what a Play What a money Syracuse also played a double overtime game against Youngstown State in mid November in 10 10495 in 20 so here we go overtime blackburg Virginia looks like the first foray into OT this season for Virginia Tech Applause Music Davis on Burnham slipped by the defender basket and foul and you see right out of it great play you get the ball into Davis thats a match up with Ben Burnham that hes been able to win does a good job of being able to get in you seeing poti what looks like his fifth foul comes over on the help watch this move again you see the spin gets in PO he comes over you see Davis in a celebrating opportunity to be able to extend this game to Applause three so Davis now with 19 points petite fing out with 14 points and thats a space eater that you lose in the middle although wesler comes right in for potit young dribbles down the lane young got fouled count the hoop a little backto back threepoint action you come back and you get one threepointer Point play and then you get the ball into Jaden Youngs hands I I love watch this little pin down action you get him off a double pin down stagger hes able to get down absorbs that contact and it finishes now with opportunity to tie this game up awfully quiet in the building for a moment a quiet heres what I if Im Syracuse I go back to Davis because again hes been able to get the position below that free throw line and then go right at Burnham tied at 85 and OT Davis shoulders Burnham shot clocked to seven Carlos points it out to Starling same spot different result this time he sent us to OT with a three right on that same same spot good defensive possession by Virginia Tech if you youre a Burnham you play solid defense got the ball out of Daviss hands forced him to another Music option shot clock to eight for young ohom big three by Young oh Jad young in the afternoon hes had this second half hes got 24 points 2 two in the second half more importantly a threepoint lead for Virginia Applause Tech Bell needs some help from Davis shot clock inside a 10 Davis trying to drop it off in tight quarters poked away lampin right back to Davis for two and its a onepoint game and nice back and forth between Davis and lampin that last time you get it over to lampin right back to Davis Syracuse to be able to cut the lead down to one Davis has 21 points in the game for the orange young again not this time and then Bell contact as he was trying to pull in the rebound from Patrick wesler again Jaden young has done a good job and watch the little double pin down that they have where the pick and roll right here and you see the defender JJ staring makes a a mistake pass passing underneath and young makes him pay for it knocking down to three and he said Im having one of those afternoons Im feeling it for Syracuse Bell shooting two so Bell to the line hes got nine points hes now tied us at 88 Bell five of five from the stripe and hes into double digits with 10 after the free throw chance to give the orange the lead with 242 to go Music Applause overtime what a basketball game between Virginia Tech and Syracuse and you know they say that whole thing if its not broken dont try to fix it I I get the ball back over to Jaden young and let him continue to do his thing because hes shown that he can go back and forth wants the kick to Burnham angling his way to the rim for Burnham just enough to get it over the front rim it seemed like the sea had pared it when bur and went down the middle little soft touch to be able to get at The Rim take back that lead just enough to creep over the front rim for the senior from Fort Mill South Carolina one point Virginia Tech lead after the Burnham bucket Davis against two Defenders shut off got it back shot clock at five Davis Baseline wesler knocks it away good block by wesler and now 145 to go in OT lamin trying to stay with youngu kicks it out to Hammond hit three big played by Jaden young realiz hes got two guys over there and he realiz hes got Ben Hammond wide by wide by himself we see R alry op him for a timeout 17 points for Hammond and a fourpoint lead Saturday at Miami 8168 their last home win you see there you see red alry not too not too happy with that last three and heres the thing is that you had two chances to get the ball to Jer Davis its like you may want to go in a different direction to see if you can get great defense by Hammond who good play chase down block by Chris Bale what a sequence at both ends defensively for the orange and the hokes inside lampin is wide open oh Brian Oliver twopoint game what a series as a play and what looked like you had to steal by Ben Hammond that Jaden young could have had a gamechanging dunk and then the play by Chris Bell and then you come back and you get Eddie lamin wide open by himself this game is far from over 16 points for lampin last home win January 15th against NC State for Virginia Tech stepping back nice and hitting it its Jaden young Jaden young hes definitely won that match up today between he and JJ Starling heres Starling trying to answer angles in and creates contact and defense has definitely been on display especially overtime watch this play by Ben Hammond and see what could have been a good Chris Bell says not today your request has been denied and then watch this young bucket where he gets the step back and hes been huge and been money all afternoon he was like yes I am definitely like that if you dont know now you know 26 points in the game one off his career high for Jaden young JJ Starling at the free throw Applause line five of nine from the strike for Starling movich will come in lamin quick breather chance to make it a one possession game from the line for JJ Starling Ben Burnham and the hokes trying to win their final home game of the season Starling got them both I think as you you see Syracuse extend a little pressure there double team of the backourt Hammond got it up to Young its about a 5second difference game and shot as movich Peter Master thats his first personal foul you see on the afternoon Ben Ham his one for three from the free throw line you remember in regul had couple of free throws we could have sealed it fourth trip to the line of the game for Hammond its a threepoint game this to make it a two possession game weve been here before we have dont forget NASCAR xinity series racing Circuit of the Americas when we get done in blackburg Music Hammonds got them both 19 points Syracuse you got to go quick you dont necessarily need a three Starling missed the shot lampin tried to grab it it is Hoke basketball I believe Brian theyre going to take a look at this only the inbounds guarded by my stovic bellwind flying oh wow I think theyre going to call offense a foul on this they are Chris bell went flying across the court I think he got tangled up with shoot and watch this play between between shot and Bill watch right now Bill comes in and then Shu comes in and Bill does a good job of being able to sell it and the Oscar goes to watch this last play if Syracuse an opportunity now dont take any time off the clock it looked like he gave him a little bit of a chicken wing see the extension of the arm at the end though by shoot so was very very close granted exceptionally close call so we are not done just yet 171 seconds on the clock in our first overtime period tied at 82 in regulation thanks to Jon Carlos and his threepointer hes on the inbounds need some help Davis back into the corner Starling missed came up short Hammond got fouled in the back court by Carlos and Im not sure Im not sure if your red arrey if you wanted a corner three by JJ Starling you still had plenty of time thought that you had Davis right there you try to go quick hindsight 2020 you just fought hard to give yourself an opportunity at another possession you put Ben Hammond back at the free throw line with an opportunity to seal this thing up if he can make both of them so Starling has missed both both of his threepoint attempts in the game and Hammonds at the line youve extended this at least to a two possession ball game and theres only 111 seconds on the game clock first OT game of the season for Virginia Tech third for the orange 20 and OT second free throw Hammond sixpoint game Carlos looking for a fast bucket and he gets it 61 Music seconds fourpoint game Hammond gets it drops it to shoot he runs into Davis 31 seconds left Im a little curious why that last play with Carlos when he went for the twopointer why he didnt go for a three because you needed six points and so I would have thought that you go for a three and then if you make it youre down three and you make a foul number two Jaden shoot at the line a cool 100 for Virginia Tech and a fivepoint Applause lead highest total of the season two for shoot 20 points desperation tossed by the Orange 10195 Virginia Tech wins it in overtime for
