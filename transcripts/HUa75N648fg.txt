most passion the most intensity this is the way basketball supposed to be an Applause Music Music inro introducing the new 2024 Ford F150 tough this smart can only be called Music F150 one point lead for Virginia Tech we welcome you back to Castle Coliseum its hard to believe Mike young is winless in five tries against Boston College 3837 against the rest of the ACC and of course last year the Eagles came in here and won 8276 theyve won their last two visits into this building as Earl Grant in Boston College and a moment ago you see Quinton post raised the arm on Sha padulla and it was added as a F1 so itll be free throws and then the ball for the hokes here out of the timeout with 1529 to go in his first half well he hit him you know you cant raise just a little bit you know but thats you got to call that well and you say just a little bit again in the 90s when I was playing this may be a common foul in the 60s when you were playing that was a love tap that was nothing no that was nothing thats a love and meanwhile the ref from call that John gney has to come over here and tell me he called the punch the ball and he said I I know you didnt know that rule thats pretty disre disrespectful Earl Grant by the way he is right though 40 and 44 at Boston College Cory I think he is done a miraculous job Chestnut Hill he absolutely has and he has his team playing much better offense this season that weve seen in the past normally their characteristics are about their defense and a great defensive stand on this possession even after the flag foul yeah Mason Matson by the way is coming the ball game senior from rockchester Minnesota plays almost 16 minutes off the bench for Boston College along with Claude El Harris Jr whos playing off the bench for the first time in a while tonight comes in averaging 14 a game against the ACC that ball got deflected away and double that was double tapped I think thats got to go the other way yeah well there they go they cleaned it up for you over there coach they can talk about you all still I can still ref I may not be able to coach anymore but I can still ref games you were right on top of you saw that yeah post by the way out of the ball game Earl Grant doing some teaching over there on his bench with not only post but also a league Bay oh just wait WD Grants about to teach how to get a defensive stance in the second Armani Mighty by the way with the ball up top number two the sophomore from Canada Zachary back for one of the best names in the game Mighty who dumps it to mcglockton Second field goal Deon mcglockton great interior passing from the Eagles on that possession I thought JayZ passed up a easy one but they even got an easier bucket on that possession Migel potit off the Virginia Tech bench delivers pulos three attempt and one and done Virginia Tech heres Mighty backing down this is Couture and an offensive foul on Armani Mighty his first second on Boston College well he might have been right on the punching rule but I dont know about on that call well coach and heres the thing with that one when you see Mighty backing down couture couture is smart enough to know to drop on the second one but when Mighty stops he pleads guilty no he should have kept going you keep going you turn and you lay the basketball up and force the officials to make the call on the defend little backourt pressure offered by the Eagles and mighty forces the turnover hell drive for the basket thats a block on Couture or no beg your pardon Robbie Baron well he cant he cant call this fou why you cant call two offensive fouls on the same guy no no that thats against all the rules thats against the rules I think that was a good call so mightys going to go to the line thats pretty good pressure by BC here guys great pressure especially when you get your fiveman to be able to come up and be the guy that comes up with the steal thats normally the the pressure release to throw it to your Center sophomore from Toronto this is just his seventh year of organized basketball he scoreless in his last four games averaging about 5 and 1 12 minutes of contest for Coach Grant he hits the second he is now seven of 12 at the line this year and hes got his first point as armman mighty and you see how Boston College wants to guard Virginia Tech but J Tech has struggled this year the first year under Mike young where theyre not one of the top teams in the league in handling the basketball averaging almost 13 turnovers a game this season deep three Couture 43rd three of the year for Hunter Couture when he gets those looks hes going to make those and I got to remove my asteris from Hunter Coutures threepoint record because I found out that he actually passed ad waso in nine less games so even though I had an ash beside the fifth year Im taking it back because he did it in less games than the guy who held the record did you put the aster there yourself absolutely I absolutely put it there say nobody else did heres the drive Zachary mcglockton over his shoulder scores again quietly Devin motons got seven to lead everybody and BC to with one one again well we talked about how he likes to play on the road but coach youre with me on the ash think about the numbers you would have put up if you had a fifth year to be able to play well jeez I mean what are we going to tell about Armando Bott I mean hes been playing for about eight years isnt he yes Armando bots played a while but Alondo did break the rebounding record in four years which means theres no asteris all right all right he just broke one this year so I dont know what one yeah thats as beside that one though that one Corys got the aster beside it here is Madson the floater with a right hand Mason Matson last Touch by Virginia TCH as Pat Driscoll so it will stay with the Eagles but were getting a look here at Virginia Techs Weaponry from the perimeter hanuk tour stepping back knocking down the three ball he is comfortable on this floor but the answer the nice find from JayZ as m glockton is able to finish over the shoulder backwards he finished yeah extra credit Jimmy you know why Cory liked that pass cuz he never would have delivered that pass thats it you know what first first The Fat Boys break up and now this this is what we doing you guys ganging up on me well Cory knows he would have shot he just doesnt you know hes just boy claudell Harris Jr by the way continues to struggle Cory well claudell actually struggling one of the reasons WD he doesnt have his normal Jersey on he wears number one heres Lyn kid hes got a pair of field goals I think kid heard me saying hes making just layups he makes a nice jump shot right there fivepoint lead for Mike Youngs team its a pretty good start by the way Tyler nickel into the lineup now as well for Virginia Tech first time weve seen the sophomore from Harrison bur from the valley averaging 10 and a half a game theres mcglockton missed the chippy got it back missed it again third time charm one of the things coach that we see is right now Boston colle is doing a great job taking advantage of the size matchups that what they have when theyve got a guy like mlin with padulla trying to defend them at the basket yeah the switches theyre catch down here heres Collins look for kid and the rebound pulled away and Donald Han Jr on the floor for Boston College sophomore brard freshman rather from Virginia Beach his second year of the program Tor an ACL in the second game of his true freshman year WD you realize I got two nephews out here right now Doan Jun I realize were old is what I realized and then of course hunor d bodys going to let that one go theres a drive and knocked away look at Mighty go get it and score armanii mighty gets the hoop and the foul and the foul is going to be on kid itll be his first and the second on Virginia TCH the best offense for the Eagles has been throw it up and go get it they have dominated the offensive glass here to start the Music C welcome back BC Trail one but coach dein mton has been terrific well he hits the three and then he gets it inside and hes got four rebounds he makes it I mean hes doing a little bit of everything in there hes had a couple really big games he he really makes a difference when hes playing like this but the rebound 103 thats thats a big margin well Cory you mentioned hes already had a huge game at Georgia attack kind of a homecoming game because hes from coming Georgia but look at what hes doing I mean hes doing it on the road post was on the bench now weve got some substitutions glockton was over there momentarily hes now over there with post and Zachary and Madson erl Grants done a really nice job digging into his Ben here early they absolutely have and theyre doing it to be able to keep post out of foul trouble picked up the flagrant one early got the foul but you know Mighty stepped in and played very well for the Eagles as well so theyre getting the job done but its 15 points in the paint now padulla slides by hand twopointer spins off and Harris with the rebound Cory told you if youre looking for claudell Jr wearing one thats not here this is the one that was in the bag on the trip for 15 tonight Eagles are wearing their alternate cream Jersey hokes are in the blackout tonight theres Mighty trying to contend on the Miss Couture deeper than the first Applause yes no hesitation whatsoever thats what you call a neon green light hun Couture getting out in transition when you shoot it from that deep you know coach has a lot of confidence in you that all came because of bad offense trying to do too much with the ball and then they get down the other end get an easy three and missed the long jumper Hokes up three coach when youve had to take a guy whos been in your starting lineup and you bring him off the bench often do you see what we may be seeing from Harris hes trying to press a little too much a little bit its hard its hard sometimes for guys to do that nich nickel drops one tell you what I dont care who theyre playing when theyre knocking in threes in this building theyre hard to catch but WD weve been here a long time you know weve come to come to Castle and watch Virginia Tech especially under Mike young that has been their calling call theyve always had a number of guys that can shoot the basketball but theyve been able to play great defense as well League Bay gets his first shot of the night to roll from in the lane second field goal for Prince hes got four this is something that bothers you as a coach to youre trying to get your starters back in there and they cant get a change and you can you can lose five six points during that time you didnt because you would never play your I was always asking you to play more guys you wouldnt do it I I just couldnt keep track of them all it was easier to to play five thats it there go coach once told me WD he said look you go out and you recruit these really good players they want to play all 40 minutes Im not taking them out of the game thats why I could have played for my guy I dont want to make my best players unhappy I understand that Kelly a long three CH Kelly had 17 in this building a year ago in the eagle win its a career high nichel another one nope he he already had the run back though WD he felt that felt good to him like it was already gone down about H junr pretty quick shots here real quick both ways hoky with a fourpoint edge you see the details from behind the line for both schools neither shy at all heres they got to get Couture one heres kid soft turnaround good how much of that is set up because you got to defend these shooters youve got Couture and nickel on the outside well theyre switching and you get a mismatch its a overhand sixfooter you know you cant stop him hand going to work here is Harris out front this is a very confident score claudell Harris knocks down a three he had missed his last eight from behind the line PRI of that hit there but the good thing is he kept kept looking kept shooting and kept his head up and you know now he might knock down two or three he had 26 at Georgia Tech 29 against Lehigh had nine straight double figure games prior to a drought here in the last couple smart play by Collins recognizing the defender was trailing him a little bit of a hesitation to get to the rim for the easy layup and a foul on Nicholl against Donald Han yep here it is in transition hard hard to stop that really good really good padulla pass hey dont forget Thursday night womens basketball presented by Alli Brook woff and Florida State visit Carol Austin and Duke starting at six and then Katie Meyer and Courtney banghart at Carmichael with Miami and number 20 North Carolina that leads us to Saturday double header starts at 5 here at the castle Georgia Tech who lost tonight to pit meets the hokes and then Dan boner and now will be at the JMA dome for Dave bang Ring of Honor induction Syracuse host NC State at 800 and our man apparently is coming to the game are they going to get my guy back in the domes going Bs going the game going up on the ring certain guys you got to show up for Dave Bing is one of those guys unbelievable you got that right heres Harris oh the way and he went for the potit rejected it Collins skip for Couture out front for three Applause Music more he can shoot Jim I mean really shoot I mean Applause really three for three yeah nine for Couture the lead is eight for the hokes a leag bay out of the corner rattles it in and give the Eagles a lot of credit for responding each and every time the hokes get this is building rocking which it can do with the best of them the Eagles have responded Baron with potit heres nichel Couture against Zachary all the way down bounce pass potit the catch and thats two on post second on post third on the Eagles lets roll it back here to claudell Harris claudell Harris tried potit potit won that battle and it ends up being turning some defense into offense on the other a h Couture who is RedHot to start this game off knocked down his third three of the first half heres poti at the line after the three by League Bay the leag cut back to five malel is a 69 free throw Music shooter host comes out of the game coach I always leave my guy in with two I just I just never thought I just think it gets guys being tentative if you it only the big anybody anybody but heres a difference though WD he also was playing a Zone and its easier to protect guys to your credit its much easier to protect guys in the zone when they have the two foul 100 right 100 but a lot of coaches just they believe in that and I just never did a League Bay heres Harris over the top of Collins too Music tough Shan padulla got a quick rest Hunter Couture now getting a quick rest these guys spend a lot of time on the floor for Mike young look at padulla the scoop and score off the window first field goal for padulla Coach yeah hes theyve kept him under pretty good control and that was a hard shot used the window for his fourth point lead back to nine now Virginia techs hit their last four from the floor Zachary burrowing in got his own Miss Madson rimed off Collins a rebound were going to go to potit foul as mlon got knocked to the deck first on potit four on the hokes mls been great on the offensive glass throughout this game poti recognizes that tries to get a body on him help goes a little high that was close Mike young and I think theyre now theyre going to have a look at this yeah yep they are indeed so teams will go to their benches here Pat Driscoll from Syracuse New York will go over and look at the monitor hes the only ref thats a good friend of mine because they didnt let him ref Syracuse GS I want as we get opportunity to see the look you see fatig go over but you watch the now that could be they could be looking at a possible hook and hold on that one WD because if you see mclin trying to lock that arm that may be a hook and hole going the other direction that may be overturned and not he didnt really get a good hook on but I believe thats what the officials are going over to look at I dont think you can get an attempted hook and hold though can you but I think that I agree I dont think you can get an attempt to hook and hold but I believe thats what they were looking for to see if it actually did hook on were they look okay let me ask you this are they not looking at two things here if poti got above the shoulders which he didnt I dont believe got him in the chin the look at the left arm of mlin going down yeah hes trying to get it he just doesnt get a hold of petite fortunately he doesnt because it wouldnt be a hook and hole so potite by the way takes the foul which is his first four on the H its a good call common foul and the officials did not take long to be be able to figure it out yep Harris Matson Zachary mlon a league Bay on the floor for Boston College theres Harris nice turn left it short hes thinking about his shot hes not shooting it when you get that way you just you cant make him yeah and he looks like he may be pressing a little bit not starting this game coming off the bench and also WD you not dont feel as good youre not wearing your number one you know what I mean I wore number one you feel good when you go out there with number one on and Padula steps out of bounds itll go to Boston College heres a look at claudell Harris Jr from hanville Louisiana you see the season numbers and therere the last two youy look everybody hits a wall no matter where you are in your career where you are in the season somebody always kind of fighting to get back in their groove right coach Klay Thompson Ive seen him Miss 10 12 threes in a row and hes as good as there is so it happens the big thing is you got to play through it you got to keep shooting and do the other thing oh you do all the other things for sure play was great at that he just played defense and try to get some Steals and try to get fouled eight to shoot for the Eagles Kelly lost it on the dribble Collins has done a little bit of everything in this first half ninepoint lead for Virginia T but hes the god WD coming into the season they have to rely on MJ Collins to be that Defender to take some of the pressure off of hanuk coutur whos played that role really for the last three years for Mike young having to go out and guard the other teams best offensive player nice pass time out for Grant poua isnt making shot hes making plays and thats what you do as a guard well Shan padulla terrific look here J this is a great pass and lefthanded and they get the Music dun six of 11 and Hunter Couture is lit the fuse for Virginia Tech tonight Cory he absolutely has been shooting the basketball great you talked about the second half at NC State thats carried over here hes comfortable in the castle this is home five years for hanuk Couture and again you know whenever youre coming into the family unbelievable its always going to help Shooters shoot though right Jim thats what they do man you got to be willing to live and die with it could T back in the lineup at Virginia and heres a turnover Collins has padulla with him padulla changed gears got to the rim and Applause scor impressive the way the hokes have shared the basketball that is now 11 assists on 15 made field goals and they have shared the basketball extremely well giving up good shots were great shots are we in a danger zone here for BC coach well they needed that basket lets lets go there for sure 11 for mlon first player to double figures in the ball game for either School coach to start this season it was really a big three for the Eagles when you consider post Zachary and Harris but mlon has stepped it up hes a double figure scorer now in ACC play well Zachary has games where he doesnt score like tonight hes just hasnt got anything going offensively padulla three routes in against post kick out for Couture Collins aduce front rim Miss and here is the rebound for the aforementioned mton plays with Kelly post Madson and Zachary Jaden Zachary to coachs Point averages 113 in the Music league Junior from Salem Wisconsin mton tried to feed post threw it away out of bounds to Virginia Tech dont forget Thursday night 10 Eastern after our womens basketball double header Kelsey rigs has the Hall of Famer Muffet McGraw Ivory L and Kelly gramling nothing but net the chronicle tonight on the womens card get you ready for a big weekend its the best coverage you can find of ACC womens basketball and available only one place ACC Network and streaming live on the ESPN Kelsey rigs has to be the hardest person hardest working person in Show Business absolutely every night yeah and she has to work with Coach beim thats the hard part thats a she she did really protest in coming the second she said coach one time okay but not not every time I think she checks her schedule and makees sure Im not there Kel unbelievable not Kelsey shes cannot believe you just said that coach and she checks the schedule its a 13point Virginia Tech lead Kelly trying to drive padulla turned it over Robbie Baron collects it qun post is working really hard to get the basketball however Virginia Tech defend Defenders with a hand in the lane not allowing him to touch it heres kid now three routes goes lefthanded couldnt Applause finish and now walk into the front court for the final 75 seconds heres post off the post inside scores and thats why you work so hard to get him the basketball because he normally makes it worth your while when he gets the basketball on his hands well he is a gifted player at 7 ft averaging 15 and six in conference play top 20 in both categories Collins wow nine in the first half for MJ Collins he averages less than seven in conference play coach Virginia Techs getting getting something from everybody I mean this is something thats like free money when they get stuff like this big lead for the HS Music Virginia Tech huddled up over there hes got to feel pretty good Cory there hitting almost 61 from the floor in the first half and when you consider that they shot 62 in the second half against NC State seeing that offense carry over onto your home floor and this is how you build momentum coach you think about going through the stretches of ACC riggers when you see your team starting to develop like this offensively you have to feel good about that right and you got seven guys scoring you dont have one or two you got everybody scoring thats a big part of why theyre in this position and BC is going to have to get the ball into post more I mean its hardia Tech doing a good job defensively but they got to get him the ball thatll help their offense very quiet first half for Quinton post hes got six points and only one rebound inside post again turns on kid and scores eight for post last couple games 18 points seven rebounds but only 39 from the floor took a lot of shots to get that 18 that was a tough really tough lefthanded shot there they tried to get two for one but they they didnt get the ball in bounds theyre going Virginia Techs going to get the last shot MJ Collins will initiate the offense against Donald Han Jr kid trying to help with the screen Collins and a foul called with 42 left to shoot its on Donald Han Jr the red shirt freshman from lown high school in Virginia Beach and thats a great foul when you have a foul to give to be able to do that right in the midst of offense with 44 remaining yep heres padulla I think theyve got now Couture lost the handle on it mcglockton three4 court and it sails over the basket well the hes are going to shoot 6 81 from the floor in the first half yeah thats the difference really they overcame the bad and be out here with you guys well you know added bonuses are small sometimes hoks the ball to start the second half Mike young has shun the suit coat for half number two here at the castle well he had to dust them off back to wearing the suits yeah where hes been wearing the the three quter zip for a while now bounds away post the rebound it is suits and sneakers week by the way for the National Association of Basketball Coaches and the continued coaches versus cancer campaign that they do such a terrific job with around the country theres mlon he was outstanding got his own miss a league Bay with post had it slapped away and turned over here is Collins oh myness emphatic I would say that was well weve talked about padulla and Couture of course but MJ Collins now in double figures hes had a great first half and started off very well in the second half defensively and turning his defense into offense once again Collins has 11 with his fifth field goal theres a drive and score with a left hand for Quenton post not a lot of sevenfooters in the country that can do that coach thats Music impressive the term skilled big man its thrown around a lot he is in fact a skilled big man he absolutely is and we mentioned like he he averages 31 assists per game you can play your offense through him which they did on the last possession got a great look from mlin just one as was unable to finish it right corner three Collins couldnt cash it Music out 11point lead Zachary tough first half on the board with the drive there first points for Jaden Zachary he needed to get on the board yep well they need his score boring especially when you come out on the road you need your veteran players to step up Jaden Zachary the leader of this Boston College Eagles team has to be good for them to win on the road Collins tried to go back to kid and El leag Bay pulls away the rebound those are the toughest plays you get a good set good shot and just miss thats hard hard for coaches post double team coming nice pass underneath tour nice anticipation takes the turnover and a backourt foul on post will be his third thats where your big guy just dont do that just what are you doing playing defense there do you almost have to say hey Quinton we know the night didnt start great for you just kind of keep it in front of you a little bit here Jim you cannot make a play like that they made a you know pulla made a great defensive play all right get back play defense cant foul there big guys need every foul they need to save every foul and make it a good foul hes had two bad fouls out of his three Collins looking for meijel potit who has checked in the ball game to spell kid by the way here is potit nice catch and score there so right there post doesnt make a defensive play cuz he just picked up his third foul so now they get a layup down and he doesnt want to come out of the game so therefore he knows he has to pretty much concede that layup to be able to stay on the floor claudell Harris has gone to the table for Boston College hell check in on the next opportunity heres Kelly kick for mlon who I thought was really good in the first half had 11 for the Eagles six to shoot Zachary feeds a league Bay the catch and score nine for Prince a league Bay by the way he had 14 six on Saturday at home against Carolina in the 10point loss WD that was a good pass by Zachary but it was a great cut by League Bay recognized his teammate was in trouble and not just standing and waiting for the basketball cutting down the lane po felt forced a Miss there eagles with a chance to cut the deficit down a little more here F Bay heres Poe for three got it Quenton post thats his 26 three of the year hes got 13 now but thats why you dont contest on the other end because you understand your importance how much you have to stay on the floor because he also understands that he can stretch the defense to open things up for his teammate what was almost double figures now back down to six heres Couture with Kelly defending drives and a whistle and foul so were off to a fast start at both ends of the floor here in this second half MJ Collins ignited this crowd here at the castle with this turnover and Hammer and then a moment ago Boston College dial three from quick post sixpoint game at the Music castle wow this new Shan game you see that Virginia Techs got a sixpoint lead post had to fight some early foul trouble he averages 15 in conference plays got 13 but MJ Collins is kind of the star tonight here Jim for the hokes because his 11 comes as a guy averaging just seven in conference BL well hes hes picked it up but you know theyve had good balance they theyre very well balanced team its not just padulla Coutures only got three shots theyre theyre doing everything they can Zacharys just staying with him hes doing a great defensive job Couture cant get shots yeah whats it say about the hes that padulla is having maybe a tough night scoring everybody else is help it will be what coach beheim has said for 47 years the best thing about freshman is they become sophomores and you think about MJ Collins now in his sophomore season hes grown up and he understands his role for Mike young and how he has to be able to oper operate to take pressure off of padulla and off Hunter Couture and be that third guy they can rely on to put points on the board also in defend also by the way Mike young looking for his first win against Boston College hes beaten everybody else in the ACC but is missed in five tries against the Eagles and right now hes got post out this is a chance for Virginia Tech to take a little bit more of a a gap here with post on the bench post just scored five straight points after he picked up that foul yeah so I mean its a calculated move to sit him now but I dont I dont think they can afford to sit him too much thought Mighty Orman Mighty in the ball game gave him some nice minutes in the first half but youre right coach post was rolling here is the sophomore Mighty mlon got the rooll that helps hes playing so confident right now you go you go have a game on a row where you score a third all of a sudden you feel like youre a focal pointed offense yeah well hes keeping them in there 13 for mton after a 15o 14 rebound game at Syracuse and the 30point game we mentioned to George attack Couture another three nope first Miss of the night for Hunter Couture from the field that was a great Look What A Catch and dumped by Armani Mighty really good catch it was a it was a really good catch but the fact that mlin had the presence of mind to know not even put that on the floor just find his guy in front of and put it right on the spot all of a sudden its down to four heres Collins three over a leag bay Baron the long rebound and the roll seven for Robbie Baron and only the third offensive Rebound in the game for the Hokies the Eagles have dominated that category but a big one for Robbie Baron to be able to pick up Zachary had it red out of there mcglockton cleans it up up with a right hand and in 15 for Deon mcglockton if you didnt know any better you would think that mcglockton was the 610 guy hes playing like one they got back in the game with post out thats pretty impressive pure padulla three with Zachary trailing and he knocks it down nine for padulla thats his first three thats going to wake him up a little bit sevenpoint lead for the hokis and a whistle and foul thats going to be off the ball on padulla second on the Junior from Edmund Oklahoma second on Mike Youngs team Boston College getting out in transition and look at the find from mlin to find Mighty under the Bas but on the other side Shan padulla youre not going to run me off the line you may move me sideways but Im still going to find this three bam like the shot F I guarantee it didnt you you really like it I love it I love it all the little things Cory right Hey listen coach was a player WD always he was a player I had the shot fig I couldnt get my shot Zachary foul line and mighty going to be ticket it for over the back here thatll be his second third on Boston College but earol Grant wants what he felt like was contact on JayZ Zachary when he shot the pull up he felt like there was there was contact on that one and Zachary talking to the official now about just that hey Armani Mighty averages less than 5 minutes a game in conference play he played 8 minutes in the first half and is getting what another three four minutes minutes here in the second half well its coming to an end now good point its well done because you got Quinton po coming back in and not this is the last time well see Mighty but Quinton post back into the game but positive minutes from Earl Grant for his bigs no they did a good job they kept it in kept it close sevenpoint game its been as big as 13 here in the second half early in the half for Virginia Tech we also have to remember Quin post playing with those three fouls so going have to be careful on the defensive end and a foul there on Virginia Tech John GNE going to get Couture here for the hook and hole Couture just trying to be crafty coming off the screen yeah youre just trying to get ahead of Harris won that one I understand I think thats a good call I think it was was it could go almost either way but Applause yeah double teaming claudell Harris Junior on the wings one of the things weve seen really to start this game weve seen a lot of deflections throughout this game how important is that as a coach to be able to make sure you got your hands a lot of people keep that stat is a big stat in their with their defense its its important theres Zachary the feed mlon the layup 17 for mton now he came in averaging just six in his last three terrific night for the red shirt sophomore back to a fivepoint game heres nichel to and Harris lot of contact making it up quite a bit twopointer for nickel back to a sevenpoint Virginia Tech lead and Tyler nickel actually averaging double figures in ACC play also so you have to account for him whenever hes on the floor for the hookus Y hes one of the four Virginia Tech players at 10 or better in the league lot of contact in the post here is post against kid double team coming Harris a three back rim miss good look though for claudell Harris Jr and that ball got knocked away turned over by Virginia Tech Harris launching and hitting six for claudell Harris Jr you got to give him credit hes not stopping Sho hes just going to let it go its not always easy to do and his only two field goals have been threepointers is when his team has needed the most that one makes it a fourpoint game as the Eagles have hung around here and weather the storm back door Couture well theyve been over playing the whole game they were they had to they had to find that one WD you heard me ask him pregame can you still dunk and what tell me yeah it just takes a little more effort now than it used to that was that looked pretty effortless it Music did back to a sixpoint game look at mlon spin cant finish on Robbie Barrett its a heck of a ball game now it absolutely is be careful of a Couture three on this possession right now hes feeling it Couture around Harris fights through draws the foul theres getting more contact on every play Harris is going to get the foul his first Cory well in the fifth year WD I had to ask the young fella do you still have it he waited to show everyone oh Im still bouncy EDD Royal former hokey theyll be releasing everything yesterday we saw the week one schedule today the Thursday Friday schedule was released including let me call your attention to BC Virginia TCH on Thursday night October 17th Miss Jeans birthday by the way Mama D the 30th anniversary of Thursday Night Football in blackburg WoW Boston College in Virginia Tech I can tell you right now I remember the old Big East days when Virginia Tech was in the Big East playing against Boston College you got talking about two guys from the state of Virginia Damen Woody going up against Michael Vic yeah some big time B battles throughout that time yep there was also a night when Boston College visited blackburg when Matt Ryan threw into the back of the end zone in the final seconds to beat the H you might not get out of here talking like that I can talk about M Ry I did it for 14 years I can do that I get it I but not here yep so thats tomorrow at 5 dont forget ACC Network ESPN 2 and also available on the ESPN app lot of folks excited youll get the full schedule of of the 17 team Atlantic Coast Conference thats what Im excited about as you see MJ Collins continue to do the job defensively forcing the turnover off of Harriss leg Im excited about me you coach beim must making a trip out west like coach beheim used to do to go get all his players from California us going to doing games at Cal and at Stan were going to see Stevie Thompson out there or something like that I think I think maybe cant wait yeah go out there to the Berkeley Im going to take a week out there though go we we can do two games well do a Saturday Monday Saturday Tuesday game I think bes talking about staying a little longer Cory a lot longer and not working by the way yeah he wants two days off in between I can tell you that Im retired heres kid ball game is eight points Madson ahead Harris is knocked down a three nice move to the Baseline against Collins took the contact got knocked out Harris took a shot up around the but coach okay at some point dont you have to realize the guy played good defense on me its not time to take a shot its more so to pass it out right you think so you think so post had it knocked away on his shot attempt by ly kid you make your move if you have it you have it if you dont think he make the pass and let somebody else try to go and MJ Collins has done a great job defensively Owen Harris when hes been in attack mode he shut him off completely you got to move that basketball dont compound the mistake by making a tough shot eight to shoot Matson one dribbl and picked up on it heres post again three to shoot tough shot the to the rebound 946 to go in an eightpoint hokey lead Virginia Tech trying to get to 12 and seven theyd be level par four and four in the ACC this is one of the 11 teams uhoh let me see if Harris has got some bounce in his legs yes I tell you what thats some frustration on that one he struggled he come off the bench this game but does a great job defensively getting out in the passing Lane coming up with the steel and takes out some aggression on the rim tell you what thats pretty solid work Cory it absolutely is nickel front Court picked up by Harris now this is what I would expect for Harris to go after nickel thats not Tyler Nicholls Forte is handling the basketball surprised he didnt add more pressure Collins trying to find a path on Matson nichel could not finish over post that got poked Away by Kid nice play there kid and fouled by mlon second on mlon Fifth on the Eagles here but claudell Harris Jr eight in a game and gets out in the passing Lane takes a look back to see is anybody can contest this theyre not so Im going to have a little extra hang time around on the rim let out some of the aggression where its been a tough game offensively for Harris but I love the way as coach said hes stuck with it continue to play Confident basketball and making plays for his team here is the sixth best free throw shooter in the ACC ly kid he is now 55 of 63 at the line this year but how about his progression youre talking about a young man who started his career at Clemson transferred in average one point a game didnt play much coming here and all of a sudden hes a stud in the ACC right now Jim you one of those guys that buys that the bigger kids may take a little longer to develop always always has we we used to try to red shirt freshman and and you know big guys and then I get the last year will be much better than that first year inside and mlon going to be fouled from behind Robbie Barons having a hard time with Deon mlon I told you earlier if you didnt know any better you would think mcglockton was the 610 guy but he is strong he is a load to handle down there on the Block similar to another guy that played at Boston College whos here by the name of Da Abrams whos on the radio call he came up and came up and gave coach beam a hug earlier today yeah he beat us to death for four years undersized power ABS comes up to see bayam and bayam starts shivering what in the world you thought he was going to play tonight he aever a double double against us I know that like all of a sudden the bad dreams came to reality Harris nice shot uhoh and again weve seen Harris knocked down a couple of Threes but the steal in the dunk I think that got him going we talked about doing the other things when youre not shooting well and hes done that here for his team tonight well hes kept his aggression thats what you got to do Couture now back for Collins heres potit against post up strong couldnt finish Harris the backside rebound dont look now but its a game sixpoint game post reroutes fouled by poti second on Migel fifth on the hokes with 803 to play quick reminder to you we got a double header coming up for you on acc Network its going to start here in blackburg at 500 Georgia Tech Virginia Tech and then at 700 well be at the JMA dome in central New York for NC State and Syracuse wolf pack is in Charlottesville tomorrow night part of two games on the ACC slate Miami visits noted a and the welltraveled Cory Alexander will be there with Doug Sherman WD I got a uh its probably a silly question but is there a certain Hall of Fame coach in the Ring of Honor at Syracuse yes hes already there snuck him in early okay I just make it sure Harris at three M glockton the rebound and the score 19 for mton B should have been up there first but you know once I beat him one time you beat him one time okay I got you he he he forgave me Cory the mans name is signed on the floor too by the way yeah no I I know that part Ive been there more than enough to recognize that yeah potit scores nice answer by the hokes to push it back to six but guys with 7 and a half to go feels like we might be headed to the wire well it looked like Virginia Tech had control but Boston College hasnt going away heres Zachary its been a quiet night offensively just the one field goal for Jaden Zachary a league Bay with 10 to shoot Zachary tries to weave all the way Basel line lost it and then last touch Couture so well get a timeout BC trailed at 1 point3 early in this second half its down to six in blackburg Big Mac no just ahead of seven minutes to play great to be at Castle Coliseum tonight Cory Alexander Jim baham West Durham all right were seeing a pretty good ball game here its part of a nice three games here tonight in the ACC but the road teams have won all three games so far tonight coach the road teams have been playing better really better in the last two weekend two games two bunch of games and the league is just so balanced that you cant tell whos going to win Pittsburgh couldnt win at couldnt play well at all and then all of a sudden they go down to Duke can win now they going to Georgia Tech can win Florida state had a terrible start to the year and now theyre second place in the league by the way pits at Miami this weekend I I think Jeff Cap was ex simp say were not playing at home anymore because they cant make shots at home but when they get on the road they have been outstanding another strong performance for Coach capable and his team on the road at Georgia Tech Duke getting taking care of business at Louisville and of course the best team in the ACC University of North Carolina a dominant second half against Wake Forest last night Harris had it blocked recovered Zachary who scores it was a live shot clock because Harriss shot never touched the rim Zachary second field goal draws Virginia Tech now lead down to four 6561 heres Cur after a sparkling first half a different kind of scoring half so far for Hunter Couture working on Harris tried to knock it it back in on the bounce pass turned over here is Zachary hell feed Harris and he lost it on the way up and John gney defers to Bren Hampton who says it goes to Virginia Tech on the turnover and that was a tremendous job by Robbie Baron getting back defensively not conceding the lay up getting in the way and thats a great call call Great call its a good call you think it was you mean to say that you were actually going against the official just for the 30 second time oh okay just just okay just only 30 second time it they get one right sometimes you know you got to understand that I tell you what John gapy has a tremendous amount of respect for Coach beam because these two have a great relationship and hes come over a number of times just to pick on you a little bit yeah he likes to pick on you Couture left it on the rim heres poti fresh 20 Baron the three and knocked around potit will give the hes a third try padulla oh and post kept it alive again almost got a fourth offensive rebound on that possession and thatll be a block on padulla third on padulla six now on Virginia Tech under six minutes to play Jaden Zachary just trying to attack and padulla not really much contact there trying to draw a call unable to get it picks up the foul but momentum on the side of the Boston College Eagles right right now they have stood the test against this Virginia Tech team that got off to a hot start here at home they were in some real trouble in this game and now theyre right in the game Harris heres Zachary back for post against kid zachar a three Off the Mark kid the nice box out hes just got to hit one of those in there as soon theyre in a one possession game yeah thats what the Eagles have been missing throughout this game is the threepoint shooting its let him down a team that comes in averaging over 77 points per game nickel for kid and deflected and taken away mcglockton and a foul on Baron boy Devin mcglockton tonight has done a little bit of everything for Boston College to keep them alive hes been their MVP WD hes been the guy for them throughout this game got off to a great start on the offensive glass making shots and here he is now with the opportunity to make this a onep possession game and can even get it down to two if hes able to knock down both free thr hes already got his second double double of the year after the 15 and 14 at Syracuse hes got 19 and 10 tonight one and one no good they just cant quite get there we just got to get one play more I mean then they have a good chance yeah coach a number of times weve said theyve gotten it down to four but they havent been able to get it any closer than that Baron padulla for three and post collects now at this point and Coach youve done this a lot more than me but would you think this is the time to get the basketball hands of Quinton post and see if they can get something good on the offensive end 100 and were both wrong were both wrong absolutely Im just glad you agree with me while were wrong and now six for Zachary and we got a foul here no foul called John GNE stopping play on something with padulla and Jaden Zachary well weve seen physical play throughout from both these teams throughout this entire game so a great call time out by John gathy to be able to allow these guys to cool down and more importantly the officials will take control of this game when we come back with James Zachary making a onep possession game we turn John Gaffney visiting there with Pat Drisco theyre earning their keep tonight this been a physical ball game we got a close game and we got some chatter going back and forth with badulla and Zachary and John Gaffney did a nice job turning the heat down a little bit yeah I mean those two have been doing that the whole game its been a physical game theyve Let It Go but theyve called what theyve had you and theyve kept control of the game so now theyre going to call anything thats close right now backourt pressure applied by The Eagles who Trail two down by as many as 13 early in this second half Cory BCs just kind of stuck with it yeah theyve had the right response every time the hes tried to get some separation they have not allowed them to be able to do it heres kid for Baron mlon now on the bounce pass heres kid one more time with post looking for padulla with five to shoot launching from long range W thats like a game saver right there it absolutely is especially when theres been chatter back and forth is simply about get a bucket you dont have to say a word turned over and a foul on Zachary Applause six on Boston College first on the junior Jaden Zachary sonan padulla is going to allow his game to do the talking the big three knocks it down and Applause respon want to get the most out of one sheet grab B it probably did that matchup is coming up soon Ill be here for that one There He Go is yeah I mean he is living his best life WD thats Jason thats Jason Kels some distant relative Outdoors at the Buffalo Bills thats it yeah there you go I knew yeah so the foul on Zachary its a common foul six on Boston College hokes with a fivepoint lead in the ball and heres MJ Collins who got off to a really good start here tonight and has continued to play a very nice night padulla in traffic fallway got it five in a row for Sha padulla but thats the way you answer the conversation when you got to call a timeout because you guys are chirping thats how you answer it thats how you do it he answered Kelly and a block on padulla and Sean grimaced a little bit when he hit the floor thats his fourth with 307 to go grabbing at the back of that left leg going to go over and have a conversation with Mike young one and one for Chaz Kelly 65 free throw shooter see padulla go down but immediately grabbed the back of that left leg something to keep an eye on throughout the game but WD theres one way to allow people to know that they cant guard you is when they cant guard you you just go score you dont have to say a word boy that was pretty deep I dont know I think that went over over Co coach Im also a philosopher arent you arent you glad you retired for that logic pay huh over my head Im also a philosopher coach Jim you set on that bench for 47 years and you could have lived without that one couldnt you yeah he have Im sure he told a couple guys Hey listen they cant guard you here is Collins along to fivepoint game under three to go Mike young trying to beat Boston College for the first time hes beaten everybody else in the accs winless in five tries against the Eagles tend to shoot for Harris theres post lost it briefly right hand off the glass Quinton post 15 for the big fella from the Netherlands made some tough shots the good things happen when you put the ball in the hands of number 12 one possession game with two 10 to go heres padulla scored the last five and a foul on Zachary will be his second that is seven on BC so one and one with 202 to go for Shawn padulla thats the one advantage when you play in the end you just you put a guy like this on the foul line hes making two point yeah make him make a shot 80 hes 80 coach you just dont put him on the line Virginia Virginia Tech is the fourth best free throw shooting team in the ACC in League plus well with Jim Bayon cor Alexander Wester M Castle Coliseum we got a fivepoint game you see the details each schools got two timeouts possession belongs to Boston College both teams are in the bonus and for BC premium on the possessions here right Jim yeah I mean theyve got to try to go to post its hard but hes get an advantage down there theyll try to get him the ball if they double theyll get an open three hopefully thats what theyll look for Chaz Kelly Devin mcglockton Quinton post Claude El Harris Jr Jaden Zachary on the floor for the Eagles here is post they ISO him against kid and hell draw the foul but thats where post has been at his best its not when theyve tried to feed him the basketball and the post but when hes caught on the perimeter and actually put it on the floor to make a play for himself and himself a scoring position three three straight driving the ball and here he goes to the foul Lyn kid the foul nine on Virginia Tech Brinton post 10th best free throw shooter in the ACC no good so coach maybe that Jinx doesnt it doesnt apply to you no however Durham okay yeah okay so it is an announcer Jinx just not a didnt say anything on that I was worried about him making that one five points it stays Baron here you just want to use the ball and there he goes left hand couldnt finish post cleans it Music up Zachary Harris thought about it into traffic Harris a deep three off the rim the rebound padulla a minute to go now in blackburg fivepoint lead for Virginia Applause te Uss the whole shot clock s the whole shot clock and get back and play defense and youre in great position heres padulla long three missed everything Zachary out of there with it half minute to go twopossession game Harris tees one up and hits claudell Harris Jr 10 in the half 13 in the ball game and now all of a sudden we got ourselves a twopoint game under a half minute well you dont get a shot at all and you miss the rim hit the rim now you have a chance to get back set your defense they never did that theyre still under 30 so they still got a still a foul situation they got two of the best fre throw shooters in the league so but shot clocks off are you trying to extend the game here DCs got to try to make one attempt to steal the ball and if they dont get it they want a foul if they can they dont let theour get the ball they dont let Pula get the ball its anybody else and you foul that guy when he catches if one of those guys catches it you foul him right away okay but they try to get it out of their hands theyre going to try to get it into their hands with Virginia Tech but try to get one steal and then just foul yeah dont forget nothing but net Justin Walters Luke Hancock follows our coverage here from blackburg theyll tell you about Dukes Road win at Louisville Pitts Road win at Georgia Tech and Florida States road win at Syracuse by the way tonight nolles go to 6 and2 in the ACC jir Watkins 27 for the simal tonight great job by lonard Hamilton and his staff the way that they have really had a Resurgence during ACC play they struggle at time for the NOS in nonconference but they have figured things out you the three of us were watch them at North Carolina on December the 2nd they all got off to a great start in that game unable to finish it but thats one of B two ACC L theyre theyre one of the most mysterious teams in not just the ACC gym maybe in college basketball well I think I just think Leonards are very underrated basketball Co he told me at North Carolina theyd be a tournament team and they look like it for 30 minutes against North Carolina yeah they just lost the pressure killed them big win tonight for them on the road heres Baron to put it in play pullan now through the back court back to Baron thats the guy theyll take the foul and and Zachary commits it and that worked perfectly and again not that Robbie Baron cant go and knock down a couple free throws however you dont want to send Hunter Couture sha padulla to the free throw line you want to send someone who hasnt been there as often well Baron has only shot 16 free throws hes hit 14 of them I mean he hes you know hes a great shooter but you know we havent been there that much Id much rather have him there than either one of those guards to your point Couture and padulla 64 and 65 free throw attempts during the year just 16 here for Robbie Baron and those are the guys that are used to being in this situation this is new for Robbie Baron to be in the GU the free throw line in this scenario one and one for Baron and he made it so the game is three now that is point number eight on the night for the Northwestern transfer who is from Richmond hell turn 24 in a couple weeks and the second one good those free throws at end the games are just so much a part of winning the game he misses the first one they make the three and now youre behind so its a two possession game with 229 left and you see that Boston College and Virginia Tech both down to one timeout any foul by the hokes is two shots though for BC here I like the action earol Grant ran earlier where you get Quinton post at the top of the key dribble hand off but instead of him rolling he pops back behind the threepoint line Im sure Mike young will have his team prepared to guard it but that often times put it big like like L kid in rotation difficult to go on Earl Grants got a terrific staff over there Cory Anthony GL Cory McCrae Jim moliner just a really good staff I think theyre going in this situation I go for three you drive and get to 6 8 seconds you got to foul Couture probably or padulla most likely and theyre going to make them so you you got a two to three foul now you got a chance to tie the game with a three one thing we have seen tonight very balanced scoring by Mike Youngs team Hunter Couture perfect from the floor in the first half look now you got four in double figures and Robbie Baron right on the doorstep they what they were sharp in the second half the other day in Raleigh theyve answered it a little bit here tonight too they have but you got to give the Eagles a lot of credit for the way that they have withstood every run this is one of the toughest places to play in the ACC having to come in and win in Castle Coliseum and the Eagles have stood the test however Virginia Tech tried to put the finishing touches on what would be their second straight win Harris Zachary post mlon and Chad Kelly by the way a 25 threepoint shooter on the floor here is Zachary 19 seconds left Paris will drive and a block is called on padulla and thats his fifth but what you have to understand and Shan padul is a very smart basketball player it is virtually impossible to draw a charge with the new rules in todays game you have to already have been set well before the Tom Harris gets over there before he even launches you have to be set so thats the right call yeah and he was in the circle anyway so it was wasnt even close ironically they got the block on the play from behind well they got to put somebody in the ball game here thats five on padulla and Brandon Rex Steiner is not able to play tonight maai long not able to play so well at this point though you want to go with your best fre go shooter so its going to be Tyler niichel who steps in to be able to come in and hes a bigger player so you got a chance to be able to rebound on a Miss more so but you want guys that can go to the free throw line and knock down shot plus you lose your best ball hand you know they knock these two down now they now I think Wason College really is going to go all out and get a steal well you got two shots for claudell Harris Jr Cory so youre going to give yourself a window here whether you make or Miss intentionally the second one you absolutely are well at this point I want to make both of them absolutely heres Harris no good 69 free throw shooter his first one of the night bounds away for all the bacon nope so now do you foul you foul here you absolutely you go for the steel once again but if you cant get it you foul and there is mlon I believe and that will be his third but WD you also recognize Hunter Couture knowing that theres no sha padul on the floor Hunters not giving that basketball up youre going to have to rip his arm off to get it he has zero intention of passing that basketball one and one for Couture and the hokes who are almost 79 in conference play are 79 during the regular season second best free throw shooting team in the league have not missed tonight well they may actually be first now because Wake Forest who was first at 80 did not shoot free throws very well last night at Carolina so they may have dropped Virginia Tech May overtake that Couture hes not missing nope double figures fifth time in the last six games hes been on the floor knocked him both out 13 seconds left fourpoint game fivepoint game 7671 Harris three ball spins away Couture the rebound and that will do it Mike young does Beat Boston College 7671 the hokes are 4 and four in the ACC in 12 s overall welcoming Georgia Tech here on Saturday BC travels to Notre Dame and then
