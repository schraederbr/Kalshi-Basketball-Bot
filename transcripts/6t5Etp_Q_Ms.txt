nine transferred four true freshman and every year you got to sort of relearn your basketball team Yeah consistency is the elusive thing in all of college basketball Every coach every program striving to create it Cal no different But theyve got a lot of guys that score double figures They move the ball and they believe in each other A well put together team that plays as one unit Chris Bell for the Bears with the first shot of the game is off the mark and Bayern Dango number 11 whos played very well for Georgia Tech with the rebound One of the best players in the conference He is active creates a lot of things Also a defensive presence a little bit of a rim protector as well Lamar Washington runs the show number one for the Yellow Jackets in the corner Thats the leading scoreer Reeds the way Reeves for a shot off Thats John Camden the transfer from Delaware and Virginia Tech All these players with resumes from different schools Is Bells second shot contested cheering Wanted a call didnt get it but offensive rebound by Justin Pippen And now a foul A reachin on Lamar Washington And yes that Pippen name is familiar is the son of the Hall of Famer Scotty Pipper Talked with that young man earlier today Lots of development in his game Mark Madson head coach Got to visit with him the former Stanford great the former NBA champ with the Lakers Its year three for him with the Bears and got off to his best start 5960 cheering And a beautiful reverse and crossover by Day Ames who puts the first points on the board I was giving him a hard time today about being a Chicago point guard And thats that Chicago game right there Little inside out with the pullup and an unforced error cheering for Georgia Tech Thats Damon Starter He is the head coach former NBA standout with the Blazers coached at Pacific but probably most famous for being Cory Williams roommate at the University of Arizona More on that later but he had some stories to tell that Cory might not want shared in this broadcast as Ames is now two for two Well you see the first one go down and right there under control Good follow through Ames the kind of player we talked earlier who can get his own shot whenever he wants to And Dongo had the heroics Saturday at uh Check that back to that story in one second as Mustaf misses cheering and applause Now its Pippen who leaves it beautifully Count the hoop Elix and one Dave we talked about them being connected This is what we mean Keeping the ball to the final moment knowing your job knowing your roles The point guard gives it up Big man rolls Georgia Tech just a step late on the rotation Theyre going to get three the hard way Pippen will find you the ball Had a careerhigh eight assists at Miami on Saturday Has 37 steals Very unselfish player I mentioned Indongo He was the one who had the great game against Cal last year Its only the fifth meeting but Georgia Tech did win last year and Indo had the gamewinning hoop Oh and double dribble I knew that The arena knew that Everyone knew it And you see the strategy early from the Bears Theyre going to double team that ball screen and how Georgia Tech plays out of that double team is going to determine a lot here for the Yellow Jackets Elach to Pippen Now Ames whos made his first two shots Justin Pippen creates some space Three pump fakes and draws a foul Heads up play by Justin P Couple of good oneonone efforts by Dayday early but then Cal relying on their system and opportunities to get points Heads up play there by Pippen along with the pick and roll we saw earlier Pippens a 82 free throw shooter Didnt look like it there but he is 76 overall prospect He out of Southern California the son of Scotty didnt play a ton at Michigan last year Says he loves the chemistry here Just loves everything about his teammates And Mark Madson credits him Cory not just being great but as as being one of his most improved players And thats what you want in terms of player development You want your guys to make leaps and bounds in terms of how they play And hes done that Chaz Kelly for three And the Yellow Jackets are on the board mentioned only two losses for the Bears at home 15 and two overall 16 six Ames Day Ames with some heat check early Hes three for three Shag Town is in the building You cant really do anything about those types of plays Thats just the point guard making it happen Indongo inside but no hoop Theyll have a foul before End of possession Its all about who has the ball And right there Day again with the closer Hes off to a great start for Cal Leads the team in scoring at 166 and hes scored double digits in 19 of the 22 games this season So not a surprise This is Cam Craft and Dango rolling and a nice interior pass Great ball movement by the Yellow Jackets who spread the court and Jaden Mustaf was the recipient at the end David took him a few possessions but how they play out of that trap is crucial right there That was perfect execution Justin Pippen off the mark and Dongo with the rebound Craft a long three He shot that right in front of you Gord And that was a set play They were going for that the entire length of the court They knew they were going to take that shot He a lot of confidence almost put it down So far its Dayday Ames 10 The Yellow Jackets five and Ames draws the foul And it brings us to our first timeout California Bay You know how everyone says You fly Ill buy Yeah Well tell me if Im right Damon had to buy the groceries and you would cook the groceries Was that the arrangement Yes Uh I singlehandedly fed the Arizona backcourt the year we went to the Final Four in 94 I was the resident chef I took my basic spaghetti and scrambled egg skills and fed the team So I asked him and I said What type of a cook was Cory And he said You know he was he was okay So Craft was off and then Dango nice follow So Cory if he says he was okay I mean thats not like a huge ringing endorsement but you were Julia Child or something Well he was a lottery pick So since college he was eating very very well So compared to the level hes been on since I could say I was pretty good He didnt start Thats pretty good too John Camden for three And the Bears up 157 Georgia Tech off to a cold start but with the patience to chip away The question is can they feast out of this double team Every time the ball is doubled in the paint can they swing to an open shot and knock it down They did but Graham misses the shot and Craft just off the mark Bell along the baseline Contested jump shot No good Craft again Ball partially blocked and Dongo cleans it up And thats a problem for the Cow Bears And Dongo really just home alone in the paint They cant put up a whole lot of resistance in the oneonone Hes just too good Theyve got to secure that defensive rebound And had to get rid of it and it was run down by TT Carr And now theres seven on the shot clock End of possessions Ames has been heroic Ames clear space cheering Very good boy at creating distance off the dribble And another unforced turnover early cheering You know Dave having a great point guard solves so many things Ames being able to connect at the end of possessions when things are a little arai right now outscoring the entire team for Georgia Tech Yeah 10 to nine 10 of the 17 DK Manuel D has checked in Sevenfooter number 12 for Cal Kuesi Reeves Hes the leading scoreer but hes off there Averages 16 a game for the Yellow Jackets And then a foul on number seven Chaz Kell Nolan Dorsey 21 checks in for Mark Madson Dorsy a grad senior transfer from Campbell where last year he was the CIA defensive player of the year And for Georgia Tech Cole Carowak number eight checks in Sorry No And for Campbell Campbell sneaky good for the Bears You got to keep an eye on him A crafty guard who can make things happen Its always a luxury when you can come in with guys who bring something to the table Not just giving guys a rest but can come out and contribute TT Carr into the lane Campbell His shot is partially blocked Fleming got a hand on it Now the lob and the flush Beautiful finish and running up the floor by Cole Carowak We saw that coming a mile away Kurak off to the races Beautiful execution by Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets within six Parr cheering took an extra step He came up on the pump fake He says I didnt Michael Greenstein says Yes you did This is off a miss Watch how the Yellow Jackets get out This is actually a threeonone but it only takes the big fella Put it up there Kai Fleming inside A strong move by the freshman Another offensive rebound for Georgia Tech Flexing their muscle in the paint Cal right now needs to settle down a little bit They got off to a great start Open shots good oneon ones got to the free throw line Last couple of possessions Ball rolls in and out but a foul on the floor on Georgia Tech on Carowak So the Bears will have the ball when they come back Holding on to a 1713 lead music All major conference teams Theyre 132 here at Hos Pavilion All things point to a great stretch run by Cal First you got to get by a pesky Georgia Tech team here at home Well easiest remaining schedule says who I want to know who said that And the teams on the schedule probably dont appreciate that either Bayern Dango reverses it for Georgia Tech Yeah hes too much in the oneonone Anytime they get him in the post its a bucket Georgia Tech wants to stay with that if they can Thats the second moving screen on Cal but theyre not staying stationary during the screen Campbell got dinged on that earlier And right there another moving screen called Elich picks up his second foul and he is subbed out for it Its always one of the most difficult parts of college basketball A lot of coaches use it You bring your big man out to set ball screens but youre asking your biggest strongest often slowest player to try to screen a little quick guy and he ends up picking a foul up 30 ft from the basket coach and this comes in for him Number 17 the big Lithuanian Big possession here for Georgia Tech if they can convert but theyre going to call a foul Yeah I thought maybe they call a travel violation Half of Cals fouls by the way Cory have been the moving screen The locals dont like this call and their question is did he pull And I think he had his hand on his shoulder and kind of gave him a little tug to pull him off balance Good call by the officials Nice back cut Lays it in And Dango with a nice assist Now were down to a two possession game after a rocky start Can Cal get back on track or do the Yellow Jackets keep surging He was so open He didnt know what to do after the pump But Coach Andis will go to the free throw line and shoot it You know sometimes the way to get open is to go away from the ball And right there beautiful twoman game Dont crowd the passer Give them space Use your angles Montis Coachinus the 611 Lithuanian will shoot two And a reminder next Wednesday on the ACC Network another double header Virginia Tech and Clemson seven and then Wake Forest and Georgia Tech 9 Eastern Great ACC hoops only on the ACC network Coaching misses both surprising because Cal is a very good free throw shooting team but empty there Washington did everything but get that thing to drop Another strong rebound by Pippen in a crowd Cal with the mismatch in the paint to see if they can get to it And its another offensive foul on Ames And Dave this is actually a good call The crowd doesnt like it but Cal just having difficulty staying still while they set ball screens Has committed six fouls music Four have been of this variety Ames is just pushing his player Yeah And you cant call Yeah its the right call Its one thing to go around a guy or bump into him but the twohanded shove is not going to get overlooked by the officials The good news is Ames has 13 points made five of his first six shots The bad news is hes now sitting down with two fouls Yeah and hes been the goto guy at the end of possessions for Cal Off to a good start making threes in transition And now theyll have to play looks like the final six minutes of this game without their point guard Well see how they adjust offensively and can Georgia Tech try to find a way to take advantage of this lineup They double team in Dongo which we were told they would do a lot Turnover by George as Washington was on the end Yeah And Dongo races to the corner to to avoid the double team and none of his teammates came to his aid He end up throwing a risky pass out front 622 left first half Cal up 2620 First of two meetings Theyll meet in early March in Atlanta Bell perfect smooth shooter Bell set play Great execution by Cal Washington passed up a shot and it led to an air ball Here comes Camden That was the most open Georgia Tech has been all game Justin Pippen for three and the lead is double digits Huge change in momentum right there for Cal They get the stop and drill a three started the game only one of five from three have since made five of six Big possession here for Cal Pippen with a little heat check Wanted two in a row Nice little 6 run by the Bears Georgia Tech trying to stay with them Strong move inside and Lamar Washington ends a little run by the Bears You feel like Cory this is sort of a crucial part of the game for Georgia Tech right here before the half Well they struggled They havent shot the ball well and they know it That probably wont continue Hopefully they can pick up their shooting I know thats what theyre hoping for And if youre Cal you want to keep your foot on the gas Youre getting everything you want Great plays to the rim And right there its going to be a goend Count that bucket Its no hoop Theyre called offensive basket interference on coach and its offensive goal See who hits the rim Yeah 17 grapp Thats a no No I mean Cory if theres anyone that knows goalending its me I cant tell you how many shots Ive goended in my career Zero Skywalker Felton Ive heard of you Yeah Zero would be the answer cheering And the shooting woes continue for the Yellow Jackets Bell inside Tough defense Pippens left alone on the other wing They swing it and pick on I like his game Cory He is crafty Well plays like that open up after you drill a couple of jumpers and the defender has the respect 18 points Theyre up 12 Early story was day Ames and made five of his first six shots but now sitting on the bench with two fouls and an easy hoop by Akai Fleming Beautiful seal by Indongo for Fleming to get all the way to the rack If youre the visiting Yellow Jackets you really want to try to clamp down defensively in these final minutes before the half and get this thing to single digits If youre Cal you want to keep going Same suit just reheated We mentioned that five on the clock First lets get to this possession as TT Carr misses and Dongo with the rebound Georgia Techs just two and seven in the conference Theyve lost six of seven This is this is a pivotal game for them on the road They got a twoame road trip and theyd love to start off with a win before they head across the bay to take on Stanford Jaden Mustaf makes it a single digit lead for Cal Only eight now You know back in those Pack 10 Pack 12 days the Bay trip was huge for everybody Stanford Cal within a couple of days and for the Yellow Jackets Now with them in the ACC they got to get used to that Well Georgia Tech had never played at Cal here before Pippen with the runner And many of these Georgia Tech players had never been to California Chaz Kelly running through the defender and they will call the foul on number three TT Carr and Cory Theyre going to put JJ Ames back in the game with the two fouls for the final 234 this first half Yeah hes just a wizard with the ball in his hand and they need a little stability offensively Last couple of possessions not typical Cal basketball Kelly hits the free throw Interesting stat First free throws for Georgia Tech this half And you would have thought theyd done a better job of getting downhill forcing some issues But first trip to the line for the Yellow Jackets Both teams in the bonus now And boy just when you think Cal Bears are running away with it Its only a sevenpoint game Cal Golden want to answer with a good executed play right here Ames short first shot coming off the bench Cal looking to push it TT Carr decides he doesnt have numbers and goes back up top to Camden Kellys had some great looks for Georgia Tech Unable to connect and theres the theft out front Camden had it stripped And no theyre going to call an offensive foul Cory you called it before anybody But no hoop David Ramigan they said pushed off Yeah and that was unnecessary You really didnt have to do that You had the angle with the defender take the layup but right there the extension so obvious in front of the official Wipes away an easy two We could be looking at a fivepoint affair Instead Cal with the ball back after turning it over Emanuel Dope leaves it for Campbell cheering DJ Campbell with another three And you said it Dave Every time it looks like the Yellow Jackets are going to make a run Cal has an answer Yellow Jackets squander a turnover And Dumbo missed his easiest shot yet Yeah he rushed that He didnt have to get cute He could have taken his time Camden in the corner Another three for Cal The lead is 13 the largest of the game so far Washington misses the layup Under a minute to go first half TT Carr slotted by Endango but a foul is called shot number 11 by go first We talked about spacing This is movement of the ball to the corner A quick shot but from a great shooter Cal able to connect And then right here you go underneath You cant Not in Hos Pavilion The Bears feeling it Cal now eight of 14 from beyond the arc as TT Carr misses the first free throw Cal is first in the conference in free throw percentage 79 And today theyre four of eight 50 Can you explain that Cory I wish I could I Id have a job as a head coach if I could tell you how to get guys to produce at that level But Cal answering the call every time Georgia Tech has made a run Georgia Tech missing some easy opportunities there Kelly connects in the lane But their last four possessions they have wide open looks and couldnt convert Ball went out of bounds and they had to stop and reset the clock Now Mark Madson having a um not spirited but a philosophical discussion with Chuck Jones Chuck Jones Michael Greenstein and Darren White our officiating crew tonight Final 36 seconds first half Georgia Tech needing a moral victory here A stop and possibly a bucket to get this to a 10point lead possibly Cal wanting to try to close the door Ames with the runner and the floater Ames has 15 now to lead all scores Absolutely sensational first half from Dayday Ames Megan off the window dropped in and then out as the Cal Paris and on a 9 to2 Cal continue to play aggressive but the threepoint shot is a very harsh mistress It loves you sometimes and then it goes away You dont have to just keep shooting the three So Damon Stamire changing his starting lineup in this second half and he decided to start Davi Ramagan the freshman from Germany So hes in the lineup along with Endango and Craft and Mustaf and Washington I think coach start wants to put an emphasis on defense He knows theyre going to have to chip away Theres the double team on the block Washington left wide open and an easy two for Georgia Tech to start the second half Well that was a heck of a blind pass too out of that trap Ames deep three and hes continuing the second half like he started the first half Thats big Anytime the defender goes underneath the confidence Ames has 18 Hes made seven of nine from the field including two of three from three and a foul called on the Bears as Mustaf went hard to the hoop Its why you dont let guys get off to a hot start right there A little bit of miscommunication All he needs is a sliver of daylight Hes going to knock it down 4631 Bears as Jaden Mustaf goes to the free throw line Not a good free throw shooter 54 but knocks that one down And thats Mustafas first free throw attempt of this game 43 of 67 64 on the year for Jaden Must makes both See if Cal can run something for Bell Hes out there Another good shooter Bell inside Runner No good And a foul on Georgia Tech Foul is going to be on Cam Craft And Bell is going to get to shoot two First foul on Craft So Chris Bell who played for three years at Syracuse went to Delisal here local very passionate guy can be tough on himself Cory but really a guy that Mark Madson loves to have in the lineup had five threepointers in four minutes at Kansas State so guy can really heat up had 27 in that game they lost that game but he was seven of nine from three And with his size thats a thats an added bonus because youve got a player that can defend and also rebound And normally you wouldnt expect a guy his size to be that good from from the threepoint line but he delivers for the Bears Cal forcing Georgia Tech way up top to start this offense cheering And they do a nice job of finding the open man And its Mustaf again And right now with a doubledigit lead Cal is comfortable with living with that shot until Georgia Tech proves they can knock it down consistently Theyre going to double that ball screen and take their chances with the corner three Pippen off the screen Pippen high arcing shot over Indongo Good defense right there by Endango to not commit the foul End of possession Craft back to Indongo who lays it in and the foul Couldnt hear the whistle It got loud but a beautiful pass by Craft And Dave this is what Im talking about when I say hes a next level player This is a ball screen He gets fouled and has the presence of mind to switch and finish in the air That kind of agility that kind of coordination Its not very common A sensational player whos had monster games for Georgia Tech this year And Dango has eight points Tippen Buzzer sealed the victory last year cheering against this team when he scored 26 and had 13 rebounds A double double that was in Atlanta Also coming off 27 and nine in the loss to North Carolina Lead is back to eight Six nothing run by the Yellow Jackets Outstanding defense Thats why hes out there Transition Easy two And Mark Matson wants to talk it over Eight nothing run Georgia Tech contesting shots not giving up wide open looks not sending them to the free throw line making sure they limit them to one shot These are all things that get addressed at halftime And here we are three minutes into the second half and its back to a sixpoint affair Camden off the screen now Pippen wide open look He short arms it inside Pippen with a nice block Fleming didnt see him from behind You can see Georgia Tech comfortable with the trap looking to pass to the open player Cals not going to abandon their strategy of double teaming the post Craft Thats a designed inbounds play and its a good one When the coach calls your number and you got the green light it helps a player with his confidence Crab NO DOUBT NO hesitation in that set play The lead is just three Camden inside strong move and draws the foul You know this play is for you Youre going to get a double screen to the corner and the rule is to shoot it Your teammates are expecting you to shoot it Theyre going in for the rebound There you see the confidence and the release Tough shot Defender was right there But the coach calls your number You got to deliver it And you see coach starter giving him a high five and some words of encouragement Wants to see his guys fight And I can imagine the conversation that was had at halftime after cheering being a teammate and a roommate Those free throws ended an 11 nothing run by Georgia Tech Ball swatted out of bounds by Campbell from behind Great effort by Campbell to make sure he didnt give up on that play David Remigan comes back in the freshman from Germany who gives them a defensive presence Now they run the double team which leaves Craft wide open Things starting to come together for the Yellow Jackets playing out of the double team Outstanding vision by Endango And we talked about where they wanted to be at the under 16 It is a onepoint game They have erased the Cal lead in just three almost four minutes A 141 one run Hard to say and harder to do by the Yellow Jackets over 215 as that you counter double teams with But it doesnt work if youre two for 12 in the first half Right now the Yellow Jackets second half knocking down shots 14 to1 run over the last 244 as Camden knocks the free throw in And for Cal Camdens done a good job of getting to the line trying to settle this offense down give some stability That was excellent diagram and circle work by you You know why I learned something I didnt know that that car was in a terrible position I used to be the bottom man weak set That is the worst place in all of college basketball to be because you cant win Reagan with the shot Thats why you know high value players guys that require double teams they put so much stress on the competition When you have to double and play four on five you got to give up something Cory we are tied now with 15 minutes left in the second half Georgia Tech has bounced back after trailing by double digits in the first half I got to tell you Im very impressed with their toughness the way theyve come out in the second half Theres another solid defensive stop Cal has lost that quick pace and rhythm they were playing with in the first half And right now you got to feel Georgia Tech believes they can get anything they want Georgia Tech has the lead 5149 first lead tonight Dave if youre Cal you want to stick to the script Let the ball do the work No hero ball And a foul underneath on Georgia Tech You know you really felt like Georgia Tech was going to have to start shooting the three to catch up but music they made a few of them but mostly its been layups and penetrations that theyve clawed their way back into this game As great a first half as it is was for Cal and disastrous second half start and it keeps getting worse Kelly lost his foot and got it back and laid it in And Cals up by Cals trailing by four Whats the whistle after the hoop Kelly got beside himself and theyre going to hit him up for taunting standing in the face of the defender Had a few choice words The referee saw it and he put a quick end to it We talked about in the lane right here Kelly does a great job trying to bait and draw the foul No call but right there Little trash talk So heres a great ankle Great job of our truck Oh good job in there by Kevin and everybody So he you know it was a great play but then you cant get in someones face anymore Co You cant do that at all And you know if youre a coach you got to take the good with the bad You love the intensity He picked the ball off He converted in transition Hes excited Its a big game but you got to know better than to do that kind of stuff especially right in front of the refs This is a tremendous shot Good body control and he wants to let guys know And thats a no no in college basketball The facetoface taunting is going to be a T every time And good job by DJ Campbell not taking the bait Cals last field goal by Ames at 1918 in the first half Remember he had 18 in the first half So they need to get him involved again He was a oneman wrecking crew in the first 20 but so far only has two points in the second half And Dave that might have been a good foul for Georgia Tech cuz they were beat on the oneonone but an away from the ball foul gives Cal the sideline out of bounds and really wipes away two points Is this second half Cory Moore what Cal is not doing or what Georgia Tech is doing Its what Georgia Tech is doing You can tell the difference in intensity the body language the plays that are taking place Georgia Techs playing with a little bit more energy than Cal It was the exact opposite in the first half Cals got to get back to good tempo shooting the three with confidence being aggressive Theyre on their heels a little bit right now Ains loses the ball He could do nothing wrong in the first half Wow Akai Fleming the freshman tried an intra highflying flush And Dave Im gonna tell you something crazy It doesnt even matter that he missed the dunk The point is they are getting turnovers and they are feeling aggressive here in the second half These are the kind of plays you want to see your guys make He blows the dunk but the message has been sent Georgia Tech seems to be in attack mode Cal has to get to the free throw line or knock down some shots Get this crowd back in the game Georgia Tech does have 16 fouls So Cal would be smart to draw the foul and get to the free throw line and start shooting one and one which theyll do right now And if Ames cant make field goals in the second half maybe he can make free throws with the clock stopped And if youre Georgia Tech intensity is great but the technical fouls and now the tictac fouls are going to cost you over the last 13 minutes of this game Theyre going to have to learn how to defend without fouling Keep this momentum if they want to try to steal a win here And Cal number one in the conference in free throw percentage number 10 in the country 787 from the free throw line for the season Of course you know we jinx that tonight Theyre 11 of 18 61 But the point is they can shoot from there Well the other point is Cal has the guards to take full advantage of being in the bonus for the remainder of this game Onepoint lead by Georgia Tech Mustaf Now a set play that will be directed by Ames Georgia Tech has increased the defensive pressure The clocks down to six Pippens going to have to shoot it He doesnt Bell does And he got it off That hoop will count as Bell just beat the shot clock That was not cheering the best possession for Cal but it counted No it wasnt And like you say sometimes its better to be lucky than good Cal needed that bucket to calm things down and that was a huge bucket Crowd has picked up and just like that theyre quieted as Chaz Kelly goes for three Kellys had a ton of wide openen looks in the first half and there he finally gets one to go Pippen no good Felix tried to get it and Dave Georgia Tech making a run Beautiful move by Kelly the lane Cant get it to drop Theyre making this run with Indongo on the bench Impressed with Pippen rebounding in traffic with the taller players Dorsy in low Elich blocked from behind by Craft Georgia Tech their former college roommate Damon Stabire spoke to the Yellow Jackets Im going to guess there were some strong language Yeah And I think he tal he knows his team and we talk a lot about you know getting the most out of your players I think he believes in his guys and he knows that he can coach them hard Thats one of the things hes always liked about the teams that hes had guys that respond to the hard coaching And you and I have done enough games and weve talked to enough coaches and we know thats not always the case around the country Georgia Techs been sharing the ball Eight assists on 10 made this half So a nice job of moving and sharing the ball and Fleming nice job of getting his rebound off the miss Second effort short and Bell comes away with it Pippen draws the foul cheering Count the hoop Justin Kenzie has the big man mismatch and Conor tries to push off No initial call but the second bit of contact right there and has the upper body strength to get it to the rim An outstanding move by Pippen And Dave youre talking about him very improved over last year Threepoint play gives Cal the lead 5756 And Dongo picked up his third personal foul on that play number seven Four fouls now on Dayday Ames the leading scoreer in this game with 21 points and quick sub Campbell comes in and Ames goes out And Dave you can see with the Yellow Jackets their their formula their recipe is just to drive the ball They they believe they can beat Cal off the bounce All their perimeter players are trying to attack the rim and draw fouls Lets mark that time 1050 in the second half when Ames goes out Well see when he comes back in And a travel and the right call on Lamar Washington You see coach start shot selection He wants his guys to be patient Pippen lost his balance recaptured it Now Bell inside going on Craft and Craft was holding him and called for the foul Second on Craft Craft known as a shooter Thats a tough defensive assignment giving up some size and Bell obviously trying to be on the attack and create some offense Second half going to take a while as Cal will go to the free throw line now every time there is a foul applause Cal 13 of 21 from the free throw line second one on the way and good for the senior from conquered California cheering Bears backed up by three Craft trying to counter He does And were tied again Ky know your personnel Craft is a shooter You cannot be that far off of a shooter especially when hes knocked down the last two And another foul And this on Indo And thats going to be his fourth And that is a big story line for Damon Starttomire as Elich will go to the free throw line Do you leave indango in the game No hes too good of a player Hes a difference maker I think if youre Georgia Tech you got to get him out of there But the problem Cory is already Mohamd Cila their great freshman 610 240 from Senagal Hes out Hes missed six games Hes rolled his ankle And their other big man Pton Marshall 7 300 Missed the last game Hes got a right thumb sprain Hes out So their only real size is Cole Carowak whos just come in Hes sevenfooter freshman from coming Georgia And ino goes out Itll be interesting to see when do you bring Bayandongo back in Well it really depends on on time and score How much time can your guards hold you into this game or get you a lead You want to put him out there and probably say with about four minutes to go and you want to hope that its still a close game where he can make a difference So Indongo with four fouls and Ames for Cal Two of the big stories today each on both sides But Dave Georgia Tech made a run with Endango on the bench They still got guards who believe they can get it done And now this game is slowing down with a lot of fouls being called on the floor and during the shot Washington was in the active shooting Hell shoot two and Cal will get some size back cheering in the game DK Manuel Duke will come back in and Ames will come in with a four foul Hey a reminder tomorrow night weve got a double header Clemson to North Carolina at music 600 pm Florida State NC State 800 pm Eastern Great hoops Thursday on the ACC Net I tell you Dave you talk about some tense minutes aims out on the floor with four fouls Nine and a half minutes An absolute eternity left in this game Went to the hole strong Came up with nothing And on the other side here comes Georgia Tech with some numbers and Chaz Kellys left alone Georgia Techs going to need some big minutes from Kiraak out there Ames wide open And that was a blown defensive assignment cheering Carowak was late getting back on defense Ran to the wrong man Ames with 24 Cal lead by four Washington reverses it Washington a smart player He knows exactly how many fouls Ames has Took it right to him Ames had to let him score Ames pulls up over Craft Ames starting now to feel like he did early in the first half He has 26 Monster game cheering for Day Ames applause Cal with a chance to add to the lead Campbell no good Manuel Durk with an offensive board Campbell again Craft left wide open And thats going to be a foul cheering on Carowak who shoved Manuel Doot the big lefthander knocks down the free throw Cal is in the double bonus by the way DK Manuel Doot whose free throws are one of two And those were the first free throws he had attempted this season Boy credit Cal for weathering the storm of a big time run from Georgia Tech Theres another corner three Oh and a foul as Manuel Duke reached in and and Dongo was trying to put it back So you have Indango and Ames both players with four fouls Yeah And at this point you can see a little bit of uh desperation cheering out of both coaches It is what it is Both programs need this game If your stars have four fouls youre just going to have to get out there and hope for the best 11 You hear us counting Fourpoint lead And Dongo now with a double double Hes got 10 points and 10 rebounds cheering Played great last year including the gamewinning hoop against Cal cheering And now off to another impressive game against the Bears again cheering The lead is four Oh sloppy pass but great hustle on the back end And more hustle from Georgia Tech Mustaf Pippen Great job tipping it to himself Pippen on the glass all night has been sensational but a careless turnover and Dongo up ahead He missed the easy one but Craft cleaned it up Twopoint game Nice heads up by Cam Craft running the floor I dont say this a lot but that was a very lucky play for Georgia Tech They blew a wideopen layup but Craft the man on the spot to clean it up and keep it a onepossession game Cal trying to keep pace They were up five Big possession here A couple of sloppy plays with turnovers They want to make sure they get good looks every time Pippen And a foul on the floor And well see who they call that on that If they call it on Cal cuz Pippen was slammed to the floor and they will call that on Cal Court And I like what Pippen did there and he took it right at Indongo trying to draw that fifth foul and get him out of there but he wasnt able to create enough contact Pippens got four assists to go with his nine points And Lamar Washington will go to the free throw line and shoot some free throws Hes one of two from the free throw line today got nine points and a costly miss with his team down two with six minutes to go in regulation Bell for three Got it to go Cal by five Bell has been huge Thats the second time theyve called his number and hes delivered And then a blocking foul on Cal Four fouls on Elich A lot of misdirection on this play but make no mistake a stagger screen for your best shooter And Dongo staying flat on that second screen and Bell had all the time in the world and drills it cheering 3 Washington misses another free throw Thats four possible points Georgia Tech has left on the table in a game thats been tight Piping to Elich Elix pump fake reverses it Milos elix applause and theno left his feet I thought for sure that might have been his fifth foul Timeout Georgia Tech We will take a 30se second break Cal leads by seven All five cheering and everybody in The Georgia Tech jersey was holding their breath on this last play Their superstar big man and Dango with four fouls right here A little pick and roll and he leaves his feet and I thought for sure that was going to get him up out of there But no call but Cal converts the layup and they enjoy a sevenpoint lead here A little over 5 minutes to go Weve seen a ton of runs this game Be interesting to see if Georgia Tech can mount one last charge Cal student section Pretty loud behind us Pretty good crowd for a 500 pm start locally here Of course this is a big weekend here in the Bay Area with Super Bowl 60 coming up Sunday in Santa Clara only 45 miles to the south of us Craft runner no good Elix with the rebound If youre Cal you want to keep the defensive pressure on Georgia Tech Create opportunities to get to the rim Youre in the bonus Dont just settle for the jumper Bell Here comes Indongo and Tech Indongo interior pass Mustaf lays it in And Dongo doing a great job all night of giving up the ball in the double team Count the hoop to Justin Pippen That was like an NBA continuation Not because his dads a Hall of Famer NBA player but because hes pretty good The stop and go of Justin Pippen Absolutely amazing tonight Takes a defender off the bounce for an one He has made a lot of timely buckets tonight for the Golden Bears Pippen with 11 points six rebounds six assists as Kelly picks up his third foul And Cal is up by seven Make it eight A key time here for Georgia Tech as we approach the 4minute media TV timeout Well for Georgia Tech youre in that area where you kind of got to pitch a shut out defensively the rest of the game Pippen with the steal Here comes Campbell Bells on his right He lobbs it up for him No good Campbell gets it back He has it blocked by Craft Pippen gets it back He loses the ball to Andongo Here comes Kelly Kelly keeps it The floater good Outstanding hustle by both teams Georgia Tech with a stand at the rim and able to get that ball and convert That possession could have gone a hundred different ways in favor of Cal and it didnt And a travel by Chris Bell And now back cheering on this side of the bank Big possession here as inongo goes Leaves it in the floater No good the tip no good And Elix with the rebound And thats been the story for Georgia Tech Missed opportunities whether its free throws or point blank layups They made a great run but havent converted on what would be some easy opportunities here over the last few minutes Elix back door Camden wide open lays it in We talked about the spacing that Cal uses right there Beautiful back cut And right now cheering the Yellow Jackets have their backs against the wall Down eight This is uh must score moment time cheering Starting with Flemings three and he got it And Mai Fleming the freshman delivers Back to a two possession game That was a huge three for Georgia Tech I think you let Justin Pippen get his hands on the ball try to create something Instead you got Bell launching a three and he hits him as he falls down As far as shot selection not the best but Bell with A HOT HAND I wish we had a camera on Cory Williams He didnt like the shot selection but when it went in he was okay with it Fleming from the corner Two in a row The freshman keeping Georgia Tech in this game Big shot by both squads Oh Kelly got away He grabbed Pippens jersey Then Pippen tried to draw a foul There are about four no calls on one possession court Akai Fleming a oneman wrecking crew He scored three straight hoops and the lead is three Welcome to the party Mr Fleming Singlehandedly Georgia Tech all the way back The final minute one possession game Cal you want to get a good shot Youre in the bonus Dont settle for the contested jumper Oh Ames was open He didnt realize he was so open Oh and Dongos hurt Hes trying to get out of the game and he commits his fifth foul No bucket Oh Dongo committed the foul cuz he was hurt Justin Pippen to inbound into the back court to Ames Theres your trap Ames splits the defender and tries to call a timeout and he does and that was their last timeout Thats their theyve been able to run 13 to 14 seconds off the clock because of the Pippen offensive rebound that took place That was huge because it gave them this opportunity to burn more time Pippen to inbound into Elich and Elich is fouled right away by Fleming And I dont think Georgia Tech wanted that foul Coach Stomar doesnt look pleased with it I think he felt like that far away from the rim with 8 seconds to go they had a good chance of getting that ball back Milos Elich has attempted three free throws tonight and hes made all of them That one is perfect Well you really got to be impressed with Cal They started this game strong They took a huge run in the second half but they look like theyre about to finish strong as well It takes a lot They didnt fall apart Seem to be doing the right things at the end of the game The lead is six cheering Tech needs to do something quickly and Pippen commits a foul which probably was not what they wanted to do count Not the worst thing in the world because Washington drilled that three but it didnt count Chaz Kelly is one for two from the free throw line tonight Im just saying ideally you didnt want to do cheering anything to stop the clock Correct For sure And he missed it Elich with the rebound and Mustaf fouls Elich cheering And Milos Elles who is perfect at the free throw line will go back Well Dave you look at a game like this Its a sixpoint game and you ask yourself how many oneon ones have the Yellow Jackets not cashed in on Its three in the second half Theres your six points Theres the difference in this game Always the little things always the details Yeah only six of 12 from the free throw line Cory youre right Elich now with 10 points and nine rebounds Georgia 31 Second one Perfect Seven for seven for Elich from the free throw line tonight Fleming no good Ball comes out Craft has it His follows no good And they foul him Cory Cal has missed 10 free throws Georgia Tech has only taken 12 and thats kind of an issue if youre Georgia Tech Obviously theyre shorthanded We talked about that But the free throw waves continue for Georgia Tech after a sensational run to actually take the lead in the second half They just havent executed at the free throw line It appears Damon Statmires team is going to run out of time Crafts second one is good but you never say never with a sevenpoint lead and threepoint shooters in this game Well the recipe is simple If youre Georgia Tech you need missed free throws and turnovers And if youre Cal be strong with the ball Make your free throws Ames is fouled So Ames is going to get a chance to get a new career high Cory he is tied for his careerhigh now with 27 He has been the man tonight Threes twos free throws shot clock winding down You name it hes delivered for Cal Ames now seven of nine from the free throw line and he has a new careerh high 28 points 29 Georgia Tech just wont go away Boy Fleming has been a terror on the offensive end Now Georgia Tech taking their time out The fresh just too little too late And if youre Georgia Tech youre really concerned about the injury to Wendongo Hopefully hell be ready to go in a couple of days and its not anything too serious But a valiant effort here today by the Yellow Jackets But Cal with the toughness to try to hold on Oh he fell down AND FLEMING LEFT WIDE ALONE CAMDEN JUST FELL DOWN SO FLEMING GOT AN EASY TWO Its 8783 A fourpoint game And now Camden is fouled Cory he just fell down Good poor execution Feet get tangled up No call by the official and Fleming gets the easy two And Dave I hate to beat a dead horse but if you make your free throws what does this game look like at this point Maybe youre down one or two instead of four but big free throw Fivepoint lead Georgia Tech just wishing there was like a minute eight left instead of eight left No fouls if your Cal just goes straight up Floaters good by Kelly but theres only three seconds left and a fourpoint game They get it in and Pippen is fouled 23 left and Justin Pippen will go to the free throw line And Dave going back what seems like a long time ago but theres actually only a few seconds of game time when Pippen secured that offensive rebound with 43 seconds to go It really changed the math for Georgia Tech And theyve managed to keep this to a twop possession game but they just couldnt get any closer than that Pippen got it I like the way Damon Starttomires team doesnt quit Cory Oh well you know that thats not going to be something out of many of his teams Theyre going to play tenacious efforts but right now it is the Cal Bears that are going to escape with the win For the sixth time this year Cal has reached 90 points
