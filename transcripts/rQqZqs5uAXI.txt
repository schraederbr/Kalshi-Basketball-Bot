right in time for the final game in the ACC regular season surging upstart Georgia Tech against Virginia at home on senior night in a mustwin game for its NCAA tournament hopes alongside Randolph childr Im Mike mono the Cavaliers in the white at home in the hands of ree beakman on senior night Point part of a big point guard match up R off between him and Nate George it is I think two of the better point guards in the ACC re is I think as good a twoway guarded areas in the country Miner tried to drop it off but he got picked by B Dango one of the youngsters in the starting lineup for Damon stmy along with George the point guard two in the gold and then Miles Kelly 13 with it up top the leading score for the jackets at 14 and 16 overall 7 and 12 in the AC SE theyre going to be either the 12 or the 13 seed in Washington DC they turn turn it over and a couple of empty possessions for the jackets meanwhile we check out the Virginia starting lineup and Jake Groves the Oklahoma transfer gets in there on senior night early sign here for Jordan tchas you got to take care of the basketball against Virginia you got to get shots up you got to get shots up no matter what couple inty possessions here heres reys beakman sticks a three he got arousing Ovation when he was Rec recognized on this senior night just moments ago hes going to be missed here hes had such a great career here and with another steal and transition Groves the trailer and Virginia will reset it Groves off the shot fake Jordan Miner lost it on the way up and it goes back to Georgia Tech well how about Georgia Tech theyre out a threegame winning streak theyve won four out of five they just beat wake and you saw how hard wake is to beat in Winston Salem only time the Demon Deacons have lost in Winston Salem at the Joel was Tuesday thanks to Bango well Jordan Tech is learning how to win and when youre young and you come in and some of these veteran guys havent won yet never accustomed to losing games and St Mars coming in changing things up he struck gold with these two freshman he have I think theyre really good and theyre starting to figure things out he put the put the ball in his hands of his two best freshman and things have always gone well for him when hes done that so he look for him to continue to put the ball in Nate Georges hand and put H Dongo in ball screens here is Kelly the Georgia Tech highend conference wins better than anyones in the ACCC triple came up short for taara gari the sophomore UMass transfer whos been excellent recently beakman off the hesitation left the runner short and kaasi Reeves gets out and runs and lays it in Georgia tchs on the board great job there pushing Tempo we talked about George giving it up early for Virginia Tech team that does Virginia Cavaliers team that doesnt give a lot of transition baskets whenever you can get them you got to take advantage of it careful were not in the comwe CL Isaac mcne no rebound kazy re I want to get out of the building I dont want to make that mistake kapari off the bounce hes been excellent recently and he slipped it to D go earlier in the year they started with a bigger body now Dongo is more comfortable so now starting gari iss another experienced guy capable with the length really skilled puts pressure on you off the bounce like that the biggest difference for him is he makes his own defensive end of the floor as you see him now clogging up the lane with his length hes matched up on Buchanan shot clock winding down beakid got by Kelly and got it to go second bucket for reys beakman what a season hes had I hes put this team on his back they would just be so lost without him Dango in the short rle you love what he can do in that spot no one plays better in a middle ball screen and joyia Tech you you know its coming you just cant stop it because you got a guy whos 69 with great hands and Good Feet and hes a really good passer so catching and shoot that floater or skipping it to the weak side three Georgia is sck it way off a Ryan gun so he attacks spins and scores he has to do more of that and as sooner ladys going to have to make a jump shot theyre going to force him to make a shot hes only made Seven threes All Season the projected first round pick who is 24th on our ESPN draft board there is Dongo one of the best freshman in the League this year with a shot clock winding down and Buchanan gets whistled for the foul with 8 seconds left on the shot clock just getting started in the final ACC regular season game of the year glad youre with us in Charlottesville when youre great your game does the talk in the ACC our speaks farther three of the last eight NCAA championships 99 NCAA tournament wins since 2015 eight NCAA titles in the league is locked into a double bu in next weeks ACC tournament in Washington DC they can be the three or the four and Clemson and pit even though Clemson just lost their Wake Forest still alive for a double bu pit playing right now its as simple as if they win they get a double buy next week yeah so its pretty simple for Pittsburgh you win your in if not Clemson who lost tonight got a chance to get it for Virginia its win in the third seed they lose their the fourth seed so so you do have all that youre good with that I finally got it okay but it doesnt matter for UVA I think they need to win because they just need to continue to stay off the bubble and continue to build some momentum as they get ready for the ACC tournament and the n as well yeah very important and Tony Bennett said just that to us earlier today at shoot around Dango goes spinning on Ryan Dunn and scores and those two had a fun and at times chippy matchup in the first meeting between these teams back on the flats they havent Dongo went right at him inside well this the Bracketology that were talking about Lenards latest update were getting the emails at all hours of the day second to last team into the field Villanova nearly came back against kraton earlier today last Touch by Ryan dun and if you UVA you just want to take care of business you know just take care of business at home no complacency here you know you had the double buy but you need to continue momentum and Tony Benny shared that today with us he just thinks his team needs to take care care business tonight and build some momentum as they get ready for the ACC tournament which he expects this team to get in and play well and they havent played since last Saturday at Cameron that 7348 loss where they only scored 18 points in the first half so Tony Bennett told us today gave his team a couple of days off and his message was one of encouragement to them and the positioning theyre still sitting in Ryan dun Pride it away from Bango and its a Georgia Tech turnover theyre third already Dongo won the previous possession D reminded him why hes in the ACC Defensive Player of the Year running saiding I dont need any help I got him oneonone and creates turnover Groves stroking it from Deep this year at 48 I think when his feet set as good as MCN is as a shooter I think grows even better hes got a pretty stroke 69 fourman at his third school started as a walkon at Eastern Washington now senior night in Charlottesville gapar has been big for them recently been in the starting lineup the last month and over the last five games averaging N9 and seven he opens up the floor his ability as a big to not only clog the paint but hes so mobile that time he catches it he drives it and its another reason why this team is starting to play their best basketball because hes become an offensive weapon at that Center Spot that they didnt have before tan Murray and that one a rim out dep clears it jackets have made their last five shots heres Kelly boy he was big Tuesday in that win at the Joel and Winston Salem knocked down five threes great tip there by Reese bman he couldnt get it Dongo had the inside position and guard cracked down on the defense and simp it to a teammate mcney cant connect Isaac mcne 0 for two from Deep 45 from three this year at 12 points per game Balls got to move against Virginia you got to have ball movement and body movement theyre going to sit in those gaps and you cant settle for Gem shots as well its got to try to find a way either by dribble penetration or by post up to get the ball in the paint there is a settled jumper there from Kyle Stan picking pop Groves wide open missed it but gets it back and now D will slow things down and back into the hands of beakman as we get a whistle from Lee Music Cassel Jordan Tech benefited from that time out they they gave up an offensive rebound and never matched up and the 71st annual ACC mens tournament starts Tuesday afternoon at Capital One arena in DC all three first round games for you right here on acc Network and the ESPN app Georgia Tech at the outset of the day could have been as high as the 11 or as low as the 14 we told you now its going to be either the 12 or the 133 for the jackets mcne got stripped George at the controls and Debo Coleman pulls it out in transition its a big moment for Virginia team they have struggled when re bman is not in the game and how to create offense tough shot Nate George how about this kid hes just so talented if you hadnt seen him before youre in for a treat just a really tough skilled just wise Beyond his years Late Bloomer who has stepped onto the scene in a major way in midtown Atlanta this year as a rookie in this league playing for Damon stanmire jackets by two Murray attacks and finishes with the right hand great job there ebo coin was between he and the basket got to his dominant hand and able to finish Baseline CAU what a block from Ryan d on Tara gorei that was loud not many weak side shot blockers in the country better than this guy at his size if neilly wanted a foul didnt get it gari went straight up were going to get into the discussion re Speakman or Ryan Dunn for ACC defensive player of the year theres a good case on both sides no youre going to get into the discussion Im going to stick with my vote early Im not Im not changing my opinion we will present the facts thats what we do kapari skips it got to be careful doing that against beakman but hes not in the game right now Harris is in there hounding Coleman George ho comes up empty and secured by Murray now theyre going to keep this with Georgia Tech they say and Tony Bennett is not happy how about this block just get that out of here D doing Ryan Dunn leads the ACC in blocks per game Reese beakman second in the ACC in Steels per game answer me this is it absolutely one of the two who is defensive player of the year in the ACC I dont think thats much of an argument okay I think its one of these two guys and I think were going to have a twotime defensive player of the year that we hadnt had since what John Henson and Sheldon Williams have D those are the only two ever to go back to back its our food line food for thought you see the numbers and those ranks for both these guys so you think its beakman no question I say its beakman because I its not an offensive category I think his defensive pressure on the ball I think Dunn does a Ryan dun does a great job off the ball coming up with shot blocking but Rees Beakmans defense on the ball is not many guys can do that cant go wrong either way right Leon Bond said it earlier this year I think we have the two best defenders in the country now we asked the question to some of the Virginia coaches and they did go with re though they said Ryan Dunn has a great case its not necessarily a landslide but from their mouths they think its Reese beatman well when you have guys that can you see Reese beatman now when you have a guy that hes averse they both Versa Defenders but the difference is theres not a lot of guys that can stay in front of the basketball off the dribble and REE beatman does that as well as anyone in the country I think he and Jamal shed are the two best twoway point guards in in college basketball I dont think its close here is beakman Groves comes up short and the rebound to Debo Coleman were locked at 12 were 10 minutes in in the final ACC game of the regular season heres Nate George working on Dante Harris you can and clears it now Dante Harris is another really good on ball Defender and when he you know he comes in his emergence to this team is important because he allows re be rman to be off the ball and attack you from a different angle good shot fake from tan Murray and he buries the triple now you and I talked about this in shoo around and I told you every time he shoots I think its going in you love his for I love his I love his fundamental setup he had only taken 28 threes coming into tonight but it made nearly half of them 13 for 28 for the Junior from New Zealand whos got five for Virginia and theres an answer from Kyle sturen the fifth year senior when theyve won big games hes been massive his experience in his ability to knock down shots hes shooting up 39 from behind the yard they are not in the position of where they are this late in the year with the confidence they have without him sturdivants been invaluable to this young yellow Jacker Squad vocal one of the leaders on this team he got it underneath to Tai Claud and now Nate George up top kaasi Reeds missed it from straight on and Harris the rebound first meeting between these teams tightly played game January 20th Virginia won it by nine but Georgia Tech led by as many as 11 in the first half you can it on the Baseline great job by be keeping his defender on his hip forcing rotation and dropping it off for the Freshman hes really improved Music offensively Tony Bennett said to us he thinks hes underrated and underappreciated both in this conference and nationally and they force another turnover from Georgia Tech beakman off the fake he attacks and well go to the line for two with the foul on of kaasi reeds tightly contested again with 410 of a second to go against Wake Forest just what we talked about just a play you put your two freshman I did ask Nate George were you supposed to get that hand off he said yes but he forgave his mid guy for finishing obviously the gamewinning shot those two guys have just grown so much over the course of the season and by Dongo has just been really underrated I think nationally for what hes been able to do Damon STM after the game said weve proven we can play with any given team on any given night and you look at the wins that his team has seven of them in ACC play theyre the only team that has beat Carolina Duke and Clemson and they also have that win against wake so thats the four top teams in the ACC in the net rankings Georgia Tech has wins against all of them well when you are young and you havt an experienced team you get up for those games you you get up for the Dukes to Carolinas and then you see you drop your guard when youre playing against teams in the middle of a pack or not such big names and thats what you get when youre learning how to win and I think thats what this program is right now when youre starting to see this team figure that out here you asked Damon STM whats different he said were playing together and were getting payback for some of the work we put in some of the teaching we tried to do earlier in the season and our guys are understanding it and learning how to win is a process you got to go through it theres Dango couldnt get it to go over the top of the 61 bu Canon and sometimes learning how to win is just learning what you can do and what you cant do Music theres a lot that Georgia Tech can do and has done recently its a flare for Harris takes kapari off the bounce nearly lost it but recovered to Buchanan laate shot clock in the hands of McNeely and now beakman matched up with Kelly kick for Harris got blocked by gari how about that look at the ground he covered using his Applause length Damon St is raved about the defensive impact that Tara gari has made for the jackets Dango lost it and thats turnover number seven for Georgia Tech and you cannot do that against Virginia thats the one thing you got to do you got to take care of the basketball you just got to get shots up beakman can it second three for reys beakman and the lead at six as large as its been for the whoos tonight I expect the show out of him his senior it always means more you know the end is near hes just been such a heck of a player Dango nearly lost it shot clock below 10 again for Georgia attack with Dango driving and weve got a foul Tony Bennett wanted to travel instead so to about 15000 here and JJ 15000 And1 because I thought he traveled as well uh thats one of the the longer Euro steps oh just steps youre going to get uh I think maybe they didnt want to call a foul on heris sometimes you dont want to call a foul you just let the play happen but and Damon stanmire will take a timeout which allows Tony Bennett more time to plead his case well take 30 seconds time to plead his case he was not pleased with the call but it ended up in a foul called on Blake Buchanan his second I think yeah I mean thats a tough call there good defense on the Freshman be can and now you got to take him out of the game picking up his second foul so its D Groves Murray McNeely at beakman for Virginia and by dango at the line 12 points 8 rebounds a game this year on 56 shooting number three freshman in the country in rebounding and field goal percentage and could be the first freshman to lead Georgia Tech in rebounding average since Chris Bosch 20 years ago you know youre in a good category when you mentioned with Chris Bosch but if you watch him play just so fluid and so skilled doesnt get sped up hes showing you a skill set here posting up driving you from the perimeter they got to try to get him the ball more in the middle of the floor in that middle ball screen it puts every defense in a difficult situ sitation Virginias great on side ball screens you got to keep the ball in the middle of the floor against them if you can dangos got eight of the 17 for Georgia Tech within four inside of six to go in this first half be off a screen and now McNeely runs off one a flare for beakman he rises cant hit and the rebound to gari the yellow jackers have improved one of the improvements have been on the defensive end of the floor theyre really fighting Virginia you through screens getting physical but they got to take care of the basketball on the offensive end of floor they killing themselves right now with their eighth turnover here in the first half come in with the worst turnover margin in the ACC and its been problematic early on for Damon stms team Murray attacking Murphy gets the roll how about the Boost T Murrays given with seven in this first half guy who had just three points total in the last three games doing a great job and hes known as a threepoint shooter and they closing out to him trying to run him off the line hes doing a great job of getting to a strong hand and driving at the paint finishing known as a tireless worker in this program kapari saw the opening and he draws a foul itll be the first on done Tony benu is getting involved here check out the form on the pass youre always a coach thats textbook baby thumbs down two hand chest pass by Tony snapping it Tony Tony was a point guard back in the day a little extra zest behind that one gari to the line told you what hes done recently hes really good against wake on Tuesday 11 points six rebounds for a guy who committed to George Washington then did the Paul then reclassified went to UMass and now in year one with the yellow jackets and his length in athleticism in T him now with Dongo what they do in that ball screen now theyre able to catch it and drive it and what you saw on that last play theyre going to put pressure on you so that big man you Canon and done in those forwards for UVA has to stop the ball screen and really get back in front of the basketball to help out cut the ball off on that short row Georgia Tech gone four and A2 minutes without a made field goal but some work at the free throw line there within five mcne backs it out shadowed by George Murray running off a screen from dun in the midrange left it short Tony Bens got to be pleased on the offensive end of the floor if Dongo gets going here lets see if theyll come doubling see how he handles that but right now they leaving a oneonone with Dunn and Dango turned it over its his third turnover of the nine for George ACH and heres dun kicking it out extra pass its Groves hits a three and d and kapari are both down in the paint Applause hey BR what are we I think the Pari got the worst of that that exchange Applause there dungs waving waving to the that hes okay we will check on both guys when we come back done to the bench gari to his feet as well late the first half champ week is here we move faster wow they are putting it on fueled by more fire oh my goodness and we wont let up so Hardware is one feels like here for Ryan Dunn in a couple of ways and also for Tara gari both guys are up and dun is staying in the game at least for Virginia watch his right ankle and then he falls and kapar falls on that right the same ankle and up the leg a little bit as well hes a tough guy stays in it both guys are out there great to be young and flexible no kidding Im hurt just looking at it talking about pliability oh man and they both stand out Applause yeah well two guys we mentioned in their sophomore Seasons making a big impact for their team and its Ryan duns Cavaliers up by eight with a little over four to go in this first half in the final game of the ACC regular season and the last of seven games today across the league jackets have won four out of five Virginia has dropped four of six trying to grab the three seed in next weeks ACC tournament Kelly going to work on McNeely and had it roll off Dongo battled for it but secured by Groves and Kelly is still scoreless came in averaging about 15 a game I thought he did a great job there driving creating space there just couldnt finish hes got to get himself going this team needs him offensively bman got a little space and from the elbow sticks the jump shot bre Beakmans got 11 in the first half duns coming up noticea be limp right now coming at his left kneecap Carter Murphys getting some run for Georgia Tech maybe trying to inject some offense for Damon stms group that has missed nine of its last 11 shots from the floor heres Murphy the transfer gave it up to George off the screen the hesitation the floater and the follow for by Dango hes got T yeah from Nate George you got to get him got to get a screen even if its guard to guard screen hes playing against arguably the best on ball defender in the country hes going to have a difficult time trying to beat Reese beakman off the bouns get another guard screen attack someone else off the bound hell get more success and be able to create for his teammates now Ryan dun is checking out to your point grimacing as he goes down the bench he waved to the bench on his last possession Jason Willer looked over at Tony Bennett and told him we need to get done out of the game and there a trainers checking him out so he goes out with 243 left in this first half and Virginia up by eight heres Miner being pushed out by Dongo McNeely shut off off the Bounce by George beakman defended by Kelly or gari rather bman still with it muscles one up and gets roll he does so much for this team hes going to need some help from the offensive end of the floor right now he just Wills this team taking the toughest assignment on the defensive end of the floor and they dont have any other guy out there now that can create off the bounce so when the shot clock gets low they got to put the ball in his hand and tell him go make a play George answers with a baseline jump shot his second bucket and a much needed answer hey coming up on the auto owners insurance half time time report first half reaction from this one with Kelsey Luke and Joel and of course we will go into whats going on at Cameron Carolina at last look leading that game theres a game going on there yeah you mcne for three sixth triple of this first half for Virginia first one from Isaac mcney their best Marksman Murphy deep one doesnt drop and the lead is 11 approaching the final minute of the Applause half pick and roll Miner on the reverse theyre getting everything now and thats dangerous when youre playing against Virginia you cant give up layups threes and the midrange jump shots and theyre getting them all right now are you surprised no timeout yet no George Pulls Up Sticks it that that freshman is just wise Beyond his years and St gives him so much confidence thats what Nate George told us today how much he has learned from Damon STM and Nate George told us even if I wasnt going to play I wanted to come to Georgia Tech to learn from Damon STM and this coaching staff just amazing what happens when you play with confidence mcneel a deep one knocks it down but thats a freshman mistake there you know the scouting report on McNeilly is she got to get out there close out George late hands in the pocket and McNeilly made him pay for it Kelly cannot answer what a first half finish for Virginia at home in the regular season finale Virginia is not of the ACC regular season for Tony Bennett they are assured of a top four seed in next weeks ACC tournament and a double buy if they win they get the three pit is winning right now at home against NC State by double figures if pit wins it gets a double buy as well Clemson is clinging to a little bit of Hope but those are the stakes in the final hour Jake Groves left it short from Deep gari the rebound what do you need to see from Georgia Tech down 14 one you got to take care of the basketball and you have to get up shots getting to your offense is fine they got to come like George there come off the screen use it you know theyre going to hedge it get the pocket pass and get the ball inside I think Dongo have to do a better job of getting low position like that so the defense cant help hes got it dozen that is a good start for one of the best freshman in the ACC thought he did a great job of getting it low as Jordan Techs extending their pressure dun did a really good job in the first half of pushing them out of a little bit further making him have the dribble the guards were able to did create a couple of turnovers that time Dongo got low position quick spin Baseline for easy dece tane Murray starts the second half Groves cans a triple you got to switch that I think when they curl into the lane on Grove side you got to know Personnel Grove is going to hurt you by popping out the three and I think thats why Dam star calling time out hes upset with that you you communicate with that you talk about it tight Cur there putting pressure on your D you got to know Personnel cuz Groves makes you play Three Corner Pocket Wahoos up 15 tournament in Washington DC again Virginia knows its going to have a double buy got a couple of days off before debuting in DC hit if it hangs on will have a double buy as well and what a job by Jeff cable this year I think hes it its been some excellent coaching jobs this year Jeff has continued to make a late push to put his team in and guys like he and Tony bennon and I think Adrien Al and Hubert Davis theyll theyll split up votes for ACC coach of the year and you can make an argument that all of those guys are deserving theyve had great years with their teams 17 and3 for North Carolina outright Champs and they sweep Duke with tonights 8479 win at Cameron David stmy was not happy so he went to the bench Debo Coleman came in and by Dango draws a foul on the rebounding action against Ryan Dawn cuber Davis is liking that robbery a little bit hes making things a little lopsided no kid man hes having his weight John shy apologized to the crazies after the game he said were going to get this thing right Dongo to the line hes got 12 nobody else for Georgia Tech with more than six hey tomorrow a ACC wrestling championship from Carmichael in Chapel Hill coverage of the final starts at 7 Eastern right here on accn and the ESPN app youre talking about coach of the year I think freshman of the year is going to be very interesting it is B dangos got a case BB Carringtons got a case Marcus Burton at Notre Dame and Jared McCain at Duke I think those are probably the top four they are um I I think itll be a shorter list than that with with both Carrington and Marcus Burton and McCain and those guys were split up a lot of votes who would you go with i i thats the one award so much so many so many times I associate things with winning but I think as a freshman when you come in and the impact that you have uh I I like Bob Carrington early I thought he ran away with it I think he came back to the pack some of that and it helped his team improve Tango up top from George and a rookie connection right there great job by Tech now theyre extending their pressure speeding it up you got to beat this UVA team down the court they scored earlier in transition and started settling in the half court a little bit much so whos your vote going to finish it up ah I knew you were going to try to put me on the spot you see you try to that you going call me I tried to move on from it and done contested at The Rim by Dongo we still dont have an answer heres Stan dropping it off for George he attacks and finishes and Nate George has brought Georgia Tech back to single digits here the first 3 minutes of the second half keep him in drag screens and keep him in transition so beakman stays off of him so he can have a easier time getting in the paint they need him in the paint real quick drag screens are what just a big or even a guard coming when hes pushing it in transition just comes set the screen you cant allow Reese beakman to stay on him because just physically as a senior just make the game easier for him mcney too strong tipped out by Dunn to beakman wide openen Murray hits another how about the KN for T Murray making you pay and now hes in double figure scoring and didnt you know playing on that when youre scouting your team you didnt expect Murray to come in we know hes capable of it and you away by pakman with the flush thats what Im saying about the experience of beakman on the ball creating that turnover against George should just give him a rub screen or something to get Reese beakman off of him Reeves attacks and threw a foul on Jake Applause bres bigman has done everything 15 points six assists no turnovers and now three Steals and he just wears you down and thats all Im saying with George hes a talented freshman but theres just not many ball Hawks like Reese beakman with his long arms plays bigger than his size physically just super strong he wears you down and Reeves good on the first Wednesday night number 10 Alabama softball squares off against 16th ranked Florida State lonni alams team in Tallahasse coverage starts at 7 Eastern and also available on the ESPN Happ ree beakman is he on your first team all ACC he better be on everyones first team I agree I I dont think if you dont have Rees beakman on the first team for what hes done to this team then youre Im going have to call the commissioner Phillips on you I got to I got to revoke some some I got to get some people uh voting privileges revoked on that one I I think hes definitely one of the top five players in this league I dont think thats an argument McNeil is straight on 103 for Virginia you knew it was coming it was a matter of time that they were going to start making some shots 10 for 20 from long range three of those triples from Isaac mcne iMac post entry a double now on Dongo from Groves and the shot clock winding down Reeves off the skip driving on Murray tough shot way too strong shot clock in reset and then Dango got fouled by Buchanan whos got three 5 minutes into the second half its Virginia up by 15 at home one of the most entertaining personalities on this fun Georgia Tech team this year has been the Florida transfer kaasi Reeves a guy who is interested in Japanese culture and also has the everchanging hair colors not just hairstyles but hair colors so hes got a little bit of blue in there that you can see above that headband tonight hes had blue at other times this year hes had some gold in there maybe a little blonde you would call it hes had a wide array of everything what whats that like I cotton candy yeah I mean we we use the same hair coloring as you can imagine I mean I what would you call this color I I would say blonde you would call it something different I I was thinking light brown maybe no theres no such thing as light brown thats like a peanut butter no there isnt a mocha of peanut butter ha color its just its blonde thats all we going we going to leave it at blonde who made you the Arbiter on these things because of all the hair I have I I use a lot of product in my hair when was the last time you had hair uh I shave three day three times a week twice a week so 5 days a week you got something yeah or three whos counting he is the follically challenged Randolph Childress Im Mike Monaco our entire crew behind the scenes first 5 minutes second half McNeely got bumped and F fouled by Miles Kelly late shot clock with only seven left in that possession for Virginia things are opening up when mcne and Mary and his guys are coming off that pin down it just takes less pressure off re be beakman have to create off the bounce and makes this Virginia offense a little less predictable offense has looked great tonight for Tony Bennett group against the jackets and this is the same team that went on a winning streak in the the middle of the year that was playing as well as anyone this league Miner couldnt finish off the feed for Murray yeah they had the eight game winning streak before dropping four out of six coming into this one kapari wide open short armed it and run down by Groves by the way Ryan Dunn for Virginia went down the tunnel came back right now hes on the bike moving slowly on the stationary bike about halfway down the tunnel for the Cavaliers a drop off for Miner against Dango he finishes and if Virginia can continue this lead and extend it we may not see done again Ry at done again up by 16 early on in this second half biggest lead for Virginia tonight kapari the catch and back out for Kelly Coleman skipped it good catch Dongo couldnt finish got his own Miss and the follow so active great hands active upset with himself he missed the first one but he is so fun to watch and motors always running game high 19 for Bango the rookie from senagal Futures bright in Midtown for these guys I mean get a big two of the most important positions you need need and need to have and its a quality athletic big and a high IQ point guard and Jordan Tech has both of those Murray swirled one out and then Dango ripped down the rebound to Kelly yeah lot to like about Damon Styers group going forward we told you theyre going to be either the 12 or the 13 seed in the ACC tournament which will start for them on Tuesday Coleman Rises spins out for the junior Jord Tech is missing shots but theyre just showing you still even against an elite defense like Virginia that middle ball screen is so difficult to defend when you got a big that can catch it and finish and pass like they do McNeely in the midrange well now theyre scroll off a pin now they got everything open and thats what makes this team so dangerous when MCN chipping in and they have their wings scoring theyre not predictable now theyre not just relying on a Reese beakman ball SC 11 for Isaac mcney start of it for Coleman and back out for the fifth year senior Kyle Stan off the bounce on mcney step back nearly went for Stan bman off the screen for Miner tried to slip it to him but a turnover and only the fourth one for the Cavaliers and Ryan Dunn return turns and thats a welcome sight for the whos faithful re Bean talking to coach about it gets a quick breather and you have got to hedge and keep him out of the paint you cant play in drop coverage and sit in the paint against him because hes going to put hes so physically gifted hes going to put that guard on his hip and not let him get in front and make an easy pass or shoot his midrange shot georia Techs going to have to change their defense to keep him out of the paint yeah ree Bean has carved up Georgia Tech with eight assists and only that first turnover George sons headband now kapari went up at The Rim against Buchanan he lost that battle didnt know where he was and got caught underneath the rim couldnt finish Harris off the crossover snakes underneath and back out for McNeely Murray off the screen on a night where we havent seen Andrew roie at all for Virginia guy whos normally been in their starting lineup the St Thomas transfer Kelly tough step back couldnt bury the triple yeah you cant you down 16 you still want to work your offense theres a lot of time left you dont want to get into one pass quick shots against this team youll find yourself down by 20 in a hurry its 1 for 13 from three for Georgia Tech last three games they had knocked down 33 combined threes shot clock at five McNeely tough shot theyre just running their offense now and they have it all going theyre getting the midrange shots theyre getting to the rim theyre 10 of 21 from high the threepoint line we know this team is going to defend theyre one of the best defensive teams in the country but this was a team that we saw that was a top 25 team in the country because now their offensive identity is starting to take shape George Well defended by Harrison then dun snagged that one away he looked healthy on that one sure did Virginia entered tonight with an offense rating nationally at1 according to kenpom and offensive efficiency theres Harris out the window the lead is 20 for Virginia you see Harris here driving with the lay off the glass Wahoos with the largest lead of the night up 20 here at home when youre great your game does the talk in the ACC I speaks volume three of the last eight NCAA championships 99 NCAA tournament wins since 2015 eight NCAA titles in the last 22 live from Greensboro Sunday at noon on ESPN NC State Notre Dame coming tomorrow on the womens side in the championship meanwhile on the men side here in Charlottesville Virginia Reese beakman and the Cavaliers up by 20 on Georgia Tech Randolph Childers Mike Monaco our entire crew with you and Reese beakman has been phenomenal tonight hes going out like a first team all ACC guy you would expect hes had a heck of a career here and I dont think Tony Bennett they told her they didnt know what they had until they got him and then they got him and was like wow hes even better than we thought he was and had a special senior season with so much on his plate this year as the guy for Virginia theyre up big shot clock winding down its a double on Dango skips it out of the post start of it sinks a three th is now for this Tech Team theyre going to try to extend their pressure full court man theyve got to get stops Virginia has shot 54 from the floor and weve told you theyve knocked down 10 threes and theyve only turned it over four times theyre one of the best in the country at that that is last Touch by George so it stays with the Cavaliers with 10 left to shoot yeah beakman turned down a shot there I thought he had the lay up Music and Murray off the screen now Dongo out on him beakman trying to get it stur in defends beakman behind the back Murray shot fake out of the corner can hit and a good clear out from Debo Coleman and whos it belong to it stays at this end with Virginia as Coleman jackied with Blake Buchanan that time I thought Jordan Tech did a really good job they switched hadnt done that a lot during the course of the night jongo came out on him great box out there just got to go after the ball I think Debo Coleman has a point that one off Lake be hens hand last it looked like agreed Flair heres beakman defended by Claud beakman off two feet scores again and hes got 17 on his senior n great switch there but you got to keep him out of the middle of the paint George off the bouns for Claude and now Dango Leading The Way with 19 points and six rebounds Harris nearly swiped it and it is a jackets turnover they 11th we talk about Harris thats what he does thats also what he can provide talk about Reese beakman on Ball but Harris is a really good on ball Defender Applause himself had the foot injury early in the year and its taking him a while to get himself into shape and play the way Tony Bennett wants his lead SCS to play almost two months with that ankle injury for Dante Harris heres Murray spinning and hitting it has been te Murrays night hes got a doz it career highs 14 for him couple years ago against Iowa traveling the call on Dango and another Georgia Tech turnover everything coming up Virginia in the home finale on the final day of the regular season and how about the unexpected sources tane Murray delivering hes dishing the open teammates there getting the assist even though Murray did most of the work mcil getting in but here just crossing over laying at off finding every one Miner gets the beneficiary of that one there and dominating the game and was upset with his only turnover that he had Virginia leads by 21 theyve shot 54 from the floor that would be their second highest this season for a team this year that has been sub 50 points in six games whats different today Well everybodys involved its a confidence thing too I mean youre not going to win games they dont play at a pace to score 80 points and its hard for you to do that against them now the when you play against them you would always say hey its the first one to 55 this is how they play the game and but when theyre struggling right now they used to having two point guards with Kei Clark and Reese beakman theyve missed Harris for S length of time and when Harris isnt healthy so much fell on beakman and both ends of the floor they struggled shot clock winding down Harris somehow found bu Cannon and a block by Dango and a shot clock violation Harris must have heard me talking about him saying how he creates great PL there to be Canon and BYOD dongos and not having any of that as he snatches that right out of the air wow he has been doing his part trying to will Georgia Tech against Virginia yeah hes been a oneman b here tonight hes done his part stur it dumped it off for Claude and he got fouled by Ryan Dunn but scoring below 50 in the six games this year for Virginia offensively theyre most games below 50 in any season since the 1940s and this does not look like that offense that weve seen for a lot of this season this looks like the team that won eight straight games during the year that was ranked in the top 25 hey the 71st annual ACC mens tournament starts Tuesday afternoon in DC and all three first round games are right here on acc Network so what of this can you bottle up and take with you to DC and try to secure that spot in the NCAA tournament the great thing is you got offensive contributions from other guys mcney has it going you know Gro has knocked down shots Harris has had moments Murrays knocking down shots they just got a contribution from everybody and thats what theyre going to need if they want to win a couple of games in the AC tournament I think theyre in the tournament but again judging off that what lonard and other guys were saying theyre right there on the bubble I think this team is in and definitely taking care of business here tonight its a quad three game certainly could not afford no a quad three loss theyve been perfect in quads three and four this year at a combined 13 and0 and again if youre just joining us Joe lonardi did say coming into this game his second to last team in Tony Bennett was talking with us earlier today and he said to feel good about it you do feel like you got to win a couple of games in DC well I think the biggest thing is that they can ill afford to lose to one of the teams early on so now getting a double buy you have no idea you know of who youre going to play and thats the issue you know so if you get into the tournament a loss against Clemson or Duke of Carolina wouldnt hurt Virginia but they can ill afford to get upset by someone thats in the lower seating in the AC tournament and lets just say this too you and I both agree that 229 and 137 in the ACC theyre in should not be a bubble team no Reeves no Dongo couldnt Corral it it does stay with Georgia Tech if youre a Virginia fan theyre taking care of business tonight you know Tonio sleep a lot easier knowing his team took care of business tonight or taking care of business tonight I think I think theyre well in controll to this game coming back for 20 down against Virginia is its a difficult challenge beakman why not with his third three and hes got 21 to match a career high lets break it on senior night why not last game at home lets go for a career high dong go the turn around hes got 21 as well again Tony Bennett said to us today I do think think Rees beakman is underappreciated I think hes really grown offensively and hes got so much on his plate that he is doing for the whos this year and by all accounts looking like theyre going to be the third best team in the ACC and he has steered that ship hes will this team in I mean this isnt the most talented team Tony Bennett has had there are a lot of moving Parts a lot to figure out this team has had its moments theyve come together early and theyve struggled some shooting and that happens when youre relying on guys to make perimeter shots thn minut kicks it out so youve said re Speakman is on your first team all ACC be on your hes on mine as well ballots are due tomorrow better be on yours so you got who you got RJ Davis PJ Hall Salis I would assume Hunter Salis reek beakman and Philip hman got it thats your five thats my father so Bott Hinson guys like that probably on the second team I I think its Bott to me not because of just his play I think his sacrifices his sacrifice offensively is the reason that team is as successful as they are yeah good point while all the other guys Harrison Ingram and Co M Ry and all those guys are going so its not an indictment against Amando B because I think they have National Championship potential and him picking his moments hes had all the accolades they dont mean anything else to him hanging a banner in Carolina would be big for him and his so first team all ACC isnt a big deal for him I I just I say that not to slight him Ka Reeves just banked in a three only the third threepoint make for Georgia Tech in this game as we hit four to go and the regular season finale across the ACC Harris reverse you said it everyones been involved for the Cavaliers this is why this is the best version of UVA Applause Dongo off the pick and roll and now moved for start of it a slip from Claud extra pass start of it back iron rebound down to mcne its a good offensive possession there by the yellow jackets but theyre not getting the ball in the paint the ball did they did a great job of changing sides but theyre still not penetrating it the pain of this def against this defense bigman back out for Harris off Target and the rebound start of it Reeves the transition triple couldnt hit it Dongo went soaring for the offensive rebound and George couldnt make them pay and is Jord Tech shooting from the threepoint line is not their strength theyre streaky when theyre making them they make a lot but on average theyre just a 33 threepoint shooting team and wasy Reed and Miles Kelly are the two guys that got to get going from behind the line and they both are struggling here tonight Harris missed it on the reverse subs getting ready to come in on both sides and the crowd is starting to chant for senior walk on Tristan how and Damon stanmire will take a timeout well take it as well 224 to go and this has been Reese beak mens nights senior night fouryear career that has been Sterling on the grounds and he has piloted virgin Virginia call me a sucker but man I I always get chills watching these ceremonies youre a sucker but its okay theyre great no its always tough you get guys to mean so much so many programs and every now and then you come across a really special one and R beakman is one of those guys and its great for him hes got an alltime great the greatest player in this program history sitting Courtside watching him and Ralph Samson here tonight how about the majors for beakman American studies Jordan Miner coming in from marac a Masters in Education a masters for Groves and his one year on the grounds and Tristan how public policy and Leadership for the 67 senior wacon who were probably going to see at some point in the last 209 third of in hits let hope we see him you know in todays game I mean with the metrics they matter and they matter for BC I mean for joria Tech and for UVA mcney takes it over the timeline and the student section intensifies with chance for Tristan how Pit by the way hung on despite the best efforts of NC State down the stretch so pit clinches a double bu and should Virginia finish this out and win theyll be the three and pit will be the fourth mcne no Dongo sores 90 seconds to go in the ACC regular season I cant tell you my how impressive that rebound is hes rebounding the ball at his highest point you know its something you just got to appreciate Coleman follows up the Dango Miss and got fouled as well yeah it is really impressive from Applause Bango so Georgia Tech about to finish out year one in the ACC for Damon STM he told you about the highend wins five of their seven ACC wins against top half teams then he got other close calls in there as well where theyve led by double digits in three of their ACC losses including at by 10 in the second half first meeting against Virginia LED BC by 16 this is a team that has four quad one wins thats as many or more than nine teams in the top 25 its been really impressive what hes done this year it has and theyve just struggled in learning how to win and close out those games and they did a better job of that you know in the last couple of games they had a three game winning streak coming into tonight lot to build on recrui shooting is going well great staff lot to be excited for for the yellow Jacks in turn of this program I think the three coaches that the ACC the first year head coaches have all been home runs I think alrey has been should be in the coach of the year conversation Michael shuberg is I think is is a stud and how about this after the three Tony Bennetts taking a timeout and hes going to make a sub Tristan house coming in and hes replacing re beakman mom Julie has been focal and she was on the court pregame she gets to watch her son head off the court here in Charlottesville and time to career high with 21 points nine assists six rebounds I asked Tony Bennett today what are you going to do now youre going to have to coach a game here without K Clark and Rees beakman man like what are you going to do Jake Groves gets an ovation as well guy who started his career as a walk on at Eastern Washington with his brother Tanner three years ago dazzled in the NCAA tournament against Kansas two years at Oklahoma and this season here at Virginia Jordan Miner exits as well the marac gr transfer and here is how the Senior Walk On from Virginia Beach oh its the B away and look at the S you got to love it Coleman responds with a three Tristan how a guy who was recruited by some non D1 schools but wanted to come here he gets his moment on senior night as well nothing gets a better reaction than the walk on scoring and thats one thing I think we adjust hope we adjust the metric so we can get more moments like that great performance here by Virginia and they mob the walk on Tristan how
