shooting the basketball and hes a guy who does it looking for backto back wins we are underway in Atlanta and its Georgia Tech that starts with the ball George was the hero in that win against Clemson had a career high 20 and now an opportunity to build off that double overtime Victory against a stingy Virginia Defense Virginia one of the better defensive teams in college basketball and thats what they do right there a turnover and when we spoke with Coach Damon SM STM at shoot around he said look were going to be tested tonight against a very good defense in Music Virginia I think for the Cavaliers particularly on the road this year as you take a look at the UVA starting five its turning that defense into offense particularly on the road where they are winless through four games this season and the starting five for Georgia Tech headline by two freshman Nathan George and by Dongo Miles Kelly the Sharpshooter as well the Junior from Stone Mountain Georgia he is shooting a lot better from three slumped a bit midseason but hes found a hot hand for this Georgia Tech offense has it Music here Reeves opens the scoring from three theyve got a lot of guys that can light it up from deep and thats what Virginia does not want to do when we spoke with Tony Bennett he was concerned he said look Georgia Tech does a great job spacing the floor they made 15 threes in a double overtime win vers Clemson on the road Ryan dun Stole It Away by Dongo ripping it away from Applause d right back to Reeves same spot missed it this time Georgia Tech not shy they will let it fly in transition defending the threepoint line is going to be key for Virginia in this game and a Georgia Tech team with plenty of confidence after that road win in double overtime against Clemson heres Kelly in a tack bow the floater Falls K oh thats a tough basine Jumper by Kelly again McNeely right on him thats a beautiful body control and finish by Kelly miscommunication beakman was there to keep the possession Music Alive 8 seconds to shoot Virginia out of rhythm offensively to start this game done trying to change it and he does ran dun drills it from three and thats a beautiful find by beakman Snak the ball screen that time and then threw it out to Dun thats excellent offense that time shot clock winding down by Music Virginia Georgia Tech trying to spread Virginia out George fouled and hell head to the line for two cavali theres Virginia head coach Tony Bennett what a record againsts Georgia Tech 172 including 10 in a row this will be a tough one today on the road playing a Georgia Tech team that he was highly complimentary of yeah and both these coaches really had high praise for one another uh uh both guys feeling pretty good about their team in terms of coming into this one off of wins but certainly uh Virginia has had the better hand and first year head coach Damon stay coming over from the NBA he said that we havent quite finished some of these games so our record isnt really reflective of the fight and the talent that he feels like he has on his team this year yeah I think they may have turned a corner winning that game on the road of vers Clemson they were down eight points a minute 33 to go in that game theyre young team that was a gutsy comeback win against a very good Clemson team on the Music road Miner muscles it home hes been a nice bright spot in the last few games Jordan Miner coming off a season High 16 yeah and I think he brings the physicality to that Virginia team when we spoke to the coaching staff that right there to finishes thats a nice find by beakman George working on McNeely pull up pop hits it and George continues to be lights out we talked about his performance on the road against a very good Clinton team where he put up 26 and only one turn turnover in that game right back to Miner on the Block trying to spin his way free and he Applause travel tall Applause Music be been all over Kelly thatll be a match up to watch tonight by D go going right into Ryan G and catches in well the thing thats impressive with George Tech well theyre very balanced team again they get Five Guys out on the court that can all score and that time theyre getting it done in the post excellent patience and spacing pakman what a follow Jam Ryan Dunn hammers it home my goodness talk about an arm coming out of nowhere with the put back dunk that is a big time offensive rebound put back foul on the floor two teams trading punches early Georgia T 4 lot of that I think is going to be fixed with uh the addition now of Jordan Miner in the lineup for them uh he provides some physical uh presence for them in particular on the defensive glass I think thats the key thing look their wings and guards are going to defend I think though the rebounding is going to be key in this game thats been a strong start for Georgia Tech an 117 lead 5 minutes in and they made their last three shots Kyle CER it with the ball hes been a spark plug off the bench for this yellow jackets team Dongo traveled a freshman whos been outstanding coming from Sagal hes had nine straight games in double Music figures Georgia Tech and manto man Lake View Canon missed it freshman on the front court for this Virginia Music team Georgia Tech does a great job in their half court offense spacing the floor and then setting hard ball screens and pin Downs Dongo attacking dun finds Kelly in the corner his Music fires up ahead McNeely decides to back it out to Applause Music beakman hes beakman in attack mode and thats what Virginia needs more of beakman the Catalyst and thats the area of his game that has improved his midrange are really love it and again credit Tony Bennett and their staff his Improvement yearoveryear at Virginia really has been impressive you know he defends but I think that part of his game really has grown Georgia Tech head coach David stouty are calling beakman the head of the Virginia snake he certainly has been that throughout his time with the Cavaliers thir of it cant connect from three and Virginia starting to string together some stops this is more like it and thats again a typical Virginia d right there again forcing you into deep contested twos or threes and thats what Damon ster M and staff did not want his team to do they want to continue to run their offense try to get some paint touches off the bounce or post entry passes Dante Harris into the game for the whoos returned on Wednesday after two months out against Virginia Tech looked good thats a big boost in the back court to join beakman as a primary ball handler Applause de tried to win it back batted around stays with the yellow Music jackets offensive rebound Claude trying to kick it out Buchanan got his foot on Applause it itll stay yellow jackets ball underneath their own hoop violation shot clock resets to 20 seconds on the shot clock and in Virginias losses thats been really one of the areas the rebounding defensive rebounding that has been a Music concern wide open in the corner and Georgia Tech makes the Cavaliers pay to far gari and thats all set up by Nathan George what a beautiful Pass Drive Baseline and then kick it to the to the corner for a wideopen three mcney trying to answer leaves it Music short foul called against Gres on the floor Georgia Tech does such a nice job spreading you out because really all Five Guys on the floor can knock down a three and thats again uh the beauty of this team uh coach Bennett talked about this in terms of how they SPAC the floor the other thing uh when we spoke to the coaching staff of Georgia Tech they want to push the pace uh in this game see if they can get out and transition off makes or misses and thats easier said than done against his Virginia team but so far 8 minutes in theyve done a nice job controlling the tempo getting more in transition than Virginias accustomed to giving up Harris right to the rim scoop to the hoop Dante Harris well having him back into the lineup I think he brings a couple of things Im going to call him a poormans version of Kei Clark in terms of his defensive presence and ability to get into the paint Coleman answers with a three to extend the tech lead to six youre right about harriso that is a welcome Edition after two months out injured looked good in his first action on Wednesday in the win against against Virginia Tech both of these teams riding midweek wins trying to go backto back in ACC play Harris lines It Up Off the Applause Mark great pass by George gari didnt take it sturdivan does and hits Kyle Sturdivant drills it from Deep St it St it for three well the patience that Georgia Tech is showing early on in this game impressive but again all set up by the dribble penetration of naan George Bond trying to answer tipped in rolls around doesnt drop Georgia Tech on a six nothing run looking for Applause more great ball movement another good look from three that time it doesnt fall and the quality of looks are that Georgia Tech is getting from three really impressive against one of the better defensive Club in Virginia that was halfway down but doesnt drop for mcne Tony Bennett told us during these Road struggles Virginia 0 and four on the road this season he said we havent been able to stop the runs George Tech on a 6 nothing run make it 8 nothing as Nathan George gets that to go and now Georgia Tech doubling up Virginia 2211 well the play of George that time showing off the Applause midrange goalen the call George attch wants that reviewed gari saying he was dotted the cylinder the officials will take a look ACC meds basketball is brought to you by Old Dominion Freight Line helping the world keep promises Malcolm Huckaby Jay alter with you Georgia Tech up 2213 the yellow jackets Malcolm theyre not shy theyre going to let it fly from three yeah they been quality looks that theyve gotten in this first half thus far all off of good ball movement and dribble drives in particular Nathan George has been able to break down this Virginia d right here close out late and and that was a concern right here again they made 15 on the road vers Clemson right now Virginias got to do a better job defending the threepoint line 1 mil this is a Georgia Tech team thats a lot better than their 9 and8 record they started the year 8 and3 wins against Mississippi State and Duke both ranked wins then they F in a fivegame losing streak every single one of those games they were within Striking Distance in the second half and four of them actually LED in the second half finally able to finish a game at Clemson in double overtime and now playing with a lot of confidence to start this game up Applause nine shot clock down to two Coleman has to heave it nothing but the bottom of the net Debo Coleman well you cant play any better defense than that right there uh thats a contested pullup jumper shot clock winding down thats is the tough bucket under pressure Georgia Tech has started this game shooting 60 from the floor Virginias opponent usually under 40 foul called on Dongo freshman not happy about it it will send Jordan Miner to the line first and this is a nice little dump ball pass by roie that time again great action by uh Virginia crowd did not like that call I think it was more probably uh with the body nonetheless two free Music throws minor the transfer from Mary Mack where he played four years hes had a slow start to his Virginia tenure but coming off that season High 16 points of the Commonwealth Clash rivalry win against Virginia Tech they really need him to start producing at that level on a consistent basis cuz he was brought in to really anchor this front Court yeah and I think the physicality really the big thing for him rebounding and then be that physical presence uh in the post for Virginia youre right theyre certainly going to need his presence uh in ACC Music play Reeves from the corner thats been the hot spot for him but missed it that time and George tagged with the the foul on the ensuing board foul Char to number two Nathan George is first well thats what it has to be for Virginia right if youre going to go on the road and start winning games after an 0 and4 start away from home its got to be with the defensive end thats what this programs built on absolutely I think again the D has been there in terms of uh contesting shots I think the big thing is the rebounding again thats been problematic for Virginia Harris step back cant hit it Applause Music Kelly swatted by dun great recovery by Ryan Dunn Virginia going to need to continue to dial it on defense Georgia Tech a 10point lead in the first this is George has been inserted into this starting lineup very unheralded freshman only had three offers Seattle U Corpus Christy Sam Houston State Damon satam took a shot on him and boy he has delivered I tell you what thats a pretty good eye by Damon STM and their staff and again the way that he has played in particular on the road and that win against Clemson and then tonight following up against one of the better defensive teams in Virginia early on six points two turnovers I mean two assists no turnovers Coleman draws the foul mcney who is guarding George to start this game but Tony Bennetts Now put beakman on George thats the ultimate praise for the Freshman point guard yeah again its been because of his dribble drives this right here though again Georgia Tech attacking of the paint they passed up some threes that time hard drive uh in the paint and coming up at the free throw line it was slow going for Nathan George at the start of his Georgia Tech Career didnt play the first three games and Damon St said I was seeing it in practice but because he was so unheralded he didnt know should I throw this guy right into the fire well since he has he has taken off 17 points at Cameron indor against Duke 20 points on the road at Clemson he just has such a Poise of fearlessness to him yeah and I think its how hes getting his production again under control and then setting his teams up for some easy opportunities as well its been impressive for the Freshman the Virginia fans will think it sounds like Kei Clark a very unheralded recruit who delivered time and time again for the Cavaliers beakman hits a big time three and boy to the whos need that one of the best guards in college basketball right there again thats a beautiful pin down they tried to gamble over the top of the screen be Fades to the corner and thats great offense by Music Virginia beakman trying to lock down George swings it to Kelly in attack mode stays with it Coleman swatted by Don and McNeely comes away with it thats more like it defensively for Music Virginia Georgia Tech has fallen into a scoring drought of 2 minutes and 30 seconds Music here 1 back Music back be B hes looking for backto back threes cant Applause Music Applause Music connect and Virginia cutting off the passing Lanes again Georgia Tech three minutes without a bucket roie decides to shoot it and he hits it Andrew roie and David St takes a timeout Virginia on a 7 nothing run getting some defensive stops and cashing in on the other Music end Che my come on now just hustling Im never going to stop keep climbing to the top yeah Im crushing it crushing it Im on my way now its Music my no please can I have these mommy finding your Healthy has never been easier start with Music Sprouts Virginia on a 7 nothing run and it really has all started with getting stops on the defensive end yeah I think the switch putting Reese beakman on Nathan George really has been key in this run George really hurt them early on in this game getting into the paint now that Reese beakman is on him that has really negated some of the dribble drives that has collapsed the defense and I think a big reason why uh theyre on this run right now because of their defense theyve missed their last four shots and theyve turned it over three times during this spell Dongo back into the Music game shot clock down to 10 Reeves trying to make something that happened another contest Ryan D he is anchoring Virginia defensively right now and thats why hes a guy that I believe will play at the next level Ryan Dunn again but his ability to block shots and bother shots Jay thats a big time block by dun and the thing I love about it he kept the ball in play and kept The Possession for Music Virginia and the drought continues for George attch George trying to end it and he does The Fearless freshman delivers again well Damon star and staff have found a good one and Nathan George hard to believe this guy only had four offers but they have found themselves a really good guard nine points already tonight coming off a career high 20 at Clemson heres Miner draws the foul on the block heads back to the foul line Char and Jay this has happened a couple of times off of pin down again this is what Miner brings again that physical presence you look at his frame built like a defensive lineman right there again hes got a great frame and he sets good screens on those pend Downs hes free guys up and forcing help but he has got to pick it up from the free throw line some missed Music opportunities just one for three today cavali substition proves checks in for Miner after the Music make Music Applause Music Applause heres Dongo called for the travel good defense by Jacob roads who come into the game dangos been tough to stop it freshman campaign nine straight games in double figures hes been super consistent for Damon statamire and thats a ISO play they went to a lot late in that Clemson game put him in a pick and roll or just dive him to the post and let him go to Applause work pakman had a chance to cut the lead in half there but missed it Music George in attack mode leaves it off to Dongo and nobody was there to stop him well his basketball IQ in the reads that he makes again uh he is playing at a high level from that point guard position for geia Tech what a beautiful find pman spins his way in and lays it up and in but the veteran says Imma put you uh down low in the block and just go right at you beautiful move by Reese beakman to answer Ser of it quick trigger missed it two possession game mcne hits it from three and just like that a threepoint game and thats a breakdown in scouting report in transition uh you cannot leave mcney open beautiful find by beakman offensive foul called against George Char George Virginia right back in it Rees beakman the spin cycle officials timeout and by Dongo and Georgia Tech leads by three program I take it s of and the wild cats won that game I got no comment I can neither confirm nor deny if we won or lost in the semis of the Maui but before the three foul called off the ball against bro Jak second what made Sater so good as a player well he was one of undiz reminds me a guy I played with when I was down in Miami uh Tim Hardaway again a smaller guard but in terms of height but very strong and could get his shot off anywhere and then had a basketball IQ really difficult guy to match up against and both these coaches though really had high praise for each other both these guys played at the next level and again certainly doing a great job with the respect so youre not surprised to see STM coaching no not at all and again uh who he played for in college as well too playing for the great uh lud Olson and he had some great stories about the impact that he had on him not only as a player and the coach but as a as a man and again the staff that he put together another reason why theyve had some success early Carl Hobs aie Wells all those guys doing a great job early on heres pakman looking for Murray threw it Applause away and uncharacteristic again uh you take a look at Tony Bennett Virginia one of the better teams in terms of not turning the ball over they got five early on that one really Applause Music unforced and they only average eight turnovers a game which leads all of division one that turnover led to a Kelly three Off the Mark so still an opportunity to tie it with a three here right before Applause halftime pakman draws the foul and Jay thats a couple times now in this game Virginia has set nice pend down screen for beakman that one as hes open right there decided not to shoot it but Ive been impressed again in this first half the screening and how clean uh some of these Virginia guys have come off for looks mcney you cannot leave him open Isaac mcy leads the ACC shooting 52 from three in conference games another breakdown again hell hit him contested but hes certainly going to make you pay when hes that wide open just miscommunication by Georgia Tech there was no screen for him or anything just nobody picked him up on the out of bounds underneath Damon stms hot over there again thats just the lack of communication and a breakdown and understanding The Scouting Report yeah you know that is bold underline at the top of the Scouting Report cant leave number 11 in blue open Kelly the drive contested no good mcne the rebound under a minute left before halftime Virginia chance to go in Applause front bman with 10 on the timer MC Neely great feed done gives Virginia their first lead of the night and that might have been their best offensive possession of the half beautiful action by Virginia and then a nice dump ball pass by Applause mcney 10 seconds Applause left crosscourt pass knocked Applause away you cant attempt something like that when you got ree beakman on the court no thats a dangerous pass almost picked off so you have two seconds here to just try and get something off and I think theyre looking to see if there should be some more time on the clock or if the game clock and shot clock are lined up well Georgia Tech had an 11point lead in this first half and they have let it slip away stolen Murray with two seconds gets it off in time and Virginia closes the first half on a 12 nothing run Tony Bennett fired up this is the best the Cavaliers have looked on the road all point so theyve kind of let that storm take over this time theyve punched back mnelia three left it short now the question is can they protect this fourpoint lead and get that first road win of the Music Season stolen away Ree beakman and this Virginia Defense has been dialed in they pick up where they left off and beakman Cashes in the steel and then the three everything going Reese Beakmans way key thing defensively again when we spoke with Damon STM he said look against this defense we cannot turn the ball over that time defense uh led to offense for Virginia great steal by Virginia Dongo rejected by D thats his third block tonight key thing again block it and keep possession the dun has the ability to do that on his defensive side good look for beakman couldnt connect that time Reeves transition three he miss fires and Georgia Tech continues their offensive struggles count the end of the first half theyre now more than five minutes scoreless great feed Miner the Applause finish the pin Downs again its not necessarily a set play by Virginia theyre just setting good screens on the pin downs and then theyre making some nice interior passing again another uncontested dunk Miles Kelly delivers a much needed three that ends Virginias 17 nothing Applause run Tech foul charge 13 miles Kell his first first foul and look at this passing right here again by dun off the pin down and again theres got to be better communication uh by Georgia Tech on some of these pin Downs again Virginia doing a nice job setting screens and then creating some opportunities off these Music Downs Georgia attack went from up 11 to down nine theyve cut it to six here McNeely pass it off at the last second miscommunication there and a turnover and they wanted roie to go to the corner that time he tried to slide up to the wing and if he stays in the corner he has a wide open look miscommunication and Music turnover and Georgia Tech gives it right Applause Music back what has changed offensively for Georgia Tech they started this game in such a great Rhythm that they really cant get back to him well I think the dribble drives have been limited by Virginia and that has really been the change and then its fer offense no communication we talked about it mcney shooting the best in the ACC percentage wise and thats another clean look off of a beautiful action Kelly cant answer tapped out to George great feed by Cy claw trying to muscle it through ripped away up ahead beakman flying count it plus the foul Rees beakman and and and one opportunity Bennett has created a nice little tree of guys playing at the next Music level and Hunter was one of those guys and youre right one of the better Defenders that youve seen in the ACC and playing for a pretty big paycheck right now for the Music Hawks bman finishes the and one thats now nine points off turnovers in this half alone for Virginia as theyve blown this lead wide open open largest lead for either team tonight Claude battling back count it plus the foul Ties on Claude Who provided big minutes in the double overtime win against Clemson delivers here and thats a strong move through contact that time by Claude and I like that possession by Georgia Tech again they have been shooting jumpers without success in this last three minute stretch get the ball into the paint Big Time move and finish by Applause Claude beakman shot clock to 10 and that went off done last now Virginia comfortable cushion here theyve erased a double digit deficit and now a ninepoint lead for minutes time right here on acc Network Malcolm Huckaby Jay alter with you so something had to give in this matchup tonight because both of these teams were battling streaks that were not going in their favor Virginia 0 and four away games this year really struggle in those games average margin of of losing by 18 points for Georgia Tech they have lost 10 straight to Tony Bennett in Virginia so somebodys breaking one of those streaks tonight Virginia up 186 in points in the Music Music paint George been quiet draws the foul he is scoreless in this second half after nine in the first is first second team foul and thats all set up though Again by great spacing they ran a couple of actions and thats the Freshman George going up against Music beatman thats got to be tough for a kid whos just 19 years old he wasnt expecting expected to play much this season comes in unheralded recruit is earned playing time and hes delivered but now youre going up against Reese beakman one of the best defenders in the entire country and Ive been impressed with his Poise again makes really good decisions a good midrange game has shot the ball well uh but Ive been more impressed with his ability to set his teammates up for some quality looks Applause mcne great hesitation and it drops in Isaac mcne Perfect Music Touch and Virginias made their last four Music shots and another turnover Applause and this right here again mcy nice head fake and step through soft touch and uh right now he is got 11 points three of five from the threepoint line that time showing off the midrange game again off the curls they do a great job fads and then theyre coming back off a little curl peakman in attack mode right into contact race beakman delivers again tough had is through contact patient offensive possession beakman now up to 15 points Reeves Corner three drills it kaasi Reeves and Georgia Tech needed that triple well Jay thats just a breakdown and thats happened a lot in this game close outs with their hands down Virginia keeps going inside and it keeps working Jordan Miner Music Applause Min 24 points in the paint for Virginia nearly half theyre scoring tonight Georgia Tech living and dying by the three Miss Music Applause Music Applause fires it was the threepoint shooting that won Georgia Tech the game on the road against Clemson right now its hurting them trailing by 10 stur it turns on the Jets passing up the three there only for Sturdivant to take it and make it Kyle Sturdivant buries his second triple you cannot ask for better ball movement if youre Damon stmy ball went left the right and everybody touched it on that Applause possessor bakman high off the glass no good Ryan Dunn pulls down the board mcney hits it from deep Isaac mcney drills it from the logo he has been huge for Virginia in this game playing with confidence no hesitation thats a big time three to quiet the crowd his fourth made three tonight that one the biggest of the bunch offensive rebound cashing in for two Ties on Claude and Tony Bennett hot thought there was a push on that offensive Applause putback beakman so crafty Reese beakman up to 17 thats a veteran move right there just patience a dribbled around made it look like he was going to make a pass and then rised up for a little pullup jumper up ahead Ryan Dunn settles it down Miner draws the foul Virginia really starting to roll well theyre showing off their experience but Isaac mcne has been hot up for Virginia this one from the logo Virginia up 10 really again credit goes to the Virginia Defense they forced them into some tough shots and on the flip side for Tony Bennett and the Cavaliers his dynamic duo of beakman and mcne have been terrific theyve combined for 31 points inside outside beakman has done it from the threepoint line but a lot of his damage in the paint and then mcney continues to shoot the ball lights out from Beyond The Arc Music Jordan Miner at the line shooting two Jordan Miner steps to the line for Applause two extending this Virginia lead the Cavaliers trailed by as many as 11 in the first half where did they take control of this game well I think again a couple of things their defense really has spurred them we talked about the numbers for miles and Kelly thats their calling C but I think a big reason the guy at the line Miner has given them great production uh in this game in particular that presence in the paint for them yeah finished the first half on a 12 nothing run and the Cavaliers have not looked back did not take the first lead of this game until 33 seconds remaining in the half and they have just kept their foot on the gas Cavaliers Music Tony Bennett has to be happy with the effort his team is playing with tonight especially because of the road struggles we have mentioned and that can become a mental thing when youre 0 and four on the road and youre losing by an average margin of defeat of 18 points a game that can start to get in to the psyche well their defense has showed up tonight again another steal that time beakman with the Music deflection and now Georgia Tech in the zone I like this change up by uh Damon stym see if he can give Virginia a different look little matchup Applause Zone beakman 1 second on the shot clock gets it off dun there to tap it in and clean up the spill Ryan Applause dun Music contested three Kelly missfires and another rebound for Ryan on the previous defensive stop we should mention reys beakman his 200th career steal hes only the third Cavalier in the history of Virginia basketball to get 200 and Damon STM had high praise for Greece beakman he said he reminded him of Malcolm brocken who he coached when he was a member of the Celtic staff so again thats pretty good company to be in Dongo hes been quiet tonight needed that bucket well Georgia Tech has had success when theyve gotten the ball into the paint to their bigs and I think thats something they need to continue to go to done another rebound thats now 10 to his name in this Applause game onepoint shy of a double double fou Char number 13 mil killing his second fourth team foul substition for the Cavaliers number four Andrew Ro now the way Georgia Tech shoots the three they are not out of this game but theyve got to turn it on and soon here well they do and I think a couple of times theyve gotten breaks theyve left McNeely open again in this zone right here mcne you must find him Harris left alone cant make the yellow jackets Applause Music pay great pass Claude wasnt ready to finish it and Reeves travels empty possession after empty possession for Georgia Tech there starting the pile up against the stingy Virginia Defense yeah and thats all set up great crows out by roie again closed out and it looked like he slid that pivot foot on that turnover and only good thing about that it was not a live ball now you got a chance to set up your Applause Music Applause defense beakman out of the game for Music Applause Music Virginia chot clock down to five mcne has to heave it and he buries it Isaac mcney from downtown Atlanta thats his fifth made three tonight wow and thats the only word really right there s clock winding down hes at the logo unlimited range and this right here again if your Damon thought of you just throw your arms up again you get them late in the shot clock just what you want and then MCN hits a deep three he was at the logo right there and thats a tough break for Georgia Music Tech mcney now 17 points five of eight from the threepoint line he has been huge for Virginia tonight on the Music road Georgia Tech still trying to claw back in at Damon stoutmire decides to go full court pressure here but the way Virginia takes care of the basketball the way they defend youre only down 13 but that might feel like 20 absolutely I think the thing is uh defensive rebounding for Georgia Tech and then defending this guy on the threepoint line right here MC Groves goes Baseline lays it up and in J Applause Groves now a 15point lead largest to the night for the Cavaliers step back Kelly hits it its a three mil Kelly Applause Tony Bennett felt it should have been a push off called that time on that three cie couldnt swipe it away and mcney settles it down five threes to McNeils name tonight this time passing Groves takes it in Skies denied by Dongo and Georgia can run up ahead oh everything but the Finish Dongo fouled that was almost Spectacular from The highflying Freshman that would have definitely shown up on Sports Center top 10 if that one went is second right here though the defense of by Georgia Tech first the break Virginia though still up on top by Applause 12 now where everybody is playing and when that is Wednesday 5 Eastern Time malol hucke Jay alter with you second game of our triple head are still to come Duke and pit coming up in just a bit on acc Network Isaac mcney and Reese beakman those have been the dynamic duo for the Cavaliers tonight trailed by 11 in the first half now leading by 12 trying to finish off their first first road win of the season and both those guys have shot the ball really well in particular mcney who came into this one 48 from the threepoint line uh he has been lights out from Beyond The Arc for Virginia has made five threes in this game Georgia Tech just showed Tuesday night that they are never out of it they trailed by eight with a minute 33 to go against Clemson came back in one and now the pressure full court up by Georgia Tech lets see if they drop back into the zone or stay man looks like theyre going to elect to stay man heres beakman coming off the curl great pass beautiful play beakman put it to roie right on the money and again thats just the concept right there running that whe cut the help is not there no community thats a beautiful find Again by beatman CI quick trigger rattles in and out no good lets see the adjustment defensively by Georgia Tech again any screens you have to communicate and help pass to be there haris the explosion couldnt finish it though although batted off the hands of kapari so stays Virginia basketball for the Cavaliers and mcne checks back in M you knew he wasnt going to it for long and Jordan Miner five made threes for mcney tonight including two from the Georgia Tech Music Applause Music Applause Music logo Jordan Miner goes with the left and Cashes in and Jay thats all set up by Reese beakman breaking down the defense again nice dribble drive on the Baseline and thats set up by a minor nice soft jump hook long rebound fast break opportunity rejected at The Rim by Dango Cavaliers charge number four Andrew Ro and Ro that time again has hesitated right here thats just great defense and hustle back to break up which looked like it was going to be a uncontested layup great effort play that time now Dongo has had a phenomenal freshman year this has not been his best night but he has been one of the most consistent players for this Georgia Tech Applause Team Music Applause George contested shot gets it to go naan George Georgia Tech has a comeback in him it might be on the back of that freshman again thats just the individual play right there not bad defense by mcney thats just a freshman hitting a tough offb balance jumper Final 5 minutes left in regulation Virginia trying to close out what would be their first true roadwi beakman for 20 rattled in didnt drop that was halfway down but doesnt fall Georgia Tech ball a big possession right here for Georgia Tech 444 to go down 12 trying to cut this to single digits stur ofan contested three too much on it trying to battle for the offensive rebound and he wins it great Hustle by sturdivan can the yellow jackets cash in now George the crossover couldnt finish it offensive rebound Claude draws the foul well credit Georgia Tech down 12 but they are putting everything on the line some great hustle plays to keep that possession alive Jay one of the things that me and you talked about uh prior to this game Georgia Tech of the job Damon STM has done these guys there has been no quit in this team and they have continued to play hard thats a big time effort play that time on the glass by Claude and they have been dominated in the paint and on the glass to tonight out scored by 24 points in the paint and thats against a Virginia team that isnt exactly imposing usually in the paint particularly in the front court but Jordan miners played excellent tonight Ryan Dunn has as well yeah I think uh Miner and Dunn really have done a nice job controlling the glass in this Applause game and youre right those points in the paint have been huge and Virginia has dominated that area as you Applause said MC de finds beakman who draws the foul foul Char to number one those two have combined for 34 points tonight officials terrific dynamic duo leading the Cavaliers on the road theyre 4 minutes away from moving to above 500 an ACC play and picking up their first conference Road win its been off of excellent ball movement but for me the guy that set the tone Reese beakman uh he shot the ball well from the perimeter 17 points but for me its been his eight assists in this game he has set his teammates up for some easy opportunities to go along with the two Steals and they each have 17 tonight and you need that on the road where youve struggled 0 and four on the season in True Road matchups all of them have been losses by at least 16 points or more and you come in get an effort from your top two players like that and now 4 minutes away from closing out this victory Virginia going to run some clock on this possession they run clock on pretty much every possession theyre really getting deep into shot clock on this one Groves o air ball as the buzzer Music blares cavali well thats a good possession by Georgia Tech again forced a deep contested three shot clock winding down certainly 339 to go you dont need a three but if it comes obviously off of dribble drive and kick youll take it you are entering Now or Never territory if youre the yellow jackets Dongo trying to spin his way free great move its single Applause digits core pressure on and Virginias done a nice job of breaking pressure by Georgia Tech and this has happened a lot Ry has been the guy to relieve some pressure from beakman and Applause mcney MCN gets free cant finish it done trying to rip down the offensive rebound battle for the ball won by Georgia Tech under three minutes to go in regulation George puts it up by Dango hammers it home what a read by Nathan George to find that Lop pitpoint pass for the slams The Freshman connection gets this place the loudest its been all night and Jay the accuracy on this pass right here all he had to do is go catch it and slam it beautiful find by the freshman Nathan George and Dongo with the Finish Dongo now 10 straight games in double figures what a phenomenal freshman year the sagales sensation has had here in Atlanta and Georgia Tech on a 7 nothing run theyve cut this lead in half they trailed by eight with a minute 33 to go on the road at Clemson and they found a way to win done critical offensive rebound and that has been the story but dun in particular has hurt them on the offensive glass D drives Baseline draws the foul hell get two at the line Char number 11 by well Ryan Dunn has five offensive rebounds in this game and that drive is set up because of a second chance opportunity Ryan Dunn has been dominant on the offensive glass for Virginia in this game ran at the line Music Applause shooting yeah dun certainly a Pro Prospect the one thing that he probably needs to improve is in his game is his foul shooting misses that one hes under 60 from the line this season and really surprising cuz again you look at his mechanics well on his free throw shot not bad certainly right here trying to make the free throw extend this lead to eight air Applause ball and Georgia Tech has the crowd in it theyve cut what was once of Virginia 15o lead down to seven under 2 minutes to go Applause to the Freshman Dongo going right into Jordan Miner 10 seconds to Applause shoot and Miner called for the foul thatll send Nate George to the line shooting one and one Cavaliers foul charged number 22 Jordan Miner his fourth 18am foul now Jay you were on number 12 the Georgia Tech win at Clemson where they were down eight with a minute 33 to go and I think one of the things that stood out to me as I watched that game was the Poise and the execution that this Georgia Tech team had down the stretch on the road against a very good Clemson team you know its very similar Malcolm mirrors that situation that score was 6860 this is 6760 found a way to get it to overtime and then won it in o on the road against a good Clemson team now just a twopossession game on an8 nothing run over the last four minutes George hits them both Virginia in a scoring drought of four minutes and 30 seconds its allowed Georgia Tech to storm back on a N9 nothing Applause run the 15point lead is down to five five Groves wide open from three and he buries it well you talk about end of game execution that is a huge three by Jacob Gro Dongo the immediate answer and David stom calls the timeout two possession game a little more than a minute left Virginia trying to cling to their first road win of the leading the way but Georgia Tech is storming back theyve got the crowd in it theyve made three in a row and now an opportunity to try and do what they did Tuesday night which was really come back from dead they were down eight on the road at Clemson took it a double overtime and one and thats the beauty of college basketball you never know and the key now is the full court pressure of by Georgia Tech now in the past uh theyve used roie uh to break pressure uh theyve inbounded the ball then thrown it immediately back to roie and let him bring the ball up Applause Music and the Georgia teack coming out of the timeout electing not to foul bakman with a double double tonight 17 points and 10 assists can he deliver another clutch moment for Applause Virginia kicks it out mcne a three got it Isaac mcy delivers again his 63 of the night Georgia Tech answers satomy takes his final timeout I mean he should just go to the DMV and change his last name I tell you mcely well Ill tell you what this is another big time three now again to close out you cannot lose sight of him thats too much airspace for mcney he has been on fire tonight you look at his numbers six of n from the threepoint line hes the one guy you stay home on you almost face guard him that time Reese beakman drove nowhere to go he lost sight of him for 1 second too late on the close out one of the best Shooters not just in the ACC but the entire country is over 50 from three in ACC play you just have to know where he is at all times and Damon STM talked about this again hes got a young team okay theyre talented theyve done some really good things but in the game situation right there MCN is the one guy you stay home on in particular in a game like tonight where he has caught fire from the threepoint line shot clock winding down you cannot give him that much airace thats just a breakdown Georgia Tech had done well the battle back into the game only for McNeely to hit yet another three that is his third game with six threes or more this Applause season now comes down to Breaking pressure and making free throws if youre Virginia key thing uh for Georgia Tech looks like they have somebody back playing safety you dont want to get beat long into MCN you certainly dont want to send him to the foul line of your Georgia attch jump ball possession arrow with the yellow jackets and just like that Georgia Tech has life in this game well right now if you look at it on the screen Tony Bennett thinks that that was a quick 5 Music seconds substi for the Cavaliers I think they call the jump offall yeah it looks like again thats Tony benett felt like he did not have possession of that it still should have been Virginia ball Georgia three missed it offensive rebound Georgia Tech has to hurry stur of in a three two really good looks missed them both minor the rebound and that should do it beakman fouled but Virginia can taste it Tech foul charson number 13 miles Kelly 10 seconds away from winning their first true Road game of the Music season well Jay it looks like Virginia is going to hold on and credit two things of their defense and then the play of their back court McNeely and this guy at the line Reese beakman has been huge in this Applause game beakman now up to 18 points in this game but I think the big number 11 assist for Reese beakman uh he has done a little bit of everything for Virginia in this game Music deep three from George too much on it and thatll do it Virginia holds on the Cavaliers take down Georgia Tech and earn their first true Road win of the Season backto back wins for Tony Bennetts team impressive their defense showed up tonight on the road I think a couple of numbers that stand out 21
