has not played in a little while sometimes you get this with the Ivy League schools on a quad system so a finals week free Thanksgiving they havent played in 10 days but its not like theyve been practicing all that you know any significantly more uh the last 10 days and uh we have a full start not sure the clock went when it was supposed to so well reset here early on in this well to your point just a huge disparity right a dart team that you know 10 days off so are they r they had a chance certainly to scout Boston College all three games at that c Islands classic three games which BC won in very different Fashions couple close games against Missouri State an overtime win and then uh they come from behind victory over Boise so you know theyve seen BC win in different ways obviously they have an idea of how the Eagles are going to come out and attack them today Kade H Haskins for three is short dartmouths going to shoot a lot of Threes thats what they do 49th nationally in most threepoint attempts so far this season Boston College has defended the three extremely well its maybe their best statistical feature this year Donald H strikes the Eagles from downtown well theyve shot the three very well that Boise State game excluded Eagles close to 40 from Beyond The Arc this year and again guys just taking advantage of opportunities and a good look there for hand nice move Inside by Romeo Merle the senior from Sweden it is a little bit of a different looking Dartmouth starting lineup today Kate H Haskins is back in the starting lineup for the first time since the opener and Jaden Williams gets his first start of the season I think an adjustment by der to get a little more size on the floor now its going to be tough against guys like Chad Benning who has two Benning off to a nice start for Boston College averaging just over 11 per game yeah the one problem for Dartmouth is they dont really have a rim protector theyre bottom 10 nationally in Blox perur game again its still early they only have five games played but they only average about a block a game so you know Ving should be able to Feast inside straight on Brandon Mitchell day is short and Elijah strong has the rebound for Boston College theyve rebounded the ball really well the last couple of games inside for Dion Brown and he lets two Defenders come to him and he draws the foul we see venning able to do this waits for that second Defender to leave the area nice spin move Mitchell D just giving up way too much Ro on the Baseline there easy finish for the big man Chad Benning the transfer from St Bon Aventure where he was the second Team all A10 selection last year catch and shoot for Dion Brown and thats a nice sign right out of the design play off the inbounds brown for two averaging just under six per game and thats maybe a reason for optimism with this Boston College team because not only is the record six and one but theyve done it without the scoring touch that were all still expecting from Dion Brown yeah a guy who showed he could be explosive at UNBC and maybe still trying to you know find his role amongst the group here Jaden Williams for three thats how darts going to stay in this game Williams whos only four of 13 from behind the arc so far this year and its a seven to five Music game Elijah strong against H Haskins kicks for Donald Dan hes a little short that Applause time nice spin move left hand no the follow from Mitchell day kind of sack tuck to the rim and then hand wisely decides to slow down and reset he was looking for an explosive play there going over the top trying to stuff it back in Jaz Kelly nice overhand pass strong inside great look for venning thats old school that wrap around bounce past into the low post nice work by strong there H Haskins from Hanover the senior from Minneapolis with a deep three he is sixth in the ivy league in points per game but thats really all off of that one big performance in the opener where he scored 32 points against Vermont state lyen Dartmouth scored 129 which was a program record heres that look all the way through and the nice pass inside for venning well to your point about has Haskins certainly a guy who can provide some explosive offense you mentioned this dartman team not going to be shy about shooting it from long range and you know youve seen him have capability to light it up offensively so you know maybe thats part of the reason for inserting him in the starting lineup today jazz Kelly a little short from three he did also have 20 against Sacred Heart in the next game but just seven points over the last three see how many threes darts going to shoot Merle that time no good and the Eagles on the run the other way Jaz Kelly lost the handle on it taken away by the first year Conor amundson from Fresno California H Haskins aggressive with the basketball kicks to the corner four and three is no good and H Haskins whacks at it for an offensive rebound d active to the ball early in this game Conor christensens in for the first time number 11 in Black DC up by one launching a mson is good another three for Dartmouth theyre three for seven from behind the ark but thats enough for a six nothing run and their first lead Browns pass is blocked loed good read by Romeo Merle and hes got it back got brown up in the air got to the basket and Dartmouth on an eight nothing run and just no Challenge on the shot there strong I think took a little bump and then I dont know maybe just found himself out of the play there but couldnt recover in time to challenge the shot Benning nearly lost the handle on it and then did out of bounds still a discussion where the ball is its to stay here when we come back nice little spurt here for Dartmouth who goes on an 8 nothing run over the last two minutes led by their threepoint Music shot total is 1500 to scientific life science mov answer every thre pointer made by the E this season Savings Bank will donate 10 to

Zone presented by rener Services Chad benen led the eagles with 16 points and seven rebounds their win over Bo State secure the C Island classic title Music Music just Music 139 lead for dartman on an 8 nothing run to gain this lead for the first time Romeo Merle certainly had a big impact the senior from Sweden his first game was against Boston College in the opener a couple years ago that was also Earl Grants first game as the head coach of BC does a great job directing traffic offensively for the Big Green set up a couple nice shots from the outside here early on so BC went full line change here five out five in McFarland Payne Beetle Taves and Hastings all come in the game right to the basket Hastings got there but commits the foul on Jaden Williams and its curious the reason for the full sub for BC is it Earl Grant not happy with the defensive start giving up too many good looks from three or is it partially to you know get some of his guys a little early rest coming off of the the short trip the short turnaround yeah I think its just probably a spark as much as anything you mentioned how much Boston College has played recently it its just it stand stand out just because of the fact that Dartmouth hasnt played a game since the 19th of November the Boston College playing three games this week down in the payman islands coming back and playing this game here Jaden Williams missed a couple at the line heres Fred pay who had a really nice tournament hes been good recently for BC getting more and more time for the sophomore from gramling Louisiana who missed almost all of last season heres Beetle its the gamewinning shot against Boise pain in the lane right hand goes I think that young mans going to continue to get increased playing time the way hes gone here over the last few games well again you wonder what could have been had it not been for the injury a season ago right what would his role really have been in his freshman season well hes another guy like Donald H now hes got opportunity he can be sort of one of those lead guards Off the Bench good handle there forcing his way into a good shooting spot nice touch with the floater and he is eight for n now at the free throw line this year Fred pay five games last year before he was forced to red shirt after a knee injury on December 5th against Central Connecticut but hes a former fourstar recruit coming in from Louisiana you saw on that graphic had the 18 points in a career day against Missouri state in the semifinals earlier this week feels like thats the way Boston College is going to go its not going to be the the same guy every night its going to be a different guy leading the way and a foul here committed by Luca Taves Boston College whos won five games in a row that is their longest winning streak since December of 2017 which included that win over number one Duke here at kti Forum bidding for their best start since 2007 2008 or win away from matching a 7 And1 start deep three from Kade H Haskins boy hes not afraid to shoot from anywhere well right off the catch hes looking to turn in fire 66 so hes got height to elevate so BCs going to have to make sure to keep some of their taller guards on him try and discourage that shot best they can heres Roger McFarland the veteran grad transfer now pay for three to match thats from a step or two beyond the line good confidence early on from P 46 threepoint shooter to start this year Ryan Cornish coming off the bench today for the first time nice looking shot there it does not go onepoint game Dartmouth in front here early first half Josh Beetle the Clemson transfer hit a leg of the Dartmouth guy kickball was not called all the way down the other end but Mitchell day couldnt convert even there G got to the rebound first but threw it out of bounds starts been very active so far and when theyre hitting threes like this they can hang in yeah McFarland just trailing behind the screen P doesnt quite step up but as the answer on the other end again late close out from Merle pay ready to shoot McFarland and Taves not on the same Applause page fourth turnover for Boston College here early first half Grant sticking with this second group right now well theyve given him some life offensively weve gotten a couple fortunate breaks on Miss free throws and a miss layup on a transition opportunity for Dartmouth though CPC jumping out they know what Dartmouth wants to do theyre going to try to force the Big Green inside and thats a perfect example of it on that possession right really aggressive coming out you live with the drive and then its turned over to Boston College and Deion Brown is back in I dont know Hastings almost looked like he overplayed that a little bit allowed Cornish to slip through probably want that pressure up top to be a little bit tighter so BC actually is shooting the ball very well theyre six for nine from the floor but Dartmouth has five more attempts and two more made threes and thats why the score is where it is right now yeah four turnovers TR thats the difference in the possessions dartman has scored five points off of those four turnovers pay backing away a lot of pressure from Ben Brown the sophomore from Manchester England Brown for three is no good you mentioned the Eagles did not shoot the three ball well against Boise State after a really good stretch over this fivegame winning streak as you mentioned theyre at 41 on the threepoint shot which includes that two for 12 on Wednesday right and it to your point it hasnt been just one or two different players you know Kellys shooting 40 from three Payne 6 for 13 beetle in limited shots three for seven hands over 40 so its everybody having a chance to contribute to the offense from the outside crowd starting to fill in here on this Friday afternoon Thanksgiving week Dartmouth up by by one the drive from amson gives it up three ball for cornish is no good Eagles run with it Payne Cuts right back left and draws the Applause foul and we step aside with 1141 to go here well we know how important defense is to everything that Earl gr preaches and everything he wants to talk about and early in the season we have certainly seen that on display from this Boston College team yeah and the big ones obviously the threepoint percentage defense right thats you know an almost 10 11 difference early on again a lot of different things factor in opponent location all that sort of stuff matters and obviously Dartmouth is shooting the three well out of the gate today will it be something that continues throughout the entire game Still Remains a question now theyre certainly shooting it well enough to be in this position up by one for David mclins team the ninth year head coach of the Big Green Payne is one of two at the line really nice start today seven points for Fred Payne and a tie basketball game three ball straight on Williams what a shot the Junior from windamir Florida adds dartmouths fifth threepointer here in the first 9 Minutes of the first half and if there was a guy youd sort of maybe let it fire a little bit Williams might be it Hastings Champs it down Earl Grant still going with basically this second group minus Dion Brown is in there and Donald Hs about to check back in as well eagles need a little bit more of that feeding into the post that is dartmouths first turnover of the afternoon and youll see screening action away Brown just a half step late its quick release but Williams a guy who hadnt shot it well early on two for three today so hes got the green light for sure Hastings was impactful in the first couple of games of that Cay and Islands classic as that is thrown away eight points in backtoback games against Old Dominion and Missouri States Daves just a little out of control as he got to the rim that time didnt have an Lane to put it up tried to kick it back out split the difference between brown and hand dont have either of your point guards on the floor right now basically if your Boston College three from the corner its good Conor amson with his second three Dartmouth is 641 from behind the ark today and analytics still tell you that corner three is the most efficient one you can take round drop up and under shorts and a good rebound by Jaden Williams had an opportunity to take another foul there and passed it up that is a wild shot that goes waved off though with the foul being ruled on the floor how about that though nevertheless from Ryan Cornish think hes got a pretty good argument here for continuation wow I mean theres the contact and he goes right into the shot I mean I understand you know probably the type of foul that it was but Cornish petitioning right away for the N1 maybe should have had it theres Ryan Cornish missed a lot of time last season got hurt in the first Ivy game of the year they really felt like they had an impact on the season that Dartmouth had a season ago its 2 and 12 in Ivy League Play Mitchell day kicks out H Haskins three ball Applause good Kade H Haskins with his third threepointer Dartmouth is 7 for 12 from behind the strip guess that 10day rest will do you well wow whatever it is it is working right now against the BC team that has not given up the threepoint shot this year vetting spins right hand good and a foul and I think were going to see a lot more of that from Chad venning who obviously has a size Advantage inside yeah I mean look anytime BCs been able to dump the ball down into the low post vening or Hastings theyve been able to convert pretty much every time again theres no real shot blocker out there for Dartmouth and again venning using his body so well just leaning in to Mitchell day and an easy spin off of him second foul on Mitchell day there is Chad venning picked up his game over the last few hes third in the ACC coming in in total blocks fourth in blocks per game and he knocks down the free throw seven points for venning tied with Fred Payne for the Boston College lead the Eagles starting lineup is back in there now 2521 Dartmouth Lee Music Applause H Haskins against Elijah strong hands off five to shoot a mansen inside that falls away and it just rolls off nice defensive trip there by Elijah strong took the switch stayed in front of the mson the whole time made him take a very tough shot Kelly kicks to a wide open Dion Brown who cant hit and ask for a better look there Cornish on the other end that rolls and gets the friendly spin like soft touch there by Cornish his first two points of the game 2721 Dartmouth shooting 50 Boston College is shooting 57 but Dartmouth six more attempts from the floor and obviously the threepoint shots been huge Chad venning thought about it instead dries venning is called for an offensive Applause foul his size kind of goes against him here yep thats tough too cuz Cornish kind of comes over and brushes up against him Christensen though to his point was set he was outside the restricted area its one of those where venning needs to almost slow himself up a little bit as he goes crashing in he does have the size Advantage but just make sure to use it while maintaining body control oh boy the pass was there for cornish but he threw it away with Conor amundson cutting with 8 minutes remaining in this first half teams think its a time out yeah its not under eight here I think we should its that rare situation where stops exactly at 8 minutes I guess were going to take it 12 from behind the arc so far oh when you got 10 days off what are you going to do other than take finals up at uh your Ivy League school youre going to get in the gym youre going to get some shots up and all that practice has served the Big Green Well coming out shooting the ball very very well this afternoon Kate H Haskins has been their best shooter all year long and hes doing it again so far today you know when you look at the numbers overall for Dartmouth some of the numbers do stand out but you got to remember so much came in that first game when they scored 129 points a program record that you know the rest of the time their threepoint shot has not been you know anything that kind of is crazy here just 27 from behind the arc outside of the opener where they went 20 for 41 against btsu Lindon but boy have they been good today in fact that 129 points thats a third of the total points they had scored all year coming into this game today trying to take advantage of the team on some short rest you wondered how their legs would be offensively BC came out I think executed with what they wanted to do and then the turnovers crept in now were going to see if they can sort of settle things down with most of the regulars back out there Donald hand has five after that floater goes averaging 15 per game Merl against hands with 16 to shoot for Dartmouth Christian s right to the bucket thats a good look that doesnt go yeah he got a step on Benning there just couldnt finish it a couple times Dar had good looks at the rim and just missed they are three for nine on their twopoint shots today 7even for 12 from three and no good that time strong overran it a bit threepointer from H Haskins he finally misses from behind the ark well now were seeing whats going to be a problem I think for Dartmouth in foul trouble and again talk about the sized mismatch inside Mitchell days already on the bench with two Christenson just picked up his second Cornish who can be a weapon for them offensively on both ends of the and and defensively as well in terms of creating turnovers hes in foul trouble so this is not an especially deep Dartmouth team Austin college has been pretty good getting to the line this year at 71 as a team on the free throw venting at just 55 but he makes that one he leads Boston College with eight first half points going to be a big man in the ACCC youre going to have to knock down free throws cuz you know youre going to have your chances as phys iCal as the game gets down under the basket offensive so Dartmouth who really did not turn the ball over at all in that opening stretch of this game gives it away there and thats another Dartmouth player with two fouls as Jaden Williams gets his second thats four players with two fouls for Dart and if youre Boston College this should be a clearcut sign as any need to just keep attacking Music strong floats it inside looking for venning knocked out of bounds stays here with Boston College yeah this has got to be one of those okay its a little bit of a sloppy start early although again you see shooting 53 from the field its just more about the threepoint shot as weve talked about for dartman but now its all right what do we have to do to get to the half with the lead here of the last 637 maybe its give Chaz Kelly the chance to shoot threes that looks like one of their pet plays under the basket right quick little handoff give and go to the corner three second time Kellys had that look this time hes able to knock it down to the corner to match no from Ben Brown and now the Eagles have the lead again lets see if they can take it advantage of it on a 7 nothing run right now over the last 90 seconds slip venning inside draws another foul nice pass by Kelly here sold the no look across the floor again just a simple little handoff play venning with a little back screen sets up the shot this is what Kelly does best so good at Distributing the ball and Dartmouth is going to take a timeout with six minutes to go in the first bus to college back up by one back in 30 seconds Music onepoint lead for Boston College great day to bring the kids out here on this Friday mat Black Friday right after Thanksgiving you see what Boston College has done at The Rim theyve kind of struggled a little bit there this year but you feel like with guys like Benning that number is only going to go up as the year goes on because they are getting to the line a little bit more well and thats obviously going to be pivotal this is a game where they can absolutely Feast getting to the free throw line theyre going to be in the double bonus for pretty much the rest of this first half just a matter of continuing to create the those opportunities and I think maybe look for the guards to attack the basket a little bit more obviously with a guy like vening you want to sort of give him his space and let him work in a oneonone matchup but I think you can see opportunities for guys like H Brown and Beetle to attack the rim as well Chad venning has not missed a shot today three for three from the floor five for five from the line for a 55 free throw shooter so that is a real Music positive and the Eagles have their biggest lead since they were up 72 venning trying to add to Applause it theres some good footwork from the big man 11 nothing Boston College run Benning has 13 and Eagles really trying to take away the threepoint shot right now get beat a different way a Manson kicks Christensen for three its good nice little design to get him open and Conor Christensen finds that threepointer that Dartmouth was looking for yeah trying to attack vetting there they had him working hard that whole defensive shift to match Josh beetle is good he was wide open broke out for 13 in the win against Boise including that gamewinning threepointer that we showed you off the top of the show the Clemson transfer DC up for Merle inside blocked by beetle beetle got Applause it hes good switching hands like that mid drive five points in a row for Beetle Eagles have their largest lead of the day and a ball thrown inside and a foul goes against Applause BC heres the steal by venning he just picked up the foul and then heres the block by Beetle good recognition there just getting the fingertips to it and does it himself on the other end with the Nifty Euro Step of the floater Fred Payne Roger farlin and Jaden Hastings all back into the game for Boston College now up by seven with 418 to go here in the first half that saw Dartmouth lead by as much as seven the other way mson too strong on the Applause twopointer strong nice fake goes back right with his left hand is no good yeah nothing wrong with that though just bullied his man off the spot Mitch day Coast to Coast no good aggressive take to the basket but it did not go and Beetle swipe from behind pay does a good job to find it and it Cycles around for Elijah strong who lived up to his name maybe one more pass there little frantic sequence and Williams is fouled on the threepoint shot so all the momentum going Boston Colleges way but Dartmouth will have some free throws when we come back what a game for Chad Benning here early on four for four from the floor five for f Music Applause Applause well Boston College has really picked up their game over the last few minutes and Chad venning has been the biggest reason why well you see the great footwork from the big man inside spinning off his Defender a handful of times for easy layups its also how hes gotten himself to the line a couple times where hes knocked down all of his free throws and even showing it in the transition game a little bit quick hands and the Nifty stepped to the rim for two you know the thing that has stood out about watching him for a couple of weeks now Ben is you know especially in a game like this hes pretty good at understanding where he has those mismatch advantages and when he kind of needs to take over a game and weve seen him do that a couple of times well it was obviously going to be a big hole coming off of last year right you lose a guy like Quinton post who was so impactful not only in and around the basket but also from the outside and venting is a different type of player certainly but has that great footwork has that nice soft touch and you know when you get into those physical ECC battles he is not a guy who who is going to wear down so an important little sequence here for Dartmouth remember the foul on the threepoint shot by Josh Beetle so Jadon Williams has three free throws and hes made the first two now eight points in the game today for the Junior and he gets all Music three number he missed two earlier but he gets all three here Beetle picked up his dribble needs help cant find Fred Payne without it being knocked away Austin college ball with 326 Dartmouth is still only one of their last seven from the floor here so if youre boss to college you got to feel like now now is the time to try to put some distance in between still the momentum on your side even despite those three free throws Dartmouth throwing wrinkles in with a press now a zone that corner threes been open a few times this time pay didnt quite have it brown drives Deion Brown did not get it Applause off thought he had the reverse he waited for the defender to come again you mentioned a guy who was such a great scorer last year at UNBC you just wonder if hes still just sort of figuring out what he can and can do against the the competition he SE in this season a mson created a little space for himself a fast ball for cornish 245 to go in this first half and Cornish converts Applause Dartmouth is not going away easy nice job by Cornish again just able to extend out doesnt shy away from the physical battle there and the free throw makes it a onepoint game again five points in the first half here for cornish but a season High 18 against U Albany couple of games ago Dartmouth trying to snap a threegame losing skid today Boston College trying to extend their winning streak to six McFarland little trap now has oneonone with six to shoot McFarland turns ends up as a pass for pay but he lost the handle on it on the Baseline well McFarland getting it in the middle of the Zone there I think just sort of ran out of ideas of what he wanted to do eventually just sort of tried to force his way to the rim and that jump hook would not sit for him so now the momentum on the side of Dartmouth theyve scored six points in a row that is a double team though and Williams just lost the handle on it McFarland On The Run drives McFarland blocked Brandon Mitchell day Hastings got a back though Second Chance is good this time for McFarland nice job by Hastings sticking with a play there yeah that looked like that could be a real momentum swinger and Hastings found that basketball in a frantic sequence Mitchell day who had the block just walks to the rim first points for Brandon Mitchell day go getting lost in a couple of those screen pops M day immediately going straight to the bucket no help defense from Music Applause BC four guys off the bench plus hand right now time McFarland deep three to strong and Dartmouth with a minute to go in the first half can play for the lead and they do wide open again Brandon Mitchell day the big lead by one yeah thats just tough transition defense numbers are back for the Eagles but guys not picking up their assignments and it hasnt even necessarily been the threepoint shot here recently for Dartmouth theyve just taken advantage inside push the defense out and converted Beetle left hand is good seven for Josh Beetle well you just almost wish youd see that more from him just feels like he is able to attack and create offense almost on a whim certainly a high scoring half here both teams in the 40s and about a 4 second difference between the game and The Possession for Ryan Cornish guarded by Fred pay Cornish slips and its foul its a couple times again High screen they want Hastings and thats the second time it Cornish both times right Hasting goes goes out to pressure here he loses Mitchell day and then again with the foul Cornish is able to slip through a seam youve seen it a few times weve talked about it you see the potential for a guy who remember missed all of last year but you also kind of see some of those defensive inconsistencies thatll improve over time so Cornish at the foul line Dartmouth down by one 11 seconds remaining and he gets the front end ran Cornish is a 66 free throw shooter coming off the bench today for the first time this year the senior from pomac Maryland and the Big Green lead again back to the Press say I give this to Beetle and clear out looks like Earl Grants just going to let him go be got it back from pay three seconds Beetle forces Beetle got it again miss the mental fatigue of having to go back out you know almost less than 48 hours later and play another tough game nice pass from hand inside Elija strong start the second half with an N one chance again the more Boston College gets the ball around the rim I think the better off theyre going to be here its a really nice pass from hand and then strong taking advantage of exactly what you were just talking about with Coach that size that Boston College has inside in a matchup like this first two points of the game for Elijah strong hes another one we talked about Donald H doing it off the top in terms of leading Boston College scoring wise coming in but Strongs another guy who saw minimal time last year has a much larger role this year in the coaching staff has confidence in him and he is rewarding that confidence with production nice drive blocked by venning Chad venning as we mentioned top five in the ACC and blocks to start the year Deion Brown on the drive double team nice handoff for venning good find by Brown and Chad venning will go to the line that sort of sixth sense that guards have sometimes he feels the defender come over check out the defense first first using that wingspan to make up the ground getting to it before Mitchell day could get it to the glass so Chad Benning having himself a very nice afternoon so far and he has still been perfect on his shooting this is trouble early for darou that foul on Mitchell day was his third so two early fouls they were already over the limit in the first half and now youd say the guy who might be best suited to be their rim protector has to take an early seat and it did feel like BC was on their best stretch when he was out in foul trouble in that first half so venning has 15 hes seven for seven from the foul line and the Eagles have the first five points of half number two Christensen whos getting a lot of minutes today the senior from Eden Prairie Minnesota mson thought about it instead drives and gets all the way to the basket and I think this is three on vening he comes over trying to block the shot aunon does a good job getting rid of this ball early enough just no help on the drive there for strong so its definitely a fine line right because the thing that dartman is doing right now is we told you about all those threes they hadit early so Boston College has crashed the threepoint line defensively and now Dartmouth is starting to use that ball fake and beat him back the other way and one is good what a sequence and most importantly as you said Benning to the bench with three fouls and I think an interesting switch here for the Eagles Jaz Kelly goes all the way to the basket yeah just nobody guarding the rim that time Kelly able to get all the way downhill there strong basically now has to switch to the five usually its been a straight swap right vending for Hastings we saw Hastings give up a couple easy buckets toward the end of that first half so a little bit of a smaller group but a group who can still get to the rim and have success right now for BC Williams no good for three then hand is a little bit short on the drop fast ball Merle lets his man go by strong got a piece of it and Dartmouth resets trying to drive again and does Applause again its a little bit of a tough match up for strong hes got the foot speed but almanson has done a good job getting him off balance a couple times Conor mson with 11 points now over his season average at just under 11 per game Kelly deep three no good and a rebound to H Haskins deep three he got it a fourth threepointer for Kate H Haskins a thats just a confident shooter with a confident shot I dont know what Warrior you do there well now you got everything going right because you push Boston College to the threepoint line defensively youre getting the drive but youre still making a threepoint shot like that and this is a onepoint game Kelly inside for Elijah strong against haset strong to the Applause line first lets look at the drive on the other end yeah a little shot fake again strong doesnt like get way up in the air but off balance enough that it opens up the driving lane and then a nice screen here by Mur strong does a relatively decent job but as soon as H Haskins sees his man go under hes letting it go remember it had been a couple of games for H Haskins who had 32 in the opener and then 20 against Sacred Heart in game number two but since that point had only seven points total excuse me averaging seven points per game had hit five of 20 for three over three games but now hes kind of come back to the guy that weve seen those first two games of the year I mean you sort of have a couple tough games maybe figure youre due and he certainly has come out firing again today hes averaging 15 per game hes up to 12 today another drive not quite there but Dartmouth still willing to go inside I mean that was a defensive breakdown there nobody guarding the drive Deon brown lost it got it back left hand too strong and then actually probably could have been called for a foul on the end of that instead it knocks out of bounds Dartmouth will get it anyway he just sense some frustration right now for Dion Brown just trying to find his rhythm trying to find his game well remember we saw that mass line change by Earl Grant five guys coming out five coming in early well see if he does something dramatic like that like he did in the first half Ryan Cornish Williams 4 three he got it Jaden Williams has 12 Dartmouth leads by two I mean really right now its two guys if youre BC that are burning you H Haskins you could sort of see potentially coming ni spin move for Elijah strong but yes you had no idea he did four threes year hes got four today alone four for 13 from three coming in for Jaden Williams Haskins got his man up in the air does have to pass off with 14 to shoot tie game at 53 four and a half into the second half Cornish drives and draws the foul Dartmouth has the Eagles right where they and theyre getting to watch a competitive basketball game here 53 a piece up 4 and 12 into this second half and the thing that has stood out the most to me about this Dartmouth team is theres been a couple of times where it felt like okay heres the inevitable BS and college is kind of going to take this game and extend out the lead a little bit and Dartmouth time after time has not let the Eagles do that well to dartmouths credit they keep finding ways to exploit the Boston College defense and there are a couple factors for that right whether its tired legs from a short turnaround and some travel coming back from the cin Islands classic theres the fact that Dartmouth has had 10 days off and theyve obviously been practicing for this Boston College team during that time and maybe theyre feeling confident coming off of that time off but they keep finding matchups you know whether its Cornish going oneonone against Brown whether its you know taking advantage of Hastings and some communication issues in the screen and roll game but they keep finding different ways to exploit something offensively and the shots keep falling thats another part of it couple of subs for Earl Grant including Josh Beetle back in the game he missed the jumper there and Fred Kean is back in as well threepointer again it is good Applause again a fifth three for Kade H Haskins and Dartmouth leads by four Music Fred Payne drives and is fou well we told you coming in Boston College had held their opponents to just under six threes per game shooting under 26 Dartmouth has made 11 today and its more threes than it made against anyone not Vermont state Lyon earlier this year Music and again that was another deep three from H Haskins so again you know I dont know what you do here in terms of the adjustment for BC you just keep extending because we saw vulnerable to the dve extended and Dartmouth converted the drives threepointer in transition that was too strong but an offensive rebound TI by Williams and cornes was well off a little bit too much heat check going on there so two chances there well see if that becomes a big moment as the Eagles back on possession Beetle to Fred Payne short on the three a rebound to Haskins now thats sort of been I think an underplayed storyline obviously David mclam thought it was very important for his team but theyve been good on the defensive glass as they have held Boston College to just two offensive rebounds today its a place where BCs really thrived at times this year saw them have 22 offensive boards in a game just last week against Lola Williams wide open well the UPS is good boy again just no communication on the back end hand turns to see the ball loses total sight of his man and how about Jaden Williams having himself a day shooting the three a 152 Dartmouth run they are 12 of 22 from three Donald Han BC needs one that was too strong and now the Eagles are starting to go cold from the floor just three for nine in this half out of bounds it will stay here well nows the time where youre going to look to I think your defense is really the thing you have to sign Shore up right now of your BC and expect that your defense will find a way to fuel your energy on offense so a couple of Subs here for Boston College and they put Chad venning back in the game playing with three fouls I dont think you can afford not to right now yeah I mean feels like hes your your most consistent thing H Haskins catch and shoot not there and a foul on the rebound that was another one that looked like it was almost there and David mlin felt like it Williams going over the back here good design another great look for has Haskins one thing that is worth noting that is already five team fouls on Dartmouth in this half and bennings going to be the guy right if BCs getting back in this game 17 ties the season high in a Boston College High for Chad Benning he has not missed a shot but playing with three fouls Dartmouth leads by five thanks to 12 threepointers Merle drives against Beetle Merle right hand no its good defense by Beetle just trusted his length stayed down Beetle sees a lane and Merle blocks him from behind Merle showing off the Hops there Beetle feeling like he had the angle saw the lane to the basket Earth doing a good job elevating there Music Cameron mamy in the game for dth for the first Music time double team comes on Benning first time thats more of that right coming up on 12 to go Kelly kicks to the corner Fred pay for three is no good McFarland flies in for the rebound but he stepped out of bounds going for it McFarland whos such a good rebounder especially as a guard top 15 in the AC in rebounds with seven per game but he couldnt keep his feet in hes one of those guys who you expect to make hustle plays for you like that he does not have a rebound today thats probably a sign of some of the symptoms that are plaguing BC in this ball game dartmouths also just hasnt missed that much here lately wide open again Brandon Mitchell day wide open I mean again if youre going to concede a shot thats a guy youd concede it to but he makes him pay and darmouth just hasnt really missed much today to your point 13 threepointers for the Dartmouth big green Chaz Kelly cant find Music it dartman is shooting 50 from the floor this half five of nine from three theyve made 13 for the game and they are on the precipice of a special Friday afternoon points in the second half it is 216 Dart since that point and the Big Green getting injections of life from everybody on the floor Haskins couple deep threes Williams and Mitchell day guys who had not shot the three well this year getting into the mix as well seemingly dmouth cannot miss from the outside and Austin college going to have to do a little bit better job closing out putting just a little bit more pressure on those Shooters without exposing themselves to giving up those easy driving Applause Music LS it is 63 55 this is the largest lead of the game for Dartmouth just over 11 minutes to go the Eagles coming in winning five straight off of a real quality win on Tuesday against Boise State a quad one win and Dartmouth has given everything the Eagles can handle and a lot more in fact eight points more right now on this Friday fourth game of the week for Boston College and that was just going to be a big part of the recipe to an upset right for Darth is just trying to take advantage and keep fighting and force Boston College to exert a lot of energy because you dont know how much get is in the tank right Applause now and the Eagles have not been able to find the defensive touch at times today theyve still been okay offensively theyre actually out shooting Dartmouth from the floor but obviously significant fewer threes and just 30 though 31 in the second half thats right and so even that has dramatically dropped off here thats been this last stretch yeah feels like this is going to be their best opportunity here is continue to attack continue to just try to use your size use your muscle and get to the free throw line and the fact that Dartmouth is now in the bonus here the rest of the way so Boston College has a lot of free throws coming can they make them down the stretch of this game they need to badly and McFarland makes the first that last foul was on Merl and there is H Haskins back in five of eight from three today five rebounds as well 15 points for Kade H Haskins the senior kind of an amazing story he played a lot as a sophomore played more as a sophomore 22 minutes per game did not play a ton last year just 10 games and had only five threepoint attemps only nine points total yep but he has been a man tonight my goodness he does get a couple back and now a turnover beetle to run it out Josh Beetle to the bucket so 12 for Beetle after 13 against Boise on Applause Music Tuesday VC does trim the lead quite a bit in that sequence Merle gets inside another wide open three goes I mean these are wide open and credit Dartmouth for knocking them down yeah I mean vennings dropping off here again Mitchell day not a guy who you would put on The Scouting Report as a knockdown shooter but thats the plan for darmouth if youre open Let it Fly and theyre all going in right now 6659 under 10 to go Donald hand is short from three just hasnt been his day the Eagles are 0 for six from behind The Arc in the second half Mitchell D made a couple of big ones here in this second half little bump there Cornish keeps the dribble seven to shoot Cornish inside got the Lan counted and a foul and you see the defensive issues that BC continues to have in these screen and rolls this time Cornish elects to keep it and venning essentially screens out Beetle watch here the contact venning just cuts off Beetle there one sh the big corish and allows Cornish to get to the Music Applause basket it is a 10point Dartmouth lead Cornish has 11 after that made free throw Beetle catches McFarland for three that was way off yeah youre not going to get 10 points back at once Vibes are way off for the maroon and gold right now yeah just got to continue to stick to the game plan and attack this is a reach on Applause venning Applause Farland and I know the threepointer has been a a weapon for Boston College for most of the year but again just feels like their their better path to success is to continue to go inside yeah and the first half it was the defense this half its been both ends and its hard not to be demoralized but how many shots dartman just continued to make Mitchell day inside couldnt finish then nearly got it back but it does go out of bounds off the Junior from St Applause Louis ni job by Elijah strong just staying solid and by the way remember BC just got back within four and Dartmouth six points in a row again to take this lead to where it is right now Beetle inside for strong he spins left hand got it and a foul boy did BC need that they need somebody to give them a lift thats also four on Mitchell day H Haskins trying to sell the charge there and Mitchell day just needs to sort of give up at that point or you know at least concede the shot you youve got a player spinning taking a jump H its hard to do in real time but hes so valuable being on the Music floor its an interesting contrast cuz now you bring Christensen back in who youd argue is probably a better outside shooter than Mitchell day and again BC has to go with this slightly smaller lineup and hope that strong can have a little better success in these screen and roll spots we have not seen Jaden Hastings back in the second half you saw him give up a couple buckets on that pick and pop play they were attacking vening with it before he was brought back out so now its up to strong to try to handle that scenario and all of Elijah Strongs points have come in this second half eight of them for Boston College 6962 to the corner Christensen another open look for three that time it doesnt go thats one youll live with if your Boston College defensively under eight minutes to go at kti Forum Dion Brown got it inside for strongs got the size Advantage lost his footing and tries the foul free throws for Elijah strong when we come back dartman given Bost College quite a fight this afternoon there as they have the lead 6962 glass half empty is that situation right there after cornage just picked up his fourth foul yeah and Mitchell obviously is a huge impact loss as well not just for the fact that hes put in 10 points which is above his average hes knocked down threes which is something he hasnt done all year but hes also your best rim protector and youve seen even with this slightly smaller lineup on the floor for Boston College Eliza strong can catch inside and hes basically done whatever hes wanted the last couple trips hes also helped with the fact that offensive rebounds has been a complete nonfactor in this game strong though this is kind of one of those games here now okay didnt have much in the first half but hes grinding his way nine points now all in this second half when Boston College has been in desperate need of a spark he has 10 now 6964 lets see if BC ratchets up the pressure a bit the half cour trap good catch by Williams he decides to take the shot and it goes holy cow Jaden Williams has 18 and they are all from behind the ark wow its been that kind of day for the Big Green every time it feels like the eagles maybe have a way back in Dartmouth eliminates it question whether that was tipped or not answer for now is no yeah I dont think there was a tip there I mean if this goes might be one of those days just throwing Haymaker after Haymaker that was tipped out of bounds it will stay here 16 on the timer Dartmouth is 15 for 27 from three and again you have to credit the Big Green for sticking to this plan right I mean its one thing to say hey anytime we have a three were going to shoot it its another thing when you actually get out on the floor to keep executing it another one not this time and boy H Haskins actually got the full touch on that offensive rebound yeah he won the jump Ball battle he did knock it out of bounds well the last time Dartmouth has been in this territory in terms of three points made was November of 2021 it was the game after they played here against Boston College they went down to Georgetown and beat the Hoya behind 16 threepoint shots we 16 of 38 that day today they are 15 of 28 Josh beetles had some big moments a new season high with 14 following up his 13 that he had against Boise yeah career high for him as well just continues to grow into this role theres another drive and a kick to the corner and an extra pass for Merl who scores great ball movements and how about Merl not shying away waiting for contact that never came good strong take all the way to the rim twoman game here with Beetle and strong 6 minutes to go Dartmouth lead 7466 strong inside count it and a Applause foul like this like the twoman game Beetle and strong working well off one another finds the angle uses that soft touch but how about Merle and very impressed with his ability to you know for an undersized guy obviously he is does not shy away from the physical battles and hes won a couple tough rebounds and a tough layup there strong cant hit the free throw but hes been crucial in this second half this is the end that matters right now for BC you have to find a way to get stops darthmouth 50 from the floor 7even of 13 in this second half from behind the arc 7468 a mson falling away way Applause no strong spins to the corner for Deon Brown and it does not go but McFarland with a big offensive rebound and he draws the foul we told you the offensive rebounds have not been a factor today darts done a really good job and well time for McFarland to get one there yeah just got inside position on Williams and guess what he draws another fourth foul this time its Williams so McFarland gets the first one and David mofin will use the timeout 523 to go here in the second half Dartmouth trying to hang on and pull off a huge upset in KY Music Applause 11 Music the Music Music well this has turned into some game and BC has needed a spark in the second half and Elijah strong has been that guy well and hes doing what Boston College needs to get back in this game hes just taking the ball to the rim hes using his size hes drawing contact and he is doing his best to to almost pull BC back into this game singlehandedly he has been the emotional leader of this team you just see it as soon as you watch him on the floor he was so big in that game a couple of weeks ago against Temple so its 7469 after McFarland missed the second out of the Dartmouth timeout Cornish got space and no good 15 threepointers today for Dartmouth has been the difference in this game theyre shooting 54 from three roll of the dice here for Dave mlin both guys with four fouls Cornish and Mitchell D are on the floor right now yeah its interesting both guys with four in for BC Benning with three fouls we have not seen in a little bit that shot is no good for BC and theni hand y Williams on the sideline you bring up vening which is a good point I almost wonder if thats as much for defense as anything else because remember before he went to the bench darmouth was getting open looks from three off of those pick and pop plays and you know there was some miscommunication with Ving on a couple of those switches strong can he do it again he can how big has Elija strong been in the second half yeah just telling Mitchell day look Im coming at you youre either letting me all the way in or youre going to foul me one or the other 7471 Eagles trying to extend their longest winning streak in almost 7 years the Haskin got it saw it coming just a little stumble by hand on the switch and that half second is all H Haskins needs six for nine from Applause Music three 7771 going to give strong got the double but he slips through it strong again boy its dartman threes against strong right now but the twos arent going to beat the threes so the eagles need a stop at some point here with 332 to go Applause Music Applause way outside he did it Ryan carnish you got to be kidding 17 threepointers for Dartmouth well they are just unconscious right now from the outside and the bench is up and loving it BC had been as close as theyve been in quite a while in this second half and backto back huge threes for Dartmouth its 80 to 73 with under three to go hands got to find something right hand and its a foul called with 249 to go the dmouth big green 17 of 30 from three today 2 49 away from a huge upset Music Music Music he well this has been quite an afternoon as the Dartmouth big green keep Landing punch for punch and how about those two H Haskins and Williams who have not attempted anything but threes and they have made 11 of them between the two of them over 60 combined and its two different stories right H Haskins youve seen it already this year granted it was against a different opponent in Vermont on state L Len and Sacred Heart early on shot had been off recently but you know hes a shooter Jaden Williams was four of 13 so hed only taken 13 threes he only hit four of them he I think is very a totally different case in terms of an X Factor for Dart today Han makes one of two the number one free throw shooter in the ACC this year 80 to 74 with 240 to go Dartmouth time to win their first game against Boston College in 36 Applause years Cornish wants it he just made the last one now he drives thats been the story of the day as much as the threes have stood out in 17 of them dartmouths beating BC everywhere on those cuts and its prevented them from guarding the three the way they want to Brown on the drive that goes four points for Dion Brown just his second field goal and feel like thiss a time where BC just needed more of that earlier on still within shouting distance but they need a stop and this is where the clock plays in dartmouths favor they can bleed it down seeson high for points and Dartmouth outside of that first game Cornish again for to shoot strong that time stays with him he wanted a foul there Cornish trying to take it into the body but strong doing a good job making up the ground late but this is a match up darith is okay with right you know this is its its a tough match up for strong Hornish a little step quicker hes just looking for that get him off balance and then take it to the rim still some adjusting underneath 27 is is whats left on the timer and just for context by the way Eagles have made six of their last eight shots from the floor but dartman is just making big ones didnt quite have it that time not a bad idea just not enough time for that pretty smart defending by BC just flying at the shooter force one extra pass knowing that the time was going to run out the previous shot clock violations under review to get the clock correct so I think theyre not reviewing the hot clock per se but just making sure the overall number is where it needs to be at this point yeah I mean maybe tack on another half second put on the game clock so add 1 second worth noting you know dmouth really has not been in one of these this year 8176 against Sacred Heart that was relatively close game most of the way Boston College has been in a lot of these recently specifically the last two Beetle drives got it just Shrugged off Robinson there he extends his career high 16 points DC again with a little bit of token trap but again theyre going to let Dartmouth play it out 118 to go Mitchell day playing with four fouls Williams against Brown Williams blocked from behind good help from strong and dartmouths going to use another timeout here to draw something up with 13 seconds on the timer were back in 30 seconds Dartmouth up by four so David mofin drawing something up with 13 seconds remaining on The Possession and Dartmouth holding this 82 78 lead over Boston College trying to snap the Eagles five game win streak coming into play today the Big Green the story has been the threepoint shot 17 of them today including nine for 15 in this second half going to have to watch right again here off the inbounds play right maybe a a quick replace play with h Haskins and Mitchell day here over on the far side got to get it in they do quick three h Haskins no good thats a pretty good look again boy that is you are breathing a sigh of relief if youre ear Grant right now that was exactly what the big green wanted off that play final minute strong left hand short but a foul and again Elijah strong has been the guy in the second half for Boston College and just basic basketball right gets aane takes it amundson tries to draw a charge but Strongs already Airborne by the time I think he gets his feet Music set Elijah strong 16 points all of them in this second half and add another and it took a while for BC to get here right you know they tried vening a couple times Dartmouth kept getting defensive mismatches in its favor Eagles finally finding this smaller lineup with strong at the five thats has worked its been a slow crawl but theyre back they need one more stop twopoint game Mitchell day with strong playe close defense nice cut to the basket he got it what a drive by Brandon Mitchell Applause day he just beat his man Beetle on the other end counter p thrown and now Boston College uses that timeout oh what a big basket by Mitchel day I I have to say I like the idea from strong being aggressive looking to Paw that ball a nice finish by Mitchell day and well again beetle with that ball in his hands just feels like he can do that whenever he wants right strong tried to make it up in the end Mitchell day did a good job shielding the ball with the body using two hands all the way up to the basket so thats Now 26 of Boston colleges 38 points in this second half have come from Josh Beetle for Elijah Music strong and it just feels like it took a little while for BC to get to this point you wonder if they got here Midway Mark in the second half offense has been okay and boy theyve had a flare for the dramatic recently with F that was the gamewinner with 22 left in their very last game just a couple of days ago against Boise and then now looking at where this game is how big was this at the end of the first half by Beetle to make that three and his team is down by two and he and strong have been the two guys for Boston College Beetle who set a new career high against Boise with 13 on Tuesday has exceeded that with 18 today on eight of 10 from the floor look there are some guys you just want the ball in their hands when these moments come around and Beetle you know didnt necessarily have that opportunity at Clemson hes got that opportunity a couple times and he has risen to the occasion this Applause year question is will darmouth give him another opportunity to be a hero because they have have had so many big moments of their own Boston College has committed five fouls in this second half theout that they choose to go they dont have nearly the foul trouble that Dartmouth does on their side no you might just take one here just in case you have to go that route though play it out little trap on hins brings it across double team is there and they get the foul on BC and again thats one that they do have to give but now the shot clock resets so now you have to foul or no it resets to 20 okay sets to 20 so 268 overall to go Dartmouth does have one more timeout if they need it Boston College has two didnt know if the shot clock had gotten under 20 the first time around and Earls going to use another one here 30 time out with 268 remaining and theyll draw something up to defensively I think at this point its all about you know presumably Boston College is going to have some sort of trap on its just a matter of again the defensive communication and the recovery on the back end you you dont certainly dont want to give up an open layup or an open threepoint shot you want to be able to recover if you can try to force the turn over D done a pretty good job taking care of the basketball in the eight giveaways for Boston College its worth noting it is a 23 15 run since they fell down by 10 at 69 to 59 with 924 to Music go but do they have enough time to come all the way back goes back to could they have gotten to this group thats brought them back a little earlier maybe tough to say right youre trying a few different things BR Grant obviously going to groups that have gotten them stops in the past before that was really the big thing they just never got the stops soon enough to make up the ground they needed yeah theyve actually picked up their shooting here recently to come back in so all the way in the back court Dartmouth up by two corner double team is there 12 to shoot for Mitchell day and theres the Applause foul no problem on that foul for strong its his first but Dartmouth now will try to win this game at the free throw line one notable adjustment here for dmouth they just brought back in Merl part of this comeback has been Beetle yeah using his size against aminon Merles a much tougher matchup for Beetle there Brandon Mitchell day who is sixth in the ivy league in free throw percentage at 77 coming in hes played with four fouls for a while here remember two huge free throws and almost all of his points have come in the second half BC going quickly 8682 beetle tried to get it to Brown its taken away by cish he stole it clean and BC does not get a shot at it and again the defensive change for Dari is what made all the difference here beeta wants that quick step back three but Merle does a good job navigating the screen of strong forces Beetle to give it up Cornish was waiting and picked it off 994 to go Music I mean the amazing part of this game for cornish its felt like hes embodied the as much as the threes have been the story its not just the threes because of some of those drives he has 18 points tying his season High Dartmouth leads by six the Eagles do not have a threepointer in this second half they got to try one with strong it is no good Beetle puts it up quickly and is fouled with 22 to go Applause Romeo yeah I think to your point Eric you go back to that stretch end of the first half where o Grant said we did not close the first half well obviously the beatle three excluded but that was the strength stretch where Dartmouth was not getting its offense from behind the threepoint line but they were finding matchups that they liked going to the rim you know Cornish was a big part of that aminon got a couple baskets attacking the rim Merle had a couple layups and and that was the stretch where they were able to stay in it after going down seven points in that first half to keep in touch and they came out shooting like Gang Busters in the second half just need to get it in they do an absolute stunner at C deep
