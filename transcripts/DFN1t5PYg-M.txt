Chase Hunter Jaden Zachary and now the clock did not start when the ball was controlled by the Tigers there was a little bit of a collision and and as the ball went in the air and Chase Hunter and I think hes okay well hes actually limping a little bit Yeah meanwhile Clarence Armstrong with Kell Miller and Jeffrey Anderson or Jeffrey Clark rather an early visit to the table to make sure we got some all the mechanics going well so we need 2 seconds off the game clock there or four or four doesnt make any difference actually the shot clock doesnt start till somebody has possession so there should be more time on the shot clock than the game I think theyre saying Clemson had 2 seconds of possession 4 seconds total right so here we go chase Hunter all the way to the basket on the drive and quickly two nothing Tigers well obviously he wasnt hurt very badly on that Collision thats what the old Jim Brown move he limps back to the Huddle and then drives so two nothing lead Javon blackshire Jr handles the ball out front against Zachary Tigers no surprise opening a manto man sasoko tries to free blackshire who continues to have some tough shooting the perimeter for the Bears theres a turn and score and Andre sto yakovich is on the board lets go boys set it up shefflin with Wiggins tonight Chanty lost it on the drive and the tigers turn it Applause over so Cal will get the ball back on the Clemson giveaway and I cant hear Music you Doug Cory thanks very much we welcome you to Little John Coliseum in Clemson South Carolina youve only missed about 53 seconds weve got a Andre sto yakovich basket for the cow bears and we got a Chase Hunter Drive and score for the Clemson Tigers so were 22 and headed to the second minute of 40 here at Little John tonight Dan and black she black sheer just made that shot West I think hes going to be a key tonight and hes got to be able to get the ball to the basket and good Heavens Reeves just threw it in behind Zachary yep and he threw it to Brad Brownell who was open uh and was very surprised to get it Christian Reeves in the starting lineup tonight Victor lockin has been under the weather really since the end of the Stanford game on Wednesday he did not go through the morning workout here at Little John Coliseum but did come out in warm up tonight we dont know his status in terms of minutes or management well just have to play a wait and see game like you folks will tonight Petrus with five to shoot hell put it on the deck against shefflin fall away is too strong Reeves the backside rebound now how about that sheflin moving his feet and you know hes noted as an inside muscle guy but that was just great defense out on the perimeter Hunter working against Campbell Reeves I think stole a pass for shefflin now to Ian and heres Zachary at the top of the circle working on black sheer Reeves with a right hand and gets the bounce just the eigh field goal of the year for the Duke transfer rard sophomore Christian Reeds well that was an excellent entry inside and hes got to be able to make that shot Reus petritis for Campbell here is Soko the Michigan State transfer Black Shear off the window Reeves the rebound there Black Shear has been very aggressive with the shots here early in the game Wiggins on an entry for shefin double team coming Ian bounces out of traffic Hunter out front three ball good five for Chase Hunter and Clemson off to a good start thats just great ball movement and it all starts when shefflin somehow is able to get it out of there Zachary offering some backourt pressure and heres blacker to Applause work what a different night this could be for Christian Reeves Dan whos trying to get healthy for the first time in his career really as a Collegiate player six to shoot Black Shear almost traveled with it Soko with with Reeves defending jump shot No Good Hunter the rebound and in that respect Christian Reeves just has to do the little things right yes absolutely hes got to be S feet tall hes got to play defense on the inside hes got to make shots close to the basket Zachary on Jen at 16 ft front rim Miss kept Alive by Reeves petritis finally collects it for cow this is interesting West we have two very good offensive rebounding teams here tonight heres sto yakovich on a hard drive and score that is a tough matchup for Wiggins yep four for Andre stojakovich who is the third best scorer in the ACC at 191 Hunter heres sheflin against petrius Zachary Wheels around all the way against black sheir backs him down and scores nope spun out with the right hand and ball got rebounded hell ball will belong to cow we have played four minutes and two seconds of just the third team in what their 15th game tonight yes and that really helps your team your Chemistry if you have that kind of stability but again theyd like to get more out of Christian Reeves and his opportunity to show them that he can do more is very important for he him personally CS hit three of their first Music seven all of them have been in within the paint petritis the air force transfer DJ Campbell with Black Shear Soko and of course sto yakovich six to shoot Black Shear the right hand Runner shefflin the rebound Ian had it knocked away in the back court thatll be on Javon blackshire Applause Jr and Ian sheflin will put it in Applause play and we see some substitutions here is Jeremiah Wilkinson for the first time on the floor for the Golden Bears a young man from Metro Atlanta Powder Springs Georgia and Joseph A Joshua Ola Joseph is into the ball game for Cal he did not play in Wednesdays ball game at pit heres Hunter out of the shefin double team and Chase Hunters got seven Ian sheflin did such a great job just hanging on to the basketball waiting for somebody to come open this is Wilkinson whos been a very nice add to the Cal roster theyre only freshman this year sooko had it knocked away Reeves saved it on the turnover and Dylan Hunter sprits into the front court but Dylan Hunter is in the game to guard sto yakovich Wiggins is out Chase along two and Reeves the rebound and fouled on the play its going to be on sasoko bods First and the second on on the Golden Bears and Reeves continues to be very active on the inside youd like your big guy to be able to convert that one and get an and one but he does a great job he gets position right in front of sissoko doesnt allow the stronger guy to box him out I said the foul on Soko they actually taged Ola Joseph with his first it is still the second cow foul and Soko takes a seat and that is Lee dor the Vanderbilt transfer from Dallas coming onto the floor for Cal and Reeves hit them both four points for Christian Reeves Four Points couple of rebounds Good Start Dell Jones onto the floor for Clemson freshman from uh Baltimore Landover Maryland actually is seeing action Here For the First Time Ola Joseph blackshire now sto yakovich off the high weave p up over the top of Reeves is good boy Andre sto yakovich is fun to watch 11th best field goal shooter in the ACC hes got six of Cs eight and that was a tough shot yep Jones on an entry for Reeves lost it between the wickets and itll be a turnover on the Tigers and theres Mark Matson who turns 49 later this month from Walnut Creek California and who says Rivals cant be friends great Stanford player who now coaches at rival cow well and he is hes such a positive person and he has created a very positive atmosphere of cow sure has sto yakovich on the drive Reeves bothered it and theyre going to call Goal tending score the basket for Andre hes got eight on his fourth field goal and obviously this has been a problem early for Clemson they have yet to find somebody who can keep sto yakovich from getting into the lane now theres a couple of screens but he just has the great ability to find that lane and get to the basket so with Dort on the floor Brad Brownell brings miles Foster the 67 grad transfer from Illinois State out on the deck there goes Hunter to the basket he lost it on the way and Cal off the giveaway trailing one and sto yakovich the hot hand Dort backing down on Foster cant find it over the left shoulder 15 to shoot heres sto yakovich Foster trying to help now the mismatch over the top of Miles Foster in the rebound from behind sheflin to chase Hunter thats pretty good help defense by Dylan Hunter Jones thought about the pull up left side Dylan Hunter obliges and hits three ball from Dylan Hunter is his 12th of the year weve got a stoppage here and Clarence Armstrong has gone to the table and Miles Foster on the floor the transfer from Illinois State who started his college career Monmouth hes the one assigned now with Lee Dort out there playing the post for cow and we also get our first look heres Christian Tucker handling the ball for Cal and this is Wilkinson penetrating and hell get an an one opportunity Chris Jeremiah Wilkinson off the bounce pass right at the foul circle from Tucker and Fosters going to get hit with his first foul thatll be the first of the game on Clemson W that was a great change of Direction dribble in the middle of a crowd and this is what Wilkinson can do hes a powerfully bu young man drive the ball to the basket 79 free throw shooter is Jeremiah Wilkinson The lefthander Knocks it down the Bears Golden Bears are fourth in the ACC at 75 coming into Applause tonight onepoint lead for Applause Clemson Dylan Hunter for Ian sheflin a long three is good first points for sheflin Dan from behind the line well and you know sheflin if the lights go out here well be able to find him with those shoes itll probably blow in the dark Wilkinson tries to answer cannot Jones and the Tigers boy Cal got back nicely in transition defense Dylan Hunter on the drive in traffic now double team is there got knocked away and last Touch by the Tigers Clarence Armstrong said it hit the leg of the junior Dylan Applause Hunter Brad Brownell season number 15 here at Tiger toown alltime winning his coach at Clemson 443 career wins thats and hes not happy with the details even though his teams up four here Dan hes not happy with the turnovers thats four by the Tigers and this is a cal team that can really score you dont want to give them a lot of extra opportunity Campbell couldnt finish got his own rebound and the stick Back DJ Campbell whos from the 757 down in Tidewater Virginia on the board for Cal Jones a Fall Away rebound backside Wilkinson Cal can tie and Dort will miss the layup and then the ball got knocked away on the Campbell recovery and thatll get us to a timeout well Ian Chef ESPN w this has been very interesting so far Cal has 15 points one from the free throw line and everything else in the lane and theyre not doing it with back to the basket power theyre driving the ball through the Clemson defense and getting layups Music Ola Joseph working against Chanty Wiggins heres Christian Tucker the transfer from Texas San Antonio with six to shoot Campbell tees it up for the lead and zacker the Applause rebound tigers by two Wiggins thought about it Dort challenged a guy Dort size challeng you have to be able to drive by him and get to the goal Zachary working on Wilkinson now they skip it hot breeder in the corner Jones the rookie three spins in seventh three of the year for Dell Jones Clemson back to a fivepoint Advantage he is not a high percentage threepoint shooter fourth three of the half for Clemson Cal has missed all three of their tries here is Tucker seven to shoot and now Wilkinson back for Ola Joseph thatll Bound Away shefflin another rebound from Dort Zachary Cal offense is sort of stalled without sto yakovich in the game Jones right back for shefflin Dort there to body him up defensively shefflin going to work feeds Wiggins with a right hand nice pass by and sheflin and what a great job by seflin to feel the double team coming and then find the open man Zachary challenging Wilkinson in the back court where the game is changing speeds here a little bit in this first what 11 minutes Dan ma cow likes to get up and down and theyve been missing shots and thats giving Clemson an opportunity to get out and go dor backing in on shein left it short with the right hand Jones Jones runs through to collect and heres Clemson again trying to find an advantage uhoh Jones travel yep sure did thatll be turnover number five on the Tigers and with that sto yakovich sasoko and petritis return for Cal and Chase hunter gets Dell Jones in the Clemson lineup and heres Christian Reeves to give Ian shefflin a break about 90 seconds ahead of a under eight timeout well Cals offense really did get stagnant without sto yakovich and petrius yeah petrius at Air Force last year he led the team in scoring rebounding assists Steals and blocks five core guy huh how about that he and hiy breeder who both played at Air Force together on the floor now for their respective schools sasoko turning on reev with the right hand scores thats just power inside I mean Reeves played that about as well as you can play go lets goase fivepoint lead for Clemson hiy breeder out front heres Zachary a three first Miss of the night for the Tigers Second Chance off the high breeder rebound well Zachary does a lot of things but hes not a great threepoint shooter yep only 12 of 43 now on the year after the Miss there Hunter a rack on the dribble five to shoot for Chase against petrius crosses him up gets into traffic out of the corner Wiggins and the rebound on the inside position for sissoko give Music Applause Campbell is a Western Carolina transfer runner with a right hand goes and again West Cal continues to drive the ball to the basket and get into the lane and basically shoot layups now that wasnt an easy shot but again it was Point Blank Range threepoint lead for Clemson heres Reed Wiggins tries to beat Petri cant get through tend to shoot Music Applause and a timeout taken no timeout okay M West Conference have found their way to the ACC on a Saturday night thats where we are in this new world of basketball Dan Bonner absolutely Clemson with a threepoint lead but the Tigers have six first half turnovers and and Andre sto yakovich has been as good as advertised here early and hell fight for a shot and score and draw the foul that is 10 for sto yakovich and the foul is on Chase Hunter itll be his first its the second on the Tigers this is a terrific move by sto yakovich W he gets into the lane and hes got to change directions in a crowd and thats the first basket theyve made that he wasnt in the lane and a rare Miss at the line Dan hes 83 thats just his 15th Miss and 85 tries heres Hunter back for Reeves deflected out of there by sasoko tried to find Reeves inside theyll roll to the deck hell ball to be called itll stay with the tigers with 14 to shoot that that was a mishandled Thing by the Tigers right there because they didnt throw the lob High Enough and that allows Soko to get it and then he throws the next pass too low you know you got to hit him in the chest with that so Clemson going to take Reeves off the floor remember lockin under the weather and we dont know if at all hes going to try and play tonight you see the reev sits right down beside Victor shefflin comes back in Dan so Clemsons sizing down here and theyve had theyve been okay with that well they have been Hy Breer a three and it drops in tigers are dialing up from behind the line here they are now five of seven from three to start this ball game and the advantage back to four sto yakovich and blackshire just ahead of seven minutes to Applause play Zachary look at sto yakovich in the lane blocking call on hi breeder well send Andre to the line for a couple of free throws first on Jake Hy breeder third on the Tigers they they simply cant guard him hes able to get around he gets around Zachary Zachary tries to draw the foul and hide breeder never gets his feet set you know once you establish your position youre allowed to move to maintain that position but he never got in position free throw good by Andre of course a year ago played for the Cardinal of Stanford and their former head coach Jared H now sto yakovich was a freshman last year he had a good freshman season yep but his numbers were H are half that last year they were half of what they are this year he has made a tremendous leap yep Mark Matson was very candid talking about his work ethic his even said you know we gave him a few days off for the holidays and he didnt waste any time he maybe took a day and he was back for a workout at home of course hes the son of Pia sto yakovich who had a terrific NBA career here is Campbell on the drive and tapped home sto yakovich the follow and the game tied at 25 14 of Cs 25 belonged to Andre sto yakovich Zachary with 17 to shoot well C is not noted as a great defensive team one that forces a lot of turnovers but theyre staying in the game today because of Clemsons turnovers and thats what were talking about with chony Wiggins he has had a he had a tough time trying to match up with sakovich playing defense but if stovich is going to guard him he can take stovic down inside twopoint lead for the Tigers blacker shefflin switched off and now hes on Javon blackshire so theres a win somewhere for the Bears sasoko cant finish Tigers got away with one there Zachary switched just a little too early Hunter the shot fake Chase Baseline for the hammer nine for Hunter the good old shot fake Dan it always helps when you can follow that shot fake with a drive to the basket for a dunk lead back to four for Applause Clemson back inside sasoko the pass deflected by Clemson itll stay with Cal with nine to Applause shoot Hunter has established the fact that he can make that three and he just fakes and goes by nobody steps in to try to get in front of him but of course its hard to draw a charge in this day and age in college basketball on a move like that Campbell will put it in play to petritis eight to shoot heres sto yakovich against Chase Hunter this is a heck of a match up sheflin tries to help back for Rus petritis hell fire for three and hit petritis is seventh triple of the year his first points tonight well there you saw a different one shot fake that goes to goes for a three not a dunk California back to within one on their first three of the night o in the corner Zachary triple good 13th three of the year for Jaden Zachary his first basket Clemson has been really effective on the offense end when they havent turned it over back to a fourpoint lead blacker Clemson played over the top of the screen now sto yakovich with 12 to shoot skip for petrius how about another one from the left Line Drive is short they run down the loose ball theyll dive for it out of their Wiggins thats a break for the Tigers Wiggins didnt block out and petrius got the ball heres Chase Hunter against to yakovich now for sheflin to catch in strong move good Ian sheins got five and a timeout is taken by Mark Madson because all right Kevin thanks very much well I agree with Seth Brad is probably making that point hes probably not making it as calmly as Seth did now passner just early calling the whole thing though yeah I mean we still got I mean we dont anybody turn the game off Josh has already called it maybe he knows something we dont AH mean expecting Alvarado to run out here with Cal at some point maybe that helps him out right mismatch inside Dylan Hunter is looking for help yep and Wilkinson handling a rock out in the midcourt area Jeremiah on the run and got it off the window young man plays with a lot of confidence hes got five well now 24 of their 30 points have been classified as points in the paint they continue to get the ball to the basket Chase Hunter trying to get it to shefflin with sto yakovich defending and Andre knocked it away but touched it last Dan two your point Cal is playing the game Inside Out offensively here in this first half which is counter to what Mark matsons teams have done for the most part during the year well but one of the other things thats interesting is because theyre getting all those baskets on drives to the the goal they only have one assist in this game yep Hunter thought about pulling the trigger over the sheflin screen he picked up his dribble a little too early heres sheflin hard drive against Dort Fall Away bounced away blacker the rebound heres Cal down four under three to go first Music half see Black Shear did not do a very good job finding the mismatch inside Dort spinning travel Lee didnt like it but facts are facts there but the thing that he has to be really frustrated about is he had Zachary posted up down low and black had every opportunity to throw him the ball and one of the things that blacker has done tonight he has pounded that ball on the floor an awful lot theyve got to move the ball a little bit better y Lee Dort 610 245 out of Dallas he and sok Applause could see time together tonight on the floor heres Jones who gave Brownell some serious minutes earlier in this Frame Zachary trying to beat petritis Feed shefflin for the dunk seven for the chef on his third field goal he just has a way of stepping into the open spot sixpoint lead just ahead of two minutes to go Tigers have hit six of their last seven Applause Wilkinson nine to shoot for Music Applause blackshire Dylan Hunter trying to help and with 29 to shoot well get a foul called on Jaden Zachary itll be his first thats four heres another look at the shefflin play well you get ball movement and then that allows a guy to drive into the lane and he draws all the defense and sheflin just has a way of finding the open spot making himself available and then hes so strong on the interior laer off the Baseline here Music Wilkinson wrap around for petrius Reus working against Chase Hunter now heres sto yakovich off the Baseline tapped alive kept around finally Hunter out of there with him Dell Jones will leave it for Chase and he had it poked away petrius the foul first on the Junior from Arlington Texas itll be the third on cow that was sort of a dangerous pass attempt by Clemson there because youre driving in youre turning around youre throwing it back toward the cow basket and if somebodys alert and petritis very nearly was thats an easy basket on the other end Music inside the final 90 seconds and a sixpoint lead for Clemson its been a very entertaining first half sure has Jones will launch a long three thats good Dell Jones only had six threes in his first 14 college games Dan hes got two tonight but and for somebody whos coming in shooting 28 hes two for three largest lead of the night Clemsons got 12 assists on 15 field goals in this first half blacker back for Wilkinson hell launch an answer Jeremiah Wilkinson now has eight in this first Applause half and its a sixpoint game Mark Matson he was kind of hiding the headlines on Wilkinson he said now hes fearless and has no problem playing on the stage oh hes all that now for a freshman plays really good going to the basket and he just showed you he can make it three very confident young man a 10 seconds differential as we wind down this first half sixpoint lead Dylan Hunter against Dort skip for Zachary hell launch bounds away picked up Jones at the horn and its finally recovered inside shefflin Couldnt score petritis is fouled coming through the back court Jones had I mean he got that rebound with nine seconds left and put it right back up and I mean that was a contested shot he did not have to shoot it I I think that he felt like the shot the clock was running out so Jones commits the foul its five on Clemson 23 left to go petrius will put it in play right in front of us thats the other thing West we got 23 seconds left in the first half and nobodys gotten into the one and one thats right yep in fact there have only been eight total fouls called here Wiggins to defend the inbound theres sto yakovich the catch falling into the seats he made it oh my goodness what a first half for Andre sto yakovich its also a matter of trying to keep them away from the basket so lockin gets the call and heres blackshire with Campbell Soko petrius and of course sto yakovich 16 to shoot and Soko against Lockett sto yakovich trying to get through traffic bounce pass and Campbell Fall Away rolls in DJ Campbell hes got six Bears to within one call has done a really nice job hanging in there West yep I mean Clemson shot 58 from the field made Seven threes and they were only up three at halftime locken tried to hit Hunter now finds him with 12 to shoot Chase for Zachary right corner Wiggins at three Chanty Wiggins now with seven thats his first three of the night right back to a fourpoint lead for the Tigers sto yakovich whos got six games of 20 or more this year already with 17 at the break tend to shoot blackshire pushes up a two and it wont go knocked around and finally Zachary with it couldnt get it to Hunter through traffic Jaden will go all the way to the basket and score himself wow that was interesting I mean lock was locking was stand all alone standing underneath the basket and Zachary used him as a shield heres blacker penetrating again and were going to get a whistle and a foul Clarence Armstrong who works tonight with Jeffrey Clark and Kell Miller will tag Zachary with his second and the first on the Tigers Victor lockin has been an important ad here and because nobodys going to replace PJ Hall but lockens done a terrific job defensively and kind of adding to the chemistry of this Clemson team well and he was sick when he played against Stanford and hes sicker now because he didnt play in the first half but hes given it a go yep pus and the Bears Trail six Rus all the way in couldnt finish it locken tried to keep it alive and patrus stepped on the end line as he battled Wiggins for it very early in the second half Wes but Clemson has been a much better done a much better job here contesting those drives into the lane theres been more traffic and more bodies in there I mean how many times have you watched the Clemson game here in Little John where they committed so few files the opposition didnt get into the one and one in the first half shefflin Hunter lost the dribble over there in front of Campbell its a turnover for Clemson itll be their eighth of the game first of the half sto yakovich right back to work hes got 19 now and every time Clemson has turned it over it seems like the Golden Bears have made him pay yep Hunter working against Campbell back to a fourpoint lead heres sheflin over petritis and it rattled out sooko clears go and were going to get a moving screen I believe oh its going to be on locket itll be the first on locket the second on Clemson I wrote down a couple things Mark Madson said to us today Dan that I think are are interesting one he talked about sharing the ball right offensively and theres a replay of the foul called on lock just pushed him yep he talked about sharing the basketball which Cal has not done much of tonight in the sense of assist to M baskets only three of them blackshire with six to shoot into sasoko turns and squares too strong locking the recovery and thats why lockens in the game thats a tougher shot over lockin Cal on the season their assist numbers are very low yep heres Wiggins into traffic jump shot from there good and Chanty Wiggins nows got nine in the ball game hes got five here in the second half to lead the Tigers sixpoint lead again well sasoko is trying to guard Wiggins and thats the way you put pressure on sasoko you or on sto yakovich Zachary knocked it away you make him play defense blackshire Campbell through traffic lost it sto yakovich cleared it up and scores now hes got 21 his ninth field goal seventh Game of the Year with 20 or more for Andre sto yakovich hes one of those guys the ball just seems to find it yep he is a gifted score but he is a really really talented basketball player well hes a very good Defender Mark Madison said he might be their best on ball Defender theres lock in for Wiggins double team skip it for sheflin hell take off Baseline and score well committing arer right yeah theyre using that mismatch with Wiggins against stovic and they had to bring a double team and because they brought a double team that opened up the lane for the Tigers back to a sixpoint Advantage for Clemson blacker in traffic got it out to petrius who shoots for three and blackshire the rebound and scores on just a little push shot on the Baseline four for Javon blackshire young man from Oakland who started his college career Grand Canyon playing for the anal opes out of the corner Wiggins another one lock in fouled sasoko went over the back first on motty on the back end of their first of four East Coast trips this year Trails by four here as we get started with the tiger Applause possession Hunter out front three back rim bounds away Dort whos back on the floor during the timeout for the Bears gets the rebound well not only is it their first of four trips but on this trip they played two of the really best teams in the league out of the corner three ball from blacker no good Pat tritis along rebound and this is Wilkinson trying to answer third try Zachary the rebound come lets go J tigers by four Jaden all the way down and will draw the foul couple of free throw throws coming for Clemson which will be their second free throws of the night and Andre sto yakovich has been the story tonight Dan to this effect well that those pretty impressive numbers yep he just he just plays the game so smoothly y he does and heres Zachary 88 on the year two shots hes got five in the ball game that was great recog by Zachary he saw locken inside screening off the Defenders and even though he wasnt able to score the basket because the Defenders fought by to create a foul locking I mean if hes done nothing else hes contested on defense and hes created a couple lanes for Drive second one good for Zachary so hes got seven in the ball game both Dylan and Chase Hunter on the floor with Zachary shefflin and Victor Lockett dork plays the post for the Bears with sto Wilkinson Ola Joseph has checked in to join blackshire on the floor for Coach Music Madson now heres sto yakovich with seven to shoot lost the handle on it and off his leg out of bounds says Clarence Armstrong now Mark Madson is not happy at all about that development get over it well this is a great job by locken to tip the ball hes coming there with the double team and it did look like that went right off the thigh of sto yakovich Clarence Armstrong pretty good look at it saw it roll off the leg and itll go to the Tigers heres Applause Hunter locking working against Dort Dylan Hunter looking for a path and a foul on Jeremiah Wilkinson was Off to the Races if the whistle wasnt blown young man who played at the skill factory a year ago out of mckr and Atlanta his first third on the Golden Bears well Hunter trying to get it inside to sheflin it was just good pressure Hunter couldnt find it hes lucky he didnt lose that ball yeah locking on the inbounds right back for Zachary Boy The Golden Bears have tightened it up defensively heres lockin feeds shefflin up strong for the dunk boy what a nice pass by Victor lockin in traffic what a great job by lockin to get stopped on the drive down the lane boy Cs been every bit to the challenge in their first visit to Little John colise Boy they sure have and Wes what about the days when the ACC didnt even have nine teams in the league those would be called the boner days of play Ola Joseph will put it in play tiger show a little pressure here yeah they do but theyve done two things here in the early in the second half theyve only turned the ball over once and they have kept Cal out of the lane the Freshman Wilkinson handling the basketball out front here against Jaden Zachary we really like Wilson sure do powerful looking kid blackshire thought about it now pulls the trigger on the three and its good Javon blacker who has really been fighting it in terms of his shooting knocks down a critical three here and Cal to within five almost 7 Minutes gone in the second half locking trying to stay out of a double team Zachary in the corner and a whistle and a foul called there Jeffrey Music Applause Clark will put Ola Joseph with his second fourth on the Bears well Hunter just doesnt get close enough to him and and Black Shear has shown the tendency in this game to drive the ball to the basket and so Hunter was giving him some room and thats why he was able to convert the three Andre sto yakovich out of the ball game here on a Clemson possession Zachary and he is fouled by blacker trying to get it to Dylan Hunter Cal trying to turn up the defensive intensity but theyre fouling and so thats a thats a dangerous thing thats now five well we know what the risk is wheres the reward turnovers right well you try to get the turnovers and like as I say Clemson has held on to the ball pretty well here so far in the second half Zachary attacking on the bounce lkin heres Chase Hunter with six to shoot right back to Victor tried to get to the basket and theres the giveway by the Tigers thats a tough pass Campbell for Wilkinson Tred to take it by lockin and hell commit the foul itll be the second on Victor third on Clemson and with that Mark Batsons team will put it in play from over near the Cal bench Ive been really impressed with the the energy that Cal plays with I mean theyve been very aggressive the entire game theres a takeaway heres Chase Hunter for the dunk 11 now for Hunter back to a sevenpoint game and a foul on Chase of Dylan hunter in the back court thatll be the first on Dylan the younger of the brothers fourth on Clemson hell come out of the lineup Dell Jones who Dan I thought gave Brad Brownell some nice minutes in the first half comes in played almost eight minutes at six Music points and its a sevenpoint Clemson lead well that foul was what you call horn play you do something like that in the horn sounds and you come out of the game Ola Joseph against shefin too strong in the Applause rebound shefflin working against Ola Joseph now Zachary takes off around Wilkinson and I think Jeremiah committed a foul on the reach after he had been beaten on the dribble four and then the Golden Bears welcome Virginia Tech to hos Pavilion thatll be all available for you on acc Network and of course the ESPN apppp and the stars are out tonight Dylan hunter or chase Hunter rather with 11 and boy Andre sto yakovich has been terrific four in the second half hes got his seventh game of the year of 20 or more for the Bears out of the timeout shefflin to catch fou and one 13 now for the chef and I think DJ Campbell was in no mans land down there boner wow he got in trouble they have the screen they have a screen and so now hes mismatched inside and lock locken again doing a great job finding his teammate on the interior and its not like locken has scored a lot of points but Wes he has been a factor in this second half and the chef hats are out again tonight and that rims out and a foul going to be called here Kell milliner going to get Chase Hunter for the the push second on Chase five on Clemson by the way the foul a moment ago on Campbell was seven now on cow so one and one for the next couple of fouls Dan but a lot of time 11 and A2 minutes to go for the tiger team thats second best in the ACC at the Music strike heres Wilkinson nice ball screen sasoko did a great job handling the ball screen look at Wilkinson go to the basket and draw the foul I think its another one on Chase Hunter no its on Victor Lockett third all in the half on lock at six now this is a perfect example of what Wilkinson brings look at this Wes he changes hands changes directions down in the lane and theres just nothing you can do to stop that guy so the foul a moment ago was on Zachary the foul before that was on Hunter so Zachary has three Chase Hunter has two lockin still with two as Wilkinson missed the front Applause end and the second one good nine for Wilkinson second free throw well see how Zachary going to the bench affects the Tigers I think hes been a significant key to their defense on the ball tonight and puts Jones on the ball block for a few minutes here eightpoint lead for Clemson lock him was open they couldnt find him oh Dylan Hunter will slash scoop and score five for Hunter boys this second half its been a reversal roll reversal because Clemsons the team thats getting into the lane and scoring the points in the pain High weave again employed by madsons team petritis spins forced it up right hand missed everything and sasoko lost the rebound battle to Jones good hustle play by The Freshman what a great hustle play by Jones shefflin against Campbell double team coming out of the corner Dylan Hunter nope and the rebound for DJ Campbell didnt look to me like he caught that ball cleanly Wes Campbell streaks to the basket and it got rejected by lockin Victor trying to fire up a good crowd here at Little John on Saturday night its a 10point lead its the largest to the night for the Tigers remember now lockin did not play in the first half Clemson did not have that factor yeah and thats his first block but I think I think hes disrupted more than that heres a cut and they threw it away and heres Chase h hter open floor petrius to beat and he will with the Applause dunk 13 for Chase Hunter his two second half field goals are fast break slams Clemson defense has really stepped it up here in the second half 12point game sto yakovich on the drive and draws the foul Jeffrey Clark out from underneath its on lockin Victor lockin by the way you see the black eye we told you about the illness hes got a black eye that also somehow or another developed during the Stanford game he walked into the basketball office yesterday and Brad Brownell greeted him with how you doing Gladiator free throw by stojakovich is good well that was that was one tough performance against Stanford he giving you another one here in the second half sure is tonight Andres got 22 make it Applause 23 four out of five at the line tonight is STO yakovich hes nine of 11 from the floor Zachary in the foul trouble that Dan mentioned so that means Jones plays some minutes and boy sheins coming to life here in the second half 15 now for Ian and that now means in this half Wes Clemson has outscored Cal it points in the paint 182 Wilkinson on the drop blocked by lockin theres Sheffer Dylan Hunter back for a deep three from Chase sasoko the rebound and if youre count its hard to score close to the basket if theres a big guy in there blocking shots under nine to go Campbell locking went to the deck and the hell ball is going to go to the Tigers Victor locken doesnt feel great for that matter doesnt look very good either but tell you what leaving it on the floor tonight for the Tigers heres this senior transfer from an Nappa in Russia well and Wes he is a big guy obviously but hes much more mobile than you might think when you just look at him that time there was a guard with the basketball he knocked it away went down and creaded the held ball I mean hes a good passer he can shoot the three a little bit Applause Jones out front heres locking with Soko there Chase Hunter on a reroute oh uhoh an Up and Under Euro and Hunters got Applause 15 Mark madsons team now Dan maybe in a bit of a danger zone trailing 14 they going to get locking again and locking to foul that is four on locking here in the second half with 806 to play Chase Hunter just makes a great move Soko cant get over there and he steps right by petritis so locking now on a third foul okay three foul yep so hell stay on the floor with 806 to go sto yakovich the free throw good cannot begin to tell you how impressed I am seeing Andre sto yakovich live here tonight Dan and checks out chy Wiggins back into the Clemson lineup Clemson with a little bit smaller lineup you know when lockin and cheffin are both playing at the same time that really creates some M mismatch problems sto yakovich is season high is 31 against Northwestern State well again he just he seems like a complete basketball player never gets Music rattled tiger lead it does cous Jones against petrius with tend to shoot Dell off the bounce and travel rare turnover here in the second half for Clemson who had more than their fair share ining opening 20 minutes 12point lead Cal team and you know who hadnt forgotten the call on the n one Terrell McIntyre yeah he said they got robbed yep he said man my college career comes down to a tough call but Cal won 6160 they played two years ago in dtin Florida Clemson won 6759 that day Chase Hunter had 14 points for Brad Brown Ls team and theres sto yakovich whos on fire here tonight for Cal who adds another field goal and now hes got 27 and the tiger lead is 10 with seven to go and thats steal by petritis Reedus to the basket hell draw the chase Hunter foul which will be his third stovich does such a great job moving with the ball and moving without the ball a nice screen down on the inside gets him open and thats a rarity today a cow basket thats an assisted basket Reus at the line the first one is no good Applause Dan you mentioned Air Force and a couple of years ago he got off to a great start in the Mountain West right top freshman score in that league for the Falcons a year ago he averaged right at about 16 a game hes got four here tonight comes in averaging eight for madsons Bears I want ninepoint lead just ahead of seven to go for the Tigers who are trying to get to 40 in the ACC Music Hunter Dylan into traffic lost it now to Chanty Wiggins with 10 to shoot heres Wiggins a pullup two thats good you know he looks really good with that pullup midrange jump shot 11 for Chanty Wiggins he goes into double figures the lead 11 for Clemson back door cut and its blocked Away by Chase Hunter kick out for blackshire and the long rebound funnel by Dylan Hunter through traffic well thats really the first time Clemson has had any sort of an answer for sto yakovich tonight at all Zachary had it deflected away itll stay with the tigers with 20 to Applause shoot and weve talked about Wiggins and how Brad Brownell really encourages him in the midrange game thats a good looking shot right there and heres stokovich it looks like hes wide open again but really nice job by Hunter to not give up on the play inbounds for Dylan Hunter heres Chase Breaks by everybody and sets it down three dunks for Chase Hunter here in the second half and the third the most emphatic well that was through traffic hes got 17 sasoko a kick out but triss three misses Scramble for the loose ball Wilkinson back and scores Jeremiah Wilkinson with 11 Music now arepa Boer 6857 ball Music game Zachary working against Wilkinson heres Wiggins a reroute on petritis foul line jumper good for Chanty Wiggins he has done a great job using his size to get into the midrange and then just jumps up over his opponent Danny had 17 on Wednesday hes got 13 here tonight and the lead back to 13 and a three ball from blackshire out front eight and the half double figures now for Javon blackshire Jr and hes knocked down a couple of Threes West back to a 10point game with 445 to go Dylan Hunter driving on blackshire sheflin in traffic and one Ian nows got 10 and a half and a chance for 11 after a foul called on sasoko Clemson is now 15 of 20 shooting the ball in the second half and of course you shoot a high percentage when to shoot shots like this just right through traffic and this is a situation where shefflin catches the ball and he does a great job not dribbling if he dribbles that ball he loses it but because he doesnt dribble hes able to rest it out of the hands of the cow Defenders and get a threepoint play and the free throw for Ian heres first of the Applause night and sheflin having quite an impact here in the second half hes got 11 and a half 18 and the ball game its been a very impressive offensive performance for the Tigers yep Wilkinson sasoko had it blocked by lockin and a foul is called that is four on lockin now with 419 to Applause play and thats 10 on the Tigers well lockin has been a factor on the inside and he gets that foul West because he swings that arm down and that looks like a foul whether there was actually a lot of contact there I dont know but it looks like he swung his arm down and actually got his hand caught in the net I dont know that he ever made contact with sasoko but on an inside play like that when you swing your arm down the referees going to call that a foul every time yep so lockin heads to the Clemson bench dont let the line score fool you no points four fouls you wouldnt think hes contributed much tonight hes been a big piece of this second half for Brad Brownell I think and I think the main impact he had was on the defensive end to start with and then the fact that he was playing in the second half really created some matchup problems because Cal didnt go with two big guys they were trying to guard sheflin with a smaller guy and that got the Clemson offense goal sheflin foul from behind thats petritis thats his second ninth foul of the game on C chlin is a guy who I mean he just knows where to go he knows where the right spot is he always seems to know what his team needs and hes able to produce it free throw is good our visit with Brad Brownell today was interesting because were talking about chemistry pieces in any basketball team and hes done such a great job of building Clemson Dan to now the chemistry paches pieces shift and when they shift the player involved in that shift to take on a bigger role this year Ian shefflin and when they take on the bigger role they have to embrace that yes and in Ian sheins case I give him a lot of credit he was a great piece with Hunter Tyson and PJ Hall and last year with PJ Hall this is he and Chase Hunters basketball team yes these theyre both guys who could be like secondary guys but you know and chefin has such a reputation as an offensive rebound what BR Brown up tell us theres usually two or three guys blocking him out right and hes got five rebounds tonight and Clemsons got a 15point lead again theres sto yakovich goodness what a move and score that is and Andre sto yakovich has got 29 hes two off his season High 31 13point game under four to go Wiggins quickly for shef a kick out for Dylan or chase Hunter rather and now heres Zachary a three thatll spin out Wiggins will give Clemson a second chance back with a right hand and sasoko pulled it off 318 to go now at Little John we can short armed that one a little bit theres sto yakovich on the drive thats going to be a block on Zachary I think nope and well get a foul called on the Tigers free throws two shots of them stovic is still down and its on Dylan Hunter by the way its a second foul on him and sto yakovich still down bar o00 Monday night on ESPN and ESPN Deportes and ESPN plus well and West one of the big reasons for this turnaround in the second half look in the first half Cal outscored Clemson 244 points in the paint in the second half a huge turnaround its Clemson scoring into in the in the lane 26 to8 sto yakovich has got 30 one off of his season high he had 31 against Northwestern State back on December the 14th misses the next one and Wiggins will run down the rebound that was also his career high but hes a point away now Applause with better than three to play here youve said it a couple times West sakovich is a really impressive player yep and hes so good with the basketball he just seems to be able to find those creases and then somehow get his get in there 10 to shoot and heres Chase Hunter five to shoot for Chase Wiggins has got to get it on the glass and does I know Wiggins likes to stand outside and shoot threes but he has shown me something in the lane this SE evening and the Tigers did that with the clock running down on the shot sto yakovich against Chase Applause Hunter heres blackshire launching and hitting well Javon blackers got three threes in the second half hes got 13 in the game and may have found his shooting stroke here on the second game of the road trip for the Bears just ahead of two minutes to go its an 11point Clemson lead and brown ells team going to work some clock here pretty good match up with stojakovich and Chase Applause Hunter Dylan Hunter back rim miss shefflin the rebound and Ian is fouled on the play by petritis Reedus Reaching Across trying to get the steel commits the foul itll be his third it is a very infrequent occasion when the referee is going to allow somebody to come and just grab the ball out of the hands of a big guy like that without calling a foul well step aside time out for the Golden Bears here with 143 to go intensity in the second half and I thought a lot of that had to do with locking Y and they started going inside more in the second half and I thought a lot of that had to do with locking because playing shefflin and locking at the same time it forced Stanford into some mismatch situations which they had a hard time handling sheins got 20 and the first of the two good this is his fourth 20po effort of his career tonight and the second one rattles out for it and with just inside of 100 seconds to go here blacker and the Golden Bears will have to be pretty quick and that ball got knocked over the end line out of Applause bounds shefflin had 23 in the loss at South Carolina so hes closing in on his season and career high here tonight as well heres sto yakovich whos got 30 on the drive pushed it up with the right hand and lock in the rebound youre almost surprised when he misses one thats a tough shot thats an over and back Bo Kell Miller now and hes saying the ball was tipped he saying the ball was hit by petritis and Mark Madson I dont think whos been a whos been a soft litigator Dan in my opinion tonight the ruling here is that petrius tip the ball okay so Clemson will keep possession now its not an over the back unless you have your body and the ball across the midcourt line and he did but the ball was tipped so he had to go back beyond the back in the back reached in there knocked it away and locking the rebound and the carum and possession is going to go to Cal on the hell ball and thats thats a turnover for the Tigers and thats another key factor in this second half they have really they really cut down on the turnovers they had a lot of turnovers in the first half very few in the second Zachary got hit in the face sper inadvertently reached up in in trying to defend Jaden and caught him across the face and I think Jadens got a little blurred vision as they put the ball back in play here with petritis and blackshire thats a little easier to deal with when you have a 12point lead with a minute left to go in STO yakovich ball deflected by Lockett black are trying to line up another one runs it in the lane with a right hand and scores well the return of Javon blackshire from a scoring perspective is going to be a pleasing note for Cal on what otherwise might be a tough night in the win lost column they will get Virginia on Wednesday night at hos Pavilion theres a Campbell foul out in the mid Court area and then Virginia Tech next Saturday here Berkeley its really a nice job by Black Shear he he takes locken into the lane and then locken drops off to go down and cover the big guy and Clemson cant get back to Black Shear quickly enough defensively but youre right Mark Madson really wanted him Black Shear that is to be able to get his offensive stroke back and certainly seems to have done that tonight well what a second half for Chase Hunter hes got 18 tonight half dozen assist and five rebounds for the Tigers these are his first free throws eighth best free throw shooter in the ACC Im telling you what I dont know that thats going to be a very pleasant trip next week for Virginia and Virginia Tech simply because this is a cow team that plays with a lot of intensity and Matson seems to have a very positive attitude over there very encouraging toward his players 12 to shoot in the final 2 seconds and shefin will handle the rebound Brad Brownell says thatll be all we need tonight fellas Clemson is going to go to 4 and0 Dan and theyre going to be tied with Duke at the top of the standings pit a game back at 3 Applause and0 and the tigers are winners 8068 here tonight at Little John Coliseum
