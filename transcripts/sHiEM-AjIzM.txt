is right now and well see who who can survive today its a good alltime series since the rebirth of Hurricanes basketball Miamis won the last five meetings but obviously the S has had some great basketball teams Through The Years here we go great to have you with us from the wat go Center omir straightway three comes up short two weeks ago that shot went in against Notre Dame yeah hes taken a lot more this year hes uh shot 16 thats more than he shot all of last year so hes going to be a continue to shoot that the new era of basketball ball we are in they didnt shoot that shot in the first possession of the game 10 seconds in in year one of Jim Len Egger friend dys coaching careers of course that shot was only worth two points at that time bran duny talked about pace and slowing the pace and playing in a manageable pace and thats a good possession as khil Brantley Cashes in the jumper with four in the shot clock he struggled the last couple game so its good to see him get off to a good start hes looking to play well today against his Miami team yeah Brantley just 6 for 2 five from the field only seven points in each of his past two dropped a scoring average to 16 per game omir couple tries and he converts omir always starts off games aggressive I think thats how he gets going as long as he stays out of foul trouble hes going to be a big Force down there and every single game for Miami that will omir stay out of foul trouble is a question Yus trying to go at the Nicaraguan big man and round one goes to omir good defense by omir chest him up a tough Applause Music shot its pack in the corner short pullup goes beautiful shot by Pac hes a microwave scorer if he gets going watch out for S lell pack like Brantley has seen his scoring slowed a little bit averaging under nine points per game in his last four omir with the defense pokes it away itll stay Lal basketball ball Miami getting after defensively that was an emphasis these last few weeks uh for Coach L he wanted him to play a lot better defense than they have over the past John as a guy whos played in this league I mean whats it like for you to see a school like Miami that you dont necessarily think of as a basketball Blue Blood superpower go to the Elite 8 and the final four in backto back years Miami was on his way up when I was playing so Im not surprised they had some good players when I was playing coming in so I I I like where theyre at as a program and coels got them rolling Second Chance opportunity Gil cant knock down the three and here comes Matt Cleveland the other way Coast to Coast Cleveland scores Beautiful Finish Matthew Cleveland from Florida State one of those portal stars that coach L seems to always get quick shot that time wont go for Shephard Miami wants to keep running because of this guy Cleveland not this time Shephard pulls down the rebound Applause Music Applause Gil to the basket coach Hill talked to us a little bit earlier hes a slasher he was concerned about him offensively being able to control him they let him go uh from an offensive standpoint at Lal yeah you can focus a lot on brickus and Brantley and forget that Gil also averages 12 points per game he scored 26 in their buzzer beaten win against Pennsylvania earlier this month that was a wild khil Brantley buzzer beating in omir second try knew he was short with it here come the Explorers jir brickus scored 41 at the Wells Fargo Center against Temple but rebounding thats thats something that they had the key in on offensive rebounding they theyve got to box out a little more and uh get those 5050 balls the fou goes against popper you cant talk to Jim Lena for too long john without him going down the rabbit hole of look he he knows that they need to be better defensively and Rebound in the basketball if they can improve those two things they have a chance to be really good really good chance right here Brantley with the drive down the lane hes coming out aggressive as we thought he would struggling the last couple games and four the six for the Explorers belong to Music Brantley Miamis got to get a little more movement offensively looks a little stagnant get a little more energy in the ball first shot for Wugga comes up short Matthew Cleveland second chance for the canes tough shot wow tough finish by Cleveland solid defense by L they cant get discouraged uh that was a good defensive possession by them rickus way off think Joseph got a piece of it the slashing popler gets fouled by khil Applause Brantley so we get ourselves a timeout Matthew Cleveland looking to push the tempo gets the rebound ball on the CW is brought to you by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for more than 150 Music years early twopoint lead for the 24th rank hurricanes here inside the watsco center we were talking about Jim Lenas desire to get his team to rebound last Sunday against Colorado m Cleveland in 34 minutes had zero defensive rebounds he had two o boards but no defensive rebounds hes already got four defensive rebounds today clearly that was a message this week definitely was a message if you look historically Clevelands been a 67 rebounded game player so I think coach Lara told him hey look I need you to get on the board especially with this smaller team we have foul one against Brantley before the break and Wugga popper to the line the Junior from Philadelphia they grew up in Big Five territory looka the leading scorer for the canes averaging 159 points per game omir is not far behind at 157 theyve got a lot of double digit scores in the starting lineup thats usually means theyre hard to guard Kean Georg we did talk about in the open is out there for the first time 68 freshman from Switzerland Gil that can be an offensive foul yes it is good defense by poer just chessing up and staying Music Applause strong oh man yeah definitely offensive foul through a little elbow shot man we got to go look at that one that was that was a headbutt headbutt Applause huh they change the rules every year I dont know I dont know what what what that falls under these days I mean youve been in a lot of battles on the block how does that feel to absorb that shot I uh I got hit in the head by actually nicolea yic I I tried to test up and he went up under me and I I bit through my lip and uh needless to stay I uh stayed away ouch the next few years of my career from that uh position Im guessing they didnt call the foul on Yas did they they did not called a fou on it was on me it was on me on your on your on your mouth on my mouth so man so I know its bowl season you know football maybe got a little confused with the with the head butut Music huh looks like its just going to be a common offensive foul on anoir Gil popper remains in the game AJ Casey makes his first appear its the sophomore from Chicago full court pressure leads to a turnover the steel for Brantley the Miss for brickus and poppler skies in for the rebound Cleveland on the gallop the other way pretty good transition defense from Lal explores of 1 three straight coming into today their last game was last Saturday they won at Lafayette by 16 Kean George emerging from Miami right on Q hes been shooting it well he is the guy they need to step up to be this Dynamic Miami team to get back to potential final four this year he right on que for that threepointer and hes really toolsy and hes still growing he was 65 a year ago now hes 68 Brantley with a shot clock at six over George and Cleveland he scores flashing in the LA two thats a tough shot by Bradley hes came here to play today coach Dy said he doesnt want his team to let the other team go on eight to 10point run so that was a good way to stop that Miami run approaching six points zipping it inside Casey through the contact and the second foul called on Gil a decision to make here for Fran duny with a lot of time to go in the first half George with the threepointer Fresh Off the Bench hey that is a confident shot he plays with a lot of confidence hes versatile theyre going to need more from him today couple weeks ago John Jim Lena said that being a sub is the hardest job in basketball you dont know when youre going to play you dont know how much youre going to play you played about 23 of your games in the NBA Off the Bench I was a career role player as you put it nicely and uh I used to try to come off the bench and just have as much energy as possible and the rest of the game took care of itself and uh thats what George is looking like hes trying to do how how natural is it to bring that energy when most of the guys have been in the game and then youre coming into the game cold hey once you get used to it and you know what youre going to do its a lot easier um once you have a roll established so I I I was I was fairly good at it to say the least and uh after a couple Red Bulls is that the pregame uh the pregame meal the Red Bull the Red Bull I I would have a Red Bull with 60 on the clock and when I have another one of 30 you on the clock wow yeah man I I had to I only had 13 minutes to make my money thats fantastic I did not see you chugging before the game today but maybe when you went backstage I might have a pregame ritual tend to shoot here rickus kicks it Brantley spins finding daylight narrowly and he throws up an airball great defense by keesan George benley Joseph was hip checked on his way to the rim by brickus there are Euro steps and then theres that side to side sachche that we just saw yeah that was right the the pull up the Kyrie Irving move as I like to call that that was a good move by Bley Joseph coach dumpy said they want to control the tempo without restricting this team cant let Miami get offensive transition or its going to be a long day for the Explorers Gil did go to the bench with two fouls tund valberg fasi is into the game and theres Nigel pack knocking in the corner jumper another short jumper byel pack hes two for two starting off well early he usually takes time to get going so its good to see him get to a good start yeah kanes are six of 11 from the floor Applause 55 Brantley pulls up and connects over pack seems like a broken record he hits another shot he came to play today down here in Coral Gables four for six eight points and 7 Music Applause Minutes pack to the corner Cleveland making a move against Shephard thats nice high level move by Cleveland he seems to know hes going to attack the RIM today hes playing well with a lot of aggression Miamis now six of eight from twopoint Applause Music range from the corner and Cleveland with another nice deflection well see if they give the rebound to himmer George but Matthew Cleveland with a huge part of it and then George turns it over in the front court so far so good on the turnovers one turnover for Miami so far that was a big emphasis of practice yesterday thats the only time I seen coach Al get up and uh kind of Make Some Noise yesterday Brantley comes up short this time well after the second half against Colorado on Sunday clearly it was just too casual too lacad isical oh what a move Cleveland takes it for two beautiful Euro with the small Shuffle at the end ref didnt call it nice move by Cleveland largest lead so far for Miami just a sizzling start at the offensive end for the hurricanes Music inside its yotus and the big man from Lithuania gets his first two of the day Miami uh struggles with size I would thought yotus would be a little more involved today as he is the biggest player in the court on both teams went to him on the first possession but hes not their goto guy they really rely on the guards this the fifth score on the starting unit popler explosive athletic ISM Defying Gravity I dont know his head was at The Rim on that layup that was a high high level finish quick shot at the other end and its desan Shepard bagging his 11th three of the Season hes my ex Factor today uh Evan I I they usually play well when he does I cant wait to see that replay of the wga pop shot though right back to wga my goodness on his Music head there are guys that can jump and then there are prolific leapers like Wugga popper a special athletic specimen explosive explosive athlete right there Brantley back door and Shephard Up and Under Shephard is an athlete in his own man these are some high level athletic plays coming uh here early in this game Miamis got to go back to W get here right got to hey got to get him Music Applause involved the Freshman kissan George takes it himself and thatll work too beautiful take coach told us earlier I want him to be more aggressive to stop thinking he looks like hes doing that today and he trusts his IQ wants him to play more instinctively out there on the court obviously a good start five points for kesan Applause Shephard makes a move on Casey way off Kean George grabs his second rebound time out Miami Miami all right Midway through this first half Miamis already halfway to 50 and Wugga popler just ridiculous hops for the Junior from Music Philly guy for the board going Coast to Coast like a point forward with a beautiful lefthanded finish then right here with the fade the tough shot good defense even better offense and here hes with the Euro been a lot of Euros today he looks really good hes four or five eight points he came to play today early down here in Coral Davis and Miami started the game three for eight theyve made their last eight field goal attempts since then theyre 11 of 16 now and uh both teams have been really Spectacular from inside the arc thats what coach dumpy did not want was these 8 to 10o Runs put together without scoring he said that could be an issue in this game against a uh high level offensive Miami team the Explorers also average N9 M threes per game so theyre a good threepoint shooting team theyre going to need to be today to carve back into this deficit Christian Watson out there for the first time Kean George not bashful on the glass omir turned away by yotus but the loose ball finds Casey fresh shot clock Watson takes Applause it possession arrows going to give it to L love the way omir is battling if you see coach Lara he he has two bigs in right now maybe something hes trying with the uh deficiency theyve had on the defensive glass well theyve got size Off the Bench thats the Curious thing is that omir you know listed at 67 I think hes more 65 66 although depends on how his hair is sitting that day but Off the Bench they got noo at 610 George at 68 Casey at 69 so he does have options and would not be surprised to see in a future matchup maybe in conference play to go big at some point but a lot of that also be comes is Casey or George or noelo ready for that role and responsibility right they they need a little help on the glass so hopefully coach can get a little bit out of him oh nice reversal benley Joseph hes got some athleticism too shot wont go though and here comes Brantley the other way desan Sheard scores plus one oh great move by the Athletics Junior from Norristown PA desan Shepard it is Euro step Saturday right here another Euro and one the tough finish with the right Music hand what makes that so hard to guard you know youre used to just guarding someone straight up so when they switch feet or pivot feet its hard to slide over and stop that coming at full speed foul was on benley Joseph threepoint play for Shepard gets it back to a sevenpoint game I dont know if uh coach Lara liked that too big look he only gave it a little a little bit of Music Applause Music time W popper the only starter thats on the bench right now looks like Ls in the zone trying to slow down on Miami offense maybe keep him outside dont know if thats a good idea looks like a 131 theres Nigel pack busting the zone to Fran dumpys dismay right on the time I I dont know if his zones what you want to play in Miami and theyre a uh one of the top threepoint shooting teams in the nation yeah number three in NCAA threepoint percentage but uh the South can shoot a little bit too its the first made three of the year for Rus yotus hes not the guy I expected to be draining not the guy I expected but thats the nature of this game these days The Bigs are shooting threes first possession of the game was the omir threepoint dve straight Applause away do they go back to Y2 at the top of the key here probably not probably not I I uh I think Miami would live with him shooting another three he was 0 for four this season before that make possession to go theres the shooter and its andrees morero who has been scorching hot over the past couple weeks hes now 12 for his last 23 Beyond The Arc coach dumy said hey morel now hes shooting the shot the ball well hes got to learn how to take good shots and make good shots and get open cuz teams are going to key in on him and he looked good in that possession hes in high 20 points in last game against Lafayette and menley Joseph went up in the air lost the ball Lal was down 11 John but all of a sudden theyre back within four theyll have the ball when we come back good one Brewing here today in Miami our double header we head to South Bend for a traditional ACC Big East matchup as the Georgetown HOAs face the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame Georgetown and Notre Dame they used to be conference Rivals when Notre Dame was in the Big East but they havent met in almost 11 years they rekindle that rivalry today inside the joy Center purcel pavilion Jaden EPs and Marcus Burton the leading scorers respectively for a couple of new head coaches you mentioned it before the game Ed coie taken over at Georgetown for Patrick Hing and Michael Shrewsberry now the man in South Bend couple uh kind of legendary programs that have have been down a little bit so hopefully those two new coaches can get them back where they used to be be an intriguing matchup with Tom wormy and Mike jinsky on the call later this afternoon M Lal on a 60 run theyve got hot from three and then they turn it over nice uh on a m defensely to get around the big man and get that steal just the second Lal turnover of the half Matthew Cleveland hes the first in the game in double figures hes got 10 man on a mission today Cleveland he has come to play down here hes uh scorching hot right now he just gets to his spot really Music well ys feeling it as a big man shot who shot threes in later his career you got to get up another one you make the first one at all times you dont want to finish the game 100 you want to keep shooting until you miss hey we at 50 right now omir the offensive rebound good defensive Slide by Shephard deflected pass finds zir anyway nice offensive possession its Miami also wants to have a little more assist and share the ball and not dribble as much so that was a beautiful offensive possession by them I dont know if this is a negative but Miami six assists on 14 field goals thats theyre scoring though theres jir brickus getting the action in his first two of the day he hes he hasnt scored and got on the board yet today that could be a scary sight for Miami cuz when he gets going lals a lot better really prolific score tough take wont fall for Pat nearly has the steal in the back cour but heres brickus his fourth year at Lal and no transfers from a D1 school on this Lal team which is rare in this day and age especially when you had the coaching turnover the steal for Joseph pack for popler popler he is playing Above the Rim today that is a nice lob with the left hand thats tougher than people think the underhand scoop lob just a smooth finish for wga high level athleticism morero tough Fade Away loose ball finds popper pack ahead for Joseph the trailer Music Cleveland man EV that looked good from our angle I thought that was going in it was right online just a hair short coach L will take that shot every time Miami just two for nine from three still have an eightpoint lead as we close toward four minutes to play in the first Music half May fighting in that post down there rickus drives on Joseph good block out from omir but it was last Touch by Miami Mago pack with the left hand scoop wga PO with the threw it in a little bit it was nice nice Music Music Alle lets take a look at the Pacific Life game summary present presented by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for more than 150 years Bradley struggled the last couple games he started off hot today Cleveland here 10 points five rebounds he started aggressive hes got this Miami team rolling early up eight points and pack three or four one to one from three I think he needs to shoot a little more honestly man hes playing well hes also got three assists to go along with the seven points in 14 minutes I mean I I agree with you John he he he can be a facilitator and pile up 67 89 assists but Miami is at his best when the other team has to respect his outside shooting right morero back outside for Shephard well ss not playing poorly by any means thats the fourth turnover for the Explorers but its the second straight time that the after timeout possession has been a turnover pressure defense by Miami in all three face defense rebounding and turnovers Miami is playing well as it was an emphasis this last week after losing to Music Colorado pack for Joseph nice seal on the Block Applause omir gets the roll preseason select all ACC selection not stopping them that close to the basket beautiful seal beautiful right hook over 6 s Ryan xan whos played limited minutes this season for the Explorers Dan has only scored 11 points all year and deflected out of bounds Kean George coming back in 307 left in the half and coming up on the Subaru halftime report well take you around the ACC well hear from Tom wormy and G man from purcel Pavilion full review of the first half stats and highlights here in Miami shck clock winding down and great defense by clevand swatting Shephards desperation three at the other end its popper time out got to get a timeout for these gets out of hand Miami looks real comfortable right now largest lead yet for the Hurricanes at 41 128 poer fourth in the country in threepoint percentage blocked by Cleveland transition threes we love to see popper right here top five shooter in the country percentage wise Coachella take that every single Music time coming up Tuesday on inside the NFL nobody breaks down games like our crew with highlights and Analysis you wont find anywhere else this week the guys will take a deep look back at the Cowboys big road contest against the bills Inside the NFL Tuesday at 87 Central on the CW Cowboys coming off the big win against Philly now they got to go to Buffalo whos just knocked off uh Kansas City on the road some high level games this weekend man Im excited to sit on the couch and uh watch Dak Prescott and Josh Allen Music go all right out of the time up see if Lal can avoid turning it over George sliding well with brickus who a lot smaller Dan back outside brickus to the corner and its fasi knocking down the three The Freshman from stockolm Sweden nice Reserve he he is one of those guys that in the future he hell hell be their best player and uh soon soon hes made Seven of his last 10 threes I mean 40 for the year but he can stroke it and heres the state Brantley the theft and he missed in the layup at The Rim almost jumped a little too high on that one cland omir fumbled the catch doesnt matter hes so strong down there man hes hes a loone seen him in person man hes a low down there he is sturdy little little gimpy right now might have hit his Applause knee hes reaching for Applause it bricky has got to try to take advantage of his bigger player but shout out to George just sliding with him playing well defensively oh Zan rejected George and omir were both right Music there looks like nor Chads omir is okay good pass good finish the Applause hammer I like this lineup Evan that they got on the court right now this this could be something special especially coming in ACC play no question about it starting five minus Joseph plus George theres a beautiful move and Kim Lena did not like that pick and roll coverage nice setup uh he talked to us earli about them being on a string defensively and helping each other out and not just guarding their man that was uh one of the few lapses early in this first half 10 points for Brantley so far in this first half from Jim Lenas neighborhood the Bronx the Bronx a lot of good players came out out of there couple of them here today different Generations oh my popper with big ambition woo hey where did he leap from there John hes flying I got chills hes flying out there today Im see where he jumped off at right here outside the lane oh my goodness thatll been on Sports Center how do you made that probably top top top five for sure hopefully hes okay down there man they need him shot clocks off the F would love a bucket here to get within 10 or nine would be wonderful too for the explores deflected out of bounds 33 on the clock most teams havent play their draw up with a short clock right now lets see what they do looks like maybe a double screen for bricks to come to the corner all season long Lal has been really good in these types of situations its why theyve won so many close games got three wins this year by one theyre five one games decided by single digits the only lost in triple OT thats deflected he got it off but it wont go down tund valberg fassi unable to cash it in as time here in the second half Miami basketball to begin half number two good to see popler back with a little shoe switch up maybe that was just a problem Master of the midrange W popper looks like hes okay coach laras said his pullup is as good as any NBA players I agree with him on that one he Compares him to Richard Hamilton you like that comp I do like that comp its its a lot to live up to however yes it is Rip was pretty good both at Yukon and then with the Pistons and wherever he went travel called it on Gil didnt see a lot of anoir Gil he picked up his second foul only played six minutes in that first half you know Miami and their two losses are minus 43 in the second half so this is going to be another habit building moment for them to play well this second half and and finish the game Applause Music strong poppler had big ideas and forgot the basketball Applause Brantley over to Gil now Music Shephard Clevelands a tough Defender to try to go oneonone against I love the focus defensively Miami you can see it in their face man they were really trying to defend oh that ball was going out of bounds and deflected incidentally off AJ toide so it stayed in rough part of the Court thats what they all say Brantley tough turnar around air mails Applause it thes going have to string together some stops and score the ball a little bit as this looks like it may get out of hand if uh they dont start to figure it out offensiv what what do you think Fran dumpys primary message was in the halftime locker room I think it was hey we we were defending well we just need to stay solid defensively make them shoot tough shots and and score the ball shoot some threes shoot more threes thats how you thats the rest look out again looks like the ankle is Okay evan to say the least 15 for popper three highlights and Counting three and a Music half inside yotus with nice finish Papa looks like hes laboring a little bit man uh hopefully Miami can get through this game and he uh you know stays healthy saw him land a little awkwardly I mean when you fly that high you got to land in a way that most humans dont Matthew Cleveland picks up where he left off in the first half well ss trying to play zone theyre trying to figure it out Zone hasnt been working another nice shot by uh Matthew Clon in Miami from twopoint range today is just ridiculous theyre 19 for 26 from two with the jab middle sky for the dunk he looks good he looks head almost at The Rim man thats some NBA athleticism right Applause there you were a guy that was known to get up a little bit do you worry about your head hitting the rim Id never worried I wasnt that athletic I just had long arms dont give me too much credit but yeah man I uh I love getting those man it energizes the team too look at I popler oh hanging in the air throwing it in he can score Every Which Way W popla show he hasnt even had to show off the jumper today man 5335 Miami has its largest lead strong start to the second half for Coach ell KES brickus is going to have to get a little aggressive he likes taking guards down to the post khil Brantley quiet the crowd momentarily with a three much needed three by L they dont need Miami to go on a run brickus the steel in the back court passes up to one on three three and its a strong take from Gil right into omir five quick points for the Explorers bodyto body lefthanded finish coach Lea told us about that finish in uh prowess SP omir right over yotus no shepher the rebound lets s making a little push Brantley back out brickus scored 41 in a game earlier this year quiet so far today and omir just picked up his first personal of the game yotus will shoot the free throws when we come back but wga Poler is having a day highlight walking highlight right here nice live by him good play Miami rolling right in what he want L beautiful finish right here he fakes towards the screen and grows Baseline too fast too athletic for the defense to recover ys not want to be a part of that poster again right there right 17 and Counting for Music Wugga I mean Hes listed 65 197 but he he plays like hes 69 610 just with that incred athleticism plays a lot bigger than he is kind of like a Bruce Brown that came here coach Al kind of described him hes similar to highle athlete that plays a lot bigger Bruce Brown was a point guard in a big man when I played with the Pistons so uh he can do it all love that comp Bruce had a couple triple doubles when he played here and was such a valuable player for the nuggets on their run of the title last year got a ring and got paid and has Indiana looking good too this yes indeed the side looks like theyre doing a little bit of a press kind of maybe to slow down offense and give them less time offensively on the other end out of the timeout from Miami pack Joseph popper Casey in Cleveland omir gets a breather on the Music Applause bench Nigel pack hasnt looked for his offense too often today now three for five after that Miss Applause Music Applause Gil trying to squeeze it through back door and it deflected off of him nice nice defense that doesnt show up in the stat she for wiga popper but its another another steel basically another steel team steel turnover they get another possession that uh Lal does not have its can only bow well for Miami especially how potent they are Music Applause offensively in a lot of ways it feels like Miami is in control its an offensive foul though but in reality Mr Big Five Fran duny has his visiting explorers within 12 15 minutes to go theyre within Striking Distance here John they are within the Striking Distance and I think this is more so on Miami as a team that comeing off fresh off a final four you have to learn how to put teams out early because a couple threes fall and now we have a ball game and Anything could happen and uh especially in college basketball Music Jim Lena was saying to us in his office earlier today that everyone thinks just cuz they have you know basically four starters back from last year its the same team that went to the final four its a very different team losing Jordan Miller and Isaiah Wong to the NBA look out popler oh that was Nifty he is showcasing his athleticism if Im popular after the game Im putting this on my highlight tape load it up to YouTube man this is a beautiful show of athleticism by him Shephard though the quick answer and the Explorer back within 11 as we said before if they keep staying within Striking Distance this game could get Applause close Hensley Joseph off the catch comes up short AJ Casey the rebound to Music Cleveland going to stay Miami ball Miami on characteristically shooting only 25 from three youd have to think that probably changes as the game goes on percentage wise theyve just got to keep shooting 42 on the season one of the top teams in the country only Wyoming and Baylor had better threepoint percentages entering today than the Hurricanes nationally Joseph good defense by Bradley seven to shoot pack slithers through sets up Cleveland with three tough fadeaway rebound deflected and nice great hustle from Music popper this could be a backbreaking bucket here for Lal if Miami punches it in with authority I like Casey to no I like Casey to roll on that pick and roll theres nobody down there the floor space I think coach or their teammates are trying to tell them hey man roll to the basket get you a finish game c game so Miami makes it to the final four they play con Connecticut play him tough but Yukon was too good they come home Sunday Monday coach L has a meeting with all 15 of his players eight of those 15 guys said coach I think Im going to transfer said what what I thought I thought you happy here we just went to the final four and oh theres nil money to be had yeah um apparently they think nil money grows on trees these days and thats the rumor but that you know is is the mindset that coaches need to have always trying to survive always moving to the next day timeout taken by Nigel pack as he stumbled but able to maintain possession and we will take it too 7 Minutes gone in the second half every day a new other new opportunity every day includes some heads scratching moments too kanes by 11 catch all the action with highflying Toledo against the rugged Wyoming Cowboys is the 2023 bar stool Arizona Bowl the Toledo Rockets and the Wyoming Cowboys Saturday December 30th 400 Eastern meanwhile coming up next more immediately tantre Styles former tarhill now wearing Georgetown colors in South band to take on new head coach Micah Shrewsberry in the Fighting Irish good to see him doing well Im georget toown man good kid uh we definitely miss him over there in UNC another former UNC T here Tyler nickel last Saturday up in blackburg popler out of the timeout elbow jumper doesnt go Casey on the glass swatted loose ball finds poppler extra possessions he got Casey down there might need to look for him got the mismatch on got to start in a position to get that rebound shot clock winding down popper with four tough shot rebounded by brickus this is how ly gets back into the game dont get tired of playing good defense and getting good shots on offensive end try to make it a 68 point game as we come under 10 Brantley I mean the fact that lals within 11 with brickus being one for six with two points is surprising to me right and then it just kind of pinpoints us on Miami second half struggles deep three Bradley puts it in there it is right now we got an eightpoint game down the stretch weve got a game on our hands Evan 122 run over the last 440 just had timeout so no timeout from Jim Lena trusting his veteran team poppler in and out omir on the glass count it plus the foul right on time omir has also stay out of foul trouble we havent talked about that today and the longer he stays in the game the better Miami is as coach told us earlier Music well nor Chad one of the elite rebounders Fridays are magical with all new episodes of Penn and Teller fola starting pen Gillette teller and new host Brook Burke Fridays is at 87 Central only on the CW Miami had missed seven straight shots before that last offensive rebound put back by nor Chad omir and jir brickus has not had a magical day so far for Lal and lals only down 10 so look for him to maybe pick it up and its actually kind of scary that he hasnt had a good game and theyre only down 10 uh coming down the stretch of this game and speaking of Rip Hamilton brickus out of the same High School Coatsville area Pennsylvania as Rip Hamilton and brickus surpassed rip brickus is the alltime leading scorer for that high school program thats impressive and in coachville is a hot bed of basketball talent and brickus is just another one in the long line of players from that part of Philly brickus and Brantley played AA ball against each other in high school Brantley from the Bronx New York to the corner fasi nope tried to bank that in Evans I dont know if he tried to Im Im hoping he didnt try to he almost did pack hits the cutting Cleveland and hell get to at the free throw line of course our coaching match up today a battle of the Bronx versus Philadelphia miam just got to stay solid you know every teams going to have their runs they got to just keep pushing and uh down the

the Lal interior every chance they get that can only B well soon theyre going to start getting threepointers to fall well you look at these two teams side by side John Lal is kind of like the Miami of the A10 in terms of their lack of size their guard play they can really shoot veteran experienced coach not going to be you know nervous in any close tight game yeah uh Miami North we can call them uh

we got to chat with him on Applause Thursday and its a foul on Brantley its his third he was an assistant at Lal in the early 80s and they were playing North Carolina and Dean Smith was walking down the line shaking everybodys hands and Dean Smith said have a great game Fran and what that meant to a young Fran duny I mean says a lot about Dean Smith he couldnt believe that Dean Smith the Dean Smith knew his name he he could not believe it and that actually made him know all the names on the other coaching staff as he coached because it had such an impact on him and credit to Dean Smith

minutes to play Cleveland going to work on fasi tough shot wont go rebound finds Shephard and hes got to get a little more ball mve its a lot of dribbling which is coach Lara did not want to start happening you know especially in the games they struggled thats what started to happen yeah that was the problem against Colorado too much dribbling I think its get Bradley the ball time and let him go hes feeling it right now had the hot hand he kicks it moros three comes up short and Cleveland pulls down the rebound that was a huge opportunity there for F I love what Miami is doing gang rebounding Applause George nice drive morero is like you kidding me with that g drove into him through the elbow yeah he looks like George created the contact right here oh I think the ref was a little premature in that Applause whistle omir kicks it Music Applause George trying to just use his basketball instincts everything but the bucket rebound marero that is going cold right now Ls got to get some balls to go in make this a game bassi sweet finger roll over omir we talked about him earlier hes kind of their future star he will be their best player to come hes looking like hes grown

Finish almost a little finger roll there beautiful finish by Applause fasi here in Miami coming up next on acc Courtside Saturday we take you to South Ben Georgetown and Notre Dame they spent 18 years

Davis getting ready to take another shot at Georgetown as a member of Notre Dame hey Evan would you believe me if I told you that M will be down eight with s minutes left with brickus only having said for two points I dont know man I I thought Lal could keep it close but the the last Clause with brickus only with two points no I I thought brickus and Brantley both needed to have good games brickus does have seven assists with only one turnover though beautiful impact hes making without scoring thats the sign of a highle high IQ player which coach Dy told us hes one of the smartest players hes ever coached one and one here for wga Music popper wgas been impressive impressive to say the least one for two at the line a rare free throw Miss for wuga entered at 88 from the line this season hes got 20 the lead is nine looks like brenley missed a wide open morero hes upset about it Basi to morero looking High hey shepher my goodness was that a play I dont that looked like they knew what they were doing right there Baseline cut for the lob the Hammer by Shephard thats what Fran duny has been wanting to see out of the timeout all game long desan Shepard soaring and scoring and we got a sevenpoint game T to shoot for Miami they got to get nor Chad the ball down there hes got a disadvantage pack hits the pullup nice stop the bleeding shot by magel pack hes playing well hes efficient today too 11 Music points six assist too hes hes came hes hes matching brick is assist more assist bassi oh what a take and one up and under against NAD omir right here with the moro with the whos known for shooting not passing with the high level pass and dunk to Shephard nice finish by fasti right hand underhand layup you know he has a little bit of pro experience um his favorite player is jiannis out of the Koo man that was a kind of a Giannis like finish Baseline of course you were teammates with Giannis in Milwaukee for a bunch of years yeah Yannis man thats my guy man happy for him didnt think he would be all world but uh I knew hed be pretty good so the threepoint play play from tund valberg fasi Rings Lal within six fais got 10 Off the Bench timeout taken with 637 to go and just cuz we got a moment we got a really good game here but what when did this the the switch flip in your mind for Giannis cuz you knew him since he was really young when did you sort of realize that he would be all world you know it was a day in practice coach Jason kid said hey go down over the bigs he goes Im not a big man he said Im not a big man I am a guard and from that day forward everybody kind of looked at him like okay young fell you got a little you got a little you know confidence in you and literally the rest was history man he took off from me Lal has had a lot of tight games this year mention theyve won three times by one point games by single digits theyre 5 one theyre 82 the despite the fact that a lot of those games could have gone either way s is not a team Id want to be in a close game with Ill tell you that right now explorers shooting 59 in the second half popper takes a look puts it in hes going to hit that every single time feet set wide open it was only a matter of time wga popper just tied his career high with 23 points Applause still six plus minutes to play Big Time shot by poer loose ball poked away morero collects tund valberg fasi fasi is feeling it man great Hustle by sheer to maintain possession itll be Lal basketball pop nice ball fake right here to get the defender to kind of get off of him oh man feet set hes going to hit that 10 times out of 10 thats a layup as we call that when I Music played fourth in the nation in threepoint percentage entering the day over 50 for the year Brantley Baseline kicks it for brickus another offensive rebound for fasi fasi growing up right before our eyes as a freshman playing well keeping them in this game and brickus gets it to go wow and one you know duy told us he said hes hes a great finisher for his size he just have an innate ability to just hes got a great feel for the game which cant be taught hes its its out of the womb beautiful omir just picked up his third change of speeds by ear by Brick is here Miami seems like theyre on her heels a little bit back to a sixpoint game John Hansen nothing more than I like to see it nice nice ball game with a lot on the line Miami trying to avoid a two game losing streak and hasnt happen very often around here lately lot of dribbling we need to get that ball Music moving oh good nice finish by benel Joseph with the contct with the finish with the left first two of the game for Joseph quick shot and an immediate answer from khil Brantley we have a ball game we we knew this was going to be fun with all these guards Bradley has came to play 21 points here we go Evan Miami 16 and one in their game after a loss dating back to the start of the 2122 season theyre getting tested today omir great position inside L switching everything so there going to be have a lot of quick rolls and and a lot of movement to get them off balance 15 for nor Chad Miami backup seven and thats three for Marrero its a fourpoint game beautiful no look by brickus I dont know if you guys saw that at home he he know he looked him off and hit him for the three he knew where he was going the whole time well we talked about Lal hanging around theyre doing more than that right now John they are in it Beau beautiful no look by marera with the threepointer weve got a ball game we got ourselves a tremendous finish Brewing lets take a look at our Pacific Life game summary presented by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for more than 150 years Bradley right here he started off the game with an infectious energy and focus hes hes got mile playing well and Cleveland here slowed down a little bit in the second half they need him to get going as well and wer popper he hadnt slowed down has to slowed down hes been flying Above the Rim all day I think down the stretch hes the guy theyre going to need to go to so first half L was shooting just 40 but getting hot here since halftime and the script has flipped a little bit thats been the tell of the tape Miami in the second half and their two losses man they have not played well and looks like theyre going to be at a deficit even if they win this game uh in the second half to the sou the 12point lead for the canes at halftime this is as close as Lal has been in a long while four minutes to play popper puts his head down and before the shot fouled by tund valberg fasi so itll be one and one here on the ninth team foul for L sou thats the aggression you got to show when its one in one wuga poer is their guy hes going to have to go and make some shots and and start finishing and and and lead the charge to win this Applause game averaged eight points a game last year only average 23 points per game as a freshman but even then Jim Lena knew he had a really special talent and those talents are just starting to emerge hes got a career high 24 make it 25 you know pick dead last in the A10 a final 14 returning four starters I love whats going on here this is why we love call Applause basketball rickus to fasi thinks about it fires and missed it Cleveland had the rebound deflected away but it finds omir looks like omir has been a little more aggressive on the pick and rolls usually when Miami is struggling they change up the defense to uh make the guard get it out of their hands Miami has made its last four field goal attempts at this end tnis shoot pack kicks it popler soaring but missed it omir keeps it alive and scores its not often we see Miami with the size Advantage omir down there battling huge Second Chance bucket for n Chad omir this a big time possession they need to get a stop theyre leaving for sasi open hes going to have to hit that for to win the game two good looks on backto back possessions and the Freshman thats shooting around 40 for the year cannot connect popper misses the bunny omir over two guys with a nice rightand finish 65 240 I hated playing against guys like that Im sitting on the sideline five offensive rebounds in in the game for nor Chad omir Miamis got 11 Second Chance points and an eightpoint lead under 3 minutes to go think you got to get the ball toir on a switch right here if they can do that here it comes again pack floater too strong omir had it but it was taken away by Music Applause Music Brantley grantley looking for some space tough shot tough shot by Dam dys got to push it here they have numbers and now with the defense getting back Jim Lena wants him to bleed a little clock that was kind of a tricky situation CU you want to push it but if you dont convert you only take 5 10 seconds off the clock thats playing into lals favor definitely a good attack by them pulling it back out when they say they didnt have anything to their advantage five to shoot packs known to create in these moments nice Angel pack omir omir taking over the game on the offensive glass you think maybe they need to put votus back in but fasi is playing so well uh omir is taking advantage of that size on the boards all of a sudden omir was having something of a quiet rebounding day hes got 17 points eight rebounds a chance to add to it at the line Shepard has picked up his third Applause foul were going to looks like Ls going a small ball which is coach dpy talked about adapting to the game dont know if he would have done this 25 years ago but uh thats how you survive in this sport yep the hometown iron choosing to be kind on that nor shadow mirr free Applause throw Buck 30 remaining Shephard fouled by omir thats number four on Norad we spoke too soon on the foul trouble no a minute left so I guess you got a foul to give um but for the most part he stayed out of foul trouble which is help Miami stay in this game with having him on the court Two Music Shots omir did not have a foul in the first half there we go so all four of his fouls have come since halftime hey coach used to tell me you cant take them with you which coach said that to you coach Williams used to say hey you cant take a with you ready foul him snapped a 2minute 53 second scoring drought with that free Applause throw desan Shepard following the nor chadow me uh the wga poppular Playbook and that he barely played barely scored his freshman year but now as a junior coming on strong double figure score blossoming into a bigger role yeah he is shepher at the line when he plays well L plays well and its its held true today hes got 15 points eight rebounds Music Applause rebounds all right down eight 90 seconds to go whats the road map here for Lal thes got to get some stops and theyve got to get it into a two or three possession game right now is a crucial possession for Lal they need a stop score and a stop to stay in this game whos it on going against Gil going against Gil running through the omir screen I like him trying to sell that you know sometimes you got to sell the foul to the ref thats team has Miss a free throw and get a score Gil good sale good sale I dont know ifs that strong I think he is Music yeah one thing Miami has going for him theyre ninth in the nation in free throw percentage right around 79 as a team and all five starters are good at the line had a down the stretch that thats a big deal especially coming in these close games thats something you expect to be consistent too from one game to the next ss got to get a quick score right here grantley looking for his offense oneul theyre going to call the foul against Wugga popper Jim Lena cannot believe it looks like Bradley initiated all the contact on that one credit to him making a ref make a call right here with the drive looks like he went into whats poer supposed to do yeah thats a tough one against wga and ball dont lie ball dont lie look the basketball guy said well a good defense well get the ball back for you somewhere Rasheed is smiling right you get to know Rasheed at all through the Carolina Connection Rasheed used to come to practice with us he come in summertime games play pickup hes probably one of the more knowledgeable uh people in the game Ive ever ever been around wow yeah thats High Praise yeah yeah for sure so omir going back to the line 22 now for NORAD he picked it up as of late 25 from popper 22 from rir packs got 11 points six assist this is how they need to play down the stretch this is a good game for them to kind of get a little scared you know before going into ACC play where just going to be tight games throughout they gave him a little scare L was within four with about four minutes to go morero had a couple threes that if they had gone down earlier would have tightened this thing up more considerably but that three perhaps too little too late to make it a ninepoint game with just a hair under 35 seconds left Miamis got two more nonconference games ston hill and North Florida and their return to ACCC schedule is against the currently unbeaten Clemson Tigers who sit at top the ACC for Coach Brad Brownell yeah Clemson is playing well they got a big time game against a put a lightly old Memphis team but is an old team too its its a a rare kind of game for college basketball to have such you know grad transfer 23 24 year olds playing against each other Clemson has had plenty of tests over the past month or so you know theyve won at Alabama and they hold serve against home against South Carolina they they go up North and win theyre a complete veteran experienced team and thats going to be a real intriguing matchup when they come to Miami on January the 3D meanwhile Georgetown and Notre Dame are coming up next Tom wormy and Mike jinsky are standing by tip off scheduled for 215 from pcel Pavilion we talked about it throughout the day John two proud programs two great Traditions both with new head coaches and you expect new coaches to you know maybe not necessarily have great success immediately but theyre establishing culture theyre building toward where they want to be and those are two programs that belong in the tournament year in year out year in year out they belong I mean Notre Dame won the ACC in 2015 Les we forget you know 7 eight years ago in Georgetown as we know is a legendary program so those coaches are on their way man you can see the blueprint right now and they just got to get their guys in and theyll be right back full court pressure Lal trying to get a 10second violation before fouling immediately but Miami able to get it across and Cleveland grabbed by Brantley who picks up his fourth with 268 remaining the luxury to have such a good free throw shooting team you can throw it to all five guys when I was playing I was either sitting on the side or down on the other end I wasnt a great free throw Applause shooter well Cleveland is the weak Link in the Miami starting lineup hes only 77 which in the Miami starting five is the weak link cuz everyone else is north of 80 Music right one of two for Matthew Cleveland the transfer from Florida State Brantley two more hes got 23 strong move by him man Im impressed with him he he had a game today oh no thankfully omir appears to be okay awkward stumble and quick three for Gil okay two 9 seconds to go fivepoint game and the foul given with 73 on the clock I dont know we cant see what was there maybe that line was you know jumped up at him I dont Music know there was a game earlier this year when Vermont was down five with like two seconds to go and one in regulation saw that that was a cant imagine going on Joseph at the line makes it a sixpoint game oh man looks like the Watson sign grabbed him jumped up and grabbed him I think he was probably thinking he was going to get fouled I think thats probably yeah BW a tire Joseph makes it a three possession game 7 Seconds to go morero in and out rebound Joseph thats the ball game Miami now 17 and one
