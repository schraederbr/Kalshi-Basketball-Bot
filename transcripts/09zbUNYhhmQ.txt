against Duke in their last game Applause Georgia Techs last game was Saturday as Mike mentioned against Duke 8643 the final there Louisville also played Saturday at Notre Dame that was a loss 7662 talk to Josh pastner and you know he said theyve had a couple of good days of practice right after that they talk things out after that I mean you absorb that type of loss and they can goes right to your soul I will say both teams had very spirited shoot arounds today more like practices and went over multiple offensive and defensive sets well see if they can put those to work tonight Sturtevant Georgia Tech of the traveling gray tonight shot clocks at 10 Coleman kind of weave his way Franklin a little bit of a follow away bounces out Withers the veteran with the rebound I think for both of these teams theyre going to try to make the other one prove themselves from the outside its going to be pretty tough to get into the paint area Ellis leads the way in scoring number three in white black and red 173 points per game Withers fires and misses tapped around almost got it and Ellis did foreign Georgia Tech takes it back yeah if theres one knock on him and his team in general turns the ball over so much and theyll sometimes gets himself in trouble up in the air Coleman missed the three Withers with another rebound thats the one advantage that Georgia Tech will have in this game very good at taking care of the basketball and neither one of these teams are outstanding shooting teams but Georgia Tech does not have any selfinflicted rules Louisvilles 41 as a team this season from the floor shot clock down here six in an offensive foul along the Baseline and that was trainer trying to make a move Franklin absorbing the contact Kenny Payne is the first year head coach and a former teammate of my broadcast partner tonight Mike jaminski and on a national championship team here at Louisville he knows all about the tradition and Excellence of this program that stayed in the family with that higher and hopefully things to settle down certainly better days ahead for this Louisville program on the bench third of it behind the line missed the three and Withers who averages about five boards per game already has three in this game about a threewing positions Louisville has got a size advantage thats Withers with a difficult shot hit the floor and hell earn free throws across the way for Georgia Tech its head coach Josh Pastor seventh season a couple of years ago Champs at the ACC tournament Mike going back to Greensboro this year yes sir when that and uh this is you know again were talking about advantages where these teams you know may have an edge Louisville gets to the freethrow line a lot more than Georgia Tech does so if they can make that an ally tonight itll help the cause Withers is 77 percent from the line this season oh sure Cardinals has a team thats 71 percent near the bottom of the conference always room for improvement and Withers and his teammates theyve been practicing those free throws yeah and a little full court pressure too here early on dont know the convincible are going for the steal here they Retreat back just want to take some time off the clock and upset Georgia Techs Rhythm Georgia Tech is 813 overall shot just 30 percent in the loss to do Kelly five feet behind the line hits the front rim up top for the rebound Mike James On The Run Coleman hustle back great play from behind not conceding the layup Coleman trying to Euro Step his way to the rim Curry pulled it in thats funny both of these teams are not really Up Tempo all the time but getting up and down the floor here early trainer lines it up Howard got the rebound for Georgia Tech five away from Atlanta looking for their first ACC Road win they defeated Miami at home and thats Sturdivant for three I shot not a great threepoint shooter 29 percent but had an open look at it good start for him I think you know to go back and be positive look at that Miami game tape and see how they played with some good vibes from that finish that game on an 110 run to close out the caves foreign Applause looking for his offense here early on the handle like to see him try to get something at the rim theyve got a taller cover on him but James is just its going to be really good Kelly the sophomore from Stone Mountain Georgia elevates over the Defenders for two yeah he needed to hit that and see some early success um and talked about it what his shooting has been 1758 in the last five so really struggling a good start Ellis distributes rattles out for trainer that was halfway down everybody else could have finished at The Rim that time Kelly only had five points against Duke was two of nine from the floor just to further your point Mike hes five of his last 27 on threepoint attacks Howard too strong Curry the rebound well run up and down this court all night GMan James thought about the jumper drives into traffic and puts it off the glass at 65 he can make that play and recently you have to honor his threepoint shot really developing that but very good off the take as well he was the leading scorer in the losing effort at Notre Dame on Saturday with 14 points Mike James was six of eight from the floor and canned a couple of Threes against the Irish this is Kelly wants a three and he hits it and uh you know Louisvilles challenging Georgia Tech to shoot from the perimeter so far the yellow jackets have answered that call two of five now Kellys now made 48 threes this season for Georgia Tech and he leads a team in that category tech desperately needs him to get hot we talked about his struggles in the open Ellis deep into the shot clock Curry runs it down in the corner Applause Curry a formidable figure on the inside Mike 68270 for the senior from Fort Wayne Indiana shot clock down to seven with a 19 rebound game earlier and thats LL is right there thats what they need him I think he needs to score here early Tom give them some confidence and then build on his assist numbers afterwards comes from a great family parents Tasha and Elbert we ran into them at the airport on the way here to Louisville Applause Big Mike jaminski fans in fact Albert called you Mr jiminski but they were very gracious we had a nice visit with them former professional football player for the Carolina Panthers Curry missed it Here Comes Georgia Tech and the gray Kelly quick close by James Kelly trying to spin it off the top of the backboard could have gone up on the same side of the rim that time made it difficult for himself Ellis has a lane score of the basket Music on Howard for Georgia Tech Applause brought to you by your local Ford dealer with Mike jaminski yeah for Georgia Tech Tom theyve got to avoid extended runs by the opposition against Duke 133 run and the end of the first half and then a 173 run to start the second that buried him in that game and for Louisville they got to maximize their size offensive glass getting inside Georgia Tech had trouble with Dukes size so lets see if Kenny Payne and his group can get on the offensive glass a little bit we had a great conversation with Kenny Payne at the shoot around at the practice facility today and its certainly been challenging season I guess thats a good way to put it in his first year but he says the guys are anxious for Success theyre hungry they want it and you may see a new player in the Horizon tonight and Emmanuel okorafor whos really done a nice job for them and hes out on the floor right now just his second game hes out of the NBA Academy in Africa which is located in Senegal one of the top players to come out of that facility war with the Miss lands leaping for the rebound and here is Elle Ellis he plays with a lot of energy and if hes had issues hes used to playing a more physical band of basketball and he had four fouls on the Notre Dame game in only 18 minutes and hes going to get probably hes going to call for the offensive foul there well core4 had eight points three of five from the floor at Notre Dame in his first action in a Louisville uniform and there you go becoming eligible January 19th Lagos Nigeria great program that the NBA has over there and so many great player and I played against Elijah on uh for a good portion of his career Manukau was a teammate of mine a lot of great talent lands the steal against Kelly and Georgia Tech was able to get back with Jalen Moore to swat it weve seen some very good defensive plays in transition by Georgia Tech Debo Coleman early and then watch this one coming from behind thats a clean rejection Lance thought he had an easy layup great look from behind the backboard the force of that squat Global keeping possession I think this is a snatchup zone that Georgia Tech plays very tough to work against trainer okoro4 saved it Withers three ball there is a four four made that play as it happened and off the scatter like that you get an open look at a three wither is one of the better threepoint shooting players for Louisville 40 of the Season hes now made 26 on the year from Beyond Beyond Applause well defended before held his ground and his teammate Withers grabbed it and Louisvilles on a 70 run they throw it away and more than anything Tom its those its its the you know the the turnovers with really nothing to do with the defense just a mistake that hurts agoraphor able to save it here and Withers knocking down a threepointer for the Cardinals Center yeah and its touched everybody and Im a teammate of mine at Duke Kenny Denard is a 40plus year Survivor testicular cancer and hes been very active in coaches versus cancer and the coaches have been involved with it its good to see and expand it to the team now as well wonderful initiative tonight here inside the arena and the cards on a 70 run of taking an 118 lead it is Georgia Tech basketball number time to look at 145 Advantage rebounding for Louisville so far four offensive boards five points that could be a big number for them going forward Applause lineup as well hes got the basketball right now for Georgia Tech Sonic NBA veteran converter Maxwell shot clock down to five for Kelly who hits the front rim they get it back out to Maxwell too strong and here early on in the game Louisvilles length has really bothered Jordan Tech shooters Georgia Tech two of eight in the threepoint distance Louisville one of four Withers has that three in the turnover Maxwell trying to beat the Defenders to the rim three of them collide and a foul coming up as Maxwell fell awkwardly good to see him getting up heres the look and uh one thing uh Maxwell will be very aggressive when he comes into the game he had 10 points against Duke you know good result there hes had an 18 point effort earlier this season so he can HE capable of having a big game and with Avon Smith out we need somebody to step up thats just the eighth free throw that Maxwell has attempted this season for the Junior from Huntersville North Carolina Applause 10 points against Duke led the team he was 26 from threepoint distance and hes got a free throw he is in the box score for Georgia Tech twopoint game closing in on the Midway points of our first half Tom wormy Mike javinsky and our outstanding ACC basketball production crew with you from Louisville Kentucky foreign Applause Music Applause does not get the shot away shot clock violation against the Cardinals we really got put in a bad situation that time was not aware of the shot clock I think you know Percy Miller at that point really needs to take over get something up on the rims foreign Music Applause Applause chance opportunities for Georgia Tech Axel with the foul Jamie lucky Bill Covington Junior AJ decide our officials this evening as Maxwell picked it up as GMan mentioned so Ellis number three coming through your picture is back in Miller out Ellis is going to be off the floor very much Withers another three for Withers Applause Music Applause wither is one of the try captains for the Louisville Cardinals its from the Richard Jr from Charlotte North Carolina heres the thing Tom I mean for uh for Louisville less than 30 percent of their offense comes from behind the arc but early here a good trend for them especially Withers seeing a big basket yeah they shoot 32 percent of the team from threepoint distance Cora four picked up his second personal so he had to go to the Louisville bench Franklin coming out of the game for Georgia Tech as well Fred Paul bagatskis has come into the game for Georgia Tech you will fire right away and thats what he you know we saw him today in shoot around and he is not he said he played against Duke uh really has not had much time this year but its a nice shot hes only played in five games this season Barts lose the handle Maxwell again reloads and hits the three his teammates were really rallying around him today and you off of the uh the bench the benches behind him I think this uh young man especially with the injuries that Georgia Tech has carve out some minutes freshman Ford from Riga Latvia lands has the bucket for Louisville scratch what I said about Tempo being a little bit slow both of these teams seem to be committed to getting up and down this evening hit that threepointer last trip down the court only his sixth game this season as Maxwell misses and he showed no fear especially and he missed his first three no hesitation with the second Ellis to the corner and James high arcing three Howard trying to out leap wheeler and he did and Tech will have it so weve got a timeout of a court its a fourpoint game inside 50 minutes to go in our first half Fred Paul bagatskis open in the corner launching a three his first of the season protecting the paint and its brought to you by CPI Security and it features the yellow jackets yeah both of these happen on the break too their teams chasing them down from behind in two blocks but this one uh spectacular by Jaylen Moore saving mcbasket there in transition he blocked it with such intensity Mike it went off the backboard hit him in the head and then went out of bounds and then Withers ended up hitting a three on that possession but it was or shouldnt have mentioned during the break that Louisvilles actually got a new president which uh they needed stability and Dr Kim schatzel was introduced to the crowd and I think a lot of things are gonna they had to get that position filled and A lots going to filter down out of that first year head coach Kenny Payne was an assistant most recently with the New York Knicks in the NBA was part of a national championship staff at Kentucky in 2012 also a former Oregon assistant that whole coaching staff very familiar with One Shining Moment go into that as the game goes on certainly a lot of NCAA Championship experience on that movie coaching staff on that bench Sturtevant Applause gatskas quick First Step finds Sturtevant James the rebound he was he was called for the ball made a nice play there I think they made a little adjustment knowing that they got to chase him off the threepoint line now the three he made just his second of the season thats Ellis from the three follow bending the rim and its a trainer talked about their length in the offensive glass nobody got a body on trainer we saw a trainer at the shoot around today exceptional leaping ability for number 12 in white Louisville really packed in defensively in that zone Kelly perfect form and he hits the three good answer well you got you know Kelly whos actually seeing a little bit bigger basket this evening and Bugattis two guys who can shake that zone loose eight points for Miles Kelly that concludes a couple of threepointers on four attempts to be on 22 feet one and threequarter inches away approaching the six minute Mark of the first half with the shot clock winding down for trainer trying to work on Coleman Jamie Luckey stepped in hes pointing it theyre going to call both of them for Applause so its Howard for Georgia Tech Mike and Roosevelt wheeler for Louisville got tangled up there Music Applause trying to be lucky talking with Bill Covington Jr and AJ Desai theyre headed over to the scorers table Music Jamie Luckys just trying to uh clean a little bit up right now aim you know for Georgia Tech I mean they wanted to respond physically Louisville was getting on the offensive glass Howard their biggest player Applause right now the advantage is 207 on the boards for Louisville sorting this out so wheeler and Howard double technical foul yeah theyre going to removal retains possession and uh 26 on the shot clock so theyve got to get something up right here but just off setting personal files now lets off the inbounds long rebound Coleman knocked Away by Ellis Two on Two game shovels it to trainer one dribble and hes fouled you know what LL has made that play missed the shot but medially went into defensive mode got the steal and then the dish right here to see him chasing it down from behind really good hustle play Applause Coleman picked up the foul for Georgia Tech the reach in there with Trader headed to the freethrow line Applause JJ trainer just moments ago opportunistic Mike yeah lets say nobody gets a body on him and thats the one thing that Louisville can do get on the offensive glass great time and great finish you know you look at up and down this line of common another offensive rebound Roosevelt wheeler shrugging off the uh double foul there earlier its wheeler who averages Mike 16 points per game all you need is a bucket to get above your average of your wheeler numbers going up defending Franklin stock clock winding down Coleman threepointer for Georgia Tech Applause five of their six made field goals are for by behind the ark and thats whats saving him though so far in this game Dylan Debo Coleman the sophomore from Memphis Tennessee they are one of ten from inside the ark Applause Withers who has made both of his threepoint attempts tries to go to the interior and gets fouled Applause Music um Applause well this is a guy you know Debo Coleman had a big game against Syracuse 17 points five of eight from three so theyve got some guys when they get started theyre capable behind the arc but I I think this is a good thing for Louisville to keep on doing attack the paint get to the freethrow line get into the bonus get Georgia Tech and foul trouble wear them down with your size you can see how vastly improved coach pastors team is tonight with the threepoint shooting they came in as a team Mike 31 of the Season 14th in the conference averaging about seven made threes per game 10th in the ACC thank you Applause Georgia Tech five of 12 for the threepoint real estate as Mike mentioned just one of ten on conventional jumpers follow Franklin get dammit protect thats the second time amongst four white jerseys that Franklin has come up with the ball and everything everybody just kind of shied away from him and let him finish Jayvon Franklin the senior from Little Rock Arkansas first year in the Georgia Tech program s over the top of jeans you know they they work and starting lineup they had him and Howard together but with Howard out now hes the fiveman and look at this I mean hes just perfect inside position stays with it he was just up and he beat everybody off the floor twice great Hustle Franklin has three double doubles this season for Georgia Tech fouled in the corner right in front of that yellow jacket bench and that was Withers well I know that Withers has made a couple of Threes in this game but that was going to be a tough shot you dont bail him out with a foul thats going to be three free throws that was Maxwell I mean wasnt a whole lot there Mike but enough and you saw the reaction from Passenger second on Tristan Maxwell three free throws coming up for Jalen Withers Applause 77 on the season for Withers hits the first now a message from Coyote Tractor Applause my experience if you work the land you got to be a jack of all trades you gotta have a little bit of optimism a whole lot of getgo Applause Music so Withers has already hit double digits in the first half ninth time this season and he gets two of three from the line six of nine is a team so far its working Texas one of two so that numbers starting to help us three ball from the corner easy board trainer 40 shooting in the first half for Louisville 27 percent for Georgia Tech so far Applause thank you Applause Ellis in the paint Music shot clock winding down for Withers and he held that follow through for an extra beat kind of gave us the Michael Jordan against Portland look over here and if theyre knocking those threes he was looking he was playing string music and he was doing everything how about Withers now three for three from the threepoint atmosphere foul coming up against Louisville Applause trainer picks up the foul Withers is feeling it perfect from Beyond The Arc just steps into that three ball and knocks it down seven point lead for Louisville Music the National Championship in a Duke uniform back 2010 on that staff for Kenny Payne and so you know obviously with his dad coming home over the source for him but there you see right there theres uh three national championships uh Danny Manning with Kansas in 88 and Danny and the Miracles Kenny Payne on that 86th National Championship team for Louisville and Milt Wagner who is the director of Player Development a member of the 86 National Championship team as well here at Louisville trying to get it to Withers Music Applause how about this team picture look at number 42 in the back row that was a lot of gray hair ago right behind Charles Barkley wouldnt want to be anywhere else in my man Rick molar right next to him didnt you see on the front all the way down on the right Kenny Payne 21 and Dara Smith 18 Kenny Payne all the way to the right Derek Smith a great team next to him G man you were business in the front party in the back back in the day huh yeah it was Ive been in the back row ever since first grade next to the teacher in any kind of class picture man that is fantastic a great moment between the GMan and Kenny Payne of the shoot around today as Coleman knocks down a three it wasnt it great to see your old teammates like that oh yeah Scotty Brooks who was in that picture was a hes been in on the pro level for a long time as a head coach and uh you know there wasnt much time for Kenny in his in his years in Philadelphia I mean Charles Barkley was our small forward and Ryan Anderson coming off the bench thats Curry close to the rim and I tell you I did Cindy Curry uh 21 he has really been on a nice little tour his last 12 86 rebound shooting about 58 so hes starting to feel more comfortable first points in the game for curry Sturdivant will launch a three and hit it for George attack Applause shooting is really bailing out Georgia Tech right now theyve made Seven threes in the game Mike here in the first half Curry able to gather in a congested area Kelly grabs it tried to get around the defender Withers we made sure that Kelly could not get to the bucket should have gone up with that you know the last time instead of trying to pass it out but here every in transition Kelly sees an opportunity to get to the rim Applause Miles Kelly played his prep ball at Hargrave Military Academy in Virginia Josh pastner talked to us about in the last couple of movies The Best of these last two practices that hes seen him in the last three weeks through this stretch he had a nice run Mike during home games against Virginia and Miami backtoback games he had 20 points at each of those in the game against Miami was a victory the loan ACC win this season for Georgia Tech Louisville still in search of that first ACC victory for Kenny Payne Music cards have won 12 with the last 13 in the series and they are 101 against Georgia Tech as members to the ACC boy theres lost it looking for a foul didnt get it heres Kelly Franklin trying to fill the lane maybe deserved a better fate Mike lands with the kick out James steps into the jumper and makes it hits a three wow that was a terrific play by Kamari Lance just took it all the way off the floor Drew everybody in got his teammate a nice look Louisville 4 of 10 on threepoint tries in the half Applause of these teams shooting way above their season average from behind the arc half a minute to go in our first 20minute segment Franklin lost the handle were going to get a timeout Louisville will take it 221 seconds to go in our first half Mike jaminsky this is the look they got them in the ball and this is where really where Louisvilles been pretty good in this game out in the open floor and you see when you got guys your front Court can bring it on the dribble kick it out that was a two on four break might have might have thought about pulling it out but its a good result first three of the game from Mike James who shoots 41 percent were outside the line and still you know with a fourpoint lead here Tom but Louisville 10 turnovers to this point in the game Id say seven of them were unforced and just miscommunication and bad decisions you know they could just clean that up somehow theyd be way ahead of the game and to their credit Georgia Tech we talked about they take care of the ball only three turnovers Mike James who just hit that three for Kenny Payne at home against Wake Forest had a 24point game a season high and eight rebounds in that game as well and you can see how he has stepped it up in the last seven games almost 15 points per game and thats against ACC competition too and uh you know the thing thats really helped him is that threepoint shot it really sets up his drive and allowing him to get into the lane hes now made 25 threes on the season and 16 of his last 32 for Mike James for threepointers closing seconds Withers he wants another one thats his first Miss from threepoint distance lands was coming over the top and a foul against the yellow jackets hes going to get two shots Applause second on Coleman Mike theres a look guys are looking at me hes got a free run right through the front of the rim according to Tech having trouble blocking guys out great look at it from behind the backboard and the foul against Nebo Coleman first free throws of the game for lands how about Kamari lands from the freethrow line Mike hes now 36 of 39 for the season well and when hes had his double figure games Thomas when hes gone to the line consistently so thats a big key for him freshman from Indianapolis Indiana cans them both averages just over five points per game for Lance hes got four 47 on the clock Sturtevant races it up the floor does not get the shot away Music Applause 3428 at the break the lead at home for the Louisville Cardinals shooting 46 percent as a team in the first half and they made four to finish inside or if theyre going to test that see if they still have the touch in the second half for Georgia Tech 10 Louisville turnovers but they havent scored a ton off of it theyve got to generate more offense there seven May threes for Georgia Tech overcoming the 30 shooting total in that first half and they are right in this one as they try to go inside Withers deflected it Howard tried to save it but could not do it so despite the turnover to open up the second half Georgia Tech has made Seven threes that is their average for an entire game this season Mike for May threes yeah and now its just a two of 15 inside of the arc so thats where uh Louisville size really benefits them James misses Franklin grabbed it the scoring discrepancy was a James threepointer reduced to a two from the first half Louisville had the halftime lead against Syracuse and at Boston College in ACC games lost both of those as Franklin Goes to the rim aggressively a good face up one dribble a strong take at the right hand lets see from Louisville right now if L Ellis starts to make his presence known in this game a pretty quiet first half for him just four points make it 60 man yep hes got to start to generate some offense for this team missed all three of his threepoint chances in the first half for Ellis hit that running floater the lead is five and a foul called no hes number three with uh for a reason hes the third member of his family with Albert as his first name stand at the airport mom yesterday and uh but he also reminds me of another number three Tom Allen Iverson plays with a lot of a bend and especially in the Payne area Kelly hell hit that Baseline jumper for Georgia Tech Applause truly great news for Josh passer and and the yellow jackets to see him really get into a nice Rhythm offensively at only five points on the loss at home against Duke on Saturday and Franklin produces a turnover Sturdivant leans into a three ball long rebound to Ellis yeah and I got you know they just wanted to test that see if the touch was still there I got to think that shooting the threepoint shooting percentage is going to come down and Ellis crafty to the basket Bill Ellis for Louisville Music Applause leading scorer for this team against over 17 points per game fourth of the ACC Franklin off the entry James has his arms in the air there was contact First on James yeah he just the one thing he does Tom he always keeps his dribble alive and he can really get the ball up on the rim in a lot of different ways to finish using that Rim as an ally coach Payne has given him a lot of responsibility this season you hear it in the shoot round all the time Mike the last person he asks about those various offensive Concepts and defensive for that matter is L Ellis he must know so it filters down to the rest of the team and this you know the things that Kenny has had to live with you know the good news LL is 100 assists on the year coming in the bad news 88 to 88 turnovers you know for your primary ball handler its not a good ratio but he uh he can make electric plays for those five assists per game gorillas best in the team James guarded by Kelly in a fouling score second on Kelly and thats the thing if that matchup stays the same that James really needs to be aggressive attack Kelly try to get that third foul on him thats how miles Kelly feels about that second personal foul Ellis put that needle the curry thats good bullet cards that was a tough pass and a tough catch at Close Quarters inside Curry though watch this I mean there are a lot of jerseys between him and the ball and a lot of times the bounce pass works better there but good catch and finish just two points in the first half for curry Franklin picked up that foul on the previous play Curry finishes off the old school threepoint play senior from Fort Wayne Indiana on Junior College transmitter Logan College in Illinois second year in the Louisville program for curry as Georgia Tech keeps it alive he lines it up Franklin tried to follow just mistimed it by a hair that would have been dynamic Applause over the shoulder to Curry looking for a cam second effort foul was called at the feed from Ellis that almost looked like it went through by the way Mike thats the third foul on Miles Kelly heres the play this Curry these two have really been working well together and yeah I was on the front side of it a bit of an optical illusion you know looking to see if Franklin had come up through the cylinder to get a piece of that but it was a clean on the other side Sydney Curry just a 49 free throw shooter on the season looking good from the line gotta admire the intensity from these two teams fighting at The Rim Mike with Franklin up there to contest Curry and so far in this half Tom Georgia Tech o of three from behind the arc that was after making seven in the first half on threepointers trailer the war grabbed it just checked in for Georgia Tech Sturdivant on the Run Applause Music still just 31 as a team from the floor for Georgia Tech Sturtevant past the first offender Music Applause out of bounds well stay at this end of the Court shot clock reset to 20 for Georgia Tech Applause four games Josh pastors team had only shot 22 percent on threepointers player seven of 19 and threes tonight were giving the shooters a lot of room on the threepoint line if they are going to test that uh threepoint percentage out late in the shot clock more Ellis individual spin cycle couldnt finish too much spin more with the hammer Jalen Moore trying to bring the house down Applause discussion with Jamie lucky Applause good game for them is Franklin nine rebounds for him hes been on the offensive last six points Applause Music what happened it was a dead ball and there was a collision at half court and uh rather than the only thing it could have been was a dead ball technical but uh Jamie lucky decided there was nothing there so no harm no foul early on in our second half so glad that youre with us for ACC basketball these two teams have demonstrated they clearly want to come away with wins tonight incredible effort so far from Louisville and Georgia Tech shot clock is inside of 10 through the lane able to regather Withers watch out with the three ball tonight cant convert on that one and Coleman pulls it in well this was yet the score in this half still at 14 he made three threepointers in the first half for Louisville Applause Georgia Tech has lost seven in a row in the series skier in Louisville yeah that Withers more match up a good one to watch here again late the shot clock for Sturtevant has to fire away long rebound to Moore Sturdivant to Cutter and it falls and hell go to the freethrow line Applause see thats where you get your shot up on the rim good things happen they got the offensive rebound right here the defense is scattered and its just a straight basket cut a lot of times when offensive rebound we talk about the three ball being open that time everything opened up inside there were no bodies to score Applause Moore got it back trying to put it on the floor Kelly oh Google lucky this they should never give up an offensive rebound on a free throw almost turned into three points for Miles Kelly leading scorer tonight for Georgia Tech with 12 Music before tonight GMan the last time these programs had met was last year at the ACC tournament in Brooklyn that was a win for Louisville 8474 in the first round before they lost to Virginia by a point in the second round the Virginia Tech went on to win the title last year beating Duke in the championship game were inside of 10 once again Ellis wasting their time how about the spark provided by more so far in the second half but if you had to pick something with Ellis I think hed settle for that shot rather than letting him get into the lane Coleman around the edge down the lane and fouled by Withers second on Withers see now you know in that I think its a wasted foul because you get Coleman that would have been a tough shot for him hes going left you know youve driven him off the threepoint line good job there but then you put him here and he maybe gets into a little bit of Rhythm hes had a tough time finding his shot tonight six points for Devo Coleman to a five from the floor and the two makes our threepointers two of the seven made by Georgia Tech in the game all of those in the first half mind you Applause Withers picked up his second personal Coleman is 68 from the line body of work this season another toughness of rebound back tip off of the Miss free throw Sturdivant too strong Applause Louisville just firing that ball crosscourt getting away with it oh and the known big bailout there I mean that that was going to be an impossible shot lands was fouled in earns free throws and two of two from the line you talked about his prowess at the line hes the last guy you bail out on a shot like this this one hits the side of the backboard it deserves repeating what Kamari lands has done from the free throw line hes two for two tonight Josh pastors well aware of his skill at the freethrow line Curry comes out but Cora four is back in 34 in white from Louisville and you know what this is Kenny Payne showing some confidence in him tight game second half giving him some minutes there hes only his second game mind you Louisville led by as many as seven in that first half and five at halftime gliding in is Sturtevant and he has been terrific getting to the paint that was just a take from half court double digits for Sturtevant Mike 10 points well above his season average with 63 per game for the senior from Norcross Georgia well remember too David Smith out in this game and somebody had to step up from the guard hes the back hes the point guard for this team for Sturtevant doing a nice job filling in there was Withers trying to make his way to the rim and a foul was called against Georgia Tech Jalen Moore is first hes the shortest guy on the floor for Tech and he just splits everybody he goes through four Defenders to get that layup playing his 101st career Collegiate game tonight transfer from Southern Cal Sturtevant Applause slamming at home he didnt know the crowd finally told him to go to the basket there was nobody guarding him and he was like all right Im up and dunk that was fabulous dropping the hammer for the Cardinals Sturdivant again puts on the breaks and hits big answer that time Applause lands catch and release volleyballed around Coleman was diving for it James ends up with the ball and a foul against Louisville its going to be against Mike James Applause score for listening to the crowd take it to the rim and thats what he did on the rim that was fine but see I mean thats one and Kenny Payne said thats what hes brought to practice that energy has really lifted everybodys spirits and then I think hes going to be a crowd favorite here pretty soon foreign Applause just a twopoint game tech oh of seven now from behind the arc and start the half Coral four midrange Kelly out jumps everybody for the rebound is actually a better job on their defensive glass limiting Second Chance opportunities Music foreign had 18 points at Notre Dame earlier this season no losing effort ful with the block they send it back to Ellis down pass on cora four the catch shoulder the turnaround rejected Franklin how about Louisville throwing football passes all over the court foreign Applause listen to the crowd and he delivers with the jam big chip now since that point bit of an uphill climb for Coach Pastor yeah no well its just a great team everything came together for that coveted year and uh maybe she could revisit that uh the covid mask served them well through 2021 they were 116 in conference play they got one of the double buys they were the fourth seed one against Miami and they had a forfeit against Virginia the first ACC Championship since 1993 for Georgia Tech our good friend friend Bobby kremins the head coach at the time he had taken them to the final four in 1990 and you know Bobbys watching from somewhere tonight trainer jumped by Franklin and thats tough to do no Franklins been a man inside in this half chance four couldnt follow and now both teams might have not made a three here in the second half Applause taken back by Georgia Tech and Coleman just kind of wild action right now with both teams killer jackets seven of 24 threepoint shots all seven of those makes in the first half Applause Louisvilles only made three threepointers in the game even the shot clock in this half two Tom with many more opportunities Second Chance opportunities for Georgia Tech Louisvilles got to do a better job at that time the first missed rebound the Georgia Tech with more rebounds so far this half that they had in the first half total trainer more up for the rebound for Georgia Tech so once again the yellow jackets with the three can take the lead it would be their first since very early in this game Mike when they LED 86 at the 1415 mark of the first half Music its like a pastor timeout Applause so theyve got two remaining trailing by two because Louisville has missed its last five shots well step aside for just a sec players of the year from the ACC ENT and right now you know weve seen this with Josh bassner not afraid to use a timeout here I I dont think you like the way that possession was setting up 12 seconds on the shot clock a chance for his team to you know tie or take the lead here so getting everybody on the same page they still have two timeouts for the half cards are trying to win their first game since they defeated Florida a m in fact they won two in a row there against Western Kentucky and Florida a m and have not won since well what has been an ally too for Louisville has hurt them in the second half Peck has not been shooting the ball while theyve had 14 misses but gotten seven offensive rebounds and thats something that Louisville thats a battle they should be winning in this game Applause Sturtevant and Kelly both with 12 points to lead the way for Georgia Tech Sturdivant hesitation dribble weak side Here Comes Franklin Applause another offensive rebound and that Clint has just been Howard has not played much in this half but Franklin has been fabulous in the middle eight points now from Franklin wither is a leading scorer for Louisville with 14 has not scored yet in the second half Turn Around from trainer and if they can get him the ball in the middle of that zone hes tall enough he can make that shot Music Five Points now for trainer they gotta just they got to just face guard Franklin at this point on the offensive glass and keep him away trying to tie it up on consecutive possessions Warren into a double team does not get the roll but a foul was called Applause Jayvon Franklin went in for the follow on this play now watch Pastor top of your screen hes in the corner there now hes get back on D look at him go hes stepping in but this is the thing okorafor turned around never got a body on Franklin and he went right to the rim Applause Josh pastner still with that athletic ability along that sideline you know and you dont see a lot of that these days Mike hes going with the shirt and tie hes discarded the code but yes like youve got Earl Grant at BC wheres coat and Ty hes sharp dresser Mike young Virginia Tech its funny some some guys after you know the covid nobody was wearing coat inside some guys came back Im a little old school Applause Ellis against miles nowhere to go he needs some help Ellis has been quiet for a while Withers wants it and hits the three right in front of his own bench really nice play by James to make that they talk about six five being able to see over everybody Withers comes alive with his 43 of the game at first points of the second half career high for made threes in a game for Jalen Withers Kelly got it back and put it in but again that was Franklin that kept that play alive Georgia Tech refusing to go away Applause James out of the corner ran into a triple team yeah theyre stumbling Jeremy lucky pointing in the direction of more Applause the officials are still trying to figure it out and well update you when we come back what a game between the Cardinals and the yellow jackets its a twopoint game Music forward weathers hitting that three see if that gets him reignited now that three by Withers is Fourth of the game at first points of the second half Jalen Withers red shirt Junior from Charlotte North Carolina Music played his high school basketball in Ohio Applause time this season that Withers has gotten double digits in scoring from Louisville Ellis Ellis will go to the freethrow line got the crowd up out of their seats you know hes had a couple of those moves that he hasnt been able to finish he gets he picks up the foul right here but just left Sturtevant behind a pretty good take against Jalen Moore so it looked like thats the thats the third on more they had given Kelly a foul before the break but they changed it to more so Kelly has three and more has three Applause all right Kellys got 14 points Sterling 12 they are the leading scorers with Ellis at the freethrow line for Louisville 78 of the season Ellis the double digits with that free throw Mike after scoring eight points at Notre Dame first shot defense has been pretty good for Louisville they just have to get on the defensive glass fourpoint lead for the car its Coleman trying to cut into it cant do it on the drive third job there and also with Coleman making him a driver dont let him get his feet organized December 14th at win against Western Kentucky Ellis had 30 points and 10 assists for the DoubleDouble Ill tell you Sturm is doing a nice job on Ellis defensively though late in the shot clock for Withers twowheeler power dribble 09 and they get a foul going to the rim Applause third on Franklin Mike Music I thought they might have overpassed right here just very fortunate to be aggressive things happen though when you try to do that Franklin has three personal fouls also has 11 rebounds tonight for Georgia Tech wheeler at the line Applause Maxwells coming in with wheeler at the line just 37 percent on the season Coleman comes out for coach pastner Applause seven points for Coleman as he exits Applause wheeler unable to harvest the free throw and then a foul was called as Mike James what that hurts you two ways one he picks up an unnecessary foul and theyre going to be shooting oneonone in that situation Applause another foul on James thats four now both teams are in the bonuses GMan mentioned Music Georgia Tech in the game seven of 11 from the line Music biggest lead for Louisville with seven in the first half led by five at halftime four right now were going inside of six minutes to go in regulation so great to have you with us Army and jiminsky Courtside trainer misses the turnaround grabs it one thing about Maxwell is not going to be shy about looking for his own offense just one point in the game for Maxwell hes missed his only threepoint try Applause shot clock down to five Sturtevant individual effort what they did nice job of keeping him in front that time making him settle for the jump shot he has been very effective getting to the rim Dallas the trainer just the type of play This Crowd needs carry that energy through to the end of the game Maxwell on the perimeter shot clock winding down he got pumped by Withers Applause Withers who has a doubledouble tonight 1710 and how about this collaboration Ellis behind the back line of the defense to JJ trainer Louisvilles got a whole host of players thatll go up and catch that and finish with the ring this little thing I mean the last the last front end of the oneonone Georgia Tech had they missed theyve got to convert these two Maxwell as we just talked about he has not been to the line a lot this year one or two in the game that was just his 10th free throw of the season for Tristan Maxwell out of North Mecklenburg High School in Huntersville North Carolina the lead is five for Louisville four and a half minutes to go in regulation they give Kenny Payne his first ECC win as a head coach working deep into the shot clock for trainer double on the Baseline couldnt find wheeler miles on the Run Miles Kelly lays it in a really nice concentration that time Ellis hustling back ran underneath him 16 points for Miles Kelly trainer from the corner hit the three as it spun on down Coleman ended up on the court right now its a three by trainer yeah the shots gonna count its just like its going to be I didnt see who the foul was called it was on the weak side that trainer three was spinning counterclockwise down the net so we need to sort this out and we will when we come back again it was trainer in the corner for three for Louisville 5751 cards again it was wheeler and Coleman who got tangled up underneath the basket after the made three by JJ Trainor and GMan just got the update from AJ design yeah so what they did is this is going to be a flagrant one right here on Wheeler so it can be two free throws for Georgia Tech and then it will be their ball underneath all the way down underneath Louisvilles basket here so that play right there by wheeler four in White against Coleman three in Gray deemed excessive and or unnecessary flavored one so thatll put Coleman at the freethrow line of Wheeler the sophomore from Richmond Virginia to that Louisville bench and then as Mike mentioned Georgia Tech will have possession of the basketball which you know is that foul could Moon large and you know you got some momentum with that threepoint shot and now the Georgia Techs got a chance for a uh four or five point play out of this one of two from the line for Coleman makes it 5752 thats a couple of points theres some points they left at the free throw line remember early on they uh the first one and one they shot they missed the front end and then that one only one of two nine of 16 in the game from the freethrow line for Coach pastor and they have struggled this season from the line only went to the line six times in the loss Saturday against Duke and that was lopsided 8643 against the Blue Devils who won yesterday against wake by two Coleman shot clock is inside a 10 Sturtevant release trainer up the ladder for the rebound the series recently has belonged to Louisville theyve won 12 in the last 13 three in a row in the series its like every pass the crowd is gasping Curry lost it a third of it has it on the Run off on the wing to Moore who got fouled and hit the deck Applause you know what and I cannot thats a thats a good foul in that situation more 70 percent shooter and this is one of the few times Curry has had the ball knocked out of his hands but you know what right here take the hard foul and go and earn it at the line its the fourth on Withers and more at the freethrow line Georgia Tech by the way Mike is trying to win here in Louisville for the first time since January of 1992 its going back away yes sir thats a different conference yes they have a recent win in the series that was February of 2020 as more converts on the second free throw thats not one here since 92 trying to make some history Kenny Payne trying to make history with his first ACC win on the shoulders of L Ellis and his Louisville teammates as we go inside of three minutes to go in regulation well lets see how Louisville handles this situation were going to run some clock be patient but this team has to give themselves a little bit extra at the end to finish James from number one and thats with him with four fouls just rising up all kinds of confidence matching the largest lead of the game for Louisville and Ellis reaching in against tournament first on Ellis Applause and we talked about it with James Applause last four games shooting 50 percent from three has enough first made three of the game for Mike James one of three on threepointers and now seven points third event at the free throw line Applause Ellis picked up the foul trying to guard Sturdivant yeah he he thought he had a clean pick and uh maybe had a pretty good argument even with all this commotion Georgia Tech hanging around GMan the lead back to five Applause thats what it was at halftime 3328 well Ill tell you what on those two free throws Sturtevant did not look like a 57 free throw shooter 14 points for Sturtevant this is out of nowhere Mike last three games hes at two four and seven points and in the absence of Smith he was out with an ankle injury for Georgia Tech come on the year he only averages 19 minutes a game Ellis missed the following out of bounds Archer Tech basketball Applause Bill Covington Junior was right on top of it Mike and that was the unfortunate thing for Louisville is theyre outside of the two minute Mark still so that cant be looked at on First Look it did look like it may have gone off to Withers diving for it there were two Georgia Tech players in the neighborhood how about this one between Louisville and Georgia Tech fivepoint game with 204 to go heres another look Mike yeah it was close it looked like Withers was the last one to get a hand on it but again I mean look at you know heard of its there too Mike watch the right hand assertive yeah this team is this these teams are combined one of 20 on the year and then look at the effort here at the end of the game Sensational effort by both of these teams really under the circumstance Ill tell you what for all the for all the excitement in the crowd and the big plays that Louisville has made for Georgia detective to be hanging in there right now says a lot about them Kenny Paynes team with a fivepoint lead to match their halftime lead heres your upcoming schedule presented by Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina Florida State comes to town on Saturday Mike home game here home game against the Seminoles they lost that Florida State on December 10th 7553 just imagine what the wind would do for the cycle of this team though Kelly Withers adding to that double double total with another rebound 17 points 12 boards Jalen Withers LL is time maybe Applause deliberate possession lens was driving late in the shot clock Applause Miles Kelly just picked up his fourth Music if theres a guy you know oneonone but still I always I always threw out the percentages in the last two minutes of the ball game especially a close one however if you want one guy for Louisville to free throw line is number 22 four for four from the line in the game Applause and this is something actually Sturtevant is having hes got a little blood issue on his leg a little cut and theyre giving him some time we see which they have been doing I mean thats you know it is built departure from years past everybody satisfied uh crowd not thrilled well they they wanted him out of the game yeah Applause predictably Lance makes it pure I mean he just doesnt have enough attempts Mike or else hed be number one in the conference in freethrow shooting Applause right now RJ Davis meets the league 88 how about Lance six of six from the line and a timeout Louisville the lead is back up to seven inside the Yum Center now time for our Coyote Tractor turning points right now those turning points late in the second half belong to Louisville heres trainer first out of the corner Michael three yeah hes got a really nice look at it and maybe you take a chance but 30 percent from him but then James a guy now you have to cover up uh two big threes big swing right there just think about an agonizing minute in 29 seconds for this crowd and for that coaching staff and this team Applause just means so much for both of these teams you know these players Mike they desperately want to give Kenny Payne his first ACC win as their head coach Music as we mentioned theyd had the halftime lead twice in ACC games couldnt hold on to it but you know what if you look at their roster and theyve had everybody in that roster has had good stretches they just havent had them at the same time good point in this game theyve been you know Willows has been fabulous and you know theyve had guys make big shots theyve got three double figure scorers right now good balance you know in that starting five because they can win it would snap a 10game losing streak and heres the thing yeah you know if youre Louisville do you take a chance on Georgia Tech o of 10 from three in this half after making seven threes in the first half yep Applause theyre probably going to need to make it three or two down stretcher Mike you know the most important thing for Louisville is to defend without fouling at this point theyre going to press up a little bit try to take some time off the clock 129 on the game clock Louisville twotime house tour detective one this matches the largest lead of the game up by seven sturt of it looking for some daylight Applause three from the line Second following Ellis well and Ill tell you what Sturtevant has been able to get into the lane almost at will in this game it appears Mike that hes just gained confidence as the game has gone on yeah I mean its you know its Josh Pastor has been on a he said the uh search engine going all year long we talked about a 10 different starting lineups Applause Music Applause 16 points for Sturdivant he and Miles Kelly whos was about to check into the game and now hes got no human City no its his offense for defense Jordan with the four fouls so theyre gonna pull him out on this end of the floor put Maxwell in Applause Music Applause pressure on the inbounds right to the rim follow a temp from Georgia Tech and a whistle Applause yeah that was uh that was just a freshman mistake right there he got nervous with the count going Adam jumped almost came in out of bounds and it looked like Moore got to miss that one coming in and then he picks up the foul first foul by Lands and right now it was funny Mike James was signaling over to Kenny Payne saying let me take the ball in bounds lets see if they change that 17 points for Sturdivant five of six from the freethrow line and in this situation the guy inbounding the ball is the most important player on the floor bounces out could have been a one possession game trainer went up to grab it rolls again on a minute to play fourpoint lead for Louisville Ellis lands launches a three and hits it what mistake on the other end Kamari lands makes the three Georgia Tech turns it over Ellis on the way up by Sturtevant come on they had him bottled up this was a this was almost a desperation three Holmen cant believe it first three of the game for plans on the seventh made three of the game for Louisville and theyve hit three critical threepointers in this second half with Ellis well that you saw a you saw a pretty good snapshot of a freshman on both ends of the floor right there Murray lands not getting the ball in bounds fouling putting on the line and then making that three what a sequence for the Cardinals were not done yet though GMan 338 seconds on the clock timeout Kenny Payne he wants to make sure everybodys on the same page defensively after that Ellis free throw the lead is now eight it is the largest of the game for Louisville 33 and change on the clock so Lance was on the inbounds at one end of the floor and made the mistake here with the steal by Sturtevant then comes in and picks up the foul in that situation very lucky the sturdomen missed one of the two free throws and then this just a complete prayer at the end of the shot clock sometimes my prayers are answered yeah I know sometimes it helps you you dont know that you dont know Kenny Payne knows he knows what it means wow that that might be right here pack it in yep no drives No fouls Five Guys on the glass tamari Lance has a story to tell the maybe a little Hotchkiss maybe a guy they look at I know hes not going to be afraid to take a shot the lack of threepoint makes in the second half doing in Georgia Tech seconds ticking away about a four second Difference game to shot Applause Music Kelly looking to drive James came over with a help defense and they have to foul Jalen Withers another rebound thats 13 in the game for Withers everybody up inside KFC Yum you know it was a funny time I was thinking today when youre talking about this game but how much pressure Louisville must the players must have been feeling to finish the deal here you know everybodys thinking oh Georgia Techs coming in you know its a first win and every is like a its a done deal we just have to fill up not the case but it looks like theyve done what they had to do get this game so Withers is at the free throw line hes got 13 rebounds to tie his career high and now 19 points is one shy of his career high in points so what a night for Jalen Withers it appears that thats going to be enough for a victory for Louisville but gaskus couldnt get a three away Coleman will fire and that will do it and Kenny Payne gets his first ACC victory 6858 is the final counts and the respect between the two head coaches and Kenny Payne will allow himself a smile hes got that first ACC win Withers led the way with the DoubleDouble 19 points 13 boards three other players got the double digits for Mike jaminsky and our entire crew Im Tom wormy thanks so much for
