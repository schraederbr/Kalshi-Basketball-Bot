Ford for ACU and away we go wolf pack and Wildcats NC State with the first possession this is DJ horn the transfer from Arizona State NC State in the home white DJ Burns he started six for six on Monday and he Wast no time getting the wolf back on the board and here is that pressure you talked about yeah now that first offens in possession thats one the thing NC State did really good in the first game they got a paint tou kicked it and then DJ Burns just knocks down a little midrange which weve seen him do many times Al deba on the catch now mcneel to point guard Cameron steel can shoot the three over 41 last year the 68 senior thats going to be a fun match up on this end he has to guard Burns inside on the other end Burns is going to have to guard him out there yeah theyre going to have the both of their hands full I know DJs going to have to step out and really cover him from three but the same thing on this end as you see he seals inside so theyre both going to have their enhance P for sure DJ says hey youre going to have to guard me too pal exactly old Mark gried reference NC State 43 barely a minute gone Hunter Jack Madden gives it up to Arion Simmons they try a three in front of Dr way off a little bit early in the shot clock thats one of the things coach Tanner probably doesnt want to see especially knowing NC State wants to run back coach Keats in his seven season coming off a trip to the NCAA tournaments and as we mentioned six guys making their debut for him on Monday Inc State getting to see a lot of these new players and uh the fan base has to be excited about what they saw yeah they played really well especially against the Citadel uh obviously as the season goes on youre going to see more and more out of each one uh they each bring something unique which is something Kevin going to need going forward the butler transfer Jaden Taylor sinks them both hes a really intriguing twoway player for NC State Orel got the ball also got him with the body and Kavon mlan well go to the line of shoot too well take another look yeah thats one of the things we we said you know NC State really likes to pressure in the full court mlan really quick Shifty guard able to get going get downhill obviously getting fou at the end and Tak a little bit of punishment uh but he gets an opportunity to get two free throws here playe running the offense I think thats one of the keys especially in this game is can they handle that pressure The Citadel especially early on kind of struggled against NC States pressure so if if ACU can really handle it theyre going to have good opport unities in this game ab and Christian was up by as many as 18 in still water and then they had some struggles supression especially those last two minutes Oklahoma State really turned it on tried to pressure them a little bit they struggled to get the ball in bounds uh and they were able to CW back in the game Jaden Taylors been aggressive hell go to the line for two more and both of these teams love to turn you over you get a look at what NC States been able to do under Kevin Keats and I know you think that their defense can be even better this year in terms of maybe not in terms of first in the ACC and forcing turnovers but just in general the versatility and the different guys that they have at length yeah they got a lot of depth I think they can legit go 10 11 guys if they need to very similar to abene Christian they played 11 guys in their comp in their first game out so theyre able to pressure theyre able to get bodies in and out and theyre able to do it going hard at all times 15 to shoot this is Dea leading score in Stillwater lost it off of his body says Ry styan that was a good defensive possession they did that against Oklahoma State the first play of the game ran that back door action I think it was DJ horn on the wing did a good job of staying home thirdy year head coach Brett Tanner prior eight years as the associate head coach under Joe Golding couple of NCAA tournament trips during that time he said look this is easily the most difficult nonconference schedule that weve ever played right they start in Still Water now theyre here in Raleigh and a chance for another Power five win that could be huge for the wild cats Id say theyve handled it pretty well so far marel to the basket for two you have to think that gives them so much confidence right I mean this is a team that a couple years ago and theyve got some veterans that was on that team a couple years ago that beat Texas in the NCAA tournament so theyve got that NCAA tournament experience but also just to start the year off with a win in a hostile environment Ste by Taylor and he missed the lay in really good job by him unable to finish but getting in that passing Lane being able to create an opportunity for NC State at Aiden a gayan contesting his shot the 610 senior former AC DC player at Louisville this is Hunter Jack Madden and thats what he did in Stillwater he knocked out some big shots down the stretch to help him to the win yeah hes a really good Shooter had a really good first game I think thats one of the things we need to see especially when they get some paint touches being able to kick it and knock down those open shots cuz then itll kind of spread out NC State a little bit more especially cuz they want to go inside out and with 14 points in the open Burns to a cutting DJ horn lefthanded floater is good did they wave off the basket I was blocked out Scott I couldnt tell either if they counted blocking foul its going to be an N1 opportunity here for horn yeah I think he was inside the semicircle yeah he had his back foot on the line um but thats one of the things that we had mentioned as well you know if NC State can make some open shots obviously DJ is going to get a lot of attention they do a good job on the initial defense right there DJ horn just cuts and DJ being a great passer that he is is able to find him on on that cut so horn with the threepoint play Michael oconnell in for NC State what a game he had in his debut made four of five threes and also and seven assists played a great game again he brings that energy very similar to diara I think theyre going to be a really good piece forc State diara guarding steel operating on the Block Birds I told you last game he was going to shoot a couple threes this year thats the first try in his NC State Career but daba gets a run out JBC comes flying in for the rebound just into the game for aene Christian thats good energy you know see rustles back doesnt think that hes going to finish in transition able to get the rebound and again these are extra possessions that you need especially in a game that could end up being close at the end tough move by Diva took some contact no whistle McConnell looks to push and thats going to be their game they solid defensive possession able to get it pushed pushed in the Run DJ horn a good shooter that he is gets a good look NC State leads it by five but the wild cats have come out shooting it well from Deep Scott yeah I mean thats one of the things especially watching Oklahoma State game they they didnt make a ton of them because they really want to play inside out but again I think because they want to go inside an uncharacteristic year for them theyve won 20 plus games in four the last five seasons and they have that good continuity on their roster so theyre good bet to maybe even finish a little bit higher this season they had a a Down Season last year for sure but theyve got some really good upper classmen theyve mixed in some really good shooting with some really good big men which is a good combination to have and he give Simmons a low post Music touch good contest by diara a gayan misses the hook shot and mid middle Brooks iss playing his first minutes tonight for Coach gats gets the rebound well we saw Casey Morel he might have been the first guy out here here in pregame warmups working on his shot and that one goes in yeah his shot was a little bit flat I thought in the first game you know Michael Connell does a really good job again just pushing the tempo a little bit getting that paint touch bringing the defense in Caseys patient steps through gets a nice Rhythm uh jump shot it helps that he got a layup to start the game get that confidence up U and get a good start this game speaking of confidence the wild cats from three theyre three for four as Emanuel Allen puts it in well Morel as you said hes seen the ball go in a couple times now thats all it takes see one going early and it makes it a lot easier the rest of the game but it I think it also you know to him that he was out here first early on was the first one out here working on his game so he was ready for tonight thats what you used to do a long time ago see he touched it last itll be the wild cats andc State possession yeah that they just got to do a little bit better job theyre getting in those paint touches but especially when the defense is helping in there theyre getting a hand on the ball you got to be able to kick that to the corner and try and get that jump shot what are your early impressions of this game right NC State leading by six obviously the Wildcats right now the three ball is carrying them yeah theyve done a good job of of knocking down some shots I honestly I think its a little bit kind of unar characteristic of them is that they want to start getting the ball in the post especially against Oklahoma State thats one of the things that they did early on so I think once they can kind of get to that mixing in a couple threes here and there is is a good start for them middle Brooks well he can hit that shot but NC State so far has been colds from three the W back 0 for four and hes going to be able to get that when he wants especially with him and DJ on the floor at the same time when hes setting that pick and pop action hes going to be able to space it out to a corner freshman Dennis Parker with the kick ball there spoke of NC States death and burns is out there along with Taylor the other three coming off the bench Allen got a great look from the top of the key well thats uh Simmons doing a great job of setting a really good screen on uh I believe it was Taylor uh knocked him down the ground but again thats thats the type of looks that you want coming off of the screen feet set open uncontested you got to live with those and theres the pressure that abene Christian wants to apply and a good job of getting out of the the Trap and Middleton creating afterwards Allen lost his shoe how about the size of Middlebrooks right we he just missed the three told you he can hit that shot he took about two steps got the contact and the continuation yeah I think he he brings a unique dynamic espe ESP him and dar are a little bit different um they can play to four they can play to five but I also think theyre really good compliments to DJ Burns which is ultimately what they need in what ways do you see them complimenting him so I think both of them can spread the floor I think especially when DJs on the floor hes not one thats going to really space it even though he says hes going to shoot some threes this year uh you need a couple guys that can space that floor especially when hes going to get so much attention mlan with an open jumper from the ACC logo able to hit that but its a sevenpoint NC State Advantage I think NC State a couple times just got lost on defense like even right there we shouldnt they shouldnt be giving up a open look especially on the ACC logo yeah I might need to see that one again I think I will slightly disagree that looked like he was set there yeah I think Id give that to him he State asking for the basket to count going to get horn back in the game the seir deu is checked in the sophomore from the New Orleans for ACU I think Taylors been much more aggressive especially tacking the basket early on in this game had a lot of success there big part of YNC States already built this 10point lead and not just him morcel Middlebrooks theyve been able to get to the rim Taylors doing a good job hounding the ball close to a 5 Seconds wol pack showing off that pressure defense the foul on Middlebrooks will take us to our Under 12 timeout brought something to the table especially that first game I think thats one of the things that can make NC State dangerous its hard to really game plan for a group collectively that can all score the basket so theyve got potentially you know Five Guys that can average double figures so anybody any night can be the guy those five guys already have 13 points tonight most impressively seven from Taylor whos also picked it up on the defensive end and he takes a lot of pride in that Allen to the rim with a nice reverse theres that first play they had against Oklahoma State getting those back Cuts thats where NC State you know abene Christian using that pressure against them to be able to get those back Cuts so they got to stay home a little bit so Allen already with a quick five he did not score against Oklahoma State their leading score from last season meanwhile I mean I feel like a broken record here with Jaden Taylor and I think NC State is just fine with that right Taylor to the rim again getting fouled yeah in attack mode already shot five free throws NC state has shot seven on the day so obviously theyre trying to make a point to get to the hole and uh Force the officials to make a call Taylor averaging just shy of 13 points per game last year with Butler as their leading score he had 18 against NC State when they played in the battle for Atlanta so they got a chance to see firsthand just how good he is and on the other side he got a chance to see uh the style of NC State the way that they play the the culture uh and the family atmosphere and it it got his attention yeah and thats one of the things that hes known of is always being a scorer and I think especially tonight one of the things youre seeing especially him being the primary on ball defender of the point guard bringing up hes doing a good job of applying pressure and making abene Christian really start their offense out I think a really big addition when you think of Casey morcel and what he can do on the defensive end now you got another guy that can lock you down yeah and I think all of them especially tough shot as I say morcel with a hand in his face and Allen still able to score it thats about all you can do right there thats really good defense uh but a tough bucket right there for sure burs oh spin move how did he do that I have no idea a little bit saucy from the big man right there showing off those guard skills he is one of the most fun players in the country no doubt about it great personality but NC States got to do a better job I know it was a great move by DJ and the crowds going crazy but you got to do a good job of getting back stopping the ball and then ultimately you got to get got to get the defensive rebound Leonardo betso with a bucket on one and and a block on the other trying to cut into the Cy State lead and throws it to Ernest Ross on the bench all right Scott you got to break this down for me I dont know how you do you see a big guy doing a spin move starting from the threepoint line off balance lefthanded I dont know if thats a floater or a sky hook but it still counts for two I think he wanted to call after too hes saying look part of the reason I was fading away is cuz I got pushed big fellow was a little bit off balance but again he just has such good touch especially around the rim you know almost expect them to make those Burns already with six points on three of four shooting 15 to shoot for Morel and NC State DJs trying to get a deep post touch there but they do a good job keeping it away from him then abene Christian does a good job of forcing a tough shot just got to finish with the rebound 5 seconds on the shot clock itll be oconnell to trigger it in from the Baseline betsol comes out especially in the exhibition NC State had some really good Baseline out of bounds play so aaln Christian can pay attention theyve got a couple quick hitters out of this they got a gayon in there to guard Burns and be a rim protector one to shoot for oconnell no know if he tipped that or if he just rushed it a little bit but but U DJ did a good job of swinging that and I think that was a good job by Simmons of recognizing late shot clock forcing the ball to get out of his hand and because it is a shot clock violation it does allow NC State to set up its press deu the transfer from LSU Unice spent one year there now out in the Heart of Texas DJ horn fouling daba as he was in the process of coming to get the ball there Id just be a little bit more cautious DB is not known to be an elite shooter so maybe let him have that catch he really wants to get downhill I feel like were he kind of wasted a foul there just let him get the catch and then keep him in front good box out by Casey Marcel there I think he drew the foul yeah Allen was being boxed out and it was Allen who fell down but hes also whistled for the foul I think they got KY lift listed at 63 but for his SI hes a really good rebounder especially on the offensive and the defensive end its going to result in one andone free throws here so NC State into the bonus with just over 9 minutes remaining in this first half and this will be their 10th and 11th free throws already in the game coach sters talking with the official uh they just got to do a little bit better job of showing their hands especially now that you know theyre in the bonus you dont want to get any picky tack ones see as a point of emphasis as zy state did not get to the line a lot against the city though compared to the Bulldogs on Monday night espe there you lose Jarel and chavon who draw a lot of fouls as well great pass and transition and again I think that just came out a little bit flat if he could get a little bit more Arc I think he makes that what a a finish by DJ Horn high off the glass over a gayan timeout ACU an offensive rebound and a nice take to the Rim Yeah and hes known for being a shooter I think he shot 41 last year at Arizona State didnt have a great shooting performance but I think these are the things that he brings to the team he brings leadership uh obviously hes been around for for a while so he knows how to play the game gets the offensive rebound and finishes so he hell be a big piece going forward wearing the number zero for NC State last couple years quavon Smith wore that number and I think right there with that nice left hand a little reminiscent of baby T baby T loveed the left hand very athletic jumping off the uh right foot as well I shot in state will give up yeah I dont know if thats the the best shot especially because NC State wants to run and that gives them an opportunity to get the rebound and and really push it got to be a little bit more selective on taking good shots Burns too good he loves going over that right shoulder and if if I was guarding him which I would not be able to do very well you got to get him to turn to the right he really wants to get to the left and I know a lot of people have been trying to figure him out and havent been able to find much success on it but really force them to go the other way Simmons foul on diara itll take us to our break nice start for NC State of 14 he need to go up yeah some great names on that list DJ thunderberg was here just couple years ago TJ Warren of course ACC Player of the Year Chucky Brown great player and a great guy too yeah lucky enough to play with TJ Warren uh for Simmons was fouled by BR to take us to the break and he missed them Music both good job of making DJ get a post touch really far out well gayan was doing what you said right trying to force him to go right he did you have to and I think to you got to remember hes a very good passer but its going to be much more difficult for him to make passes coming from the right hand so I think itll L eliminates a lot of things that he does well forcing him to that off hand now matched up with steel double team comes immediately and hes got that fall away just so skilled I mean anywhere inside 15 ft I just dont know what you do with that honestly hes able to create space with the fade away shoot a high little soft touch its just hard to defend he leads all scores with 10 McConnell McConnell got a tip on that Madden back out to Steel Allens had the hot hand in and out halfway around and down I think those are the shots that theyre theyre willing to take a good open look Im sure coach is telling them hey those are shots were going to make as the game goes on this the second time theyve run that Baseline out of bounds both times Simmons is trapped but again just so smooth great awareness he knows where the double team is coming from turns away from it and thats unguardable if hes going to make that shot and as we just showed you right he makes a high percentage of shots I have no idea who on this planet would be able to guard that maybe Wendy maybe maybe he could definitely Al Al the shot but he shoots it so high I still think he can get over him well defended By Di and a good box out by middle Brooks thats something ACU really wants to do they want to throw the ball inside but I think the length and size of NC States giving them some fits right now tough shot for horn not there and morcel comes flying in for the rebound there foul shots just great effort extra possessions going back to the line there are things that as a coach you love to see multiple efforts by two three different guys to create an extra possession diara coming off a great debut with the double double 10 points careerhigh 14 rebounds he also had three blocks which was a career Hive for him yeah he just brings Elite energy I think thats one of the things especially seeing him and a couple practices this year he brings it every night especially when you have a coach over there one of the things you dont want to have to worry about is effort and you know youre going to get that from him Davon mlan betti only I thought gave the wild cats 10 good minutes in their opener against Oklahoma State hes back in the post Allen forcing the issue and Bo diar thats going to be his second foul hes played his case saying hey I went straight up I think he went straight up but then I think when the contact hit him I think he brought his hands down just a little bit I think by rule you have to I mean technically his arms are not straight up but he didnt contact him with his arms at all yeah I think I think hes got a legit case there on Sunday Lehigh taking on North Carolina on the mens side thats it 200 followed by womens basketball triple header 17th ring Louisville hosting depal and then North Carolina hosting Davidson all games will be on the ACC Network and the ESPN Music app so a couple of free throws but still you look a 16point Advantage for NC State yeah I think a lot of its just them being a little bit more aggressive right now theyre also getting to the line about the dime from DJ M Brooks is there to clean it up has a great pass I mean ACU did a good job of getting their hands on the ball but middle Brooks again just bringing a second effort this is a wild cats team that really frustrated Oklahoma State defensively defens is their backbone as bettio has a nice move good spin move Oklahoma State game they actually called that for an offensive foul they got him on the hook uh but a good move back knocking on the door of 40 first half points still 5 minutes to go heres a turnover good active hands Id like to push that a little bit more to try to get an easy one instead of getting to the half court especially how good NC state has played in the half court defensively its the third turnover for NC State and right here its just all extra effort middle Brooks seeing that theres a contested layup getting the offensive rebound putting it back in and then right here just a good spin move off DJ finish underneath Yeah you mentioned it and and I watched that same tap that time he did a nice job not getting the elbow around the body of the defender right but more kind of side to side yeah and I will say he did a better job there it wasnt as obvious but even in that first game against Oklahoma State I dont know if I would have called it I I wouldnt have no its its a good move got to let the big men play down there middle Brooks out Dennis Parker back in on that other end I think Taylor when they especially when they trapped right there um its called Corner empty so there was no one in the corner and then you had Ben popping to an empty corner I think he had the opportunity to make that kick to him and get that open three especially with DJ taking two Defenders when hes rolling yaniel Rivera The Freshman from Puerto Rico checks in for ACU rolling the RS there nicely done you didnt play down there you played in Spain I did not a good friend of mine though Ben mcau played there for many years had a good career tend to shoot for horn de Gru has played nice defense last couple of minutes good possession and better offense is horn bails out the wol pack the clutch Wing three thats one of the frustrating Parts youre trying to you know claw back into the game you put together a good defensive possession and they still able to knock down a shot Rivera cutting travels he goes to go dho or a dribble handoff action theres no help so they almost have to switch it so it kind of creates a little bit of confusion but NC States doing a really good job of switching it and being sure pull up jumper about the only thing that hasnt gone in for Taylor tonight and jru is fouled on his way to the basket hell have a one and one I think ab and Christian starting to kind of get a little bit more comfortable starting to attack a little bit and start to draw some fouls and get to the free throw line they just havent been able to capitalize at the free throw line so far we saw some full court pressure there from them well they got to change the pace a little bit especially you know being down this many points early on theyre trying to find something where they can change the pace just a little bit deu state champion at St Augustine High School in New Orleans and named All State there four points in the open makes both free throws looks like a little bit of Zone press maybe one two2 possibly man little one two2 action just trying to disrupt them and let the shot clock run down a little bit so they cant get set in their Music offense good action there cross screen pinned down just unable to finish the basket and again Ain Christian doing a solid job on the defenseman being able to push it and thats what he does right there he just gets out and transition gets downhill especially against Oklahoma State he kind of forced the issue a lot of the times and they struggled defending him especially when he wanted to attack yeah they just got to do a better job especially they did an okay job of stopping the ball but you got to communicate on the back in Lee deba 9 and 1 12 point per game score last year led him with 15 in Music Stillwater he has six siblings all of them play basketball a couple of them played in the Carolinas his brothers Mustafa and ABA both played at Coastal Carolina Marcel way off good help defense comes from steel drive and kick and that right there is pretty much especially with tqu and Jarel being gone thats kind of what I expected they dont really have a guy thats going to take you off the bals but getting those paint touch forcing the defense to be in you know one two three rotations and getting a good look thats what theyre going to be really good at this year thats what makes it really tough right it its its enough to guard one drive or two drive but when youre able to add three or four eventually its easy to make a mistake yeah and then on top of it everybody gets a touch I mean almost everybody there I think got a a touch so you feel involved and youre willing to give a little bit more on the defensive end especially when youre getting touches on the offensive end and basketball is a rhythm game exactly got to be in good flow at all times its one of thing I told you I dont like media timeout because I feel like it takes away from the flow I want to keep going again just a good job defensively keep him in front forcing a contested three just got to do a good job of finishing with the rebound wave it off offensive foul its going to be charged to Mo mua he took the long three got the deflection and cleared out although it looked like it was daba I dont want to be too critical on the officials there maybe let him play yeah they did they did call that on 13 mua but I think on that replay you could see it was it was daba who did the the clearing out but again NC State just doing a good job keeping them in the front even when they do get beat theyre making those extra effort close outs like that last one in the corner was DJ you know he was in the paint but still did a good job closing out and getting a contest on them Bill cumington Jr Remy Sans Anthony eids are officials tonight Parker goes one for two last Touch by Music Taylor but how about this even going one for two right a 20po lead for NC State in this first half I think a lot of its just coming from them being so aggressive on the offensive end theyre forcing the issue theyre getting to the free throw line and theyre making free throws so you know thats a big piece to why theyre getting a lead especially early on here its been really impressive considering the defense we saw ACU play their last time out gayan big board by Music Parker NC State its a good shot for Morel was more in flowing in Rhythm thats a good screen by DJ getting him open I know you know obviously struggled with a shot uh last game made a few early on but I think thats one that KCs got to continue to take and continue to take with conf confidence state ran enough clock that ACU couldnt really go two for one Simmons strong inside and a held ball possession arrow favoring the wild cats 5sec differential shot clock game c Music and again thats a good job by NC State Flex action but theyre able to get in the post I think Taylor needs to get to a little bit more of a front to get a better position but again good Flex action out of there and I think NC States really doing a good job especially on the defensive end Simmons with his first basket and NC State will take a timeout you know obviously Id love to see DJ get a a post touch here especially because he can create with the pass I dont know if theyll have enough time with 76 seconds left but again anytime out of the timeout this is where coaches meet a little bit of execution theyre going to draw something up at least get some type of good look out of it this threw them off a little bit they went two three zone so good coaching skip to okono thatll take us into halftime NC State offensively click what would be your message to them in order to make a furious comeback in this one yeah I think I think defensively just be a little bit more aggressive you know theyre getting some straight line drives and some finishes at the basket you got to obviously box out cuz NC States getting offensive rebounds but youre not going to make it up and one possession you know this first 5 minutes of the start of the second half is going to be really big for them daba I think thats what they want to do they want to get the ball inside especially with daba hes very physical down low so again just get it in there play your game I know the the size and physicality viny State gave him some trouble but again you got to do what you do and thats one of the things that they do well is get the ball inside horn diara and Middlebrooks had two fouls at at halftime for Taylor thats just his first and everybody that has played tonight except for Dennis Parker has at least one foul for the wh a little bit more of that zone press that we saw at the end of the first half DJ horn able to handle it not a true point guard didnt play point guard really at Arizona State he knows hes going to have to play it a little bit more this year yeah and I think thats one of the things thats a little bit unique about this roster is that they dont have that true point guard maybe Michael O con a little bit but everybody can kind of handle the ball and everybodys got to take turns bringing it up kind of the same story for ACU where as youve seen Kon mlan has handled the ball a lot tonight Madden can do it a little bit degu can do it a little bit but its kind of going to be by committee yeah I mean thats just one of the things and I think that makes it a little bit you know harder to defend you never know whos bringing it up and hes going to initiate the offense but good job driving there and again hes Taylor was aggressive in the first half and continues it here to the second half obviously I know he wanted to to finish that but they did a good job of staying vertical and making a tough finish fouls going to go on Arion Simmons and for Simmons thatll be his third and hes hes another one I think he brings a lot of energy to this team especially in the Oklahoma State game you saw him kind of CLA smacking the floor bringing the energy on the defensive offensive in so you really got to get him because he kind of kind of gets his team going as well double double and he was a creator with the pass yeah man hes kind of that Draymond uh Draymond Green Ro for them where he does a little bit of everything he frustrates you to no end if you if hes not on your team but hes a guy that you love to have on your roster Burns got that spin move he loves but missed it and thats how the wild cats can get back in this right yeah Patience by mlan obviously could have taken that right wing jump shot but again waits for the trail man and gets an easy pull up B picked up his dribble in a tough spot diara comes and helps him out this is the abene Christian that I that I saw against Oklahoma state theyre trying to force everything out theyre trying to deny and theyre really pressuring and a little too much there bettio is whistled trying to push Burns even past the threepoint line thats something we saw from DJ Burns last streak it almost doesnt matter how far you push him out if you dont bring a double hes going to back you down until he ends up getting to where he wants anyways yeah but I will say especially as a Defender it makes it a little bit easier to dig and get the ball out of his hands so especially as a Defender you want to push that out Diva trying to stay in front hes whistled for the foul thatll be his first Madden and seat playing with two along with Allen and again Simmons out right now with the three fouls both teams dealing with a little bit of foul trouble thats a tough one ACU played really good defensive possession 28 seconds as long as you could do it and then they end up getting that foul at the end but again you just got to stay vertical make him score over you then finish with the rebound theres not a lot of contact there from Madden for his third foul but I think thats the key what you said you have to stay vertical yeah especially theyve just had a lot of ticky tack when like theyve been NC States gotten to the line an awful lot Taylors been in attack mode so at some point you know they got to understand look show your hands show the referee that youre chessing up and staying vertical so that you can make the tough contested ones Taylor is gone to the line nine times hes made all nine hes got 11 now to lead all scores thats what great scorers do right you get to the free throw line yeah you got to get there you got to make it easier on yourself again I think some of the best games that a lot of players have they see a couple going from the free throw line again he hasnt made a lot from the from the field but I know if he gets a couple good looks especially that confidence he has going N9 for9 from the line hes going to start knocking some down yeah getting to the free throw line is good thats my analysis Jaden Taylor hes pretty good at analysis too as are you Scott of course but Jaden actually majored in sports media at Butler and told me after his basketball career is done hed like to see himself in in a studio type role hes like you know what I like watching the guys on TNT I could see myself doing something like that well I can tell you Ive enjoyed being here with you its a lot of fun you get to watch some basketball talk basketball so Im sure hed love it yeah a little different live versus the studio he said he he might try his hand at what youre doing as well but but studio is where he really thinks it would be the most fun Ill try to give him as many pointers as I can on this end uh but again I think that studio may be a little bit less stressed daba and one and again thats the Scout on him right get downhill he gets to the rim and he gets the foul yeah and Allen just did a really good job staying in front again he showed his hands horn showed the ball in front was able to swipe it away and again push it in transition and thats what div is best out in transition looking to attack and again he gets back to the line third foul on mod diara in comes Middlebrooks who has two the depth of both teams might be tested by the time this ones all said and done but this is also how both teams want to play they want to pressure you they want to get you know up into you defensively so theres going to be a lot of fouls called so thats why both teams really have that depth so that they can be prepared for something like this theres some of that flow action we talked about I think both teams certainly Pride themselves on being physical and on being tough thats good patience right there the repost and he travels got a little bit off balance but thats really good patience especially by mlan he sees the big uh throws it to him they seal a little bit deeper get it to him he just got a little bit off balance but thats ultimately you know ecus game and what they want to get at ACU sorry ACU first ever meeting between NC State and abene Christian they only went to D1 a decade ago back in 2013 Ive already made two NCAA tournaments and keep in mind they werent eligible for their first four years and part of that transition something that JMU is going through right now not bow eligible first four minutes and change in the books of the second half I was a big go dogs go um very simple for me to read but uh my kids are obsessed with between between a nightmare before Christmas right now and the Grinch so uh we may have to make a trip Morel hanging in the air and draws the foul on benil and again just DJs being such a good passer again they use abin Christian wants to get into the passing Lanes get to that back cut um and just again that verticality that weve been seeing so much just staying vertical and drawing contact up at The Rim Simmons ready to check back in yeah big Dr sus sky yeah I love it we actually um I dont know if I should admit this on uh on live television but weve started our uh our Christmas setup and we have a big uh big Grinch blow up thats on top of already yes already already Christmas tree is up couple of Lights kids love it though so I can blame the kids even though its deep down its for me I got to tell you and I know a lot of people listening are are probably in agree with you so I dont want to I dont want to offend them I would say just my view is always just wait till Thanksgiving Scott I understand after Thanksgiving the tree goes off I save a week for Thanksgiving but uh you know the first couple weeks in November uh last week in November and then the rest is just set up for Christmas this is a debate I have with my wife and I hope Im not being a grinch I hope my heart isnt two sizes too small no chance I I but I respect your opinion I just I just love Thanksgiving as do I I just love the holiday cheer and again Taylor just being aggressive all night hes been attack in the rim able to get the easy one there one of the great things about Thanksgiving of course we get a lot of quality basketball right NC States going to go to the Las Vegas Showdown and just before Thanksgiving aene Christian will go to St Thomas to play in The Paradise Jam so you get right around that time you get some good food as Burns fights and wins the rebound you get some good food of course Taylor three got it and he get some good basketball too and again him that knocking down some free throws trusting the shot hes got some confidence right now hes got some things going for him so again hes feeling good attacking on the defensive end as well so uh hes playing a great game so far today and again Michael Connell pushing it with the attack Taylor been aggressive all day knock it down hes just been in attack mode from the beginning of this game obviously getting the free thr line N Out of nine times coming out in the second half again getting that confidence making a couple at the line and then obviously knocking down his last two so hes getting some confidence Taylor already with 16 his career high 24 he set that on New Years Day of this year against the Georgetown hoists Simmons with the touch and I think that hes going to be the one that needs to get things going you know hes one of their best players uh hes got to get this team going a little bit bring some energy and you see a little bit of a two three Zone Scott now we saw them on the last possession of the first half which I know you loved and it made sense to give NC State another look as horn makes some pay for the Zone but ACU really doesnt play zone no they dont but again you just got to mix things up you know if youre down 20 you know a couple things may not be working so again coach wants to mix some things up you just got to have a little bit better close out especially on a 41 career uh threepoint shooter just trying to change things to see if that wrinkle could throw NC State off and Horn immediately makes it happen Simmons on his way to the rack and I think he heard you I think he understands his responsibility as one of the veteran leaders of this team his teams down hes going to try to make something happen yeah hes just a great player for them you know obviously having I think 1111 in the first game you know he brings energy hes a good kind of leader out there that again a lot of these guys are looking to so when hes in attack mode and he looks engaged hes going to bring a lot of good things to ACU third foul on Middlebrooks coach Tanner you know we talking about switching up the defense well see here comes the qu court press weve seen a one two two Zone press now this one looks like more of a 2 two1 over and back goes Taylor and it works pays off again hes just changing things up a little bit just kind of keeping in stayed on their heels a little bit trying to figure out you know is this the 122 is this the 221 so forcing them into a turnover ultimately what theyre trying to do so if youre going to Calla back into this game those are the type of you know changes youre going to have to make coach Tanner say defense is the identity of our team its something we stress we want to force teams to take jump shots I love this quote from he said we dont play manto Man defense we play Team defense yes they play manto man but its about as a team how are we all positioning where we need to be yeah good team defense there by NC State they just werent able to get the loose ball s feeling it gives it up find seat nearly an and one hell shoot two and we kind of talked about that Draymond Green roll and he attacks and still creates you know he doesnt necessarily finish with the basket but again makes a good pass sends him to the free throw line yeah I love his game just the ability to to score rebound but also create for teammates yeah hes just one of those guys I I always said it I was I was lucky enough to be at training camp with with Draymond Green for a little while when hes on your team you love him as soon as hes off your team you absolutely hate playing against them so hes one of those that youre going to love to have a lot of headaches of of course but again hes just one of those that you love to play with see the former Oklahoma Gatorade player of the year he probably agrees with his birthday is Christmas Day Scott so he probably agrees with you we didnt get a chance to ask him but he probably you know say hey lets get in the Christmas spirit I just want to know does he get a double up on the presence yeah of course some good activity there by ACU just again you got to you got to get those 5050 balls especially when youre down in a game unable to get it and Taylor feeling it right now knocking down another shot he had a great night from the fields at least in the first half second half has been his half hes got 19 no answer from mlan but he gets his own board daba kind of keeping it alive there that is such a good shot from Cameron steel hes got a pretty touch especially you know hell give a lot of big guys trouble that have to come out and cover that he was their leading threepoint shooter as a sophomore made 43s last year shot 42 he made 35 of them diara taking him inside and thats bully ball thats just a grown man move just backing him down till he gets in the paint and finishing Id recommend send him help especially anytime you get that deep down in there send some help and a great finish by diara 6459 win in Stillwater their first Power five Conference win since they were a 14 seed in the NCAA tournament a couple of years ago coach said said man I tell you what these guys they played their tails off we talked about composure we had some moments where we lost it a little bit we knew at halftime they Oklahoma State were going to throw a punch but we just got back up and at the end of the day we kept our composure when things were going going our way those guys found a way and a really positive sign in game number one in a hostile environment to be able to come out with a win and and really it was on the strength of the defense right they held the Cowboys to just 59 points and as you can see so far in this game that that hasnt been the case NC State already surpassing that Mark yeah and I think one of the things that they did especially in that Oklahoma State game they played a good game for almost 38 minutes thats a good pass from Simmons and then just those last two minutes a little bit of pressure got to them where they probably would have won that game you know by 10 to 15 points so they kind of let him crawl back in there yeah watching that game it was pretty apparent that Amal and Christian controled that game yeah and theyre going to be a good team going forward you know I know theyre down quite a bit here but NC States just playing a great game offensively and defensively and you know they havent had any lapses where they havent scored the ball so you know n stage just controlled it from you know the start of this game till now so you know obviously its easy to get your head down and say you know what you know were getting beat but theyre still giving energy theyre still playing hard which is something that their coach wants to see miscommunication between Simmons and Madden something we talked about with NC State their depth and their balance right it was O Connell the other night uh who was four of five from three but but tonight you know horn five of eight with 13 Points morcel 11 points and obviously Jaden Taylor uh hes had a really good second half after he got to the line of ton in the first half hes got 19 so pretty much exactly what you were expecting to see from an NC State team when some of those Shooters like Taylor and Horn are on a little more than they were in game one against the Citadel yeah and I think again it just makes them so much more dangerous that you just dont know who is going to be on that night you know youve got five guys you you have to scout you know theyre all capable to go for 10 to 15 points so you know like okell the other night had a great game and he had mentioned in his press conference you know it may not be my my night every night it could be you know Jaden Taylor it could be DJ horn but you always got to be ready and understand you know I may not get as many shots as I normally do but its for the better of the team you played on a team that went to the Sweet 16 that I think had a lot of balance in its scoring yeah we had I think it was five maybe even my senior had six that averaged between it was between 10 and 13 points you know a lot of things you know especially looking back on it I was with Kendall a little bit for a summer league and a couple other guys that mentioned you know it just makes it a little bit harder cuz you know even if we take away one guy somebody else is there that has the opportunity to score 20 Music morcel well NC State just relentless on the offensive glass and thats what modar brings you know we we mentioned it in the first game hes just attacking constantly in attack mode whether its you know offensive rebound defensive rebound you know blocking shots hes bringing extra possessions getting it to the rim you know Caseys doing a good job banging in there and its still nobody gives up even though theyre up you know 20 points theyre still out there battling and for the wild cats right how do you get a defensive stop well they like to turn you over States turn it over just five times theyre not forcing to turnovers the other way to get a stop you have to get a defensive rebound and NC state has 11 offensive rebounds and thats too many if youre coach Tanner you got to you know even in the second chance point they might not have as many as what they probably could have but its resulting in all these fouls yeah you know theyre getting in foul trouble someone like Simmons has to take a seat because theyre not getting those boards yeah Simmons on the bench with the four fouls Madden and bettio have three oh mlan rejected by morcel great job noticing the back screen being in help side and caseing comes eliminates that shot you got to find him Burns does 43 its amazing when you have a really good defensive stop and come down and even though Casey hasnt been shooting the three well you know knocks it down just shows how defense trans transitions into the offensive end yeah Scott I know youre a high school baseball player its like you make a good play defensively it seems like youre always leading off the next inning yeah but that necessarily wasnt always the case for me I was a much better Defender when it came to the baseb but you know my teammates always pick me up so just not a good hitter well no signal here I guess on the sideline was Taylor all right this worth another look first the block and he comes across you know starts outside the paint obviously his mans coming off a down screen but hes still sees that the balls coming across and again DJ just being an unselfish passer hits him in stride knocks it down thats a professional block too right you dont throw it into the third row put it off the glass so you can get a chance going the other way and theres an AR to it Im telling you if you can get that extra possession a lot of people just want to send it but you know if you can get your hands back on that ball and get an extra possession out of it thats where its out and again the tenacity at the defensive end creating to get out in the offensive offensive court and theyre just getting easy Bon pass in his first minutes got the steal and diara with the finish this has been a an impressive performance on both ends for the wolf back and theyre doing it you know obviously fullcourt pressure but also in the half court Taylors Got The Touch tonight 22 points in his his second career game with NC State that Rim down here is slowly getting a little bit bigger for everybody on NC States roster its an 110 run over the last three minutes defense offense you know the hard part is you know ly State probably wants to get some some game film at they can break down but I just feel like you know obviously theres a couple parts on the defensive end that I know hell probably show in the film room as well as on the offensive end but theyve done just such a good job of Defending and transitioning that into the offens and even in their half court offense I feel like theyve done a really good job of just being patient whether its giving it to DJ and him creating becoming that point Center type of role U but again theyve just done a really good job tonight I feel like theyve kind of eliminated the stuff that ACU really wants to do on the offensive and everybody here back up 29 playing well here in their second game of this season Scott this a match up of the Wolfpack and the wild cats its also a matchup I think of uh were you a country music fan growing up in Indiana so the the truth is I just now got into some country music I did not listen to much uh when I was younger well I tell you what the these two schools an elite matchup of country music singers well I know Scotty mccu is one yeah Scotty mccu and C State Alum how about abene Christian Ronnie Dunn from Brooks and Dunn thats pretty impressive Im taking Scotty McCurry all day though Allen had a good first half hes been quiet so far here in the second thats his 10th point to lead all scores for the wild cats you dont have to take anybody in that match up you can just like them both yeah theyre both solid uh Ive listened Brooks and dun is fantastic Ive listened to quite a few Brooks and dun now that Im a little bit older they they kind of came out with that album where I think it was Casey mus Graves and some other people uh were were on it so Ive gotten introduced it but Im Al a good friend of Scotty mccre so I got to oh I didnt I my goto yeah always got to be my goto he was also here for a stin while I was here so every he once oh yes W Dior well that would have brought the house down almost brought the rim down he did bring the rim down he I think honestly when he hit his chest he sent him up a little bit higher gosh thats what we call an athlete but I also give credit dont give up the dunk there get theou make him make him earn it at the line that is his fourth foul good play out of the timeout too a little ball screen back screen action second free throw good and C State able to set up its Music pressure abene Christian going to place him his younger guards here deu youa shot maybe blocked from behind by pass or Pardon Me Taylor hes been good all night especially on the defensive end too you know weve talked a lot about the offense but even at the beginning of the game you know he was picking up the point guard full court turning them making it tough to get into the offense betso staying in with the four fouls gets the lay this is that action NC State ran a lot last year the Iverson cut side pick and roll get it to DJ in the post and just let him work off glass he didnt mean to do that off glass Scott he did not mean to do that I dont know I mean hes so good hes so skilled you got to question it normally Id say theres no way he meant to do that the banks not open this late I dont think he meant to do that but it still went in sometimes when you just got that soft touch you know things happen good things happen for you nice spin move by JV seat from edman Memorial burns the assist on the morel basket 80 points and Counting for the wolf pack seat to the rim again follows it up yeah I think he got that off hand and got diar in the lip all right from this angle yeah no chance he did that on purpose look at cam Woods in the background on the bench look at the face he makes and heres Casey just doing a good job cutting getting a Defender off his feet and finishing I will tell you if I played with a DJ Burns Id always cut cuz he is a great passer maybe in underappreciated part of his game here he is again you just got to kind of move you see DJ setting screens away and everybody cutting deu I think got tangled up with his own teammate ended up falling over out of bounds cuz if if youre not a good passer and being a good passer in this sense is not is not just about picking up assists right its just having good spatial awareness and understanding when double teams are coming where theyre coming from yeah and its kind of like that hockey assist you may not always get the assist but you force a defense into rotation and thats what you want to do anytime youre on the offensive end you got to create an advantage somewhere so you got to get them into rotation which ultimately leads to good shots diara into double figures again rebounding he lost that one gayan so thats a screen for Allen who comes in to catch it trying to drive Parker does Baseline and hes swatted rebound tipped out all the way to midcourt I think thats one of the things especially early on that youve seen this year Parker just being an elite Defender gets his hands in there just a little bit too much maybe a little bit lazy but hes going to be an elite Defender uh for NC State for years to come speaking of let a look at the block with the left hand too off hand this is the howl for foul promotion the fans get a free ChickfilA chicken sandwich if Aiden and gayan misses both and he quiets the crowd the 610 senior from Dublin Ireland he was a soccer player player in Ireland he switched to basketball at age 12 he moved to Brooklyn at age 13 and became not just a a top 100 but a top 50 recruit in fact he was the top recruit in Chris Macks first real recruiting class at Louisville spent two years there in the Ville and then one at Grand Canyon which is in the whack before grad transferring now to ACU well I would say that was a good business decision for him to get out of soccer with that size athletic can move and he looks like hes built like a rock yeah his nickname is the Irish Hulk yeah he he looks pretty physical seeds three ball off the front rim there is a gayan with the rebound oh mua comes in with with the finish and thats what we were talking about actually uh at halftime right the team comes out layup lines he threw down an incredible dunk yeah everybody everybody does the uh end of layup line dunk to send them into the bench and hes the one that did it for them and you could tell that hes probably uh came close to knocking out a few teeth on the rim it was one of those I wasnt necessarily expecting it came out of nowhere I said wow that was awesome and Im glad that that everybody watching got a chance to see it as well Brit seems like game in game out yeah and I guarantee in that timeout he was beging coach to let him get one more point but again I just think thats something that hes always going to bring night in night out you know hes going to be right at that 10o Mark 10 rebound its winning plays those are the type of guys you need on your team to win games Ernest Ross with the foul both teams in the double bonus so seat will shoot two not a shooting foul uh Im not sure if he was behind the threepoint Arc or not but it should be two shots here and the officials confirming yes two shots SE played 13 minutes against Oklahoma state scored five points and this is an opportunity weve seen the Wildcats as there is a question I think at the table they were wondering if this is not a a three shot foul it was not called a shooting foul I assume this is what the conversation is we cant hear it but for the wild cats theyve played 13 players tonight and this is a chance for Coach Tanner to give some guys some minutes and really see what he has I mean he knows he has a lot of veterans but some of the younger players get an opportunity yeah and theyre really deep even in the first game of the year I think they went 11 deep which was a pretty close game so again its early in the season a lot of these coaches want to see what they have on their benches get some guys some minutes See How They react when the big lights come on so uh you know its early in the season everybodys still trying to get a feel for each other and what they got SE air ball good job by BR pass initially got beat on the first bounce but recovered and and made uh SE take a tough contested one and obviously as you get into you know December January that rotation is really going to shorten yeah most coaches want to go kind of that 8 n route now I think with the style of play of both of them I think ideally you know maybe even 9 to 10 especially with how hard they play on the defensive end so um mostly from what Ive seen a lot of the really good teams usually go about that eight 8 to n Mark Jordan Snell into the game along with KJ Music Keats Music this is coach Tanners son Colby Tanner sophomore seeing his first minutes of the Season Rea tough all away and at this point I think coaches as Alex Nell comes in for NC State both coaches probably just want to see good ball movement right try to try to put together a couple good possessions yeah this is the time I always kind of told the referees too even though were trying to get you know two missed free throws for chicken uh you know dinner reservations are on the line here you know trying to speed it up a little bit but you know a lot of these guys you know especially some of these WalkOns what a lot of people dont realize is how much time they put in uh I had a lot of WalkOns on my roster shout out to STS battle is one of them uh theyre there an hour before I am going through the Scout going through the scout team so they put in just as much work so any opportunity they get to come in here and get minutes you know they want to come out here and try and shine M Shai Hill this is his first Collegiate game and hes going to face the crow as loud as theyve been all night chicken for everybody going to be a winner winner chicken dinner kind of night for NC State is Ross almost came through and cleared out degu the other way almost missed the finger roll one minute thats two games for NC State and the chicken promotions hit twice you know I hate to say it they probably should do it the first half too that crowd gets pretty loud when it comes to winning some chicken Tanner counted in one one and thatll be a little teaching moment uh coach Keats put his head down as soon as he threw that foul uh you just want to contest and and let him have that one a highlight for the sophomore guard Colby scored eight points last year he scored four on one play and he hasnt missed on the season that is awesome fing the threepoint shooter no but for Kobe Tanner thats one hell smile about I think this is a good one for Inc State you know theyre going to go into the film room theyre going to find a couple things uh but all in all I think for 40 minutes game they did a really good job tonight you know ICU obviously is going to take some things out of the out of the film room but you know coming off that Oklahoma State win you know they still got things to look forward to and be proud of so
