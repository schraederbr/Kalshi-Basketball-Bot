ACC games were on the road they play very well at home 8 and two and the Fighting Irish control the opening tip thats a man right there to keep an eye on he leads the Atlanta Coast Conference in scoring that is Marcus Burton hes come all the way back from an injury earlier this year against ruers and thats Shrewsberry the coachs son well have more on that a little bit later on some interesting comments from Dad yesterday at shoot around heres Burton for three and off the front of the iron the rebound potit for the Hokey and the man to follow there we talked about him a moment ago leall wears number one Al to him and thats why we said keep an eye on him buckle up fans because this is the guy that measured the combine 492 in vertical yes Applause 492 thats a way to get it started heres Burton hes defended by Ben Hammond kick it outside and an open three is not there for Davis and the other way for the Hokies this is a freshman point guard and Ben Hammond out of Fairfax Virginia a while lost a handle and it belongs to Virginia Tech lets look right away at that Mark of a fighter moment brought to you by Melo how about this and heres what it is you just throw it to the stars and watch L wild go up man it looked like the guy was looking inside of the rim its going to be an interesting match up Im Im looking at that that match up between Lew and Tate Davis all afternoon long shoot the pull up jumper hes a transfer from duke and last Touch by Notre Dame so 20 seconds on the shot clock shoots going to be important for this uh this game too in those last three games averaging about 16 points shooting 45 from behind the AR you know he went nearly two full years without playing in a college basketball game after injuries at Duke his first two years and so hes just now hitting 100 conditioning and he misses that three ball and the rebound to Davis in the Fighting Irish great feed underneath a great pass by Davis Davis is one of those guys who doesnt get a lot of credit the third leading score on this Irish team but he can handle it the small power forward position you see that last little dump off the J I mean he averages 15 points five rebounds and three assists a game thats pretty good nearly a take away into the corner lewow In and Applause Out Irish wearing the green you dont see a lot of green in those Unis anymore when you and I were growing up they had a whole ton of green heres Davis and off the back of the iron and it belongs to Virginia Tech my the house that backboard may have come down if he finishes that and that last time it seems like you know I need Im nearly jumped out of my seat you saw T Ty Davis go up there with bad intention just early the first couple of minutes it seems like you and I going to have a lot of excitement this early Music Applause afternoon picking up the dribble and coming up short is Tyler John 22 game couple of minutes in two and 12 minutes in and a bump against lewow thatll be his first and the team first against Virginia Tech head coach Mike young just picked up his 400th career coaching Victory so many years in wford in fact next weekend he will be inducted into the wford Hall of Fame and theyre also going to celebrate with Virginia in town in blackburg as theres a laying nice speed there nice feed by ver hes going to command so much attention that last time down in the post had two guys there and gets it over to mohamd for the easy one well theyre also going to recognize coach young for the 400 Victory and the induction to watfords Hall of Fame looking forward to being there next weekend with the Cavaliers in Applause town Low had it rejected out of there Davis goes behind the back excellent defense right there by lall good Deep by poti just without fouling Burton the pull up jumper from 12 and the S gim Falls home beron takes his time gets a little friendly bounce that last time you can see both teams are coming out playing physical Burton coming off a 25o effort against Florida state in the loss earlier this week nice soft touch left hand from the big fella potit and Js going to have his hands full with potit theyre going to give him a lot of touches down there little ISO ball thats another guy that can finish with both hands around the Applause cup little late on that feed right in the middle of the lane and trying to finish and beautifully done good patience there by Davis and again we talked about the fact that uh Davis is going to be one of those guys can put the ball on the floor you seeing hes Ultra aggressive going right at Le wild trying to make him defend both of these teams trying to qualify for the Atlanta Coast Conference tournament in the season it right now both W Ball kicked out of bounds and its a timeout well Tom I hope that you came in man with a little bit of excitement because we got a little both guys going Above the Rim its a good one early up with the Irish up at night time it is just what a place what a place all right 84 Fighting Irish in front way down toown and that one not going to go for sh who has still not scored early on in this one 5 minutes into the Applause Music game Burton has one bucket thought about the pullup jumper but good defense there by Rex Steiner whos just checked in for the Hokies along with Ben vernham P attention to the spacing by Notre Dame and how they do so well in as they turn the ball up over Julian Roper giving it up and thats going to be out of bounds off the knee of Jaden young so three new faces on the floor for Mike Youngs team good de transition de defense by Shrewsberry watch him get his away actually look like they both got their hand in it ends up coming off when young you know both of these coaches hail from the state where theyre coaching now coach ruseberry grew up went to Cathedral High School in Indianapolis and of course a lifetime Virginia as that one of is Off the Mark is Mike young who grew up in Radford Virginia two good guys good coaches but really good guys that same sentiment we both get a chance to sit down and talk to him as you see Davis get out and finish at The Rim js got to find a way to get their guards going we know this is a team thats going to throw the ball inside we got L Wild on the bench theyve got to find a way to get the perimeter guys going go coming off a monster game had a double double against SMU and another turnover roer to the basket and cant finish good follow there but unable to put it in as Davis and Virginia Tech coming the other way desperately in need of a basket last three possessions three turnovers this guy can shoot it but off the mark and a foul going to go against POI as he threw a left arm into Kev Music G will lead the game couple of different substitutions first time weve got a look at Patrick wesler the sevenfooter out of Matthews North Carolina hes a sophomore wheres number five for Virginia Tech into the corner wide open three and not there boy how active is this guy in the rejection right away delivered by Music Wesley neither team can buy a three weve not had one in the game yet and its funny because both teams are in the top 10 as far as made threepointers in the lead Conan owski number 25 transfer from Monmouth into the game for the first time for the Fighting Irish heres Burt great head fi oh my you saw that he had Rex Steiner Rex Steiner did a really good job playing defense but then you saw Burton hit him a little bit of a pump fake and got him to bite on it with the step through to finish this kid is so good Burton if you havent seen him he was the accs Freshman of the year last season third Team all conference performer preseason First Team all ACC and hes lived up to it when hes been healthy Applause Virginia Tech just two of 10 from the field youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State youre in good hands all Fighting Irish so far and theyve been theyve done a good job of being able to get something off their offense for Virginia Tech theyre getting good looks again you just have to be patient allow this game to Chip Away in a little bit you dont want any home runs Applause shot clock no good on the three and knocked out of bounds by Tech itll belong to Notre Dame 125 to go here in the opening Half 8 minutes in Virginia Tech only two baskets and Tom one of the things that Notre Dame has done well for for Virginia Tech is that they kept them on the perimeter now that youve got Le and poti on the inside they dont really have anyone that they throw the ball into they can go get them a bucket got a on Virginia Tech fantastic year they had Under head coach Marcus Freeman advancing all the way to the college football playoff title game before losing to Freemans Alma moer the Ohio State Buckey in traffic in and out and it tipped in it looked like by Sir mohamd yeah mohamd did a good job of being able to spin that from constantinos seemed like first half has been all the Irish again talking about for Virginia Tech got to find some type of offense been an 8 nothing Notre Dame run Burnham underneath the basket kicks it out to Young and they just cant buy one right now thats now two of 12 from the field for the Applause hok great pass beautifully done by mohamd great no look threaten the needle by mohamd for is Virginia take a call a timeout and we talked at the beginning for the Irish playing here at home is a totally different team theyve done a good job of spreading them out and picking them Applause apart another turnover by Virginia Tech LW lost a handle underneath very good defense from the Fighting Irish heres mohamd bounce pass into traffic and unable to handle it as Roper that was a tough catch man do the hokeys need a bucket and need it bad downt not there for young Burnham after the tip by wow good penetration there and another offensive rebound for the Music Applause hokes P mohameds playing good basketball early on here today and he is hes impacting the game in so many different ways and you see another good dime talk about a high IQ play weve seen him come in and just let the game come to him hes got a block on one end hes got a couple of Dimes hes definitely giving coach shuberry a shot the arm for Notre Dame yeah and again theyre playing without Matt Malo who averages nine points and five rebounds a game and so mohamd the Freshman who grew up in Charlotte North Carolina quality minutes here and young to the basket and finally its been a long time protect a nice move by Young that last time was able to break the paint and then get one going hopefully this will opens up open up some offense from Virginia Tech that end a 120 run for Notre Dame Applause Jarrett sundra another freshman out of Ashburn Virginia played at Paul v 6 Catholic High School one of the great powers in all the country they were number two nationally last year in fact he played on the same team as Ben Hammond did of Virginia Tech you see Tay Davis come in sir Mohamed goes in for great but how about the positive minutes that he gave help helped Notre Dame extend this lead up to 12 boy young is coming into this game and firing every time he touches it scramble for the ball and still scrambling and a jump ball possession arrow favors as theres some pushing and shoving down at the bottom of that you need to see the the ball go into the basket and sometimes free throws are a great opportunity and this guy can flat out shoot it so maybe this free these free throws will allow him to be able to get some type of Rhythm 83 free throw shooter and he hit them both so well see if that cant get the hokes rolling and shoot rolling and Roper uh had his arm his other arm that wasnt the one that threw the hook his left elbow being addressed Virginia Tech basketball down 10 little more than 9 minutes to go in the opening half Virginia Tech needs to play inside out think they can get their pigs involved then you can get open opportunity you see a nice little penetration and finish by Johnson I think thats the way theyre going to get back in this game is that they havent been shooting well from behind the AR he want to continue to penetrate and then get to the bucket Johnson only a freshman as we mentioned out of Orlando Florida Briar High School recruit they love his tenacity the way he defends and can take the ball to the bucket low excellent defense right there and here comes Hammond the other way wow had the first bucket of the game and heres shoot on the cut to the rim and all of a sudden coach Shrewsberry says hold on a minute 8 nothing Virginia Tech run you see Virginia Tech trying a job of trying to get downhill got two three layups and I think eventually those threepoint shots will come but you have to still stay diligent in trying to get to the basket well if youre Virginia check you got to feel pretty good that youre only six points down in this game right Applause now little jump hook comes up short but ji able to get his own Applause rebound Burton has four early on for the fighting Iris Shrewsberry is not scored he had a quiet game as you mentioned earlier this week little fade away thats a tough shot right there and the wow uh was standing out of bounds when he touched the ball so its Notre D Ball but Tom we need to get him on as a half time guess man this dude talk might be right I love that b some of his hair and some of his energy I I definitely would love some of all right so five on the shot clock so it did indeed touch a rim so Notre Dame inbounds from its own hoop and Jai is going to lay it off for Burton hes got to put it up nice pass good patience and just before the shot clock he did not get it off a good defensive possession by Virginia teken again theyre doing a good job of being able to limit Notre Dame early in the game it seemed like Notre Dame could get what they want great opportunity now Virginia Tech to be able to cut this thing down to four possible three 730 to go until halftime theall scored the first pass K of the game on an Al duck and he tried to throw the cross scored pass and then Burton intercepted him but stepped out of B he Virginia Tech you cannot afford those turnovers youre clawing back into this game last time if youre Botique you got to do a better job of getting l a direct passing Lane so he could go to work loow one of just four players in a conference to rank among the top 20 in both scoring and rebounding he has just one bucket through almost 13 minutes of this game I will continue to try to put that ball inside get potit that m match up between he and J Pote has been able to to win it so far In and Out Boy that was right there by shoot got to find a way to get Shrewsberry going he hes one of those guys have struggled since the Florida State game beautiful Left Hand penetration by Marcus Burton grew up just down the road in mikawa Indiana he does such a good job of being able to break down the defense and finish at the Music Applause rim and thats kicked outside Johnson for three and he knocks it in good pass by him and realized that he didnt have what he wanted got it over to Johnson with I think was their first three the game and its michell w Indiana I screwed that up yesterday and my wife said you better not screw that up and theres a three ball by Davis so 23 15 Notre Dame in front potit spins his way to the bucket great defense there by Applause John oh oh boy its see something in and out on the open three under 6 minutes to go lead was down to six now swells back to eight for the Fighting Irish ALU B by it went in down just throw the ball up there and then just let Lew go and get it I mean Hammond really didnt have much and caught glimpse of LW in that backside and you said a 49 in vertical leak thats incredible I remember Daryl Griffith they were going crazy he was like 43 44 and lets not forget the law is 68 yeah both of his baskets have come on Ali oops and then a nice finish off the glass by Hammond and this is the closest weve been in a long time and Tom as of late weve seen the offense starting to click a little bit more from Virginia Tech theyve done a good job of not settling for the three and breaking the paint and getting what they want flipped on the arm from behind by Hammond again when you talk about the alter chart athleticism watch Hamming break the paint and understand he doesnt have anything but then you dont see La up there on the top of the backboard just watch how high he goes up not sure he even had his elbows over the Rim Yeah but then on the other end for Notre Dame we talked about how good Marcus Burton is this is a guy that again can go get a shot and if your offense is failer just put the ball to number threes hands I mean what a start to his career we mentioned the accs Rookie of the Year is season to Music go lead back up to five and thats more to six as Burton has eight to lead all scores so the final five minutes here in the opening half outside of the first basket of the game Notre Dame has led the entire way pull up jumper bang knocked in by the Freshman Hammond his second basket you see Benham is starting to catch his stride in this game thought he struggled a little bit earlier with the pressure done a bad job better job in the last five minutes M sertis spins it into the lane excellent Hustle by poy numbers the other way Hammond to Burnham lays it in and weve got a twopoint game and that play was started by poti anytime you see your big man diving on the floor and KN your offense about Virginia Tech and the fact that theyve gone Im watch this play again active hand you see poti initiate that and then Virginia takes out and running again Benham and drop set over for Burnham be able to get and Virginia Tech again they were in a position where it looked like they were going to get blown out because they couldnt find their offense now theyve cut this thing to two with just a little bit more than four minutes Shrewsberry has not scored in the game for Notre Dame and we brought up he only had six points in the loss in Tallahassee open three not going to go for rer and good hustle down there Davis has given him excellent and its no Music surprise sorta another threepoint try in and out and another offensive rebound for Notre Dame T roer not afraid to stick his he the last time we had a tie in this game is when it was two to2 and the only lead for Virginia Tech was the first play of the game the L alyu thatll be the six foul against the H Notre D has only been whistled for two fouls this entire first half and for Ben Hammond as a fredman thats a thats a tough match up for him to have to try to contain Burton by himself if Im Virginia Tech then I I try to force him to his off hand because again hes a guy that needs that separation to be able to get that shot off Shrewsberry just cannot get a shot and heres Burton shot clocked down to 10 great strip right there by Tyler Johnson and now Virginia Tech a chance to tie the game or even take the lead 320 to go until halftime into the corner barely touching the rim was re Steiner and the Irish back the other way at the threeminute Mark Burton to the rack left hand oh my man what about about what a Blow by he he froze Rex Steiner that one time and then once he got there many times we seen him get amongst the trees and finish with his left hand man is he some kind of exciting to watch hes got 10 already heres Johnson and he rattles in the three to make it a onepoint game good crosscourt pass over to Johnson hes been another one of those players where Virginia Tech has come in has found his offense Virginia te still being able to keep this thing close Johnson that freshman out of Orlando I mean hes a big strong young man and dribbling it off his foot out of bounds is constant owski and so now Virginia jach which is not LED since the very first possession of the game will have a chance to take the lead coming up on our halftime show presented by Subaru love its what makes Subaru Subaru will bounce around the ACC how about the news yet another Hall of Fame head coach stepping down in the ACC Leonard Hamilton and again Hamilton is one of those coaches that is definitely a Hall of Famer interesting to see how youve seen I think this probably the seventh in four years that weve seen I mean it goes all the way back back to Coach K and Roy Williams you know this year weve seen larena before the year Tony Bennett nice soft touch in the lane by Davis hes had a nice game nine points and thats a match up that he can win between here and Burman theyre going to leave him on an island I would say that you put him in the post he can Elevate over him and get into that lane and finish oh too aggressive on that pass by Johnson that was through about four P so 135 to go Burton with the basketball he has 10 points to lead Notre Dame Davis has nine so thats 19 of their 29 from two players dribbling it out of bounds that was a tough pass to handle for mohammd it was and you saw that Burton was able to get there and good help side over there by L forc him have to come off that ball you see right now 12 before I still think that if Im Mike young I feel good about my team and where we are again I would like to see them be able to give Lew a touch in the paint or try to get down to your second or third options offensively thats the 11 turnover for the Fighting Irish they average that number per Applause game Burnham spins into the lane shot clock now at 10 re Steiner he cant find the mark and now under a minute to go Notre Dame tries to add to a threepoint Applause lead beautiful pass and Bon almost had it go down with the left hand yeah great pass by Tate Davis and last time nothing surprises me for Marcus Burton watch this back cutting put it right there and he sees the W come over absorbs the contact knows hes going to get two free throws tries to go and finish it and get the one so Burton 8 4 free throw shooter among the nations very best like to remind you tomorrow on CW womens basketball number 14 NC State to Tallahassee against number 222 Florida State tomorrow two Eastern 11 Pacific only on the CW Burton got a both he has 12 in a game and a lead is backed to five with 51 ticks remaining until halftime Applause Music whistle away from the ball thats going to be against Burton holding on to re Steiner you see Burton was a little overaggressive in trying to trail on re Steiner I still feel like from Virginia Tech shoot is that guy that I feel like hes due just to get with hes been playing too well and shooting the rock too will like to see them be able to run him off of a stagger and try to get him a clean look only the third team foul against Notre name in this half shot clock at 15 forc pass a and a turn over by Johnson theres a two second differential between game clock and shot clock Applause Applause all right here we go down to seven set the screen Burton pulls up bang what a first half for the amazing Marcus Burton shoot from half court and no good so after Notre D at a big lead Virginia Tech got it down to he only had two Aly slam dunks in the opening half and lets take a look at our Mark of the fighter moment brought to you by Mela and you see the back door cut by LW and again I feel like Ben Hamilton last 10 minutes of the first half going in this has really ignited this offense for Virginia Tech like you say one of the things they got to do is get Lew going because this the guys he missed the first one of that two theyre going to need his buckets his presence down low two dunks thats it in the first half so talented yet so raw hes got a lot of basketball left in him he grew up in London not been playing very long you can see the the crowd excited because I think when he misses two they get free nachos Amen to that bring them on over nothing like a good nacho on a Saturday baby no doubt about it full day of college HS get a plate full of nachos and let her rip and thats basketball heaven Applause heres Burton spins his way lost his footing and that is a foul and uh Hammond cannot believe thats his third foul and hes doing what he can because again we talk about how Burton is a handful you see the spin right there and Im not sure that he forced him to fall it look like Marcus birm lost his bals yeah Shrewsberry did not score in the first half nice feed oh and a whistle against Virginia Tech I thought a good job that last time but Tay DAV is being able to get into the chest of M initiated a little bit of a contact Drew that foul going to the line for two Mike Youngs Got to Be Wondering uh are we the only team theyre calling fouls on heres the first and two and thats dropped by Davis first trip to the line coming up C court side sat DC in Syracuse then later today Georgia Tech and Charlottesville are going to honor Tony Bennett at Virginia then tomorrow two Eastern 11 Pacific number 14 NC State number 22 Florida State on the womens side great weekend of college hoops in the ACCC only on the CW still love them get the ball in theti hes shown that give him a chance he can go ahead and play a little bully ball down there just came up short in that last one transfer from rice in his final season of college basketball Davis into the lane and right back in to ji thought about it passes on the Applause shot excellent defense there thats a tough shot by Shrewsberry whos still not scored and good good defense by shoot that last time you see Johnson hes been the one guy thats been able to find the range from down downtown back to back misses by both Johnson and shoot Bo the threepoint shooting has been abysmal for both teams th Dame one of nine chech two of 17 Burton the floater not going to go down ninepoint game two minutes Applause Music in low 43 not going to be the there now two of 18 from threepoint range and this is a team in Virginia Tech shooting at 37 Notre Dame shoots at 38 from Applause Music three I think thats for on Hammond last time couldnt get over that screen yep well thats a big hit right there their freshman point guard and now theyll bring in is back up re Steiner and Tom heres where you watch again when you see that last time puts his hand out there makes that contact you got a guy like Marcus Burton that you know that can really use that pick and roll I try to force him off of that pick and force him to get the ball to somebody else because other than Tay Davis theres no one else for Notre Dame that has really been lighting you up you see that Bren Shrewsberry is having a tough afternoon I try to get the ball out of Marcus and force someone else to make a play yeah I mean after those two guys uh Mohamad has four uh sundra with two ja with two and thats been it for Notre D mohamd had is stripped away and bodies all over the floor man when Jai hit the deck at 250 lbs it felt like uh somebody got hit Next Door by one of Marcus Freemans guys dping down low to PO double team and throws it away and great double team that last time you saw joh come over realize that poti had a much smaller Mohammad on the post he comes over to the dou Pos got to be patient except that double get the ball out its another Music turnover oh thought he Music got packed on the arm Music so a ninepoint game a little more than three minutes back to cut off the fingertips of Shrewsberry yeah Shrewsberry having a tough afternoon little curl right there looked like it would have been a easy pass and layup from Tay Davis now 13 turnovers in the game for Notre dve and again the Irish per game only turn it over 11 times on average that was nearly a turnover heres poti body slamming inside big strong move and cant get it to go and nice and again I would have a healthy dose of giving potit that ball because Notre Dame is allowing him to be able to go oneonone watching be able to back down constantinos and absorbs that contact right there until you can get the three ball going or you can get L wild going I would give potit an opportunity to go oneonone see if he can get some offense R rolling hes a good free throw shooter for a big man and hes a big man he goes 69 260 yeah hes a big guy and like I say he got a really good skill set does a good job of being able to get in the pulse to score with either hand around around the rim he got them both and now Burnham going to check in and lewow will leave po will leave in favor of Patrick Wesley well and again when you look at Virginia Tech where do you get your offense you have proven to play really good defense and be able to stifle Notre Dame for the most part outside of Burton but where do you go to get some offense good question shoot is not found the trigger nor is burnam heres Burton into the lane and contact and a late whistle there but a foul going to go against West and Burton will go to the free throw line to shoot a pair where he is four of four from the line today yeah that first step I watch him be able to get in there at 51s got enough bounce man looked like he almost got away with a little bit of an extension of that that left arm right there again and Burtons a tough car because he can go first one up there and good CWs number one show back and all new this Monday dont miss all American Monday in eastern 7 Central right here on the CW Mohamad and Davis will leave for the Irish as Burton hits both free throws his first two points in the second half he has 16 in the game yeah again for I I keep going back and saying that for Virginia Tech theyve got to get someone to go and I feel like that guys got to be shoot see re Steiner comes in it could be him again that pick and roll hes shown that hes a guy that if youll give him opportunity to get downhill knock down that shot its his first bucket of the game Burton for three not going to be there and Weser did a nice job boxing out but couldnt find the handle on it so another 16 timeout so heres the thing is the difference has been the Marcus SM excuse me Marcus burden thing but I think that again for Virginia Tech you hang on your defense and continue to try to pound that ball inside I asked you because you played so many years in uh in Italy I wrote you the other day in an email and said no bueno I said is that Italiano because you can speak Italian Italian you I break off a couple of bars for you if you want me to Rex Steiner Off the Mark and save Noe tried to save it and threw it off his own man and last time you saw re Steiner knocked down shot constantinos is staying right there in the lane would it like to see him be able to turn the corner I know he hit the last one but as as poorly as both teams have shot time from behind the arc I still feel like Virginia Tech is theyve got to run in them theyve got it where a couple of those shots going to start start the fall for Shrewsberry who still is not scored leaves in favor of Logan Im sophomore out of zionville and theres Po and he has a couple of buckets in the game and he has four in the second half a nice Dive by poti was able to get the ball on sunra was a little late I feel like thats a guy that they can give some offense from again Virginia te doing a good job of CH chipping away at this lead times coming off the screen nice feed and a lot of traffic in there the big fella sticks his nose straight ahead and when youre as big as he is why not Kowski did a good job of being able to gather himself thought he had the first look kept his footwork together was able to Corral it and finish it snow to Dames first field goal this second half Wild on the court looking for either shoot or this guy burn him to get something going today turn it over and those are the turnovers you see Mike young over there encouraging his team you cannot afford those unforced turnovers but again what you do is you give Notre Dame yet another opportunity to extend this lead and Marcus bird when hes got the ball in his hands know that hes the most dangerous player on the floor you know for the hokes when they had that six game losing streak they didnt shoot it well and they turned the ball over a lot both of those hangs um have reared its ugly head today theyve turned it over 12 times now and not shooting it well at all hes picks up his dribble and theres that three you were talking about he if youre Johnson you got to get up I know that he can blow by you but you had you read the Scout report that he doesnt need much time that last time Johnson had his hand down B raises up and knocks down that three that is now 19 and Burton the leading scorer in the Atlanta Coast Conference aage just 21 a game still not there the three ball and thatll be a foul underneath stanowski will be whistle for his third Tom watch this last play when you see Johnson he feel like hes playing pretty good defense Marb basically you youre not going to go and close him off he hes got great bounce and great rise on his jump shot elevates knocks down net three man he is some kind of player I mean you know look Cooper flag right now is probably having the best year of any player in the league I think we all can agree with that um you know RJ Davis a reigning Player of the Year in the Atlanta Coast Conference but uh as far as a guy that can hurt you in so many ways especially off the dribble I think thats where Burton really separates himself from a lot of guys as berham finally connects much deserved much needed three but going back to buron we talked about that NC State run when they went won five games with a team like this and a got it can give you buckets they could be very dangerous if they can get in and find the right match up in ACC tournament Shrewsberry back in there for his dad shot clock down to 12 hes looking for somebody to move Davis strong to the basket lays it in and nice Blow by by Tay Davis that last time he realized he had po if he could get past that shoulder then hes downhill and then hes going to finish at The Rim Davis saverage is 15 he has 13 and the lead back to nine for the Fighting Applause Music Irish oh the wall is spent a lot of time on that Virginia Tech bench they call PO for over the back thatll be his Music third see Markus burd look like he may have gotten scratched there on the right there at the rim of his nose probably going back to have that addressed and great opportunity for Mike young in Virginia Tech again to be able to get back into this game you see for his afternoon 19 points if Im Notre Dame I continue to put to keep that ball in Tay Daviss hands hes been the other guy thats been able to give us offense this afternoon lets mark it down here at the 1230 Mark to go and a ninepoint lead for Notre Dame but with Burton having to lead to go to the locker room good strong penetration to the basket by kevi Junior out of Centerville Ohio just outside of Dayton Ohio you see j a little bit penetration right there see Burnham cross the arm there TR showing guard likee skills putting the ball on the floor trying to get to the cup try averages six points six rebounds a game he played two seasons at Penn State and came with his coach next Saturday the exclusive own to NASCAR Tona International Speedway next Saturday four Eastern one Pacific only on the CW find it interesting with Burt now shuberry decides to come back in with Ser mohamd I thought in that first half when they were struggling with their offense he was a guy that kept kept them going offensively not so much with scoring but just with his playmaking yeah made some real nice passes did score a couple of buckets lob it in there and a foul underneath as the Wilds back in the game I still feel like for Virginia Tech theyve got to find theyve been able to keep this thing relatively close with their defense as where on offense theyve struggled and I look at this lineup you know assuming that L is able to make the free throws theyve got to be able to find someone that can give them some consistent points first drip to first successful trip to the free throw line for L who missed two to in the half 10point game trying to make it nine and he Applause does Under 12 to go here in South Ben Indiana on this very cold Saturday afternoon hey we thought it was bad here after those pictures of Syracuse game two of our double head were doing pretty good were doing okay yeah were hanging in there Applause great feed right there a terrific block great help by Young you saw a j it looked like its going to be easy dunk Young comes over and gets a block and then at the other end low with his third dunk of the game and all of a sudden that lead goes from 11 down to seven Great penetration by Burnham for to help and then again you know if L wild gets it anywhere close to the bucket you might as well consider it done all right so theyve actually lost two points off the lead since Burton left now with these two baskets from Tech and boy laow wondering what in the world am I supposed to do thats his third foul again you see Tay Davis get out hes been able to win that match up in the post and you see finally Marcus Burton comes back going with the towel over his head interesting to see if its something thats serious and whether its going to affect him on on his return maybe his girlfriends here want to see her beat up no all beat up know say hey the chicks like like it when you get a little bit little cut right there you know maybe thats my problem before I got married I should have gotten all cut up or something early I I got a chance to meet your wife you and I both have outed our Amen brother amen to Applause that good afternoon for Tay Davis you see 15 points and eight rebounds still no bur kind point lead and heres Johnson hes had a nice game Johnson and he will go to the free throw line as checking in for the first time Jr kesn the Junior from right here in South B went to St Joes high school and Johnson does a good job of being able to get down downhill and hes a guy that leans in the contact I remember talking to coach young he said he likes him because hes a physical guy that that plays hard as you see him to get the first one down and we again you see slowly Virginia Tech chipping away from this thing when it looks like Notre Dame may be able to expand this need this lead They still hang around hey both these teams have a lot to look forward to man and you know the next year coming years those so young and talented players one of two from the line is Johnson heres a crazy thing to for the wild card is that with the young guys you wander with n and the port doubt you know youre recruiting your guys and you see K Davis with opportunity to go to the bucket and looking for help is the official under the basket and youre right I mean you know you know coach young basically said he said as far as Im concerned I got to look at it like player in college basketball is in a Bo yeah he said its a shame he said I never thought in my 40 Years of coaching it would come to that but thats where it is but the weird thing is Ive traveled around the ACC and talked to these coaches when you have breakout players you worry about the guys in weather the next year y theyre off to what something better thats right or what they think sometimes is better right right losing his balance here going up was mohamd so now Virginia Tech down eight rexin heres shoot can he finally bury one and he does thats his first three and Tom thats the guy as you see time out call that Virginia Tech needs him to come again theyve been able to Chip Away cut this lead down to five and by the way Burton is coming back into the game so while he was gone they lost four points give State farmer call well get to work excuse me guys but the queen is already working here like a good neighbor State Farm is there still find a way to hang in there right now only down five well we all remember last year when the number 10 seed it was NC State made that incredible they they were the 10th seed in the ACC tournament they were the 11th seed in the NCAA tournament and you just have to find the right combination and get hot at the right time and get some momentum Burton has a cut above his right eye there is some swelling were told but hes in there right now for Notre deine in this fivepoint game and thats an air ball put up Im not so sure thats exactly what Michael Shrewsberry is looking for from Julian R well interested to see how that cut does affect him because again we talk about other than Tay Davis Notre Dame hasnt gotten reliable offense as Virginia Tech slowly seems like theyre trying to find and gain some ground re Steiner dumps it off to shoot who hit a three a moment ago defended by Shrewsberry and heres re Steiner King out long three and good wide open again Im not so sure thats a shot theyre looking there Zan checks into the game for the first time for Virginia Tech Burt no problem with the eye sometime I think that eye is okay and what you realize is that thats a guy that weve seen all afternoon long he does not allow you to speed him up he does not settle got a little separation to get that one to go thats his 10th 20po game this season bear in mind its only his 16th game of the year because he Applause missed six games after being injured early in the year watch this last play B clums up and low his sleep used that pick and roll a little bit of a hesitation gave him a little bit of a chicken wing get that separation that jump shot to go all right so Kevin Jai going to come back in poti comes back in were down to the final 836 to go and Notre Dame leading 50 43 Id give poti a touch real fast let let the big man go to work thats a nice little give and go and then they swing it Cross Court into the corner theyve had some really good looks from three and just continue to miss lewow wow what a nice left hand and good offensive rebound by lewow then last time does a good job of being able to absorb contact gets that one to go first H and figures now 10 and thats going to be an offensive foul against Burton and Burton was caught holding a wild that last time on the moving on that screen Michael Shrewsberry did not like that call a little Music bit watch this this pick and you see yeah I dont know what coach shw is talking about there on that one thats a offensive foul all day every day all right fivepoint game now big trip here final8 minutes to go for Virginia Tech heres young and he dribbles it off his foot po able to pick it up and able to get it out of there shot clock down to 10 shoot for three lall knocked it out of bounds so the under 18 and you had guys step up and you wonder since hes been back and because he is the guy is this still that adjustment Point period for them and understanding that they have to defer to him or still stay really aggressive oh thats an over and back yeah Mohamed tried to pick up his uh right foot before a cross over the line and hes unable to do so thats a turnover fivepoint game 732 to go and as much as we talk about Marcus Burt and the fact that you know Notre Dame is Led for the majority of this game Virginia Tech is still hanging in the wings if they can continue to find a way to get that that offense I still feel like breaking that paint getting the ball inside theyve had success with that swing across Court young bounce pass into the Wall Kicks it out to re Steiner shot clocked down at three hes going to have to put it up oh he lays it off for lall and hell go and lay it in what a finish I thought lall had a great opportunity early when he passed it out good dime by re Steiner and then lall with the presence of mind that finishes the shot clock was finished was closing how about time this lead now down to three 655 to go in South Bend heres Burton to the wreck picked up his dribble Shrewsberry has still not scored a single point in this game and the coachs son averages 14 a Applause game Burton forced that one and then an over the back I think theyre going to get poit on that one oh my gosh I think ja was trying to reach out for him and poti got got H with the hold watch watch this this battle down there between poti and J he knocked him over I thought he had squared up turned around he did not so thats now nine team fouls against Virginia Tech only six against Notre Dame and this will be a one and one for Shi 30 of 42 from the line on the year two for two Applause today game two of our triple header coming up next from Syracuse BC in the orange CW Courtside Saturday coming up next only on the CW then youre out the mo how about a couple of big wins for Georgia Tech playing in Virginia later you and I were there last weekend when they knocked off Louisville ending in 10 game win streak then they go to Clemson and win yeah I mean two quad one victories for the yellow jackets got a great opportunity going playing against the Virginia team theyre starting to find their little stretch too theyve struggled before its going to be a really good game second meeting of the year next weekend on CW between the hokes and the Cavaliers and Rex Steiner knocks down at three first time hes connected from downtown in the game and its a twopoint spread 615 left to go and you almost thought that as well as Virginia Tech shoots the ball that they were due Rick Steiner knocking down a much needed three Shrewsberry force that one and now all of a sudden the chance to tie or take the lead the only lead the hokes have had in this game is a very first possession on an alley slam to lewow and theres a nice little pick and roll and headed to the free throw line heres Toby but heres what set that up Rex Steiner because hes made a couple of buckets you got honor honor and show on him that last time watch this last time it allows L to be able to come over and get the ball and you see roer a little late on the rotation bows L Wild against the arm and now gives him opportunity to be able to tie this game up L wild is two of four from the free throw line miss his first two made his last two he hits two here were tied this is a two shot Applause foul oh those hurt 68 free throw shooter on the year leads his team in scoring and rebounding and field goal Music percentage hit one out of two and its a onepoint spread with 549 left young will lead coming back in for the hokes is Tyler Johnson Hammond still sitting on bench over there with four fouls but re Steiners playing quite well and that is a turnover another one against Notre Dame yeah yet another turnover unforced turnover for Notre Dame theyve got to regain their composure weve seen a slight sh shift in momentum as far as Virginia Tech is concerned that is 17 turnovers for the Irish and they average just 11 a game they swing it in the corner tried to lay it off excellent Anticipation by Burton and back the other way Davis and rejected by low great transition defense would look to be a two on1 situation L comes back for that block ooh how about that little ankle breaker and then you missed the shot he youve been there absolutely it looked pretty but you know the the end result was not what you expected boy that one would have gone down Mercy all right theyre clearing out down there for Davis whos had a nice game and bodies falling all over the place no whistle under five minutes to go in a onepoint under lead wide open for three and I mean didnt even catch a rim yeah youre Notre Dame right now I think a little pick and roll action maybe between Marcus Burton and and Tay Davis those have been the guys that youve been able to rely on all afternoon long Virginia check is five of 27 from threepoint L Burton on the crossover pulls up and got it to go thats what he did is basically he was able to get to a spot and he realized that he had Scott guard him was able to elevate extend this lead back up to three two better than a season average for Burton he has 23 on the night and the lead back to three Rex Steiner looking for Burnham who thought about pulling the trigger and now hes going to go into the lane Rex Steiner to tie it up knocked there followed by burnam to make it a onepoint gain and what a put back by Burnham he has five in the second half he has seven in the game 345 to go in South B looks like were headed for the last Whoever has the last Poss they pull this out why would you have anybody else touch it except for this guy into the lane Burton and couldnt get it to go go rebound for laow and now a chance again for Virginia Tech to take the lead it seemed like re Steiner has been the one thats had the pulse as far as getting them into their offense vernam for the lead and it does not follow low there with a follow and for the first time since it was two nothing on a lwow dunk his dunk gives his team their next lead of the game you see time out by Notre Dame we talked about this Virginia team nowhere to be able to give him that spurk Notre Dame shot 50 in the first half theyve shot 27 in the second half only five total field goals for Notre Dame in this second half shot clock at 10 and Burton with a ball defended by and heres Shrewsberry whos still not scoring and he had a feel for that young man its been a rough day Tom Im not sure that if Im might young what I would do is on those pick and rolls with Marcus bton maybe I double team that and get the ball out of his hands especially youre talking about you got 239 no one else on Notre Dames team is consistently shown that they can put provide a bucket other than Tay Davis yeah Davis has 15 and not another Notre Dame player with more than six rejected by lwow oh that is wow indeed great great helps side and Recovery by law watch this last block block where he comes out of nowhere slaps over to the second row God what an athlete look at that talk about a guy just off just sure athleticism Here Comes Burton in the corner and trying to go Baseline spins into the lane and heres Davis and a tough shot there and now Virginia Tech with 25 to go with the basketball and the onepoint lead good defense by re Steiner Last At Last go around to force Marcus burden to give the ball up hey Rex Ste has got a chance to be a pretty good player he does and I thought that especially is comeing you see Burnham knocked down at three outside of Rex Steiner is also be Burnham in this second half thats allow Virginia Tech to come up big and extend their lead and out of four Burnham shoots 46 from threepoint land and Burton trying to do it all by himself rer into the lane kicks it out to Burton and he got fouled and thats now the double bonus watch this land play you get the ball you pass him a good shot from shoot over to Burnham hes been a guy as of late consistent knocking down shots yeah he was not making shots early they were really counting on him to start off well after transferring from Charleston and now starting to shoot it much better tell you this foul situation could be a big deal and the rest of the way two shots you see rer at the line right now it seems that LW may have to come to come out of the game Im not sure if he guy maybe a little blood showing or something like that somebody better get over there and get it fixed up because they need this guy back in the game oh absolutely and again going back to rein I think that he made the transition one of the officials come over and confirm that Lew had a little blood that they needed to address yeah that was Trey Sans who came over and of course the officials are wearing the wristbands in remembrance of his father Ry stons who is an official for over 35 years in the ACC we lost him and U all the officials remembering him in all his great years of service here in the Atlanta Coast Conference two big free throws for rer here seen nor Dame leave from moster afternoon find themselves down by four roer able to bang it in there a 58 free throw shooter though he is rarely ever at the lot and Burnham going to leave boy maybe this Im a little surprised Burnham as theyre going to the offensive end of the floor that he has taken out of the game Im surprised as well because you know Virginia Tech they struggle to find offense hes a guy that gave them some valuable minutes not sure if Im Mike young how long I keep him on the bench yeah hes a very good free throw shooter as Applause well shoot nearly Music travel shot clock at 10 and heres re Stein working on Burton pulls up for three and that will be stuck and itll give it to Notre Dame Im not sure thats a shot they were looking for on that Tri and I dont Im Im Im sure that maybe potit chance you see your boy Burnham come back into the game not sure why you would not have had him on the offensive Music possession and and heres again we go back Notre Dames down by two you got a little bit more than a minute Im running some type of a pick and roll action with Marcus Burton but if Im a Virginia Tech I wall up that lane and do not allow him to get any kind of blow by Burton fade away little strong and lall back in the game able to get the rebound so now were exactly at one minute to go in South Ben Indiana and a twopoint hoky Applause lead low left t and K up so now Notre d a chance to tie or take the lead Burton defended by Rex Steiner and they just clear out for him in the lane man two shots in a row in and out and that was probably one of the easiest shots that hes had you see right now Notre Dame getting up to foul re Steiner that last time Burton did the back down and got a good look Music Applause headed to the free throw line is Rex Steiner where he is a 75 free throw shooter the Southpaw from aworth Georgia with a righthander from aworth Georgia these are big big big and he got the first one to make it a threepoint game all of his points have come here in the second can have in close games this year its been a disaster for Notre Dame one and three decided by three points or fewer Virginia Tech unbeaten in such games Notre Daves had three losses this year by a single point and he was only able to make one of two but baded back and save and what about a heads up play and get some type of violation that works even better if you look at the alignment from Virginia Tech theyre going to come out and youre going to have maybe Rex Steiner and shoot come in and get the ball and it is Rex Steiner as you thought it would be hes double teamed in the corner ooh and perhaps a little early on that foul and Tom heres the thing is that you had him perfectly trapped you got 18 seconds I would have gone and inheld that trap and force him to throw that ball away because he had nowhere to go boy oh boy it looked like they had him sandwiched down there didnt it this is a textbook trap if youre Notre Dame right there you do not have to foul for the ball and they had the other passes pretty much locked up Rex Steiner has just hit three of four in the last minute and make it four out of five and that makes it now a fourpoint lead for Virginia Tech 15 seconds remaining we talked a lot about law and how he was able to get going but I really thought in that second half it was Rex Steiner they got them going with his playmaking and making some shots yeah that was after Hammond got his fourth foul and Rex Steiner has stepped in there and done an excellent job five out of six from the line and now the final 12 seconds Burton Shrewsberry in the corner Davis for three not over yet all of a sudden its a twopoint game and nice play to get the ball over to T Davis like you say ball security is essential you got to get the ball in if youre vir ATT who what happened a timeout by Young oh wow that was a close wow telling everybody get down or at least lets get some separation and some spacing here and now here we go they get it into re Steiner hes trapped in the corner and trapped in that corner and they what possibly could be Tate Davis on the push Id like to see that again because I thought they got him exactly where they were watch again Watch where sundra and Tay Davis come over theyve got him it looked like there was a little bit of a shove by sandre with the left hand forces Rex Steiner out second time in a row that Notre Dame literally had re Steiner where they wanted him all right re Steiner has hit five of six from the line and four of five just here in the last less than a minute and 20 seconds for a threepoint lead its a he makes this one and thats pretty much all she wrote cool has he been I mean stepping up knocking down this free throws only a sophomore backup point guard to Hammond that averages about 2222 minutes lets take a look at our play of the game its Brandon Shrewsberry we talked about his struggles carrying over from the floorida state game into this afternoon Music all right so some full court light pressure by the hokes with 46 left and heres Shrewsberry for three and the lay in at the buzzer by serup to make it a twopoint final but how about Virginia Tech thats a big time win for the hokes big time win for the hes theyve been playing well Mike Youngs got to be proud of his guys they were able
