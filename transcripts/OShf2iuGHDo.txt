half against LSU down in Baton Rouge the Bucks looking for their first division one win of the year and the tap is controlled by Dorian Ana and off we go Thanksgiving Eve hoops at the corner of first and Fowler and Nathan George the sophomore who had his best shooting night of the Season as last time out goes right to tongo and a oneand Aly John thats what youre talking about hey thats the twoman game right there are the two sophomores these are the standout guys for the jackets and picking up full court Nate George hungry on defense playing 994 ft so quick foul on Nathan George but thats been one of the challenges for Georgia Tech these last couple of times out they have struggled offensively in the first half the Buccaneers led by Taj Kelly their senior forward from Atlanta he started every game this season so is dalen Barry a new face in the lineup though Derrick Harris Jr from Camila Georgia making his first start as a Buccaneer and Kelly goes to working on W Che what hes got two for the yellow jackets one change to their starting lineup from last game Javen McCollum the transfer from Oklahoma is out tonight he is in protocol therefore Lance Terry gets the start hes been their Sixth Man George hangs and his shot short rebound to Kell Georgia Southern defensively playing manto man really forcing Georgia Tech away from the middle of the floor on that possession underneath the theres Harris now Jones with it he goes up and draws contact our officiating crew led by Clarence Armstrong Mark schner and Conor Penn Rees Jones you hes a guy that hes had his spots this season he had 21 points 14 boards in that you know tough loss to LSU in which they were in the game uh up by five at the half on that one Wy but he was nine of n perfect from the field against the SEC foe in LSU yeah hes shooting 70 from the floor and less than 50 from the free throw line Yellow Jackets want to make it earn it hits his first hits him both for Georgia Tech against Cincinnati they turn the ball over 10 times in the first half five in the first three minutes and Charleston Suther applying some press Terry Zips it in Ona and swatted on the arm by ree Jones well I like the attack they throw over the pressure one two2 three4 court press and theyre on a three on two on the back side i w checkw a little bit slow to get to the rim like to see him catch and go directly up but hes at the line hes playing great ball he has 24 rebounds in his last three games three in which he started so its eight boards per game for the Freshman been a tough start for anek with the free throw line for Georgia te he 0 for seven this year theres a look at head coach Damon stoutmire in his second Music season and he harped on one thing in particular tonight John and moving forward for Georgia Tech theyve got to have better ball movement Dongo and Jones crumple down on top of each other I think its just the details the attention to details offensively ball movement is crucial but you also need you know good positioning good spacing the screening the timing of the screens all these things that you work on in practice early in the season Wy uh jacket just need to find T in those things Kelly lost control of it you saw dalen Barry at the point guard position for Charleston Southern a transfer from UNC Charlotte first year as a starter Barry here to inbound gets it into Kelly for Charleston Southern you mentioned have not beaten a division one team this year they defeated Morris College and niia school a few weeks ago shot clock winding down Harris has got to send it upward its short and Nate George the Applause rebound on wua from the free throw line it falls nice execution by the jackets pushing Tempo and that was a high percentage look for the big man about 12T out straight on and both teams applying full court three4 court press each of these teams have had trouble turning the ball over this year and theres a threepointer falling for Thompson Kamar now two of 10 on the year he has struggled with that shot so far collecty as a team Georgia sou just shooting 26 from Beyond the arc on the season theres the Pigman showing the rain thats a part of his game and like Kamar he struggled shooting the three these first few weeks the fron would check what you know coach tar says just about getting confidence Baseline Drive Harris cant finish from underneath and around three Yellow Jackets he gets the rebound and then Taps it back to Jones great effort from Derek Harris Jr getting the Applause start jabed Loose by Terry now a chance to get out and run and layup no stick back wasy Reeves yes thats what wasy Reeves brings to the Yellow Jacket team 37 games played 37 starts hes a leader an unsung hero for this team and know his Player Development hes gradually gotten better each game and that three drops in for Taj Kelly Charleston Southern in that loss to Ferman last weekend they shot just four of 23 from Beyond The Arc is George from the short Corner gets it to drop we saw Kelly Make the basket there he also had 15 and8 against LSU hes an Atlanta native played at Grayson High School up in Gwynette County not far from the flats here yeah nearly won a State title as a junior lost by one point to Wheeler High Music Applause School fact he was high school teammates with Devon Smith back at Grayson former jacket and that ball knocked out of bounds itll stay with Charleston Southern both teams connecting from long distance these first couple of minutes the yellow jackets and the Buccaneers theyve struggled to score recently not in the open tonight an wua for the yellow jackets and Taj Kelly for the bucks FY hell chir back at coach Stam in practice give him a little something I wouldnt do too much of that but uh you know to steal from Colorado I mean theres a buffalo team thats going in the right direction knocked off Yukon last night um great get for the jackets and again this is an Institute here in Atlanta and the ACC and this city you can recruit from the entire Globe um they can get Talent here and Coach stms done a nice job of that after a Miss threepointer from Keenan Wilkins got a foul coming here on Lamar Odin Jr another Georgia n out of Douglasville product of greenforest Academy spent the last four years at Drexel University now at Charleston Southern for his Fifth and final year Ibrahim schar getting some early minutes as is Duncan pal theyve checked in for Georgia Tech Terry floats hits I like that action theres no coverage in the middle and thats why like on that possession for Georgia Tech is the ball movement you know one or two ball ball reversals and they get a wide open layup and that was an emphasis coming into the game move the basketball switch sides of the floor make the defense work t a long way from the paint races back Wilkins now penetrating kicking out Taj Kelly that three wont fall so far charlest and Southern half their field goal attempts have been from Beyond The Arc and a foul coming here on Keenan Wilkin seeing Nate George Applause colliding here well take a look at Georgia Techs last possession it was a ball movement and Lance Terry a guy thats great playing downhill hes a veteran guy third leading scorer on the jackets roster at a season high at home against Georgia she had 20 points in that game he can score the Music ball yeah all 20 of those points came in the second half he sends a sharp bounce pass into Dongo and hes found that touch around the rim thats been a challenge for by the last couple of games hes been getting quality looks just has not been able to connect on Dongo two of two from the floor four points again hes second team preseason all ACC selection only took four shot attempts in the loss against Cincinnati on Saturday so jacket doing a nice job getting in the basketball yeah those five points against Georgia the fewest points he had scored since early February last year against Louisville we had a look at Suare number 30 he and Bongo both bring length to the lineup defensively uh can really cover some ground both athletic wiry guys that uh can contest at The Rim as well the biggest challenge for sare trying to stay out of foul trouble last 12 minutes of game play hes now got seven fouls of course spanning multiple gsan Wilkins the freshman coach Nims team a team that plays smart basketball uh they shoot more free throw attempts than their opponents they dont foul and give away points at the free throw line um very heady team their aill is Hil kiles heel has been shooting the basketball just 55 from the free throw line on the season and struggling from Beyond AR and theres a turnover the other way Barry can he recover no we got a foul coming Charleston Southern theyve shot just 26 from Beyond The Arc this year and heres a look at the turnover the live ball turnovers thats been a major point of emphasis for Coach Damon star the last couple of weeks they they played just the two games over the last two weeks yeah thats you know its just focus and um you got to go through Growing Pains but entering league play those are things you got to clean Applause up so Barry hits the first free throw Jaylen Gibson heads to the bench for Charleston Southern Rees Jones returns and Nate George now with two fouls he heads to the bench and you can see charlest and Southern they havent had trouble getting to the line they just havent capitalized and now Jaden mustaf Charles getting the line 22 times per game and theyre making 12 of them so leaving 10 points at the line thats a huge number 55 from the free throw Lines not going to get it done and you know theyre 26 on the season coming into this one from Beyond The Arc and 42 of their shot attempts Wy are from Beyond The Arc so you know you add those two stats up if they can correct that defensively theyve been good just shooting the basketball and not a team that turns it over a lot Jaden mustaf his jumper is short and another storyline developing here John we have not seen RJ Johnson yet tonight who is Charlestons Southern leading threepoint shooter he started four games this year as Kelly can miss with the right hand or cant make it with the right hand played 38 minutes in their lost to Ferman but we have not seen him tonight and theres no preseason or I should say pregame notice or anything like that yeah hes also the leading assist man at 32 assists on the season 20 turnovers uh hes a hes a big piece uh and a turnover Here Comes moop liftoff and by Dango there to clean it up Wilkins had good hands but Georgia Tech cleaning up the backboard Dongo eating pre Thanksgiving meal right there off the glass Georgia Tech up eight largest lead of the game will be back at kremens court in Music Applause Atlanta maybe moose was I I bet he I mean yeah can text him Music but after a few sluggish first halfs Georgia Tech has put up 20 points theyre shooting close to 70 here in the first seven minutes and John A lot of that damage has come around the rim yeah Georgia Tech has done a nice job uh last few possessions getting stops pushing Tempo and the hustle factor a number of guys on the roster cleaning up the backboard by Dongo on that last possession with the hustle play so out of the timeout will be dalen Barry bring the ball up the floor for Charleston Southern guarded by Duncan pal who was really the silver lining in that loss to Cincinnati for Georgia Tech gave him 10 points off the bench and a poor pass is picked off by Terry and mustaf bowling over Keenan Wilkins its been a little bit of an adjustment for Jaden mof to the college game of course he had that right wrist injury and for mustaf he feels like hes being guarded differently here at the college level than he was in high school a lot more of the Defenders are going under those ball screens than what he saw in high school yeah and the hardest part about that if if youre not a knockdown threepoint shooter from you know when your Defenders going under screens to have the patience to let the game come to you dont feel like youve got a force um because hes a guy that defensively athletically hes played at a high level he can play in this league but as a freshman he just needs to learn observe play hard play defense and not force the offense itll itll come he will develop theyve got a great coaching staff um and again the injuries dont help yeah you see that left wrist taped up I beg your pardon but its tough enough to jump into college basketball as a true freshman as Kelly misses the first free throw but to play your first game against West Georgia then you miss two games against North Florida and Texas Southern and your next two are against Georgia and Cincinnati two teams that are extremely physical that makes it that much tougher I think mustaf will Thrive against those opponents and hes a guy that can play downhill hes physical he hes hes strong hes athletic um his game he can get it going getting to the free throw line early sprinting the floor hitting the offensive glass getting some run outs um just needs to get comfortable needs more minutes hes going to get the opportunity here tonight Nate George pick up those two fouls early Charles and Southern they have not hit a b a bucket in nearly 5 minutes but they have been getting to the free throw line and we got a foul here on reys Jones willll step aside Georgia Tech a 20 to2 lead think a staff uh Trey Johnson Nate Lewis guys that have played at Charleston Southern so three of your five have a lot of pride in the university and can definitely recruit and sell it sell that Vision in support of coach nimley and then mik Howen a great associate head coach coming from William and Mary and before that spent time on some winning teams at winth so solid staff moff taking it to the hole and theres Applause two as georia te gets ready for Oklahoma North Carolina next week I think these these next two games including tonight going to be big for Jayden mustaf as geord Austin Southern turns it over yeah minutes played I mean thats thats the best teacher for players is get out there especially a freshman like mustaf whos battling some injuries get the minutes and then spend time with your assistant coaches watch film uh theres a lot to learn game is different at this level and if youre coachable we know hes talented those things add up LC OBrien just checking into the game unloads it to Dongo works it back out to must who between JV and McCollum being out tonight and Nate George pick up those early two fouls were going to have mustaf running the point and we got a foul on the rebound even that possession right there he had the size Advantage was a little little bit hesitant you know Id like to see him be a little bit more aggressive thinking hey Ive got a 6in Advantage right here this is my bucket still a highquality shot but thatll come with confidence that offensive minded scores mentality hes a guy that you get a mismatch like that can score on that all day get to the free throw line conversation here between Conor pen and head coach nimley coach nimley working on the side line see got down in a stance selling it and thats because Taj Kelly just picked up his second Music foul so both teams now with six fouls wasy Reeves to Music inbound little given go between the freshman and Jaden Musta flushes it with two hands nice back door freshman to freshman on that play So getting used to playing with each other on the floor thats a nice combination of true freshman you dont see a lot of two freshman combos on the floor at the same time anymore in the college game tough shot for Harris a battle for the the board and itll stick with Charleston Southern but the Freshman from Buoy Maryland starting to find his legs here right there dalen Berry took his eyes off his man was caught steering at the ball no weakside help and there you see the athleticism of the Freshman getting up finishing at The Rim jackets up 12 largest lead in this one a longer conversation between Clarence Armstrong and the officiating crew confirming that they do have it as Buccaneer basketball be the Freshman Wilkins to inbound and it goes to Taj Kelly senior from Atlanta in the painted area going up against Dongo and a foul here on Dongo put Kelly at the line thats nice action by Charleston Southern on that possession they needed a basket bad got the ball to their most aggressive score in the paint Kelly oneonone ISO situation against by and he drew the foul so Kelly at the line missed his first two free throws hes shooting below 50 on the season but Charles and Southern theyre missing a big piece it appears offensively tonight RJ Johnson who played 38 minutes and is shooting over 40 from three is in Street closed John we did not get any notice about him being scratched he is not scratched in the official game book but he appears to not be available at least for the time being as kaasi Reeves spins hangs and hits nice possession Again by the jacket J RJ Johnson hes averaging 32 minutes per game hes the leading threepoint field goal percentage shooter and threepoint shot maker as well as the leading assist man so a huge void in Charleston ss roster tonight and a poor pass from Lamar Odin Jr another turnover in Charleston Southern they have not hit a shot from the floor John in the last 6 and 1 half minutes so clearly missing RJ Johnson who was an all Big South Conference honorable mention last year in fact he led the conference in minutes per game so its not just the production but I mean just the sheer minutes be a considerable absence mate George back on the floor with his two fouls on Wu with taking it himself cant get it to fall a battle for the rebound and it winds up in the hands of the smallest man on the floor Keenan Wilkins transition three ball Barry way off Applause Music line theyre going to get on W with they on the contact on the rebound Buccaneers had the right idea on that possession pushing Tempo the pitch ahead had a good look but like I said thats been the story this season 25 as a team from Beyond The Arc but the hustle is there we get to the line chance to H on the hard way Odin Jr hits the front end of a one and one hear the name Odin you you think of one guy right John Greg Odin they are cousins Lamar second cousins with Greg OD former Ohio State Buckeye apparently distant enough cousins to not get that 7ot height he still got good size and again he played meaningful minutes at Drexel off the knee of George and right to kaase Reeves and a loose ball pulled down by dalen Barry Wilkins catch and shoot three it wont go Kelly looking for the offensive room rebound oh check with diving itll stick with Charleston Southern but were going on S and a half minutes now Charleston Southern has not made a basket and you cant fault the looks theyre getting good looks um just its a make or Miss game its a shot makers league right uh you got to make those shots and you know I think as a coaching staff if youre youre happy with the shot selection you got to play that way I mean a team that shoots 42 of their field goals from Beyond The Arc thats thats philosophical thats the way they play dont think pitch ahead take high percentage shots thats whats repped in practice but early on in this season have not been able to find the stroke and as much as you may hear it preach from your coach I mean as a shooter at some point it does feel a little tense like weve got to have this next one right Applause now I agree Wy and Georgia Tech theyre just stacking points high percentage shots getting stops one and DS and gradually pulling away with this one 16 to4 run for Georgia Tech Terry creates a steal here we go hes got the launch codes Lance Terry and a Timeout on the floor called by coach son nimley he may only stand 6 three but hes got a 40 in vertical take another look at this the pitch ahead the jackets in command Terry Tak an early serving on Thanksgiving week here good memories it was 98 coach kems coach team we won 103 to 63 uh then Paul hts first year SE senior season November 21 2000 was an 8562 Victory early in the season see if we can find those highlights throw them up at halftime points in that last one were looked it up yeah you guys left some points at the free throw line though it was something like 25 for 50 or something like that Charleston Southern just desperate to get the lid off the basket Taj Kelly Ching up on anqua the extra pass and Kelly there it is on Ibrahim asare and for the first time in nearly 9 minutes thats a made basket for Charleston sou great action coming out of the dead ball situation s nimley dialed it up cleared the weak side of the floor went twoman game and Ibrahim Suare not worried about Rees Jones there nice job keeping the ball high on that possession he caught it gathered ball never came down solid Applause fundamentals Kelly too strong theres the put back for Jones and second chance points that was how Charleston Southern was able to take a lead into halftime against LSU and Baton Rouge they just they they outwork the Tigers on the glass and when youre shooting the percentage theyre shooting youre going to need those extra shots unw what double teamed Duncan pal tries to stroke one and its well short step back find the line he had 10 points his last game and a heat check coming out of the Applause gate and we got a foul here its going to be on reys Jones thats three on Jones yeah that hurts uh the pleaded lineup ready foul trouble starting to creep in for Coach nimley Squad the Buccaneers going to have to find some Power Punch From the Bench tonight well coming off the bench its going to be Lee oleri played just five minutes against Ferman so hes in F Jones presumably for the rest of the half soare at the line again the absence of RJ Johnson the guy that shootting 44 from three coming into this one third leading scorer on the Bucks roster and the leading assist man so its a night where for the Buccaneers roster its going to be some of the parts need guys to step up make plays yeah with the injury to Johnson its only 10 players available and Anthony Gau is a freshman hasnt played the last couple of games theres no official update on his status and SAR gets the high Applause bounce its the yellow jackets shooting nearly 60 from the floor offensively it seems like they found some better ball movement too eight assists just two turnovers theyve been taking good care of the Applause basketball Odins three well short Music Applause again there was thats how they play there was no hesitation uh the shot was there it went up and again airball on that possession weve seen a couple just hit the backboard totally missed the rim you look at Odins first three years at Drexel he was shooting nearly 35 from three but the last year and a half somethings just falling out of sink in his shot Nate George little hesan drive and a lay in off the glass D jackets have broken it up to 18 now the change of change of pace on that possession Nates very good at that getting the defense to freeze and then a jolt to the rim to finish and there he is with the offensive put back good effort mustaf came down hold the ankle a little bit on the end of that play looks to be okay this time its Kamar and he buries it Charleston Southern needed that theyre now three of 12 from Beyond The Arc tonight onward with going up batting for the ball and its Oli with it derck Harris lost his footing but hes back up and running and now Lance Terry hes already got four steals tonight bumping up again Applause Barry 6 seconds to shoot Barrys going to have to attack offbalance shot and Dongo ripping away the Applause rebound so far it just seems like Georgia Techs Pace on both ends of the floor has improved as St George hits another midrange jumper well he was just probing the defense found the step back nice shot by the sophomore Georgia Tech up sense gives hes got three rebounds as well hes playing hard four of seven from the floor and 12 minutes a play his output is there his efficiency is there more importantly his mentality thats what needs to carry on as they start playing stronger opponents you think it has to do with the shoes theyre pink Applause be between Georges pink shoes you got by Dongo with the turquoise lot of color out there on the feet tonight thats Terrys got some purple ones either way 5 Seconds to shoot Wilkins has his pass disrupted by Dongo he runs the floor he will go to the free throw line mustaf a nice job re recogition the jump stop the soft touch pass jackets out and running Dongo to the line a stretch the lead well be back Mish Music Pavilion downhill get to the paint get to the line were always seeing already seeing ree Jones one of the starters on the front line for Charleston Southern with three fouls so definitely working in a game where RJ Johnson is also out not dressed tonight hes the third leading scorer for Charleston Southern couch star talks a lot about how the key for by Dongo is to pay attention to the details hes talking about boxing out defense trying to keep him engaged and thats really when hes at his best and he had some pretty big performances last year you think about that game against Duke as Lance Terrys called for the foul there but if hes doing the little things right John it seems like the offense kind of comes to him its natural yeah and and you know we talk about little things the Casual fan thinks about offense the little things on the defense up side of the ball if youre by Dongo you know youre positioning youre going to be in a ton of ball screen defense the ability to sit down know what the Scout is be there talk on defense from you know if youre a post youre usually behind the action youre kind of the the point guard the catcher so to speak so youve got to be a very vocal player on the basketball court those are the little things the details that coach star and the staff talk about thats what translates to you know get to the next level so Barry misses the front end of the one and one and now its going to be an offensive foul on Dongo like you were talking about John little things you know unforced error youre 45 ft from the basket and a moving screen so tremendous Talent having a tremendous game but always room to improve and I think thats what you know you hopped on earlier speaking to coach Dons how do we get better well as a collective we all have to get better at the details The Bigs on both sides in foul trouble now dangos got three Luca OBrien trying to guard down low forces the Miss Jaden mustaf with some more minutes tonight with JV and McCollum out feeds OBrien the threepointer just short and Jaylen Gibson Soares in for the rebound the transfer from UNCC Music Greensboro Kelly lowers the shoulder mustaf absorbs it nearly forced to turnover but theyll say it stays with Charleston Souther oh Brian right there Hit the Floor diving hes hes battled some injuries as well but a guy with a ton of minutes NCA tournament Applause experience you mentioned getting Dorian anqua away from Colorado he signed a letter of intent to go there out of college before or out of high school rather luk OBrien a transfer from Colorado and now a double team down low Gibson got a pretty good look at it and its bat in the air and down for Charleston Southern you know you talk about details that was an example right there Suare you know you cannot let the offensive player that close to the basket slide through and you got to respond like that come back to the other end and slam it home look at that smile from Pango on the bench Wilkins underhand flip and Barry was losing control of the basketball but hes fouled Buccaneers is already in the double bonus here you see Nate great Court Vision Suare a guy that can catch and finish at The Rim you see the great length the extension he plays his role you know set good screens play defense be vocal have energy Sprint the floor finish at The Rim hes a guy that can as the season goes on he gets more minutes can be a real positive for the jackets hes got six points in just seven minutes tonight its pretty good for a guy who had three points on the whole season coming into tonight red shirt freshman from Guinea its about opportunity you know we havent spoken much about it but jackins without their leading score of Mulla coming into this one Music kayen mustaf into the lane B some space and knocks it down the mentality right there he was aggressive downhill he had score in mind gathered and shot just confidence right there after failing to score 30 points in either half against Cincinnati Georgia Techs got over 40 and now Ibrahim suar picks up his third foul had the position had the verticality you got to stay down and take one for the team right there he left his feet you were there you were there just take the hit well hes going to chat up larence Armstrong anyway oh hes got no argument on that one he left his feet he had the position bottom line you got to let the player run you over you know you just got to take the hit for the team that might be what Clarence is telling him I guarantee it lay out man take for the team so sare to the bench on wua hes got two fouls and Taj Applause Music Applause Music Kelly its one out of two Charleston Southern 9 for 15 so far from the free throw Applause line under two minutes to play here in the first half oh good crossover and the elbow J oh yes he looks real comfortable with the basketball hes hes reading the defense playing with a great pace for a freshman to see that pace I think at just minutes you know hes getting out there hes getting comfortable great execution by mustaf thats going to be three on Nate George now so for as many things that have gone right for Georgia Tech in this first half John they have committed as a team now 12 fouls and big part 13 fouls and now Suare Dongo and George all have three Wilkins hits the first free Music Applause Music throw both teams fouling a lot in this one for the jackets George with three fouls Dongo with three Suare with three Terry with two Charleson Southern you know theyve done a nice job this season this is not new theyre theyre great at picking up fouls I think their personnel and the way they attack lends itself to that guy like Taj Kelly really attacks the glass puts pressure on the defense in the interior mustaf little backhand pass to on W with the sky hook now and another foul the wayy Reeves you even saw Mark Schnur there the official making the call saying all right guys come on Coach man thats thatll give you a few gray hairs hes coaching though hes coaching on the sideline talking to his young freshman he knows give me some FaceTime let me teach its G to pay off so Barry hits the first free throw Charleston Southern 18 free throw attempts here in the first half and that has kept them within range ultimately theyre going to have to shoot the ball better from the floor below 30 here in the first half OBrien flashing open down low on the Block touch was off Wilkins the rebound and now Charleston Southern if they can put together one good final minute here just could to have a different feel going into the locker room than what it might have looked like 5 minutes ago Gibson on Reeves attacking and hitting its down to 13 its a game of runs and the bucks now with a 60 run in the last minute of this one so not going away showing some fight one more stop and a bucket youre feeling really good going into halftime if youre a buccaneer Ons got to get rid of it tend to shoot for Lance Terry gets past Wilkins fading away and he gets the roll Barry coming up the floor with 10 seconds left in the first half ball screen from Kelly a three no and Barry waiting for it to fly out of bounds and with 710 of a second left Buccaneers will have one chance the Baseline inbounds and kaasi Reeves down Im not sure what happened if hes cramping or grabbing the left ankle little early on in this one to be cramping might have rolled the ankle on that possession we didnt see it longtime trainer Richard Stewart attending to wayy Reeves on the side line well get a Suare checking into the game right there roll ouch that hurts hope hes okay you see Richard Stewart Long Time athletic trainer hell have some time to spend with him and halftime looks like hes going to be be able to return year number 18 for Richard Stewart catch and shoot Wilkins goes up and its a clean block Luke OBrien smothering Wilkins in the yellow jackets will take a 15point lead into halftime coach saw nimley arguing at midcourt but thats the end of the first half and having discipline on the offensive side of the ball Taj Kelly goes to anqua and theres the third foul on Dorian an wua well we knew Georgia Tech in foul trouble on the front line Dongo with three thank youon had two now he has three so the Georgia Tech front line and thats what happened Kellys a guy in a half court situation put him in ISO you see his size his strength his ability to put it on the ground and both Yellow Jackets leaving their feet and thats what we say Play Hard Play smart playing spart means getting position having the discipline to not foul not bring your hands down and and right now Jack its battling foul trouble on the front line so Ona now with two fouls Dongo playing with three and Jaylen Gibson is in for Thompson Kamar so the change in the AR your pardon for Rees Jones so a Chang in the starting lineup the beginning of the first half for Charleston Southern out of the timeout a turnover and oh my is this going to be a foul on P Dongo it is that is his fourth on a loose ball you mentioned it during the break John that if Charleston Southern the first step is trying to get by Dongo his fourth foul well that they need to get someone to the bench and Suare will come in and again he has three so now you have a young front line with Suare and O CA and things get interesting still a long way to go lead is down to 13 Barry turns the corner is laying a short Gibson a second chance and another foul on anwood cheekwood now he has three and for Georgia Tech is a team that is now 17 fouls tonight in hardly 30 seconds into the first half coach Damon statamire wants a timeout well Charleston Southern is getting some pieces in place to try and make a run at the yellow jackets in the second half back in a moment from a cish pavilion Music Music the first stre Music middle Music in5 Applause you Music Applause Music d Applause Applause Applause Music Applause Music head coach Damon statamire not just with some Choice words for his team but with a fiery tone trying to get the yellow jackets locked in for this second half and John thats the type of intensity you see from a guy whos been over a decade in the NBA yeah 13 seasons in the NBA uh hes a storied player and now a great coach as a player took zon to the final four and you as a head coach at Pacific five years a second year at Georgia Tech spent time on the bench at Zona Memphis rice he knows whats coming hes trying to get the jackets ready and you look at foul trouble Dongo George Suare check where the entire front Music line in foul trouble and and thats what I think was talking about we got to be smart weve got to have position weve got to have discipline um and said it in an emphatic way is from what we can what we can tell trying to send the message and although Charleston Southern this year shooting just 55 from the free throw line they have hit 74 of their free throws today and the leads down to 11 Nate George cant get the bucket and now a chance to get it to single digits for Charleston Southern missing one of their key pieces in RJ Johnson whos out with injury tonight Jaylen Gibson going up against Suare Gibson off balance good defense from Suare and he gets the rebound Gibson had a good look on that a nice left off the glass couldnt get it to drop and Suare turns it over Barrys going to push the pedal and he dribbles it off his leg its to Tech basketball a break for the yellow check its Nate George who trying to close down on him now nine turnovers in the game for the bucks and only four assists for Charleston Southern and theyre going to get Thompson Kamar there thats his first foul Odin Jr will come in for the bucks 20 on the shot clock Georgia taking a box set theyre going to get the ball to their point guard and see if they can operate here George weaving stopping and its batted back by Suare Lance Terry at six points in the first half at four steals now into the lane left hand no Suare again on the glass cant finish and the rebound belongs to Derek Harris Jr Suare chasing him down fed down low Kelly goes up and theres two and its down to nine mate George is going to have a bruised rib tomorrow right there that was a man move in the paint weve got a ninepoint game Georgia Tech struggling again 60 Run for the Buccaneers start the second half Lance Terry draws the foul go to the line for two but first you talked about a bruised rib John lets take another look right here the awareness boom put him on your back Nate does a nice job not fouling on that possession he was at a disadvantage Georgia Tech will go to the line trying to get back to double figures Bucks have done a nice job getting the ball in the paint Applause that is a third foul on taj Kelly or Taj Kelly who weve been talking about Jordan Tech foul trouble Charleston Southern has some of their own and if youre the bucks if you can play downhill and get some dribble penetration get some postups theres a a natural tendency for less resistance when youre in foul trouble so theyre going to get some good looks they can add the discipline the probe and get it to the basket on dribble drives ISO post situations John you expected to see some Zone from Georgia Tech with the foul trouble and a nice touch from Taj Kelly finds the soft spot eightpoint game again Dongo on the bench straddled with four fouls Mulla not playing in this one so Georgia Techs two leading scores coming in this one youre not going to see that on the floor so its going to be about Georgia Tech sticking together theyre getting tested need to persevere right here stick together you got enough Talent out there got to find a way without your two leading scorers so the foul is going to go against dalen Barry itll put Suare at the Music line red shirt freshman from Guinea and already tonight he has played 10 minutes Music and that is a career high those 10 minutes but hes brought some good energy Yellow Jackets though have missed a couple of free throws here to begin the second Music half both teams with three fouls Wy already just under three minutes into this one so much of the same this has been a physical game Suare misses them both and Dorian an wua going to get called for over the back on the rebound that gives him four fouls Georgia Techs going to have to play small ball expect to see a lot of Zone but its got to be an aggressive Zone active Music hands we still have looks like theyre going to stay man over 17 minutes left Music John then Gibson gets the ball across theres a long way to go a few foul to give Kelly nice feed on the back door cut and good patience from Kamar everything but the Applause basket Lance Terry trying to squeak past Kelly he does and it goes down anyway good contest from Gibson Terry with a nice finish in the traffic from the high arcer that was contested in the paint lead back to double digits kind of reminds you some of those baskets he got late against Georgia he took it into his own hands and a turnover George races past Barry headed to the hole pal carals the rebound and now fight for the loose ball and the Buccaneers have it a little bit frenetic here and Coach Nimble wants Charleston Southern to slow it down Kelly on Powell now trying to go up and under no progress he goes up anyway and wont get the roll good defense Duncan po boasy Reeves pulls a trigger on a three thats a quick possession for the yellow jackets and I thought that was a tough shot especially for for a senior you havent put one up defense was right there the jackets could have got a better shot selection on that possession given the time and score and Lance Terrys going to get called for the foul and thats three on Lance Terry foul trouble abound for the yellow jackets but Lance Terry spin cycle Lance terryz three Nate George three and Suare with three uh and Kellys a guy that the Bucks will play through right now the bucks at the free throw line are 17 of 23 coming in this one they were averaging 22 free throw attempts per game good for 12 points so already with 15 minutes to play thats been a story line theyre 17 of 23 from the free throw line and Georgia Tech in foul trouble Kelly going to work on pal now Eric Harris Jr hes run the point tonight along with dalen Barry in the absence of RJ Johnson Kelly faces up five to shoot on pal Suare ready to help instead its a jumper and Pals got the rebound pal nice job holding his ground right there hes pushing gaining gaining an advantage on position and a forc contest shot Luke OBrien scoreless in the first half Lance Terry working to get free and its turned over Harris gives it right back to OBrien fed ahead to Terry there he goes and down it goes jackets forced the turnover get out finally find some easy baskets right there a little bucket in transition we have not seen that in the second half the Bucks have had control another Force turn over George downhill to the rim hes got 10 now the lead is back to 14 Couple live ball turnovers just like that Georgia Tech a little more Breathing Room Nate was picking up full court there hes got to be careful though hes got three fouls hes got to be smart about it three ball wont go Charleston Southern its been a struggle all season long and they are just three of 14 now Luke OBrien gets the roll on the three and coach nley has no choice but to take a time out a 90 Run for the yellow jackets the lead is back to 17 for the first time this half three consecutive stops that was two4 of the lift here in the second half with those fouls Jord Techs key players and again if youre just tuning in by Dongo with four fouls Dorian on witha with four fouls so starting front line for Georgia Tech saddled on the bench a bit of a growth opportunity perhaps for some of the subs for the yellow jackets and a foul here is that on George yes it is thats four on Nate George and were told kaasi Reeves has gone to the locker room so I mean the yellow jackets theyre dropping like flies right now and still committed to the mantoman defense uh Terry will come in so lets get a rund down lets get we had a lot of fouls where we at Wy on the foul situation well weve got Nate George by Dongo and Dorian anucha each with four as Kelly drives towards Suare and theres two then youve got Lance Terry and Ibraham Suare who were on the floor they each have three so thats five different yellow jackets of three or more fouls Jaden mustaf floats it high it wont go and the rebound off the face of Jaylen Gibson Duncan Powell ends up with it and he muscles up for two nice physical finish by Powell timely bucket and we got wasy Reeves in the locker room being attended to by Richard Stewart and Mulla out of this one not dressed so thats five and foul trouble and two appear to be out for the game Gibson on Suare and O nearly had an and one Jaylen Gibson his first year at Charleson Southern hell head to the line thats four on Suare and you if you look at the Georgia Tech lineup what is abson out there you dont have a lot of primary ball handlers youve got Suare youve got pal you got OBrien you got mustaf really Terrys your guy there you see right there the foul and again thats why Georgia Techs playing with this lineup uh foul trouble foul trouble foul trouble and the Bucks unable to convert 55 from the free throw line coming into this one and a chance to cut into the lead and just unable to drop it if 50 not going to do it Wy theyve got to be able to capitalize at the free throw line to have a chance in this one well it might if Jordan te can only have four players on the floor are yes exactly mustaf feed Sor and its swatted out of play by Jaylen Gibson havent talked much about Gibson tonight he spent couple years at NC State then on to Winston Salem State for a season red shirted at UNCC Greensboro last year but hes actually played in this building played here a couple years ago with NC State Gibsons got good length hes playing 16 minutes per game coming into this one shooting 73 from the field hes 19 of 26 coach get him the ball more hes got six six points five boards a game mustaf attacking Gibson he earns the foul I like the aggressive play downhill mustaf had success with that in the first half the ability to score in the paint utilizing his size and hell have a chance to go to the free throw line and jackets get some cushion in this one three for four at the free throw line this year Jaden mustaf a product of overtime Elite thats a private school basketball program based in midtown Atlanta just down the street e along with Darion Sutton to overtime Elite alumni and youre seen more and more of those guys sprinkled throughout both college and professional basketball as mof hits both free throws and Lead is up to 18 so as much as the foul trouble isnt concern Charleston Southern got a long way to go and heres the Zone from Georgia T well its just a matter of time I mean this its a game of numbers youre playing without some of your starters due to foul trouble you got to start and who knocked that down number one Odin Jr yeah Lamar Odin Jr he has struggled for threepoint range this year that was a big part of his game really the last couple of Seasons that stroke just has not been there yeah thats if youre the Georgia Tech coaching staff youre like ghost Zone and then the first possession a guy that shoots on the season six of 33 coming in this one knocks it down like its nothing and you got to just shake your head Hofs jumper is short Wilkins The Freshman driving the floor feeds to Gibson great footwork Jaylen Gibson he skates down the way and thats where if you can play downhill theres no resistance by Georgia Tech no one wants to pick up that four F foul so the Bucks can have success if they play fast and play downhill get the ball to the paint and its imp in that case that Jord Tech do not turn the ball over as unw Che with threepointer barely draws the rim Wilkins Popp and stop three way short and thatll be Georgia Tech Applause basketball Charleston Southern not going away 11 to play Down by 13 Coach s nimley the Big South player of the year hes getting back into that stance that he showcased 10 years ago when he was a fck here so under 11 to play a 13point lead for Georgia Tech mustaf takes it to the rim jayen mustaf just owning that try rooff now with 12 points uh if theres a bright spot for the jackets in this one something you did not expect it was moff to be leading off small scores uh again talented freshman but we just havent seen him hes been injured and good defense by the yellow jackets and youve been forced to see him the night John with jav and McCullum out in protocol and then also Nate George with four fouls its been on the shoulders of mustaf and now dunan Powell ahead of the line Powell get to the line yeah yeah I think backourt play 10 minutes left get the ball in Terry and Georges hands they combined for 21 points seven assists zero turnovers um but both are in foul trouble so but I think they theyre your leaders theyre going to make good decision making and then its really about defensing and playing smart you know whether its the zone or the man having the discipline to not foul keep Charleston Southern off the free throw line and right now Jord Tech appears theyre going to get Taj Kelly off the floor that was his fourth foul Charleston Southerns leading score with 17 he has to head to the bench and it feels like its going to be a decision by KO tonight more than it is going to be going the full 12 rounds you can find me KO on the couch tomorrow after my third helping of turkey and stuffing and some desserts thats just a normal Thursday evening for you John yeah see what kind of Pi is on the table and not that kind of pie I know were on Georgia Texas campus but uh take fre 14 slices in transition Lance Terry to the roof again jackets finally find a way to get out and transition and stretching this one open up 19950 to play The Zone causing problems for the Box 60 Run for the yellow jackets over the last minute zipped inside hey coach D statar upet the shot clock is Applause incorrect looking up there it felt like it been about 15 seconds and all of a sudden the shot clock read 20 were going to have to take a look at this Damons going to use some time to gather with his team was on top of it though yeah the shot clock reset and it wasnt a problem of it did a shot come close to hitting the rim or there was no shot it just all of a sudden reset and our officiating crew is going to take a look and try and figure out where it should be and as Mark Schnur looks at the replay you can see Clarence Armstrong having a friendly conversation there with head coach saw nimley for Charles and Music Souther that might be a preview of some conversations you see around the Thanksgiving table you got you know couple distant relatives havent seen each other in a while dont really get along thats what that looks like to me doesnt it yeah Nim hes Im impressed with Nim hes got the art of communication he tell hes a point guard hes a floor General the eye contact when hes addressing the officials hes smart Savvy even as a coach he was a hell of a player all right so here we go 25 24 and all sudden the game clock and the shot clock are not rolling right now so thats the issue it stopped at 943 and it wasnt just the shot clock it was the clock as a whole and it still hasnt run hasnt run and now it starts moving I that had be at least 6 s seconds conservatively but thats what happened there is both clocks stopped so theyve got a stopwatch out we dont know if it was human error or Tech technological difficulty this might take a moment to sort out as theyve got a work on the timing here and again there it stops 943 and then didnt resume for again I mean Im saying 6 to 7 Seconds conservatively now the other piece of this too John is you cant put Charleston Southern at too much of a disadvantage and there were just 3 seconds in the clock they probably would have behaved differently right yeah for sure and um its just part of the game you got to adjust uh given the situation times going to go back on the clock both teams both coaches having time right now to regroup for Georgia Tech right now youve got a 19point Advantage the message has got to be defense rebound be disciplined take care of the ball we are in control lets not foul lets not giveway points at the free throw line youve got Bongo straddle with four hell be coming back into this one shortly youre in good shape there what you dont want is a run couple threes downhill eight then it gets to 10 and now the Bucks would think they have a chance lets see what we got Wy whats the verdict 922 on the clock and only two seconds on the shot clock thats a tough break for Charleston Southern on the clock malfunction so theyre going to have to draw something out here yeah tough break side out of bounds you got to get something you know either curling towards the basket or screen and go away from the basketball throw over the top and have an ISO situation on the other side of the ball other side of the court and two seconds is is all you got though theres kaasi Reeves back on the bench he was in the locker room and I suppose the referees they dont have a whole lot of discretion so 2 seconds on the clock its batted in the air and a turnover well Georgia Tech smart staying in the zone protecting the basket and there was no nothing nothing open on that play mustaf goes up and jayen mustaf 14 points now leaves all Georgia Tech scores Savvy game by the front hes not shooting threes hes taking what the defense gives he has the advantage and hes been a high percentage guy in the paint today Barry trying to sneak through the Zone kicks out Lamar Odin Juniors three well short and the rebound and last touched I think by on with CA was that the rule I think itll stick with Charleston Southern but one more look at this drive from Jaden Musto John a fourstar Prospect coming out of overtime Elite right there hes had that all day driving downhill Odin Jr has nothing for him moff is tearing them apart first half second half hes been consistent and theyre going to say it was a foul on anua so he is out of the game that is his fifth thats this bad bad luck for the jackets on rqua hes averaging eight rebounds per game game in the last three coming into this one as he has been inserted in the starting lineup Odin Jr at the line hits the front end of a one and one but going back to Jaden mustaf John we spoke to coach statamire this morning he was adamant that Jaden just had not played like the player he knows him to be and I think weve seen some flashes of that tonight and ultimately he gets an extended run tonight because of the injury to Javen McCullen the foul trouble for Nate George and although there was probably a little more heartburn involved at times tonight you could look back on this game and say well that foul trouble actually gave Jaden mustaf a chance to sort of find his legs here at the college level it was only averaging 13 minutes per game coming into this one so finally a game where he gets some flow and as a player you get your confidence you get your just get a better feel out there the more youre out on the floor touching the B how about that feel for dunan Powell was some nice touch well he was a right spot against Cincinnati he had 10 points kept the jackets in that one and there is Kanan Wilkins the another Buccaneers threepoint percentage down in the low 20s entering tonight pal trying to answer halfway down and out Suarez got to be careful swiping over the back 94 ft from the bucket thats with four fouls a Kelly on the floor with four fouls goes on Luke OBrien and thatll put Kelly at the line when we come back Georgia Tech a 19point lead time running out for Charleston sou as they try to pull off the upset first off physicality of these guards playing downhill too much for the bucks to handle Georgia Tech with a comfortable lead right now 19point advantage and 727 a play itll be Taj Kelly at the line he leads all scorers with 17 points tonight but its come out of 15 shots hes four for eight at the free throw line so far tonight from Atlanta at of Grayson High School Music he played against Lance Terry back in high school of course for both those guys that was a long time ago Lance in is sixth year and a Kelly in his fourth season playing in his 100th career game tonight so he hits both free throws lead down to 177 USAF feeds pal too strong by Dongo has played less than a minute in this second half Nathan George has played only six its been the bench for Georgia Tech thats trying to carry the load here and with under seven minutes to play got a sizable lead Jord Tech looking for some deep shot clock possessions smart play by Applause mustaf seven to shoot spin liftoff and a foul coming here its going to go against dalen Barry be one of the few players not in foul trouble yeah just a smart possession by the jackets the ability to burn some clock and then get a downhill action with your hot hand in Music mustaf Now Thompson Kamar coming in for Kanan Wilkins lead up to 19 6 and A2 minutes to play Charleston Southern trying to save every last second here Terry walks up on Barry Georg Tech will sit in that zone Maybe to be an active Zone active hands be there on the catch try not to foul Kelly tries to tap it in he does George Tech contending the ball was on the rim and theyre going to take a look here potential offensive basket interference as GRE Suare not sure if hes frustrated or maybe he took a lick there on the chin I believe he took a lick by Tosh Kelly well get a look at it right here right there that left El bow and I think he got a double time got a second helping not the right way no little extra kick to it so theyre going to rule that not basket they will take a look at it at the under four media timeout so for the moment its a 19point lead but didnt get the perfect look there on that replay it is subject to change by Dongo back on the floor as Suare heads the bench Dongo playing with four fouls Ali and he flushes it Applause under six to Applause play three point Splash Thompson Kamara he is hit two of those tonight he had just one to begin the season and now hes three of four tonight not bad for a guy who is one for nine the first six games lands Terry count the basket hell go to the line yeah when the jackets have needed a bucket theyve put the ball in Terrys hands and hes delivered and again the last time he turned the corner the last possession he turned the corner went middle there he gave the Shifty move but he just go in middle and came back the other direction py play high IQ getting what he wants downhill going towards the basket takes the contact miss the free throw but Terrys got 15 points tonight this guy that played three years at Gardner web took last season off due to injury and so hes really inserted himself on the offensive side of the ball here again he led all scores against Georgia in the lost to Georgia for the jackets he had 20 points all in the second half and hes building off that momentum by Dongo some nice touch charers and Southern though John theyve now hit seven of 23 pointers that was not the expectation coming in that its going to be something positive they can build on the shot starting to fall a little bit CU they were at 26 from Beyond The Arc entering plate tonight in without RJ Johnson out due to injury and he led all threepoint Shooters with 15 on the season he was shooting 44 so some other guys stepping up kmer carmera my goodness hes now four of five transfer from Frank Phillips Jr College in north Texas about coming out of Applause nowhere and Jaden mustaf just continuing to attack and Tech gets a little help that Applause time under four minutes to play Georgia Tech ahead by 18 Kelly good move but not enough touch and Thompson Kamar has hardly missed at all pump fake if that had gone in he hed really be feeling it instead Here Comes Georgia Tech in control here and Coach Damon stanmire wants a timeout just over 3 and 12 minutes to play the yellow jackets ahead 8163 it can smell a 500 Rec for the sweet potato pie already talked about your love for sweet potato pie well seriously what what is your favorite Thanksgiving dish you know what I I like when everyone you know Ive got kids so you know inlaws are in the kids I like at the end of the day Im watching some football its about 900 at night and the leftovers like a turkey

Thanksgiving are you going to watch Packers dolphins or you going to throw on Old Tom Brady highlights Im a Pats fan its been its been a while were going to rebuild in New England yeah not quite like being a Falcons fan huh well leave that alone dalen Barry leaves it short and Nate George comes out with it and he lays it in absorbing the contact that time and Nate George in double figures again one a four yellow jackets with 12 or more points tonight and a blocking foul on mustaf and thatll put Reese Jones at the free throw line I might have had that call the other way Im just uh well youre a contrarian Im biased though must stuff earned it he had a great game freshman I thought his feet were there they were Applause set instead Jones sits the first free throw Rees Jones out of Fort Washington in Maryland Flint Hill High School you know a little something about Flint Hill huh great Dennis Scott numbering the Rapters we we enjoyed that on the night of the Georgia game Dennis Scott fln Hills I got to imagine best player ever coming out of there played for the legendary Steve better and number four went to the rafters in inside uh The cish Pavilion last week meanwhile number 11 on the floor by Dango hes now a perfect 8 for eight tonight 17 points and six boards made the most of his time when he was out there but the foul trouble really hurt sat most of the second half of this one that three way short from Thompson Kamar B get another rebound he puts up a double double play in just 18 minutes thatll be something under two to play jayen mustaf George Tech and a move to three and three Nate George thats that floater working Tech will be wrapping up this seven game season opening home stand on Saturday afternoon at 100 against Central Arkansas un pal going to get called for the foul there and then after that game against Central Arkansas Jordan Tech will hit the road first the SEC ACC challenge at Oklahoma then at North Carolina on December 7th that game against Northwestern is a neutral site game itll be played in Milwaukee and Jordan Tech will return home to face UNBC the Terriers and then the first ACC home game after that will be Duke on a Saturday afternoon in mamsh Duke took a tough one last night against Kansas but what a high level game I mean you look at Duke Carolina theyre back yep in fact theyre the only two teams in the ACC currently in the top 25 Duke at 11 and North Carolina at 12 but we were talking earlier who who do you kind of like us outside of those two programs in the ACC yeah it itll be fun to see how that shakes out um I like pit I think coach cable has got a good core returning I I like their style of play um you know Louisville uh trying to trying to rebuild there as well they had a huge win last night um could that be signs of whats to come out of Louisville this season we dont know yeah did you see what they did today as you get a look here foul is going to go against Lamar or beg your pardon yes Lamar Odin Jr but Louisville today check out this score John and Wake Forest competitive Clemson always be in the mix 8961 Louisville over Indiana today Indiana Coach Mike Woodsons done a great job there theyre ranked 12th in the country so thats a huge win for Louisville Dongo misses the free throw look at Charleston Southerns upcoming schedule theyre not done with ACC opponents yet theyve got the Miami Hurricanes on Saturday afternoon at 200 Satur Im wondering if they go right from Atlanta and spend an extra day or two in Miami thats thats what Id be doing around the holiday final minute Music Dongo Cuts loose a three and itll be Buccaneer Music basketball well I want to know what Miami fans are going to be there because you got a 200 home game but the football team for Miami you got a big game against Syracuse thats at 330 crowd might thin out there in the second half Georgia Tech a couple weeks back that was a huge win for Brent key in his football program uh taking out the number five then ranked KES at home and then Coach key on a Thursday night game on ESPN they pulled off the miracle if everyone thought it was over and they found a way to get it done and so theyll go uh to Athens cross town rival play the Bulldogs never an easy one 730 pm to meets leather oh cross state rival youre right Georgia technically not in Atlanta therell be some debate about that youll hear occasionally make sure we got we got it stra think you got we got to make sure we got the got the fact straight its that time of year folks 8767 Georgia Tech going to get back to 500 overall Duncan Pals going to go to the free throw line and you know I thought coach statam you know offered some cander after the loss to Cincinnati you know hes pretty blunt you know this is not where I thought we were going to be at this point in the season two and three and a lopsided loss at home to Cincinnati but he was pretty matter of fact about he said you know really only one thing for us to do thats get back to work and he kind of described his whole career in basketball has been based on two things playing hard and being tough and I think we saw some of that tonight from Georgia Tech theres a lot of wisdom there and I I think I hope that this yellow jacket team just Embraces the wisdom that he brings to the table the the great players hes been around the coaches the mentors heve had uh even you know was working with the Boston Celtics uh prior to coming over to the tech so a wealth of knowledge and certainly uh hes done a nice job on the recruiting Trails here up in the talent level and Nate George drills a three thatll give him 17 tonight you saw Taj Kelly fouled out with 20 that ought to be enough to lead all scores land Terry the rebound the yellow jackets can dribble it out and after a couple of tough losses here at home the yellow jackets bounce back with a much needed 9167 win over Charleston Southern and John tonight a big step for Georgia Tech moving in the right direction a Get Right game 91 points again coming off a 58 Point outing in the loss to Cincinnati so feel good going into tomorrow have a good meal enjoy the family and friend time thats what its all about and both teams will be back in action on the weekend thats going to do it
