the opponent well you just saw number one Zurich Phelps whos their leading scorer he is the leader of this team look this team beat West Virginia earlier this year this team lost two Heartbreakers to Arizona State by two and Dayton by two they just need to learn how to finish here we go DOD SMU with the basketball in their alternate black uniforms in Tallahassee Florida here at the Tucker Center number one is zorich f who last year was sixth in the American in scoring helps to set up a up inside and the Mustangs are off and Applause running warley green Watkins Deonte green and Baba Miller who has continued to work so hard this year on his shooting out at 500 today only one on the floor at that point still working on a shooting coming off a horrible game shooting free throws here goes Baba Miller driving to the bucket and hes got the seminal on the board yeah Boba Miller is one of those big guys that can put the ball on the floor and attack and now were seeing Florida State full CT pressure DJ Edwards at the point weve talked about belp Chuck Harris Samuel Williamson who began his college basketball career at Louisville and then Keon Ambrose Hilton another one of the transfers in the starting lineup he is an Alabama transfer and there is phelp 65 and Junior from Midland Texas out of Duncanville High School he is seventh in the conference this year in scoring at 16 wanted they need more than just scoring though Mark out of zich bels tonight well the growth and Leadership and maturity of Zurich Phelps shined through at West Virginia when he pulled the team together at halftime and challenged them in mature in the right way and this team responded hes the true leader of this team number one in black Zur Phelps keep an eye on him Chuck Harris the former Butler Bulldog buries the three yeah Harris is just a Hooper you really knows how to Applause play interesting Jaylen warley with the basketball number one in white has yet to attempt a threepoint shot this year unheard of in modern basketball foul on the drive thatll send jir Watkins to the line but warley coach just has determined Im not good at shooting three balls this year and so Im not going to shoot them now this is a guy who has shot plenty of them his first two years at a 31 clip but I find it so interesting and admirable that he has taken it upon himself to say you know what Im not making a high enough percentage of him Im going to do other things well you know one thing that Leonard Hamiltons team have have always done under his mentorship is identifying parts and pieces where they fit and how to win now in the last couple years hes struggled because he hasnt had the depth and hes had turnover of roster with the with the new rules of transferring and things like that but this roster intrigues me and it has those same parts and pieces and so warley brings tremendous on ball defense he can pressure the ball he can deflect the dribbler and so hes deferring his offensive game to bring greater defense in another part and piece to the puzzle that is Leonard Hamiltons basketball team couple of free throws made by jir Watkins makes it Applause 54 Harris uses the Music screen now with the switch looking to go to work bottom of your screen watch warley and Phelps thats one versus one Ry all over Phelps not getting him the ball Williamson traveling violations fsus defense is a staple and Doug Jaylen warley was the reason why Rob leirs offense shut down he completely took CK felt out of that possession by full denial of the basketball coach Hamilton says of Jaylen War warley quote hes got a lot of Philly in him he has done a great job defensively and jayen growing up has Vivid memories of the Finley Recreation Center playing ball there just like WIIL Chamberlain did just like Kobe Bryant did just like his dad and his uncles did he is Philly through and through on the opposite side watching the body of the screen number 22 Darren Green a Marksman one of the great Shooters in the country hes not touched it yet Worley Off the Mark Deontay green pulls it back out consecutive shots that did not hit the rim so a shot clock violation gave the ball back to Music SMU and theres coach Hamilton in his 22nd year 1971 graduate of UT Martin and he has told me in the past that he was planning to use the GI Bill to become the first in his family to attend college but then instead of joining the Army he was given an opportunity at Gaston College in his hometown of Gastonia which fostered his needs and his desire to grow led him to become the first black athlete couple of years later at UT Martin he is the first of many in many different walks of life and specifically in college basketball and Leonard was also the first black basketball coach in the SEC under Joe B Hall was one of those great Kentucky teams back in the early mid 7s yeah first black teack coach in the big eights at the at Oklahoma State and on and on and on what a marvelous run he has had at FSU warley crossport with three to shoot off the bounce Watkins and another shot clock violation that will make Rob laner very very happy the seconde head coach at SMU has built this team on defense and they have been rebounding fighting for loose balls and now we will all get our first look at former Georgetown Hoya Primo Spears the Junior from Hartford Connecticut who is now eligible and inserted into the lineup by coach Hamilton about 3 and 12 minutes in remember how stifling this SMU defense has been in the first three and a half minutes of this game why cuz nobody at Forida State could penetrate past the defender Primo Spears has that ability well see if the game changes here Bob it up two points after breaking the pressure SMU on top by Applause five now will Primo Spears will he let the game come to him as Darren Green goes up the Applause three Del keeps the dribble and now theyll reset with BJ Edwards the sophomore from Knoxville Tennessee at the point got mismatch inside on the switch Spears up with the big Spears comes around great and here comes Spears l it to the rim bad pass trying to find Jaylen Applause gainy and one bad pass but gets another here come the noes Florida State back within three green with the layup he can heat it Applause Music Applause up Applause now Doug Florida State likes to switch a lot of screens youll see them switch up that does create some Applause Music mismatches first time out when we come back well tell you what you need to know about the newest null Amir Primo Spears Music in 20 years the Mustangs with the early threepoint lead over the seols in Tallahassee and uh a shot in the arm for FSU with the activation of Primo Spears Amir Spears IV he uh from the time he was three was getting up early morning to have workouts with his dad Amir III their best friends and he gets his nickname Primo from his dad his dad was named premere then it was pre then down to Primo and so its big primo and little primo and little Primo brings an awful lot third stop couple of years at Duane then last year 16 points per game at Georgetown and now Mark he is a Florida State 70 you know Im always curious about what teammates say about another teammate so reached out to Darren Green Jr and asked him what does primo Spears bring to this lineup he talked about the fact that Primo comes to practice every day with his lunch pales work roots and and practices like hes going to play tonight this kid had to wait and wait and wait High basketball IQ but a real voice on the bench even though he wasnt playing Green told me that sometimes he gets lost he doesnt pick his spot the right way and that Primo would watch him and Coach him on how to get open move without the ball the last thing the Primo brings to this team he knows every player on the team where they want the ball in every situation hes a cerebral point guard that brings a lot to this Florida State basketball team good ball movement to get a clean three just missed by Chandler Jackson NOS keep it and a foul is called between the circles playing his hes playing his first game since the Big E tournament last March March 8th Georgetown lost to Villanova and since that time number 23 has been on Ice in terms of game this is like a midseason trade if you will this is a shot in the arm for Florida State look were all familiar with what happened with Florida football when the quarterback went down and probably denied them a shot at the National Championship now how will the NCA selection committee determine how these teams react when they add players to their roster like Primo Spears will it be a plus for them be interesting to see in March Spears cant get the Roll But tipped in by Deontay Music green green is just so long and has a good nose for the ball around the rim meanwhile at this end SMU has turned the ball over four times and they made their first four shots and theres another turnover how did you know that was going to be their fifth turnover thats a walk theyve got a a trend going just a good Gap so we talked about can Primo Spears can he get by somebody into the paint thats where SMU was so effective early in this game now he doesnt finish right there but we see the ability to get to the rim and that makes Defenders collapse and react thats good for Florida State Chuck Harriss pass makes its way out to the Applause perimeter looks like looks like theyre passing a hot potato thats not good no Music Dy Jackson hands it off spear setting up for a good look but Off the Mark by Taylor Applause Music Applause Music Bowen for moral victory for SMU earlier in this game is just not turning it Applause Music over bur to fade away got it blocked but Deontay green is going to be whistled for the foul well to show you how excited Primo Spears was to get on the floor in game action tonight with his seven olds teammates he was in the building long before everybody else thats 1226 today getting up shots just getting up shots its what he has done ever since he was a little kid in Hartford Connecticut and that continues in Tallahassee Florida now now that hes back on the floor wearing a game uniform for the first time in months and Doug thats a full 6 hours and 26 minutes before you get on the floor as a threeyearold hes sleeping in today now Spears will take a seat after getting about a thre minute run now Im guessing he can go over to the bench and catch his breath and uh feel good about things a little difference between practice being able to handle the rigors of the game versus game speed and thats just called a little baptism get him in the game get his feet on the ground get him feeling comfortable and then give him another rotation later on and heres a sense Mark of what he can bring to this Florida State team he went for 37 in a game last year against Xavier so when hes cooking look out yeah he averaged 16 points over five assists couple steals a game a little bit over one steal a game for Georgetown Music rley directing traffic from the wing shot clock down under Applause five the step back three little too strong back tap and the Mustangs keep it put 20 back on the shot Applause clock a great defense on F hes getting nothing done on the offensive end number one at the top of your screen emry lanir dumps it off but protection of the rim Again by Music Applause FSU good read block shot with nothing to show for it though Music Hudson at the other end trying to cash in instead kicks it out the three ball around around and out great pass good shot nothing to show fors that last rebound pulled down by jayen gy so good to see him back implying his fourth game as a seol after a devastating knee injury cost him last year after transferring in from Brown he continues to work himself into game shape going to be a big part of the SE old as they turn the calendar with ACC play coming just a couple of weeks away 108 Music SMU we pick up the phone hosting Queens University and then Marcus Burton and Notre Dame host the marest red foxes a good weekend of Hoops catch it here on EC Network and the ESPN app with Mark Adams Im Doug Sherman Clemson by the way fell from the ranks of the unbeaten this after afternoon in Memphis great game 7977 PJ hall went for 21 points had a chance Mark to tie the game with a threepoint shot with 6 seconds to go couldnt get it to go now losing to Memphis is not necessarily a bad thing especially in Memphis but for Clemson they are off to a tremendous start to the year yeah undefeated going into this game you mentioned PJ Hall who I absolutely love Im going go a really old school Philadelphia 76ers Steve mix type player big strong body that just gives it up to score to rebound to set screens I love that kid and Brad Brown L one of the more underrated coaches in the country followed his career at wght state did a great job there and now Clemson in the national rankings under Brad Brown hell its a really fun team to watch with a lot of dynamic Applause Talent once again shot clocking issue for Florida State and once again Im not sure they beat it I dont think it is a shot clock violation you know Doug back to that that Clemson Ive got Clemson Queens coming up as we take a look here on the spin move watching the background one zero looks like thats a shot clock violation to me and we also should mention that Queen University out of Charlotte North Carolina that one of their alums is Emily Scofield our producers wife we got to make sure we get that into nice yeah now the big question is will she be tuned in watch Alma moer thats what weve got to make sure is going on this Friday night I have a connection with our producer and I believe I can make that request all right basket so indeed they have disallowed the basket for a shot clock violation and out of that Florida state will go into some full court pressure and when youve got Baba Miller at 611 204 at the head of that press thats pretty effective Applause well SMU has just been Elite defensively offensively they have struggled no question turned it over a lot we look at the drive in the basket right there no good but SMU has been Elite defensively this year theyve improved so much from one year ago first in the American field goal percentage defense of course Houston not there anymore that helps everybody else in the league right now but Memphis also has been a really good defensive team points allowed this team is just downright Applause stingy at the line J head coach I was saying rob laner told us earlier today Mark that uh jayen Smith who is the Ultimate Team guy he relinquished the starting role to BJ Edwards and you followed up with a question what do you mean by relinquish and I thought his answer was fascinating yeah he he sat down with Jaylen Smith and basic said look if you dont feel comfortable with this we wont do it and Jaylen Smith said no Id rather come off the bench thats the best thing for this team you talk about a selfless individual and Jaylen Smith in a culture of weed within that SMU locker room that is an impressive young man and impressive culture led by Rob lir off the bounce Deontay Greens got two more the sophomore from Asheville North Carolina draws the Noles to within one Doug Ive never heard a coach say if youre not comfortable with it we wont do it Ive never heard that before in any conversation but thats the type of culture that Rin near wants he wants buying from his players he wants to get input from his players and I think its really refreshing and fun fou on the rebound and it caught both of our attention when coach laner used that word relinquish because again that implies that he gave it up as the player actively offered for the betterman of the team to give up his spot pass Spears back Music in out there with gy Miller and Watkins and it looks like Darren Green as well the five out there for the no Doug its amazing what we learned from coach lanir today I wont say anything else but lets just say weve got some really interesting stuff to talk about coming out this next break yeah no question hes got his opportunity as a third heres at Sienna and then back to uh being one of the top assistants in the country under Billy Donovan in Florida then he was at Texas and again at Tennessee under rck Barn then he got a head coaching job in the sun Bel conference at Georgia state which he parlayed into this opportunity at SMU and and again this program is on the rise moving to the Atlantic Coast Conference next year and it was very well documented the amount of money back in September that the boosters of SMU raised to help build football and basketball and all the all the other parts of the athletic department to the level of a power conference school and uh the ceiling is very high at Moody Coliseum as far as Im concerned coach oh its a tremendous facility theres theres great history there of success with many many sports across SMU It is Well funded and a president of the United States at court side of George W bush its pretty fun to go see a game of it is its a good addition as far as Im concerned to the ACC Bel looking to go oneonone draws to contact puts up an airball doesnt get the whistle and now Teddy Valentine one of our officials indeed does call a foul Zer Phelps is really trying to get his offensive game going forcing that shot right there and they need him to get the flo but he needs to move harder without the basketball he needs better screens to come off of to get the basketball right now theyre denying him the ball everywhere that foul went on Baba Miller in pursuit of the uh rebound not on the shot Samuel Williamsons attempted pass knocked out of bounds with 14 on the shot clock and the noes defense flexing its muscles as you see they forced eight consecutive misses by SMU yeah Florida State always known for being long and Taylor bu right there at 610 really long Wings Applause spin belt from the Music elbow hes on the floor others on the floor and the whistle comes for a held ball with a possession arrow belonging to Florida Applause State well Leonard Hamiltons got a team that that plays with a sense of urgency and they really Challenge and block shots aggressively I love the big guy getting on the floor right there just tremendous hustle You Got To Know Your Role Taylor ban now has challenged a shot and now gotten on the floor for a loose ball coming off the bench those are the kind of guys you win with 610 freshman from Jericho Vermont ESPN 100 guy last year number 82 recruit in the country landed by coach Hamilton and his staff Spears no also found an interesting Mark what you were referencing Chandler Jackson had a quote saying were more connected this season were more together talking about the chemistry of this years nlls team as opposed to the one that last year went 9 and 23 well theyve gone through a couple of losses here recently and now they need to get back on the winning track tonight get mentally healthy real fast and we mentioned where they get Spears back they still are without Cam Corin and Cameron Fletcher due to injury so they are not whole by any means theres the beautiful stroke of Darren Green Jr and one of the great Shooters in the country of active players hes in the top 10 of made threes gains back on the floor with Miller having picked up his second foul Florida state with a two point lead SMU with the basketball 822 to go in the half Another Empty trip for the Mustang Spears tough shot forced it thats the thing I was concerned about if he would just force it he he tonight so far bouls going to go against Taylor B Music Bowen I mentioned how hes from Jericho Vermont but that is not where he was born actually his parents fled War torn Sudan for Egypt where he was born in a refugee camp wound up coming to the United States and at a very young age was adopted by a family in Vermont and so he grew up downhill skiing and ice skating before finding the love of basketball Id like to see that by the way Id like to see him down here steam at 6 10 in and Ill be doing the Florida State game coming up their very next game against North Florida and you can bet Doug there will be a picture of the big fell schem got to get Applause that Zurich Phelps missed the first and gets the second hes been held relatively in check so far coming in averaging 16 points per game Music Applause Applause well just no way to penetrate that defense SMU really moves their feet well an illegal screen against Florida State well whos Rob Ferguson and why is he so important to SMU basketball now and going forward well answer when we come back Music its back at Tallahasse Florida SMU trailing Florida State by a point born Rob Ferguson in New York City in 1968 to teenager Shauna Foster who herself was an illegal alien from Halifax Nova Scotia raised in Buffalo Rob didnt know his father until High School when uh they did Foster a good relationship Emory lanir died in 1987 when Rob was at St Bonaventure he then took his fathers last name and subsequently named his first born Emery now Rob and his mom Shauna remain close shell actually be traveling from Canada to Texas next week to spend Christmas with her grandkids you know DG Rob and his father reconnected and they broke that dysfunctional cycle Leonard Hamilton also played a role in Robins development as a coach with some fatherly advice early in his coaching career both ler and Leonard Hamilton were at the same junior college practice on a recruiting trip Hamilton noticed the young coach and engaged lanir by asking him if you want to be a head coach someday lanir indicated yeah absolutely Hamilton mentored him suggesting he learn to do everything not just be a recruiter learn to schedule learn to plan practice learn on court coaching skill development laner has done just that now hes the head coach at SMU Leonard Hamilton is like The Godfather lot of people understand this that hes developed young coaches moving forward in their career and finding their like Andy Enfield at USC tremendous influence on infield Bill self of Kansas yeah that bill self National Championship coach and Dennis Gates now at Missouri this guy is the Godfather of K basketball coaching he influenced lir and dozens and dozens and dozens of young coaches throughout his career yeah and that random get together where the two of them first talked some 30 years ago was when coach lanir was a young assistant he wasnt sure whether he was at St Bonaventure or at ruter but either way coach Hamilton an established division one head coach sought him out to just share a few thoughts and they have remained friends ever since and and that relationship is why these two teams are playing here tonight I mean this was a twoyear contract for a home and Home Series first one in Tallahassee next year supposed to be back in Dallas but now that the Mustangs are going to be part of the ACC that return game isnt coming and oh by the way there is Rob liners son Emory who again he named for his father who when Rob grew up he didnt have a relationship with so uh you talk about breaking that dysfunctional cycle Ive known Rob for over 20 years and Ive always been really really impressed at where he has come from where he is now and the type of family man that he has been Music SMU with the Music basketball long rebound comes back Applause out tough shot and again I think gainy may have gotten a piece this seols defense and rebounding is Relentless yeah their length is really bothering SMU but on the opposite side the same thing is happening this is a defensive struggle these are two Elite defenses theyre just giving each other roundhouses every possession well theyre going to have to repaint the rims at halftime at this end of the floor SMU has missed its last 12 shots and has not scored a field goal in about 9 minutes now youre starting to see some frustration too here Doug for example Darren Green JR could knock down three ball was about 25 ft out he just knew he was open and shot it so both Rin now and Leonard Hamilton they need more motion they need more ball movement they need to be able to get Defenders closing out and beat them on the close outs right now theres a lot of force shots going on a little bit too much dribbling and trying to make things happen oneonone both these coaches going to have to re their teams in offensively and play together dont you see the frustration right there from Z phelp the leading score foru Phelps has only three points on one of six shooting he comes in averaging over 16 per game SMU made its first four shots of this ball game and since that time they have missed 17 of of Music 19 really for the first time in a long time SMU caught not being able to defend the dribbler and actually reached out and grab theyve been so good on the ball defense Music tonight warley from the Baseline great Applause Music cut the Mustang desperate for a bucket cant get it on the threepoint drive by emry Applause lanir got a good look out of transition but Josh nickelberry shot rims out here comes SMU the other way and another FSU block shot those field goal percenter just keep going down I seen better shooting percentages than hockey games mean look at the defense look at the length Florida State just brings athlete after athlete after athlete and just goes up and gets it Josh nickelberry right there the Atlantic 10 Conference Sixth Man of the Year last season at Lal has come to play as final year of college eligibility at Florida State hes my favorite seminal too by the way Doug well explain that later but hes my favorite seminar yeah well youre wrong in that cuz Ive got my own favorite but well explain I know you do I know Applause you here goes nickelberry hits the deck and was fouled now nickelberry you might remember played a couple of years at Louisville but only got into 24 games total and uh wound up going on to L the last two years with the Explorers hes able to get more minutes and really evolved his game he was a big recruit coming out of bville North Carolina back in the day and from a very athletic family as you might expect his father was a star an AllAmerican linebacker back at Northern Illinois University back in the day he once had a scoop and score against the Arkansas Razer backs thats got to be pretty cool quiting all those Pig suoy chance in fville what did they win uh I would guess no but I dont know for sure gu Northern Illinois has been good six to shoot tough shot created nicely though by Chandler Jackson the sophomore from Memphis Tennessee is on the board and its back to a onepoint game Chandler Jackson one of those guys that can assist at almost a three to1 assisted turnover ratio that time finally giv F FSU some Applause offense one and done rebound snared by Applause Music gainy good ball movement Jackson off the front Applause Music iron and then the Mustangs finally score to put it back to a threepoint game on the layup by BJ Edwards well this is exactly what SMU wants hang around keep the lead keep it physical turn it into a a a defensive mosh pit and thats exactly what the Mustangs are doing right now lastu was picked number seven in the preseason American Athletic Conference poll and Im not sure where you would see them slotting in Mark as that ball is knocked out of bounds but they have shown signs that they might be better than that FAU clear number one in the American Memphis not far behind but SMU if it plays this kind of defense is going to be in a lot of ball games theyre making it tough on the Seals All Night Patrick Jak for safe as we mentioned going to break the American Athletic Conference is uh top heavy I mean FAU went to the final four last year theyre the preseason favorite coming in Memphis has showed extremely well this year and you go down to number seven uh in the preseason poll was SMU what do you think about the Mustangs as they uh have their finale season in the American and and where Rob Lans team might stack up well Rob laner in his second year this is a more stable program now hes been able to recruit to his way of coaching theyve had returning players like Zurich Phelps have been really good offensively but as you mentioned they face as together of a team as there is in the country in Dusty Mays fa out those guys play together Penny Hy Bo told me that they are the most together team that hes ever coached against and that includes the NBA by the way Memphis today they knock off number 13 and undefeated going into today Clemson heck of a win for Memphis it was their first home game in over 29 days theyve gone on the road wanted VCU they wanted Texas AM and now they win against Clemson and Ron Hunter and Tain with Jaylen Forbes and Kevin cross that is a really talented basketball team thats been through the wars of the American they havent quite gotten to the summit yet of the American but thats a really good team as well after that then its a flip of coin theres a lot of good teams not great teams I think SMU is one of those top four or five teams from what Ive seen tonight and you mentioned FAU ranked 15th they were in Springfield Massachusetts today and beat by coincidence Rob laners alma mater St Bonaventure 6454 so the owls are nine and two and theyve got a couple of guards that could wind up in the NBA theyve got Vladimir golden in the middle if you remember him the big guy from the final four run last year who is really really good so uh they are the team to be uh and SMU will start concentrating next year on being a member of the ACC but for now they are all American Athletic Conference theres pal Stanford also coming into the Applause ACC heres Chuck Harris step back three nothing but Music net with SMU I just like their Poise especially defensively now off defensively its been a train record times for both these teams but lets credit how athletic both these teams are how hard theyve play defensively well in an effort to get some shooting into the game Leonard Hamilton inserted Tom house you saw him missed the three at one end and that got the Mustangs the Pony Express out and running SMU has an eightpoint lead how do you beat a stingy defense you run you push the ball you coverage begins at noon Eastern and before that tomorrow morning they are going to unveil a statue of the great Muffet McGraw and shes going to be the first female in Fighting Irish Athletics history to have a statue joining get this list Mark n era Dan Devine Lou Holtz Frank Ley moose krower those are statues around the football stadium next door but now the basketball arena will have Muffet McGraw Standing Tall by one of the entryways beginning tomorrow and forever going forward that is really cool obviously welllearned a tremendous basketball coach motivator of women and also a person who was never afraid to share her opinion on anything that could help women the womens game and overall our country so I I just think its a its a tremendous honor to a welldeserving coach yeah 33 years as head coach and Dame nine final fours couple of national championships thatll be part of our coverage here on acc Network tomorrow coverage begins at noon Florida state gets a couple of points on the board Mak it a sixpoint game under a minute and a half remaining here in the first well both teams are starting to take the lid off now theyre actually getting some points through the Music basket Doug I would double down in two errors get out and run like this and go to the offensive glass manufacture points Darren Green Jr all by himself Well normally thats Applause money contested shot goes for the Mustangs back to an eightpoint lead thanks to Zurich Phelps this eightpoint lead feels like its 20 in this game Applause Music Rob theres defense has been suffocating three Spears pass mishandled by bull Bowen five to shoot bull Bowen may have taken an extra step we get a whistle and a foul I guess indeed it is a person foul against SMU I definitely saw a walk right there thats three steps line number Taylor definitely some contact but looked like bull Bowen actually ran into him more than anything Music else Music ACC PM with Mark Packer and Taylor tanen bom is weekdays in 4 Eastern from Marks Charlotte studio in his basement they will talk the latest from around the conference right here on acc Network and the ESPN act you are you in your basement right now Doug Im just curious I am not I am not are you uh Im in the enthusiasms basketball cabin out we dont we dont go to the basement here we go to the enthusiam boops cabin out in my backyard I cant believe weve taken almost an hour to get enthusi atams into our broadcast final 6 seconds of the Music half off the front iron and a foul on the rebound with under a second to go fou so so Doug I have to brag you I have the greatest backdrop in the history of PN live from home Ive got the Christmas tree behind me I got my book coach thegeek right over me I got a net from a championship from you know about decades ago when I was a lot younger than I am now so I take a lot of pride in the fact that I dont do my games from a basement I decorate the inclus Hoops tapping just for the holidays and I got my candy striped my candy cane striped tie as well when I came fested I noticed your green tie and I think its great I love your green tie but I brought my a game my Christmas a game tonight for ESPN so youre giving me what a B minus no no Im giving you a B CU youre red St Im giving you a B cuz youre red well it is the holiday season but uh the Scrooge was around Tallahassee in the first half not allowing many baskets as points the only person who has really scored the ball Chuck Harris leads everybody with nine points long rebound into the corner the Mustangs extend the possession back out to Samuel Williamson still looking for his first points nice pass on the back Music door Williamson again looking to set up a teammate it goes out of bound back to Florida State but the good news is SMU did get an offensive rebound I think they should just stuck right back up Music there Jaylen warley at the point the Junior from Philadelphia averaging six points three and a half assists per game really credit the SMU defense is the best shooter one of the great Shooters in the country number 22 in white Darren Green Jr there he gets a shot right here thats the first time hes been able to catch the ball and actually make a play since the first half well his reputation always precedes him as an excellent threepoint shooter Mark we got a timeout called by SMU so if youre defending him even if hes not made a three tonight youve got to go out and chase him yeah and and youve got to make sure he doesnt catch the basketball because he has added layers to his game I call games for him when he was at UCF and hes obviously a really good shooter and right now Leonard Hamilton trying to bring this Florida State team Applause back Leonard Hamilton was a candidate last year for the Nay Smith Hall of Fame now he didnt make it this years nominees will be announced this coming Thursday and as coach Hamilton told me last year if he ever were to make it to Springfield quote Id consider it the gravy on the home fries what a marvelous career that he has had he has seen it all done it all even had a oneyear run as the head coach in the NBA of the Washington Wizards although it didnt go all that well hes come back to college and at one point he was the winningest coach in both Miami Hurricanes and Florida and heres the number Miami heres the number that we dont talk about enough 97 of the players who have completed their eligibility under coach Hamilton have graduated 97 smus lead is back to Music seven Chuck Harris the first into double figures on the turnaround smus figured it out Doug theyre starting to move the ball better we saw it late in the first half theyve made the adjustment they they put more pressure on the FSU defense by swinging the ball side to side and finding open Shooters good penetration by jir Watkins hes got his first field goal of the night now Florida State at halftime definitely talked about more penetration more active Dribble To The Rim Edwards off the ball screen has a mismatch lost it tried to go for half behind his back and here comes Florida State on the Run pulling up green off the front of the iron back the other way comes SMU good ball movement find the open man in the corner got a good look but Harris missed it on the putb its now 2922 SMU so Doug what did we talk about adjustments more 94 ft more double down on the offensive glass and thats exactly what s you did on that possession green feeds the post here com comes the double team Baba Miller back into the corner under 10 to shoot that should have been an easy shot two foot jump stop on the left hand side just power to the rim instead of Al Up and Under Phelps will head to the free throw line first foul on warley look how this is an easy basket stay on the left hand side and finish instead go Dipsy do underneath and off the rim no keep the game Music simple well in talking about Coach Hamilton he got his first opportunity to be a coach in college basketball long long time ago and uh Mark you were doing a little bit of research that was 19 1971 at Austin PE State University and we could a guy by the name of fly Williams by the way the number one movie in George C Scott was the actor of the year patent in 1971 the number one song was Joy to the World by Three Dog Night everybody remembers that one and S SMU head coach Ral theer was 3 years old when Leonard Hamilton was the assistant coach at Austin P when they went to the NCA tournament with fly Williams the famous chant was the fly is open lets go P fly open lets go PE flies open lets go PE and it was Leonard Hamilton as that young college assistant who went into Brooklyn and got Jimmy Fly Williams to come to Austin P and they went to the Sweet 16 I mean it really was remarkable yeah and and Blake Kelly allowed Leonard Hamilton to do all the things to be a head coach not just be a recruiter but to plan practice to schedule to do all the things that a head coach need to do to be successful cuz honestly there were a lot of coaches if we take it hard in the rim right there and theres the foul a lot of coaches back in the 70s and 80s that were AfricanAmerican coaches were seen as recruiters and didnt get the opportunities to become fullfledged coaches as far as scheduling go as far as on as far as strategies go and things like that the game has certainly changed and moved in the right direction and thats where Leonard Hamilton has been such a great voice in this game helping young coaches to understand how you develop as a head coach and so many hes mentored along the way and you know you talk about uh the racial environment that he came up in not only growing up in the segregated South in Gastonia North Carolina but when he was an assistant at Austin P they had done so well they made it like I said to the swet 16 the head coaching job came open and the University president said to Leonard that he was not strong enough as a leader to promote a black man to that position at that time and Coach Hamilton said it cut my guts out so he left BAS baset took a sales job at Dow Chemical until a faithful phone call from Joe beh Hall at Kentucky who did have the nerve to be able to bring on a black man in that environment and establish the groundwork that youre talking about and hes a Hall of Fame coach period yep smus lead balloons to 12 off another Florida State Applause Music Applause turnover Primos Spar still looking for his first basket as a seol he had a tough start to his FSU career 0 for six in that first half maybe hell find his rhythm here in the second Watkins after his own Miss and the whistle goes against the Mustangs SMU all night long steel leads to easy offense thats why the Stags are in the lead right now Music will flow offensively number one in black there has been the Catalyst just lately hes got their last five points as part of a 70 run and now SMU with its largest lead of the night over Florida State its 3422 with Mark Adams Im Doug Sherman and the Mustangs well up 12 feels like 22 at this point with the way offense has been tough to come by tonight Mark so in SMU theyve been a hard luck team look they have four losses against Texas AM Wisconsin lost by two to Dayton really good team out of the 810 and lost by two at Arizona State this is a team that could very well be 82 right now sitting at 6 and4 me rir has this team on the right trajectory and based on his track record of recruiting you got to figure the talent is going to continue to come to Dallas theyve got as we talked about in the first half facilities theyve got a a magnificent University and the job that he did as a head coach at Georgia State most recently earlier 20 years ago getting Talent as a head coach at Sienna he acquired a ton of talent including Jack mclinton who wound up transferring to Miami and got drafted and then as an assistant coach for Rick Barnes and for uh Dave L at Virginia and then uh for Billy Donovan at Florida he has shown he can connect with people and bring in players so youre right it just feels like the trajectory is up last year was tough in his first season they didnt win nearly as many games as they would have liked but with the move to the ACC looming it does feel like the Mustangs are positioned to move up well one thing I know about the ACC you better be able to defend somebody and this team is defending a lot of somebodys this season tonight there you see opponents field goal percentage was number one in the in the American at 38 tonight holding Florida State the 24 I mean this team can intimidate you they can smother you with their long long lanky aggressive defense they really move their feet in an elique way thats why theyre so effective and tyriq Smith just grabbed that rebound we havent mentioned him much tonight couple of years at Texas te couple of years at Oklahoma State coach laner says hes getting better by the day and at 68 225 hes another grown man up front defending for the Mustang wide openen three just barely nicked the iron long pass off the hands of Spears and out of bounds you know the difference in these two teams tonight is that SMU and their half court offense they are sharing the ball theyre moving the ball and Florida state is just having a tough time catching the ball coming down Music the I think sometimes you get frustrated to try to do everything at once and try to score without actually doing something with the ball thats Applause effective Chuck Harris long three hes got it Harris now with 14 points to lead all scores yeah Chuck Harris leading away and thats a new threatening to run away and hide here in the second half now Harris joined the 1000 Point Club earlier this season November 9th against Lamar of course he spent three years at Butler starter last year long rebound leads to a near run out now Harris is set up on the wing Doug that last possession was no pass shot shots are just being forced by FSU theyre trying to score 14 points in one possession thats not how basketball Works Harris got the defender in the air and then missed the bank shot on second effort able to score the basketball SMU is moving the ball sharing the ball and D Ling down on the offensive glass when coach lanir told us today Chuck Harris is a Hooper my kind of guy go get a bucket thats what I felt on that possession Mark y green contested three able to find the ring well he can definitely do that Darren Green hits gets hot this things going to get close real fast Applause Music itll remain at this end for SMU when we come back Chuck Harris just finding himself wide open knocking down the three ball hes been the Difference Maker offensively little bit offensive glassw extra effort by Chuck Harris and were back 3926 SMU there the 16 points for Harris out of Ashburn Virginia he played in arguably the best high school basketball conference in the country the uh Washington DC Catholic League he played at Gonzaga Catholic High School SMU builds the lead to 16 their largest of the night Spears fouled on his drive to the Music basket you know Doug sometimes you get a sense of a team Whos down and they have boys they have patience they know theyve got to build at one possession at a time I feel like Florida State right now is just trying to do everything in one possession instead of letting the game come to them its hard to do when you get a good defensive team a good aggressive defense some team but this team really need to settle down share the ball and count on each other Music now station the seal call timeout well take it with him and be back to Tallahassee in 30 Music seconds Walmarts amazing holiday deals are happening State down 16 second half field goal shooting has completely flipped for the Mustang all of a sudden their shot is going meanwhile Florida State continues to be stuck in neutral well credit the SMU defense been very stingy been very aggressive they moved their feet actively theyve been able to challenge shots and theyve limited Florida State typically a team thats really rangy and get the offensive glass we havent seen offensive glass work really from Florida State weve seen it from SMU theyve really dominated on the glass created some Second Chance points by manufacturing with effort getting the offensive R Baba Miller back on the floor for Florida State Spears thats a force shot Spears is tried the ball period yeah missed all six of his shots in the first half that wasnt a good one there SMU meanwhile six of 10 in the second half shooting after only 34 in the first half Bel and a trip to the free throw line ahead for Tyreek Applause Smith thats the 12th offensive rebound for SMU Kreek Smith just poog go to it last year with the Oklahoma State Cowboys 36 games started nine helped that team reach the NIT Music quarterfinal heres our Friday night mens basketball that begins at 6 Eastern PJ Hall and number 13 Clemson hosting Queens University and then Marcus Burton and Notre Dame host the merest red foxes a good weekend of Hoops catch it here on accet work and the ESPN really looking forward to seeing PJ Hall be traveling down to Clemson to see that one in person really excited about Brad Brown s ball club theyre undefeated going into today they lost at Memphis in a tough one thats a good basketball team no doubt about it weak side rebound grabbed by Jaylen gainy Florida State extends The Possession 1145 remaining in the second theres another Force three for you coach on the offensive rebound though the seminal comeing Come Away with a couple of points thanks to the twotime ivy league Defensive Player of the Year Jaylen gainy yeah gainy out of Brown University right there really long really athletic and really aggressive on the offensive glass Florida State needs more of that type of focused effort on the offensive end especially rebounding the ball he went 635 days between playing game after transferring from Brown of course he suffered the knee injury right before the start of last season and so gainy playing just his fourth game as a null still trying to work himself into game shape he could really be a Difference Maker for the nolles once he gets it going timeout at the Tucker Center the seol down by 15 to the Mustangs with 1110 on the clock Music 1 points a game and 42 from downtown this kid is a Hooper he is a cool customer and tonight nobody cooler in Tallahassee than Chuck Harris hes finding ways to score from three hes getting in the paint making plays even went to the offensive last and knocked one down as well the big question mark about Chuck Harris can he show the passion can he be that leader tonight hes been that leader and after an offensive rebound he even flexed a little bit force the passion from Chuck Harris well his father Charles senior his mother juetta his siblings Nina Alvin and Kesha enjoying Im sure tracking Chuck Jr with the 16 points to lead all scores Mustangs by 16 Baba Miller grabs the missed free throw I dont know how you are with plus minus if you uh think theres a place in analytics for that I think there is a place others do not but SMU is plus 17 with Harris on the court tonight minus two when hes out of the game coincidence or not no thats not a coincidence thats too big of a number you know Chuck Harris is one of those guys of course he went for 176 rebounds and the loss to Arizona State and Chuck Harris is a guy thats going to lend his talent well to late game situations this a guy that can create a shot can make a shot and he makes Zurich Phelps better Zurich Phelps can play Zurich Phelps hasnt had a great night tonight but Chuck Harris Can can help this team get through offensive droughts and they went through some of that tonight and then hes come through in the second half and just been Dynamic for SMU by the way Primo Spears gets his first two points from the free throw line as a seal and out of that a little full pressure from coach Hamilton Applause SMU has really used Florida States Health defense against them because theyve been able to move the ball aggressively and be a little bit patient on the offensive end both of these teams had extended breaks before this game since their last game because of final exams one was off for a week the other was off for 10 days and uh without the students at the Tucker Center not the energy and environment still as a coach you understand youve got to impress upon your guys youve got to be able to bring it regardless of the circumstances yeah SMU going on the road here tonight theyve shown that they have bounced back doesnt matter if its finals or where they played last they were ready to play tonight right from the beginning especially defensively and their offensive game is caught Music up touchdown in the paint by Chandler Jackson starting to feel a little slow now from Florida State Harris pulls it back out and lost and out of bounds by Zurich Phelps so again the N starting to get something going back within 12 last two turnovers for SMU off the bounce now can Florida State take advantage Music again Music Applause Music well how many times we felt like there was a force shot from Florida State tonight a lot a lot the little Runner goes good touch on that shot by number zero BJ Applause Edwards and hes a kid with upside for sure still learning how to play a little bit right there thats something you needed a basket he came Applause Music through NOS continue to start to make some buckets back to an 11point game well you can see the energy on the defensive end as well for Florida State a few baskets in this team has come to Applause life Williamson pulls up cant get the roll offensive rebound he pulls it back out best time to shoot a three off a missed shot and a kick back out a wide openen look for Chuck Harris that last offensive rebound by SMU was a want to thing there were white jerseys in the in the area but there were black jerseys that pursued the ball and that was Samuel Williamson and you know hes been hearing from his coaches as Miller lays it in from his days at Louisville and then continuing with Rob lanir you need to crash the glass you need to make harder Cuts we need that energy you are a superior athlete and if you just apply yourself good things are going to happen and we saw it on that last offensive rebound he got the offensive glass and picked up an assist here goes Williamson hard to the basket off the glass with the left hand Williamson has made a big difference over the last two possessions by his effort on the offensive glass and then that time attacking off the dribble Drive well done now coach lanir still has faith in the fact that he thinks Williamson quote is going to break out soon loves the work ethic last two possessions as you said he was the difference Primo no there for the easy two Baba Applause Miller Bo its turning into a an offensive rebound Fest right Applause now now can the white jerseys keep the black jerseys off the offensive glass watch the ball go up somehow the Mustangs got the ball back Williamson from 10 has two more time out Music Mustangs SMU offensive rebound gets the ball out Chuck Harris from downtown and then Williamson really doing a job of attacking hes been the most aggressive player on the floor thats why SMU at halftime we talked about adjustments and the adjustment for SMU was to double down on the offensive glass offensive rebounding is a want to thing Samuel Williamson wants it four and finds Chuck Harris from offensive rebounding is a want to thing and this is a team thats getting after tonight 14 want toos in this game the 14 want to is more than their opponents to get the offensive glass and score yeah its been a big part of what SMU has done this year and you see they are already above their season average which is second best in the American Athletic Conference so getting it done against a long in athletic Florida State team the want two for the Mustangs has been better than the want two for the NOS for state gets a bucket on the reverse Josh nickelberry wanting to get it done its a transfer from laau Florida state has played with more energy they just havent been able to turn that energy into knocking down this this lead for SMU now the lead was as large as 17 at 4326 but the seol chipping away still with time on the clock Williamson quick first step to the base line went toward the rim with bad intentions and he will head to the free throw line Doug we were talking during we were talking during the break about Samuel Williamson and the things that that Rob lir talked about that this would be his breakout season he has a a top three work EIC as we see him attack the room right there and you kept some notes from previous coaches that he played for what do those say about him well almost identical to what coach lanir was telling telling us today about you got to make harder Cuts you got to run the floor with purpose take advantage of the gifts that you have and uh coach lanir had the same sentiment all with the belief that its in there and you know I credit Samuel Williamson he came out of Rockwell Texas as a huge recruit for Louisville and he said after his freshman year I was humbled the jump from high school to college was a big deal and it doesnt matter if youre a top 100 recruit or youre the last guy on the bench its a big jump and its harder than than most people realize especially when youre playing high school basketball and you have dominated every single game your entire life its tough but again coach lanir like the coaches he has had previously have great faith in this young man that he can continue to tap into that talent that he has now thats the thing that that Rob talked coach lir talked a lot about yesterday and how he talked about how many players did he mention that I believe in you or I trust you all that is a powerful statement to a player that you believe in them and that you trust them as their coach and were seeing that manifest itself in the body language and how this team is playing so hard tonight on the road against Music FSU rob laner a 55yearold from Buffalo and he is indeed the cousin of the late Hall of Famer Bob laner on his fathers side they didnt really know each other until well into adulthood for Rob they coincidentally went to the same Alma moer both went to St Bonaventure and Rob laner Rob was a starter for three years in college a good guard on teams that as he acknowledged to us earlier didnt win enough when I asked him hey whats the difference between your son on your team now and you playing at St Bonaventure back in the late 80s and early 90s he was quick to say well Emory does more winning than his dad both in high school and in college hes biger more athletic and better looking than me so theres that emry won a couple of state championships as well and thank God he looks like his mother no Applause Music doubt we for states to stop right here in the worst Applause way by to Music shoot and they get that stop can they turn it into offense at the other end and Spears gives it up that would have made it a single digit Applause deficit well Deontay green did everything right except not scored two foot jump stop was balanced just got intimidated inside uhoh B it up Williamson throws it Applause down every Florida State defenders head turned to the ball Williamson read the back of the heads of all the Defenders went right to the rim thats exactly how you back cut from the Baseline watch all the Florida state faces see how theyre all looking to the ball you saw every face looking out toward us and Williamson read it perfectly just goes right to the rim nobody can stop that because everybody was out of position everybody was ball Centric defensively you cant play that way and win and a terrific delivery on the pass by Chuck Harris right where Williamson needed it that was one of the problems for Rob laners team last year they didnt have the point guard play that they have this year they had guys out of position trying to share that position and now it seems to fit better this season yeah Chuck Harris has that High basketball IQ he can shoot the basketball it just takes a lot of pressure off of off of Zur Phelps Phelps was the one guy that you had to guard last year now youve got multiple guys you have to guard including Chuck Harris its made Phelps better kicked out of bounds by jir Watkins Mustangs will keep it under 5 minutes left in Music regulation Chandler Chandler Jackson returns his father David was a fouryear starter back in the day at Western Illinois and was that teams top scor three times now Doug Phelps has not had a great night hes only three for 10 from the floor 0 for three from three he does have 10 points but Chuck Harris has bailed this team out because they havent they have an option a and an option b now at the guard Music Applause positions eight on the timer bels off the Mark Williamson another offensive rebound and Williamson has dominated the last five minutes this game Mustangs continue to bleed the clock on top by Applause Music 11 Jaylen Smith on his penetration we get a whistle Deonte green called for the Music personal just the six foul on the seol here in the second half Music it has been a tough day for the ACC today Clemson lost to a really good Memphis team at Memphis North Carolina Kentucky two Blue Bloods going after each other that can quite work out as well as North Carolina fans would hope Virginia did come back and beat nor Eastern in a heck of a ball game before this came Georgia te one sponsor pman went I think 21 for Virginia hit the game winning shot late to avoid the upset against nor Music Eastern great defense again right from the start SMU has just been doing it and that has been the story in short of the Mustangs having a change in the last 348 they are in position for the road win well Patrick its official youre the Leagues most valuable bundler couple of possessions ago where all the Defenders for Florida State were looking at the ball and he got it dunk on the backside well this is not a bounds play look at all the Florida state Defenders look where their eyes are as theyre looking right at the ball as you see the shooter jayen Smith on the right hand side of on along the sideline right in front of his own bench because Defenders dont see ball and man Smith just slides right down to the threepoint line and is wide open to knock it down we saw a dunk because Florida state was staring at the basketball and now we see an out of bounds play a wideopen three ball as Florida state has to learn from those defensive Music mistakes and there is green thats his only made field or Smith rather who made his uh thats his only made field goal for the night as Chandler Jackson stands at the line well we mentioned in the first half uh coach that you and I Thanks to a little Personal Touch from Leonard Hamiltons staff weve got our own favorite seol uh this year and when we get a break we well show you exactly why that is I uh fav theres a reason why Florida state has been so successful in so many athletic games wow well snu has really executed in this game theyve turned this thing into a rock fight just out executed Florida State at every turn after the dunk by Tyreek Smith back to a 15point lead SMU with the basketball 320 to Applause Music Applause go Phelps along the Baseline lost the basketball and he commits the foul so in the mail from the great truck wall the Sid at Florida State we received handwritten notes from two of the players as you can see for Mark it was Mr Adams from Josh nickelberry thank you for getting to know our basketball team and then tells him one thing he might not know Mr Sherman thank you as well one thing you dont know about me is that my grandfather played for the 76ers with Will Chamberlain thats from Jaylen warley so thats why I say Jaylen warley is now my favorite seol but in this day and age who writes a note like that to show the appreciation theres our man no better S ID in the ACC than Chuck wal no he is the best in any sport Ive been doing this for 25 years and the the notes that he puts together the attention to detail the investment of time with us to help us to get ready to tell these stories on this broadcast Chuck does a tremendous job and also kudos to Florida State look theres a reason why the football teams won three national championships the basketball teams been to 18 NCA tournaments and one final four womens soccer national champions in 2014 18 21 23 baseball is the winningest team in the country basically over the last 10 10 years softball national champions in 2018 they produced 21 Olympians in 2016 first class all the way and Chuck Walsh a great representative for Leonard Hamilton in this basketball team and Josh nickelberry thank you for your personal note it means a lot to an old guy like me believe me I I concur Jaylen as well thank you so much bright in my day and couldnt have more quickly sent a message to Chuck saying boy that really was something never have seen anything like it in all of our Applause years well speaking of the womens soccer team in Florida State how about Brian Pensky his team just completed an undefeated 220 And1 record they beat Stanford on December 4th theres coach for the fourth time Florida state is the national champ of womens Music soccer and oh by the way the football team has a pretty big game coming up not as big as they would like for a to be but theyll be taken on Georgia of course in the orange bow December 30th 400 on ESPN in a matchup of two teams that would have much preferred to better in the college football playoff yeah thats the national championship game isnt it Doug well some people think yeah couple of pretty good teams in the midst of tremendous Seasons you lose your quarterback you still win and you dont make it to the final four of the football plans yeah hard to swallow hard to figure hard to swallow Im not a fan of college Applause football well talk about Chuck Harris just keeps on putting points on the Music board man SMU has been so good on the glass theres a connectivity to this team that I did not see last year Applause unselfish Smith impressive win yeah going to have a chance for a threepoint play and uh youre right impressive and and theyve gotten just enough offense here in the second half to get themselves some separation well and Samuel Williamson that guy that we talked about is going to have a breakout season it may have started tonight in Tallahasse that kid has awesome yeah he has been awesome this half Chuck Harris by the way with his game high 24 points still eight shy of his career high which came against Tennessee Tech last December when he was a butler Bulldog but with points and baskets coming at a premium especially in that Rock fight of the first half Harris was the one coach who kept this SMU offense alive yeah when Zurich Phelps a year ago couldnt score this team just folded offensively now Chuck Harris the way that hes playing this season it gives them a wonderful option that can make shots and attack off the dribble and then you had Samuel Williams into that mix as well look were talking about a guy thats 68 that could put the ball on the floor can go get you an offensive rebound has a good enough fighter to go get it is improving defensively and Zurich Phelps hasnt even played well tonight look this is a team that has some weapons and Rob laner is finding out day by day how good those weapons are theyre two twoo losses away from being 82 going into this game and now an impressive Road win tonight at Florida State 42 second half points for SMU shooting 62 and only five turnovers I mean you talk about flipping the script from half to half it all happened on the defensive end I mean they established their dominance def defensively early in this game and of look FSU matched them defensively for a long time and then FSU started I think panicking a little bit offensively they lost their patience they lost their confidence in each other started forcing some shots and SMU took advantage of that was a SMU has been a more mature team tonight especially on the road winning in Tallahassee well after this the nothing but net crew will break down the day around the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every mens game and look ahead to the best matchups on the schedule in the coming week coverage you can only find here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app Primo Spears first field goal as a 70 cuts it to 14 now he may settle in now I think he really pressed tonight you can understand that first game back after all the the reports about you know transfers being eligible and then they would lose a year of Eligibility and finally came through with everybody can play which is a good thing for Applause basketball yeah and you just dont know even though he has been around college basketball this is third stop its got to you know play with your emotions play with your mind am I going to play am I not going to play and then for a while well if you play during this window you may play two games and lose an entire year of Eligibility and not until yesterday did it get worked out that well you can play and you will be able to play for the rest of the season its a lot and Im happy for all those young men like Primo Spears who now get an opportunity to play look this is a player game its not an administrators game its its not its not even a fan game its a player game its not a coachs game and these young men deserve the opportunity to play look the way I look at it in business we have things called noncompetes and so if you sign a noncompete well you dont get to go and do your job at another organization because you sign a noncompete in Kai basketball though theres no noncompete and I dont I dont understand why we went down this path of saying well you know what we have to go to a court to find out the the Attorney Generals in six different states sue the NCA and then come up with a ruling that theres going to be a temporary restraining order and then it turns into everybody complain which was the right decision by the way and I applaud the NCA I applaud the attorney generals from those six different states and now guys can play because these players deserve to play Applause period well if you like what youve seen out of the Mustangs and youre a fan of the ACC you are going to see a lot of the Mustangs because of course they with Stanford and Cal will be full members of the Atlantic Coast Conference come the fall and uh for SMU this has been a long time coming since the death penalty back in the early 90s it has been really hard and they have tried again and again and again through multip channels to get back to have a seat at the table and so the folks in Dallas are so happy to have their Mustangs as part of the ACC and uh we are looking forward to what they and the Cardinal and the Bears are able to bring to the Atlantic Coast Conference well for those AC fans that arent familiar with with SMU semi oet was selected 37th in the NBA Draft by Boston Sterling Brown spent some time in the NBA these are all players from the last five seasons Shake Milton also was a great player was picked up by Dallas then traded to Philadelphia now is with Minnesota Ben Moore also had a cup of coffee in the NBA and then Fon hunt also was a twoway player uh with the New York Knicks for a while so this is a this is a program that has produced NBA professional players in in the most recent pass those guys were under the watch of Larry Brown and Tim jankovic the two head coaches immediately preceding Rob laner and they have had a marvelous run and again they put a ton of money into redoing Coliseum its a great home court theyre putting money into building up the football stadium to make it bigger money is not a problem for this athletic department and they are coming to the ACC not just to be a middle of the pack team in any sport theyre coming to be contenders for championships Yeah Tim jenovich doesnt get enough credit for the job he did along with Larry Brown out SMU it put SMU on the national Consciousness with NCA tournament bids with n NBA players and then Rob lanir comes in as Tim was able to walk away on his own terms and now Rob laner comes in youre going to have a transition year and now were seeing the fruits of his labor as well smus a really good job in a great City in a great Arena so get ready ACC youre coming to Dallas next year yeah SMU better part of the last decade has spent time almost every year in the national rankings in Music basketball 70s forced to turn over get the easy layup by jir Watkins back to a 10point game floor State continues to apply that pressure you know they have played with energy here in the second half first half was a little Music rough ball deflected for hor Place yeah it bound the ball and and Samuel Williamson right there put the ball right above his head was looking right at the Target he was going to pass thats a turnover waiting to happen you cant do that against the double team you got to go Triple Threat you got to give them head fak you got to keep continue to move and attack he cant walk traveling violation violation cant move your feet on the inbound if its not after a made basket Music they see the turnovers up 15 now for the Mustang now seol they can make it interesting if they can knock down a quick three yep and got it in the hands of the right man green gives it to Watkins who penetrates lost the ball out of bounds its a turnover back to Music SMU theyre going to take another look to see if they got the call off the Applause hand that first look made me think that uh it was off of SMU but after further review not so sure leard Hamilton has to come up with a 10point play in the last 238 Music here so is there enough there to overturn that I mean obviously an SMU player got their hands on the ball but that doesnt mean the Florida state player didnt touch it last its really close Bert Smith Ted Valentine Katie verett our three officials tonight Bert Smith was the one who was initially looking at the video replay to try and come up with the correct call here Music I dont think theres enough there to overturn it because they called it SMU ball theres the hand that slaps down so after Williamson slapped the ball from Watkins did the ball hit Watkins before it went out of Music bounds its FSU basketball Music look for Darren Green good opportunity missed by Taylor B Bowen and now with a shot clock off a foul is given that will send Williamson back to the free throw line Applause well from here SMU will play Tuesday against Houston Christian at home at Moody Coliseum before a game on Friday the 22nd at Murray State and then theyre off until the new year when conference play gets going on January 2nd against Charlotte so moving forward what do you see from coach laner and his Club well this is definitely a game to build on this is a team thats getting better every single night out and now they go into their last nonconference game and then get ready for Charlotte and the tough American of course FAU and Memphis are going to be a load to deal with in that League Tain very talented but this SMU team from what I see tonight theyve got a chance to make some noise in the Applause Music American that should do it as mu comes to Tallahassee and takes down Florida State 6857 final thought coach just a grinded out win for the Mustangs of Rob laner Chuck Harris 24 points to lead the way
