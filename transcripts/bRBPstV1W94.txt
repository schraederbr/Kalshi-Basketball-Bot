and just a simple number 70 anytime Boston College has held any team under 70 points they have won the game and for Syracuse youve got to contain the perimeter Boston College has three guys shooting over 40 from three and also weve got to find JJ Starling some help just to get him going and get other guys going so they can win the game and uh play well well it was a lively Dome on Wednesday but a disappointing outcome Duke was phenomenal here on Wednesday night new opportunity today for both these teams shot clock down to five on the opening possession its Elijah Moore over Deon Brown for three hes been struggling a bit lately that looked really good right there shot with a little bit of confidence kind of have some freshman woves as the season goes on that looked good all the orange fans can sit down after just one possession here at the Dome today Donald Han Jr the reigning co ACC player of the week misses his first shot but got his rebound and JJ Starling picks up the games first foul no changes for Adrien Entre and the orange starting lineup star Starling Taylor and more in the back court with Davis and lamin up front curious to see if nem McLoud can continue the momentum today that he contributed Wednesday off the bench scoring 10 points the season High Chad venning not starting but we do expect to see him third start of the year for Jaden Hastings the red shirt freshman from Orlando Donald Han Jr on the attack scores nice drive down the middle kind of a open shoulder finger roll hes been playing so well as of late he really has 31 last weekend in the win over Florida state anytime you can share an award with Cooper flag youre doing something right but two for two from Deep the orange its Elijah Moore hes got all six they called him choa I dont know if you saw at home he looked at the Bulls Eye on his elbow hes two for two that BS well for Syracuse they need someone to help Starling score Deion Brown had it ripped away by Moore but Brown gets it back too strong off the iron then lanin throws away the rebound on the outlet pass I will say for the folks at home there is a defensive intensity down here right now by both teams this is kind of a mustwin for both to to stay in contention for the ACC tournament youre right John and its weird to say that considering ones 10 and 12 and the others 10 and 13 but there absolutely is an early intensity and some pretty good shot making too Donald Hs got four for BC see what Elijah Moore can do hes got all six for the orange5 the last three pick it up where he left off Davis kicks it to Taylor re post got a mismatch and he cant score over McFarland Here Comes bcon transfer Josh Beetle brings it back outside McFarland passes up the screen from Hastings and rims out the triple Lucas Taylor at 15 four weeks ago in Chestnut Hill 7971 win for the orange on the 11th of January and what about this start Elijah Moore wears number eight hes got eight points in less than three minutes so way to come out of that slump hes been in lately he looks really good getting in the lane after theyre running him off the line early aggressiveness from Elijah and theres Beetle getting the bounce steady vet efficient takes good shots one of the top guys at the assist turnover ratios in the AC hes a steady presence for his Boston College team two teams that combined six for 10 in the opening minutes this is the match just saw a wide open Lane and took it theyve got to exploit that right now this red shirt freshman on a drizzled de theyve got to look at that a little more now 13 career points for lamin whose college career has taken him to Fort Worth Texas and Boulder Colorado and now now to snowy Syracuse Donald Han Jr is feeling it looks good for the relas of his hands Syracuse might have to do a little more be a little more aggressive on that screen as hes the only guy really scoring for them confident looking stroke once again poor coverage on the pick and roll lanin did not go through the smaller Defender Ps length kind of bothered laughing a little laughing a little bit laughing should have just went straight up on that one Donald Han junor bit of a heat check there hes now three for five sure theyre not upset at that one its halfway down before it popped back out like one of my shots earlier this morning except M wasnt halfway down Elijah Moore Oh in and out

flurry on January 11th at Connie Forum chock clck down to four JJ Starling unable to beat the buzzer with a make and the rebound to Donald Han Jr Starling might have to start shooting that shooting the ball when they go under just to make Boston College stay honest offensively its tough to score when they go that far under screen and theyre going to keep going under unless he proves he can make it yeah you got to just shoot that to let them know that you will shoot that and put a little more pressure on the defense loose ball foul just picked up by Starling and uh that is his first I think I

opponents in 17 out of the last 18 games so hopefully they can get a spark for this team thats been on a little bit of a drought to your point orange bench outscored BC 16 to6 and an eightpoint win

70 for Boston College they are right now I dont want to jinx some they are on Pace to keep Syracuse under 70 points so this is going to bold well for them if they can keep defending at this level DC feels they have pretty automatic points when Donald Han Jr goes to the line 91 on the year hes 45 for his last 47 and I apologize to BC fans in chess n Hill and Beyond I did not realize I had such Powers I still dont believe in the commentator curse but that one is hard to deny well numbers say he probably shouldnt Miss for the rest of the game so Evan I think youre good I dont know I dont know if Ill ever be let back into Massachusetts 19 all Bell feeds asovic nice pass to Lampton nice big big pass to sturich attracted a second Defender dropped it off for Lampton for an easy finish Ving

Bell hand right in his grill Bell takes it and scores going glass talk about this unit coming into the game outscoring all their opponents BS the last 17 out of 18 games theyre Shoring it up right now for a s team thats kind of struggling to begin Bell is a starter all last year giving him a little Firepower off the bench at times no good for Dion Brown as terich another rebound Carlos saw a little lane finds lampin hes surrounded by BC maroon and Cal Miss fires from the Applause corner bad pass Eagles turn it over for the third time what do we got jump ball arrow goes back to BC and a characteristic Mistake by Beetle he usually does not make those type of turnovers looks like he just lost grip on the ball number theres red ay 30 wins so far at the Helm of the orange its eight and five at home this year Jim beheim came to his defense on local radio here in town yesterday saying that you got to give him a chance you got to give them the funding to bring in the top KN players so theres no secet around Louisville and du at the top of the league they are spending more money spending more money vending back in this is the hook short JJ Starling loose ball picked up by PC Beetle almost ran into his teammate and then he rattles in the three that looked good from the relas of his hand he shooting 50 519 to be exact on the season nice transition three by Beetle whos made up for his last mistake with the turnover in transition you didnt wanted to say 52 you wanted to say 519 got to be specific man you know for home we watch Lin gives it up sets the screen rolls and dishes and itll be C ball with five to shoot that thinks got to be a little more aggressive on that roll you know Vining maybe laboring a little bit on the injury hasnt played Id like for him to take that up to the rim six points five rebounds so far for lamin of course he had a 23 rebound game earlier this year its the most rebound in a game by any ACC player this season Derek Coleman and Dave D the two names that got those stats thats a good company to be in nice take JJ Starling with his first two of the ball game he had missed his first four before that make heres our sixth lead change H had a wire to wire win last Saturday and they were down wire to wire the game before and the game after against Stanford and Duke respectively hit that wall camping made ref didnt give him that as he was searching for the contact Starling lost the handle and turns it over that was a turnover but I do like the aggression that Starling has putting pressure on the defense every possession trying to get downhill eventually those shots will go set Elijah Mo a little too long they cooled off is that on the head coach one of the assistants they might have you know forgot about him over there he hasnt played this world in a long time thats fair Kelly gives it up hand Rising Fire for three got to get out him man he the confidence hes playing with is is is otherworldly right now that shot looked really good 10 points already for Donald Han Jr in double figures for the 19th time in his 23rd game this year Elijah Moore no hes still hot he is still Applause hot hes four for five hes got 11 points to lead the orange coach arrey did not like that shot he had a smile on that one on the other end if it goes in you like it but I I understand it was contested not really in rhythm but if it goes in you shrug your shoulders and smile its an offensive foul on BC and well get ourselves a timeout with 306 to play Donald Han Jrs got 10 Elijah Moores got 11 good ball game with the orange up one 306 to play in the half Music deltaic is Steve free throw and aoin to wines if he can do it seconds were going to S him to half for to win Applause gas J two Del e e in the past few weeks have the orange fans seen Donnie in a Syracuse jersey for the last time hopefully comes back strong but this day and age you just never know everybodys a free agent right about that and you know youre never going to see a healthy Syracuse lineup which you hate to see they have all the pieces on paper to be really good Elijah Moore not this time lanin got a hand on it but its Tred down by BC the rebound for Donald hand in the corner the next step for Elijah Moore now that hes hitting off shots offensively is to get his teammates involved that was a little rush he probably could have dropped that off the L strong working against Davis tough turnaround and Eddie lanin Jrs got seven rebounds so far in the Applause game JJ for two Applause put constant pressure on your defense I love the way hes playing tonight JJ started over for four hes now two for six four points to the Syracuse leading Applause score venning backing down lampin lost his rhythm shot clock at seven Kelly through venning hands Here Comes cuse jier Davis Coast to Coast he missed it but right there for the tip back was Lucas Taylor good old Taylor to follow it that might have been the basketball Gods talking he probably should have gave it up a little earlier you you dont feel quite as sheepish after the Miss if one of your teammates puts it right back in right right about that we still scored no worries just gave him an offensive rebound for his for his troubles defensive pressure right here is just Syracuse is theyve up the intensity anything up and thats off pain or McKelly excuse me the the pressure by Elijah Mo we we talked about that earlier the offense is lead the defense for Applause him here turnover out of the hands here J probably should have threw it up a little earlier but you know what Lucas Taylor got the rebound and the point so hes rewarded another Mark of the fighter moment brought to you by Modell lampin throws it down eight points eight rebounds for the big fella from Houston six offensive rebounds so far for Syracuse right now number one in the league offensive rebounds per game tied with the Stamford star Maxim Reno Fred Payne ninth rebound for lamin hes going to have a double double by halftime if he scores here although he may run out of time to get his 10th rebound hes on his way is the point V might be laboring it might be something to look at for Syracuse to try to get Ling the ball but I like it in starlings hands as well either way shock clock is off game clocks at four to the corner kickoff pass Davis from the es logo not quite look good for a second oh the orange with a bit of a turbulent can the orange break it open or will the Eagles hang around and keep the back and forth thing going Syracuse has to keep applying defensive pressure and Bost C just got to get in the hand Juniors hands and let him play from there orange fans rise to their feet here at the Dome and Jer Davis will let everybody sit down Q scores on the first possession in both halves if theyre going to have ground guarding jier Davis theyve got to give him the ball every single time largest lead so far for the orange joshh Beetle knocks down the two surpris he doesnt look for his offense more Ive always liked his game even when he was at Clemson I mean hes shooting 50 from the field and from three might be a guy that he needs to look for his offense a little more especially on this F college team as you called for right back to Davis got to get to it every time theres a mismatch down there right now Boston College is going to have to figure it out four straight points for Davis to start the second half for the orange 87th alltime meeting Beetle looking for his offense and finds it so thats four for Davis four for Beetle a game a oneonone they yell no reject but uh same results on that pick and roll coverage Starland got to figure that out theyre probably going to come back to that play again thats off Moors hip out of bounds to BC one of the things that brown does do for for this team hes a hes a hustle player he he he makes the small plays for this Boston College defense Eagles have not won at the Dome since a really bad BC team knocked off number one Syracuse February 2014 in overtime Syracuses spoiled BCs last 10 trips to Syracuse Taylor picks up his second foul John when youre a player you care about I mean I know when youre a player of Carolina you care about the Duke history but like other series histories do you know what happened before you got there for sure uh and the Clemson Clemson had to be us for 50 years and we did not want to be the team that lost at Carolina so that definitely played a factor in our intensity when we did have come to the de another special exception for Carol but that that streak did come to an end finally Brad Brownell momentous occasion after the hand three Starling cant return the favor although hell retry from the corner and knock it down another offensive rebound leading to a shot DCs got a finish possession as we T in our key to the game 11 Second Chance points for cuse another three for Boston College first points of the day for Dion Brown not of offense but Syracuse is creeping up on that magic number of 70 that Boston College wants to keep their teams under Eagles 80 this season when holding the opponent to 70 or less oh JJ starlings eating up missed his first four shots but now hes four for his last six hes got 10 points and double figures for the 15th time this year he had 20 points in the second half against BC last Music game take a look at the mark of a fighter moment brought to you by Modelo swing right here to the corner nice Rhythm three for brown and on the other and Starling right back at you the double team on J Davis led to that open three by Starling theyve got to keep going at him hes making plays for his teammates two teams eight for nine make it 9 for 10 from the floor to start the second half as we saw BC come back score 15 points in a couple minutes against FL State they can put the ball in the basket as well Deon brown big time scorer last year at UNBC if he heats up look out five for Dion to start the second half Up and Under

minute against Duke and havent made a free throw today theyre now 0 for three in that department thats just attacking the rim and putting pressure on the defense getting downhill Syracuse has to do a little bit more that to put a little pressure on the referees to make a call Deon Brown gets downhill oh and he missed it again from Point Blank Range it was too easy he was rust a little bit down there with the trees JJ for two hes got a quick First Step that offensive rebound for his shot has kind of opened him up offensively and hes starting to see the ball go in Boston Collin better be careful painful fourpoint swing for Earl Grant rejection there oh back down by Jaden Hastings announcing his presence in the second half caught lampin slipping a little bit down there nice punch with

Carlos to the corner and cuck was fouled by beetle with a bump Music Applause number we had a nice chat with Earl Grant earlier asked him a pretty point blank question you know Donald Han Jr coming on strong hes just to sophomore asked him if he sort of begun talking about you know how much money Boston College could give him to stay for next year he said oh yeah we we started those conversations already cuz thats the era were in now its constant and he lost 80 of his scoring last year so you know hes got to start negotiating a little earlier and trying to keep guys he said they may have low balled mlock them last year so hes learning through the process just as everyone else when I asked him the question John part of me expecting to say no well deal with that all after the season now were focusing on basketball but the reality is its a new world tough Fade Away there jier Davis six points since halftime theyve got to keep giving him the ball hes in the Rhythm right now hes

Financial Security for nearly 160 years orange up by eight lets take a look at todays key play brought to you by Hilton Garden in Hilton for the stay good defense by Ling Jor then getting down being patient looking for his offensive teammate a threein rhythm thats how play hes been playing a long time that last shot from JJ Starling top of the key was initially ruled a two its been changed to a three so JJ now with two threes in the game hes two for four from Deep hes got 14 points I got a feeling hes just getting started I would not disagree with you there Elijah is strong comes up short rebound chased by Brown and itll be BC ball Brown making some key plays to get his team extra possessions right here just hustling man and trying to get his team oo might have hit off his back though right I thought initially the bounce was out of bounds and then hit his back but notc caught a break there sometimes hustle catches a break and sometimes the ball doesnt lie itll still be BC ball though Carlos smacks it away from Beetle BC has got to figure out how to get H Jun the ball man thats the only way that theyre going to close this Gap hes got to start putting a little more pressure seems like hes kind of Fading Into the offensive scheme right now saying he has to be a little bit more selfish yeah hes got to go get the ball venning tied up Eagles will maintain possession but only 36 in the shot clock Eagles taking their time propositioning for a clock reset into the corner Donald H Jr short caught the rim though shock clock reset and Elijah strong will get back to the free throw line for the Eagles it has not been a great free throw display from the two teams the Eagles are one for Four the orange are one for five see if Elijah strong can change that here after he missed a couple earlier there you go the CWs number one show is back and its all new this Monday dont miss all American Monday at 87 Central right here on the CW stayed quiet on last free throw seems like it Music Applause worked two for two there for strong sevenpoint game kind of been back and forth between three and nine this entire second half DCs got to string together some stops to get this game closer as the clock is slowly ticking Music away nice pass the cup acrobatic move and a late whistle but I think BT Smith got it right even though strong disagrees I think thats a foul yeah thats a foul seems like the ref may not have wanted to call that but I think it was too much at the end Kyle cuff 0 for eight from the field did not score in 12 minutes on Wednesday but he hit a couple of huge shots in the win over BC back in January CED again I guess it didnt work Evan this whats going on here for the orange at the line I think Ive seen this I mean four for 12 combined thats tough fuse now two for Applause seven we head into the fourth quarter of this basketball game orange led by seven at the half a back and forth first half with a bunch of lead changes strong tied up this time its Syracuse ball stovich brings energy Off the Bench I love what he brings to this team coming in for his limited minutes to impact this game hasnt scored yet but hes impacted the game in other ways its been a minute since were seen a BC rebound and go the other way so theyve got to start get some stops soon Carlos pull up Syracuse ball tell you what vinning is going to feel that tomorrow lamping Jr is not giving him any breaks down there going for the boards asovic to trigger the inbound from the Baseline Starling on the bench right now so Chris Bell looking for his offense go and off strong out of bounds to cuse again DC I was saying before man its been a while since theyve just got a rebound and went the other way its either ended at points free throws or turnover rebounds just 30 to 27 only plus three feels like a bigger margin than that really he does Syracuse looking for some more Second Chance points Eddie unable to throw it in its going to stay with cuse BC cant believe it Elijah strong is not going to send Matt Potter a Christmas card next year lets see looks like its all strong right there lamp throws it down on the fth chance of The Possession give a team five goals at it theyre probably going to score Evan nice for Syracuse to keep at it BC as we said in the key of the game has to finish possessions to win this game largest lead of the day so far for the orange important possession here for BC and free throws coming for strong lamin in disbelief who me I think that was a foul although strong may have been a little out of control yeah hes right thats a foul that is a foul if Ive ever seen you we got a moment here free throws talking a lot about lamin and venting John youre youre a different kind of post I mean you didnt necessarily have the same gir that those two had not that youre slight you had some strength to you obviously some some hops how did you deal with those guys with that more grome nature I would have been Garin movich big Zeller would have had to take on lamp pting I want to know Parts when I was in college big those big guys what about in the league well thats a whole different story some guys I dont care if its you or me you got to bring a double team but um you got to do your work early and uh try to make the shot as tough as possible against you know big bodies like that of course you had to deal with Giannis and practice more often than not for sure what was that like h it was tough uh cuz he practiced like he played in the game man which is a good good habit to to build as a young player I know he he credits your influence on him and how you helped him improve and practice and taught him how to work in the NBA yeah um I used to guard him every day man so I I when he was younger I used to get with him a little bit uh needless to say as you guys see him now I dont think anybody in the world can guard him at this point as a guy who has been dealt on the trade deadline what was your reaction all the hoopla this past week I think the Luca trade started the landslide I think it made everybody else not not afraid to make some moves if youre going to trade LCA donic anybody can get traded BC gets the steal Luca Taves into the game for the first time he didnt play on Wednesday against Louisville either he hit the halfcourt shot today shoo on maybe coach is looking for some shooting Donald H Jr had way too much space there and hes got BC back within six thats what you cannot give H Jr hes shooting over 50 the last three games thats a layup for him right Applause there eagles not going away venning reaching in for the steel came up empty lamin going oneonone no helps coming Applause wins that battle these guys are battling in there man theyre both need the ice badge after this your PC you got to try to get it back to hand here after he just knocked one down right you have to think pay missed him again though Fred Payne puts it in fourpoint game as we close in on seven minutes to play timeout Syracuse Applause we will take it as well 5955 good one coming down the stretch here at the Dome damn Applause hey e youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by Pacific Life

it Ill say it again youve got to get the ball in hand Juniors hands theyre running a high pick and roll have been in roll hopefully putting H in the weak side hopefully to get a three or a shot but I think he needs to be the primary ball handler for these next seven minutes oh Grant looks like hes ready to play ready to defend ready to fight huse is led by as many as 10 BC has cut it to four C ejected by Taves and the loose ball picked up by BCs McFarland ahead Kane and itll be Eagles ball off myerovich Music well get ourselves another timeout now 641 to play BC ball down four looking for a win at the Dome for Music Music down Music damn hey Applause lets take a look at todays game summary presented by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for nearly 160 years Dion Brown for BC and Jer Davis for Syracuse neither scored in the first half John Henson both of them gotten going here in the second know Deion Brown has kind of started off slow this season you know one of their top 4S out of the portal but hes playing well the second half and G Davis has just been taking advantage of Mak mismatches either finding his teammates or looking to score Davis scored over 1300 points in three years at Delaware native of the first state now coming up to the ACC for his final season his 118th game college basketball today this is a big possess of Boston College to kind of put a little pressure on Syracuse to see if they can withstand this run no doubt that theyre on P feeds the post nice cross screen venning backing down lampin venning tough shot Well Done by lampin thats his 15th rebound of the day this defense has been a story of the game down there and venning not allowing him to get good looks at The Rim second highest rebounding game of the season for lampin only surpassed by the 23 boards he had against pit stepped out of bounds its the second time today thats happened to Chris Bell Old Coach used to tell me the Courts been the same size for 100 years you got to know where youre at wow ever since they hung the peach baskets in Springfield exactly another possession where H junor is just in the corner yeah its a little surprising very Taves to the other side McFarland airballs the three and then hand got a hand on the rebound and knocked away itll stay BC ball says Bert Smith in the Applause Baseline Taves gets it in corner three in and out and again out of bounds again Boston College basketball type of game has been hey this is the third possession for BC Hot Potato they ought to get a good shot here Music this is right here where ah just a tough break just a tough bounce theyre both going for the ball it happens its basketball youre right John hand is just chilling in the corner it doesnt make a lot of sense for BC now he gets a touch gives it up Applause immediately venning backing down lamin tough stand defensively for the orange I I just I just dont know if thats the guy Id be going at lamping has played really well defensively down the stretch so this is very interesting to see if youre a Boston College Benning just two for eight now from the floor Davis kicks it and reposts with a clock winding down oh ball on the smack by McFarland good hands numbers for the Eagles pretty good transition defense from cuse Donald H junor theres what weve been talking for every time he touches it good things happen man this is um but credit to him for staying within himself and shooting good shots when he gets him thats a sign of a high Lev player I I love that he staying in the game regardless onepoint game four and a half to Applause play V kind of grimacing a little bit looks to be in a little pain Bell free throw jumper is Applause good big bucket for Syracuse snaps a drought that had lasted over four minutes without a Applause point there we go getting involved with some action right here this is kind of what you want only one guy for BCS and double figures thats Donald Han Jr and again theyre going to have a possession without giving him a touch 19 for hand Brown and Beetle each have nine though they werent involved in that possession either JJ Starling leading away for cuse with 14 Starling fouled and hell shoot two free throws after the final media timeout in regulation Q by three conclusion coming up fans with Boston College missing two consective free throws earlier in the game youe chickfila at the the your youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for nearly 160 years to who wants one Applause I Applause you Applause youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for nearly 160 years welcome back to Syracuse for the orange leading by 3 337 into play coming up when were done here well take you to John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville for the red hot Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets led by Damon staty against the Virginia Cavaliers theyll be honoring Tony Bennett today which is a reminder of all the long tenured successful ACC coaches who have either stepped aside or are planning on stepping aside at the end of the season it is a whos who of coaches for the past quarter century plus I mean those are some names for you right there all legends all Hall of Fame guys hopefully the ACC continues to breed excellence in the coaching realm Jim beheim obviously a ton of success here leading Syracuse to five final fours the national championship Carmelo Anthony and Company back in 2003 Applause there was something about this Syracuse team John and frankly I feel that way now maybe a little less so with the news that Donnie Freeman is definitely done but there was something about Syracuse in March even if they didnt have a great season there were always pesky in their conference tournament or in the National Tournament yeah it was a its its a its a big brand and and that that zone defense one game yeah could mess a lot of teams up and did mess a lot of teams up absolutely all righty three and a half to play fivepoint Applause game beetle with the left hand puts it in nice move nice Pace by beetle with the left hand with the float hes a guy who want the ball in his hands as well towards the end of the game assisted turnover ratio top 15 in the Applause ACC dier Davis he found his spot tough match up under siiz right there McFarland hes got to put up a little more resistant maybe front push the catch out 67 vers 64 veteran and Davis knows how to use that size and both Beetle throws it to the first row Applause H junr was wide open on the on the Easy Pass he tried to make the the the the great pass instead of the Easy Pass and uh thats what thats when you turn the ball over down to two and a half remaining ninth double double of the Season today for Edie lanin Jr matching the number of double doubles he had last year as a Colorado Buffalo and JJ Starling continuing his second half scoring barrage J say stering now hes the guy here Syracuse who want the ball in his hands hes a closer for them and uh they seem to be doing that 14 of his 18 in the second half he had 20 in the second half against BC last month venning borrows in doubled he scores Applause anyway and BC going to take a timeout with a buck 53 left vennings third field goal brings the Eagles within five good patience for the screen right here Cuts back pins the defender behind him nice float game thats what he Music does strong move right here Patience by vinning but good defense still by lamping that was a tough shot and again you know Donald H junr 19 points Beatles join him in double figures with 11 Donald Han four for n from three feels like theyve gone away from him down the stretch yeah its um interesting uh strategy he does pull the defender the primary Defender away from the play so he still is affecting the game in a positive light cuz you cannot leave him the way he shoots the three Syracuse got to get the ball to Jer Davis and let the game kind of work itself out whether he makes a play or for his teammate or takes a good shot orange in the first meeting against BC shot 57 the second half theyre shooting 62 so far in the second half today little full core pressure out of the timeout Starling gets it across the timeline to Bell and now the orange will run some clock up five with a buck 42 to play Davis kicks it Bell in and out rebound popped around still loose and McFarland rips it away from his teammate I think thats the first possession weve seen BC finish man in a long time just getting the rebound off one shot Syracuse fans trying to implore a game ceiling stop Daran Juniors three wont go rebound pulled down by Davis starlings got to hustle get this cross he does and we are under a minute PC playing this out they could foul and give one in ones and create more time orange have not shot the ball well from the line today or during the season and you give the foul after 25 seconds come off the shot clock there John just some strange late game clock management when youre down by five yeah you know uh Brown risks going for the steal which got him behind the play and uh charlin being the offensive player that he is attacked and Drew the foul 177 foul so its one and one for Starling rebound Syracuse Lin tipped it to Davis still a two possession game you might have to play this out see if you get a quick score BC a quick stop yep five to shoot Starling can he be the closer JJ missed it rebound loose Lin hes got magnets in his hands the rebound his 16th rebound might have just sealed the deal today at the Dome we talked about it finishing The Possession credit the Syracuse on man battling on the boards the magic number 70 its still in play so you know lanord got to knock this down one and one here even if he misses him for BC youre down to 20 seconds left if he misses if your BC can you get the rebound oh he can its another Miss of a front end Eagles still have some life remember what happened last Saturday against Florida State and and gets the bounce interesting McFarland hit the net and the ball was still on its way down loose in the back court but a foul called on Brown threepoint game 91 to go and another one and one here coming up for Syracuse is this a violation that should prevent the basket I think that is definitely goal tending refson called it it didnt it looked like it moved a little more than in live and actually did on slow motion maybe thats just the speed of the camera I just know youre not allowed to grab the net when youre out there you know that too yeah you definitely cant do that Syracuse got to not down some free throws to close this game out its been a nightmarish day theyre four for 11 at the line another Miss front end Eagles have a chance down three with 5 Seconds and Syracuse gives the Applause foul they watch the floor a state game theyre not theyre not going to play around with fire be one and one here for Donald Han Jr with 53 to go no theyve got two fouls to give so this could get tricky so that or is that six that was the 16 foul they still have one more to give okay lets take a look now todays player of the game brought to you by Progressive Insurance save when you bundle Auto home and motorcycle insurance visit progressivecom hes just been a load from the opening tip to the closing bell we talked about it whoever is winning the battle between Benning and Lin Jr their team is probably going to win the game Lin Jr has put his team in position to Come Away with a ACC win and still keep their hopes alive to get into the tournament this year and effectively almost putting Boston College in a area where they may not be able to come back from getting to the ACC tournament Syracuse has missed three straight front ends of one and one to keep PC in this game theyre now four for 12 at the free throw line which is just astonishing yeah you know theyve got one more foul to give so if I am Syracuse Im letting BC get the ball in run a second or two off foul right away if Im Boston College Im running to play to get a shot for H Jr coming off a screen quickly so well see what coach Grant has drw up or drawn up Im sorry to uh get a shot before Syracuse can foul BCs made eight threes in the game BC has not shot free throws well either theyre just four of eight from the line four threes today for hand one each for brown beetle pain and strong Applause venning is out there with hand Brown strong and Beetle its tough spot to get a shot in right here Applause so Syracuse defensively as BC gets it to venning and just like the eagles did against North Carolina they call their final time out after getting it across midcourt the issue against the target he was they couldnt get it in and they turned it over smart play because you know that Syracuse is going to try to foul so you want to get the ball to a spot where you can throw it in and get a quick shot because if Syracuse does foul its going to run too much time off the clock well you say its a smart play John but I mean if they dont have they dont have a timeout left so they have no margin for Eric getting this in that has been you know what cost him in Chapel Hill BC trying to get out of the bottom three theyre going to need at least two more wins in their final nine games but realistically theyre probably going to need three or four you know BC feels that they have the horses to go four and five in their last nine games and get to the ACC tournament as as NC State showed last year you can catch lightning in a bottle magic can happen you want to be a part of the ACC signature event the officials are looking at the monitor perhaps to add had a couple tents of a second back onto the clock if youre BC here yes youre expecting a foul but I think with that in mind you got to be catch shoot right TR to get three free throws right now its a catcher shoot coach Grant did that so Syracuse couldnt just foul them on the catch and so now you draw up a play and you let the tiip follow where they may if they missed a shot game over so this is it you surprised venning is out there when hes for nine all time from three you know I think hes going to be a screener probably the best screener thats fair on the team oh now Syracuse has taken a timeout its a 30 think this game doesnt matter to these teams youre mistaken this is important to separate themselves especially Syracuse from that line of not getting into the ACC tournament two teams that desperately just want a taste victory BCs lost seven of eight Syracuse has dropped four of five both these teams teams won last Saturday but wins have been few and far between in conference play dont forget when we are done here at the Dome we will take you to charlotesville for the yellow jackets and the Cavaliers also ACC womens basketball top 25 Showdown tomorrow from Tallahassee all right 45 on the clock orange have one timeout left BC has none eagles need to get this in can we see another Boston College miracle I dont believe in magic but well see Payne to trigger the inbound throws it to venning gives it back to Payne good look for the tie its good 67 all 12 to go time out Syracuse spoke too soon Evan Fred Payne with the gutsy shot to tie Applause Music up that could not have been what Syracuse had wanted defensively pay had a ton of space youve got to be up if youre lamping because you got to foul you have to be up to foul that right there Ling has got to be moving screen on venning not at all youve got to be up the foul right there just bad defense by Syracuse gotta be cant go under either for JJ Starling just woo I guess erl Grants double timeout uh worked out for him today 7even nothing Run for the Eagles to tie it at 67 huse has not scored in the last 217 think about all those Miss free throws John including three missed missed front ends of one and ones staggering stuff and now 12 to go cuse has to go the length of the Court any BC foul would be two shots so you certainly dont want a foul despite Syracuses strugles at the line got to draw up the old the Bryce Drew play Bryce Drew Christian lner maybe catch it and turn and shoot and dont foul if youre BC just whatever you do dont foul what a shot from Fred Payne The Freshman from Louisiana asked Earl Grant before the game if hes surprised with Fred for 41 from three he said not really cuz he he got hurt last year he tore ligaments in his knee and he tore his hamstring and because he couldnt do anything else he just shot yeah all season long and that helped refine his form and added to his confidence and I heard a coach say that a guy getting injured helped him as a shooter all right Jer Davis to inbound looking for Starling lamin or Carlos he gets it to Carlos from three4 court its short and and weve got five more minutes here in Syracuse sorry guys we going to have to wait weve got a ball game right here Boston CAU us with another epic comeback uh what a way to end the game for them Syracuse missing free throws and uh once again Boston College capitalized on the other teams mistakes down the stretch what a wild way to finish that second half lets take a look at again Syracuse up by three with 4 seconds left Ving right back to pay smooth stroke from The Freshman Nice Shot stepped into it good lift but you know what he didnt have a defender in his face he got a good look at the basket a 40 threepoint shooter is going to make most of Music those third overtime game of the season for Boston College they beat Missouri State back in November they lost to North Carolina a couple weeks ago this is my second overtime game I had the Clemson pit overtime game its the second overtime game for Syracuse they hung on against the Penguins of Youngstown State OT 10495 back in mid November a lifetime ago when it comes to a college basketball Music season this has been a pretty wild way to get to OT right um Syracuse has to kind of regroup I I just cant I just cant believe that you know Syracuse has the timeout that Earl Grant called and then calls another timeout and then Fred Payne gets that good of a look from three you know you almost could say you could have had a switchable guard on vinning because they needed three but also you have to worry about the rebound but two doesnt kill you so a lot of interesting decisions down the stretch thats why Im over here not coaching Applause EV Jer Davis to jump center with Chad venning venning was not in the starting lineup so he did not jump it earlier venning wins the tip in the hands of pain its been a long time since the Eagles had a lead in this game back when it was Applause 2725 pay comes up short startling the rebound maybe feeding the hot hand see if he can still has it going by Boston College last time BC W here at the Dome was an overtime against the number one Syracuse team that enter of the day 25 and0 and free throws coming here for the orange 31 seconds into OT nice rip through right here going Baseline we lets go go go the game has been a lot more physical than that foul but you know we got behind and the Bre Bre made the call Davis attempting his first three throws of the Applause day 87th all time meeting between BC and Syracuse its the third time that theyve gone to OT Jer Davis told Coach keep feeding me keep the ball coming so well see if they continue that Donald H J puts the Eagles on top I mean you know hey maybe thats what hes there for space the floor and shoot when we get the ball great find by Beetle finding his best player best shooter on the team 24 for BCs top star what do we got its a block that that might have went last year last couple years but the new rule good attack by Beetle drawing the defense in kff loses Vision thats what happens when you lose vision on the shooter fifth three of the day for Donald hand Jr the reigning coac player of the week two to player of the week Im get first fatherson Duo to be players of the week in ACC history his dad was a pretty good player back in the day as well really the first in history first in history surpris I think in 2003 it was our our guy Randolph tiris and his son Brandy didnt get that distinction right one for two were tied at 70 huse continues to struggle from the line theyve missed nine of their 16 Applause tries strong fakes it and then lost it 11th BC turnover each team had 10 turns in Applause regulation 13 points 16 rebounds for Lampton now he sets the screen for Starin to the Elbow for two tough shot he is hes a gifted offensive player man that that was a tough shot he made look really Applause easy now Beetle pieres the paint and a tough tear drop for Josh Beetle he has been getting into the lane sailing off the defender hitting that floater all night especially in the second half the tied for the fifth time weve had 10 lead changes Syracuse is Led for more than 33 minutes BC is in a zone right now trying to switch it up a little bit they havent been able to put PC away they just cant what to man right now a different look clocks down to four Davis absorbs the contact and will take two free throws with 233 to play in Applause OT are they going to call it on the floor strong has got a no two shots right here strongest upset on foul but look youve got to you got to back up a little bit and give jier Davis some room Beetle restraining strong has been frustrated with the officials all game long theyve got to get strong out of there man hes Donnie Freemans calling for a te over there in the Syracuse bench they got to get him down hes being hes a little emotional right now understandably Applause wow number Syracuse entering the day was 17th out of 18 teams in free throw shooting in the league but hav been this bad theyre now seven for 17 from the free throw line Davis goes one for two there puts the orange back up one Midway through the Applause overtime Beetle pivots back to his left is Donald Han Jr going to get a touch I dont think so there it is 11 to shoot and tough Fade Away wont go and a strong rebound from Davis tough to give him the ball in that situation where hes got to make something happen without any offensive set Applause um but hes a guy that could potentially make something happen if that was the case not going not going Davis gets it Starling missed it and the rebound finds BC P slows it up this is this is what BC needs right Applause here give it to him yeah there you go hand was fouled turke fou number Taylor picks it up thats his Applause third getting a little too close you got to give him some air space to land thats a foul but another positive play by Han Jr getting the ball in this crunch time one for two at the line today for hand wow kind of a hitch hes got a weird hitch um I had a weird hitch of my free throws and I was not very good so Im glad that hes showing that the hitch does work I mean hes number one in the ACC but not today right 91 for the year one for three today needs this one for the tie smooth 73 Off DC has got to finish the possession right here what killed him last time down the stretch my finish you mean get a defensive rebound after getting a miss Lucas Taylor with some English off the glass nice finish by Lucas Taylor havent heard his name much this game but that was a nice drive off the screen by lamping Jr just a second shot attempt hes two for two Beetle inside for venning triple team he scores anyway L the foul and BC could retake the lead at the line just a strong move good pass by Beetle strong finish on three guys he was fouled by at least two of the three hes got some long arms man he hes its the reason hes number two in field goal percentage in the ACC foul on lanin is third venning free throw puts BC up one we got a close free throw make we got one so lets see what happens Applause nine points now for venning this would be a devastating disappointing defeat for Syracuse who is up 10 in the second half actually up 11 at one point 5645 with 1212 left Starling swed but a foul called Now Syracuse wants goal tending take get it good take by uh Starling right here get to the Lane got it from behind I guess you can call that a foul not a goal 10 but a reasonable foul call for sure yep number two on hand so lamin back to the line where hes one for four these are I beg your pardon itll be Starling at the line hes two for four Applause interesting hes such a throw shooter beinging such a good Applause Music Applause score 304 left Starling for the lead we remain even game and shot clock are about a half second apart timeout Boston College BC will get the last shot right here well be back in 60 seconds BC and Syracuse tied 76 all 226 to go Music Music Music two teams below 500 but battling to the brink here today at the Dome 76 all with 226 to play and for those of you joining us looking for game three of our CW Courtside Saturday triple header well get you to Charlottesville as soon as we finish here in C tip off scheduled for 537 pm Eastern so stay with us on the CW for Georgia Tech in Virginia all right game clock and shot clock are just about in sync theyre about a half second apart if your BC are you thinking one shot no offensive rebound no chance for Syria Hughes either we win or we go to double yeah youre thinking one shot in the NBA we had a rule you start to play at around 10 or 9 seconds so you allow time maybe for a tip in but for the most part one shot theyll probably have Beetle and Vinnie High pick and roll with Han junr on the opposite side and uh thats been working for him if the guy sags off hands Junior H junr he shoots to three if not vinning gets a layup or Beetle comes out for the float so its been working Fred Payne was the hero at the end of regulation the game tying three with a second left pay in bounds to Beetle out there with McFarland venning in hand empty side pick and roll thats going to be the game thats what theyve been doing and Boston College pull off another miraculous victory for the second straight Saturday Josh Beetle getting downhill but he lost it lamp in the steel Starling for the win at the buzzer and weve got double overtime Georgia Tech Virginia still to come and Syracuse wins the tip to Applause begin inside to Davis help came and its out of bounds last Touch by BC got a pick that up right there if you mcfarling that was a good defensive play orange have 10 to shoot JJ Starling Leading The Way with 21 but unable to win the game at the end of OT and now Boston College will look to retake the lead here in double OT eight ties 11 lead changes Josh beetle step back three eagles back in front coach Grant see he trusts his his he trusts Beetle he he he he knows that hes a guy thats going to make a good play and that was a good shot by him to put him up three 16 for Beetle tough shot for Taylor in ball venning tracks down the rebound good job by Han junr getting back in front you see the tip off in Charlottesville on the day that theyre honoring Tony Bennett the yellow jackets and the Cavaliers just getting underway well get you there with Tom wormy in the crew in a bit theres a tough take Donald Han Jr now at 26 points and this is the largest lead of the day for Boston College and Junior with another clutch clutch moved to the basket man they two stalwarts at the guard position are leading them right now to a potential Road win in the ACC which is tough to come by timeout taken by Syracuse cant go under I dont know if Syracuse has learned his lesson yet but that right there is a easy shot for a 51 threepoint shooter eighth time this year BCs made double digit threes in a ball game theyre 11 for 27 two for three here in the overtime take a look at whats going on at jpj as Syracuse and BC strategize Virginia coming off a great performance in Pittsburgh on Monday John and off to a heck of a start so far today Virginia is still one of those Elite programs obviously coaching chains late in the well early but late into the season um offseason um kind of hurt them a little bit but Im sure theyll find a way Georgia Tech also had a couple nice wins getting the best of Clemson in OT also beat Louisville Damon Styers team is coming on strong thats a really intriguing game for a couple of teams that are trying to get back to the 500 Mark for the season right about that so were in a timeout with 324 left in double overtime Isaac mcne is going to hit another wow N9 nothing Virginia sorry to steal Tom wormys Thunder MC Neely ripping the ropes as Tom might say interesting kind of stat Beetle has 14 of his 19 threepointers have come with 10 seconds or less on a shot or game clock shooting 57 from three in ACC play so maybe hes the guy you want the ball in his hands when the games down the stretch so another sizzling start for Virginia they got a 9 nothing lead will keep you posted s use two for seven in the two overtimes combined so far John and for the game theyre just nine for 20 from the free throw line five straight points for DC to begin double overtime can Syracuse counter right here oh my goodness Ill say with confidence that not what red atrey Drew up in the Huddle lampin looks like he was telling hes telling Davis I was supposed to set a pick not get the ball so thats just miscommunication on the board in the timeout which could be detrimental down five or three minutes left inot venning driving on lampin he scores over him that was a tough move nice little crossover to the chest up seven straight for the Eagles here in OT if youre BC you dont want threes make them score twos and you should go home with the victory darling lost his Tribble theres just a discombobulated feeling right now for the Syracuse offense clock winding down Bell forced to Fire and four Eagles there for the defensive board pain pulls it in that rebound evens up the rebounding battle each team has exactly 40 rebounds in the game so BC holding its own despite giving up 16 offensive boards that have led to 13 Second Chance points for the orange Donald ham Jr dont get the bouns lamin grabs it 17th rebound Here Comes cuse Carlos a blur to the pass absorbing the contact and scoring through hand first points for jquan Carlos in the game good verality by H junr and then pressure and stolen away and then stolen back and its still loose and its a Rugby scrum and PCs got possession and a fouls called on Applause Starling chaos I didnt know what I what to look at it was so much much going on right there Syracuse trying to be Applause aggressive good defense by Carlos right here too just getting his hands on the ball John did you watch any of the rugby seven scrums in uh Paris this past summer I did not um you know what actually that should have been a 10sec because s never had possession of the ball right there so interesting pain at the line he missed the front end of a one and one and then a foul by the shooter pay bumps Bell going for the rebound and thats a gift two shots for Chris Bell just a mistake by pain right here you want that clock to run when theyre trying to score first mistake is missing the front end of the one and one and then to compound it by giving the foul when Syracuses offense is really struggling seemed a little rush in that free throw shooting at 41 uh probably was a little jittery on that Bells first free throw attempt to the game is pure its almost like neither of these teams knows how to win a late game tight crunch time situation right about that coach Grant talked about crunch time situations with guys that are all coming together to be a new team these are the type of moments that having an older team spin together helps who has that in college basketball in 2025 nobody at this Applause point even if you got older guys they havent been together for a long time two free throws for Bell its a threepoint game DC run the clock down and get a good shot thats all you can do right here the clock is your worst enemy team coming on beetle hes into the back court and hes called for the violation I think its the right call Jeff Clark was all over it I dont know I think Syracuse hit that ball I think it should have been fair game right here I dont know well lets lets see right there yeah I think Syracuse you know what youre right they did deflect it out of his hand J maybe because he tried to pick up possession in his half court and right there was po by Carlos for sure interesting interesting is what you often say when you think they got it wrong I Ive sus that out about you I I tell you I tell you what these both these coaches going to have some good late game film to go over on the way home Starling was hammered second foul on venning good job by uh Starling searching out that contact right here searching his contact right here putting the pressure on the ref to make a call Smart play by him for one of these teams the film watch is going to be excruciating right and the outcome very much still hangs in the balance keep stand by Georgia Tech and Virginia fans well get you to jpj as soon as we can Georgia Tech bounc back after falling behind nine Zips now 98 another fascinating Saturday of ACC basketball All Around The League triple header day here on the CW Starling brings the orange back within one little offense defense substitution movich in lamin is Applause out full court pressure here coming from cuse BCs got to handle this pressure theyve struggled this second overtime hand can run the Baseline didnt doubled in the back court Beetle gets it back to hand under a minute to go in the second over time hand gives it up McFarland wasnt expecting the pass though he was fortunate to maintain possession possession now hand to pay missed it short Movic couldnt control the rebound it finds pain he cant score and its a jump ball it goes to BC via the possession arrow after cuse won the tip to start the second overtime P May might have could have taken out that rebound and and ran some clock I know you got a layup but uh the clock is your enemy right now if your BC now BC is going to take once again its final timeout lets lets just run through the madness BC 70 run to close regulation including that three from pay with one point two left Carlos three quarter Court heave could not connect and then at the end of the first overtime was tied Beetle turned it over Starling got a decent look that hes made in this gym many many times but not today and that led us to double overtime where BC jumped in front by seven and now over the last 70 seconds John hson Syracuse on a 60 run as we take another Glimpse at whats transpiring in Charlottesville Day Day Ames coming off his best game of the year for the Cavaliers got to get a stop if your Syracuse finish the play coach arri is telling his team to switch everything seems looks like its interchangeable Music all right 405 to go BC was fouled its actually not a bad foul 40 shooter stovic has got to get that early get out there earlier and and be in position that is a foul Payne has had some clutch shots today smooth stroke there BC by two 389 to go neither team has a timeout left John Yep this is going to come down right here to makeing free throws and finishing off a defensive possession if they get the rebound pay sinks them both Browns coming back in and hes replacing Beetle if youre BC no threes twos do not lose the game no threes Starling goes right at venning and scores off the window and well apparently I was mistaken apparently Syracuse does have a timeout left yes they do these coaches are uh theyre using mistake getting down hill vinning sitting back in the drop thats bad news when they got a guy like staring coming downhill well I know the folks are hoping that this game can end so they can get to their dinner plans or to Georgia Tech Virginia BC has never played a triple overtime game in its history Syracuse last went to Triple overtime on a night that everybody remembers at Madison Square when the orange and the Yukon Huskies went six overtimes in that classic 127 117 orange victory in the Big East tournament that was in 2009 16 years ago I remember where I was watching that game I I remember that game too that was a Legendary game the MSG right there the Old School Big East battle after falling behind N9 nothing and the yellow jackets have gotten back on track Damon Styers team you can never count them out theyll go to their Under 12 timeout with the jackets narrowly in front here its Boston College by one with 307 to go its interesting Brown is in the game not Beetle who Beetles been the primary ball handler against his pressure I wonder what the thinking in is at maybe free throws but tough double team and a great pass from McFarland to get it across and then hand fouled by Bell itll be two free throws for BC with 243 left inot good Patience by McFarland to go look through the double team a little size and get it to the uh best free throw shooter in ACC thats a really nice pass by McFarland surrounded by Defenders and the entire Syracuse Ben over there my goodness gracious Donald Han Jr enter today 45 of his last 47 at the line hes two for five I think that was my fault ever here today its not your fault John Henson its not your fault as I quote Robin Williams oh he missed he missed him both unbelievable truly Syracuse can retake the lead here with 15 seconds dou oot JJ Starling was fouled by venning 111 Applause remaining right here this is what you want match up your best offensive player Vinnies got to foul that if hes in a disadvantage you dont want to give him to make him make to which he hasnt done on a consistent basis today third foul on venning JJ five of eight at the line with his team down Music one we are tied for the ninth time JJ Starling looks to give us our 12th lead change of the day for the free throw substitution Davis back in Bell to the bench Eagles out of Applause timeouts what a wild day it has been we had 7 minutes left at 500 so there there were three minutes left of the game at 500 he missed it were still tied are we going going to Triple OT or can BC come up with a clutch game winner go hes got to go Donald Han junr stolen away Kyle cuff for the win from mid triple overtime Applause beckin do you have an inclination of whos going to win this game or do you have no clue well I judge it since Syracuse got off to a good start last time DC you know second lets go Syracuse for the good start this time Im little back to the whale Bell feeds Davis inside and he gets the bounce Kier Davis into double figures and the orange up by two Good Start they have no answer for him this second half Syracuse is going back to the whale and had it poked away and a reging fouls going on Carlos two free throws coming up for Donald hand Junior which may or may not be good news for BC yeah again if you just joined us Donald Han Jr the number one free throw shooter in the league for the season 101 for 111 coming into the day and hes gone two for six here at the Dome now Its Tricky shooting at the dome but thats still stunning oh my goodness and he cant believe it and hes in his own head right now basketball is a is a funny sport Evan sometimes you have games like this just and hes literally missed more free throws today in the last two months combined maybe two years to make it a onepoint Kan wow he touched every part of the rim and got it to Applause go orange by one with the ball as we bring you the two box jackets by three at jpj in Charlottesville in front of us here in Syracuse Jer Davis ridiculous Fade Away J you got to keep feeding the Beast right there they have no answer for him well see if Boston Carlos has an answer Carlos with great ball pressure right here making life tough for beetle is deflected it hit the official it went out of bounds and its BC ball Carlos is laughing a little little bit cuz he know he hit it off right here its a tough move right here Fade to the Baseline but when youre feeling it like he is the basket looks wide suddenly Jer Davis with 16 points the season high as 22 back in the season opener P gets downhill too strong though loose ball finds hand he lost it and its Syracuse ball Applause Syracuse has four the first five points to begin the third overtime good job from the for pushing him out making it a little tougher for him Davis calling for it posting up at the threepoint line paac is up going right at McFarland shoots over him and missed it and BC secures the rebound seven boards for hand to go with 28 points to lead Applause BC Donald H junr long two wont go Carlos pulls down the Applause rebound most of the fans here at the Dome on their feet it has been a wild 52 and2 minutes and Syracuse extends the lead courtesy at JJ Starin strong move to the inside hand that thats a tough move to handle BC has no answer defensively right now theyve got to do something quickly on the offensive side JJ has now got 28 matching hands output and BC turns it over nice hesi right here Frieza Defender just a tough pass good job by caros making the pass more difficult for Applause Vinnie 16 turnovers now for BC just 12 for Syracuse got to get it to J Davis right here if you can or Starling pick your poison at this point nine to shoot Starling had it poked away into the back cour get it four in the shot clock Starling to the basket Lin kcks the rebound to himself and then McFarland smacks it away and BC comes away with it what good hands by McFarland its the second time hes done that tonight Earl Grant directing traffic in front of the BC bench McFarland back RS the three and Bells got the rebound Syracuse can slow it down with a fivepoint lead and 120 left we talked about mental toughness Boston College is settling right now and Syracuse is not theyre getting to the rim theyre Applause attacking paly on venning I think now they gave it to Payne its his third personal it was away from the ball and two shots for Applause Carlos now theyre going to send lampin to the line yeah cuz lamin is the one that was fouled maybe that was a kind of hacka Shack situation get him on the line since down five with a minute left Eddie at the line is one for four dont know if it was intentional but does youre right seem like a smart foul despite Lin stepping up and confidently draining it Applause the action continues in Charlottesville really looking forward to that game and seeing who can get the win and keep their momentum going Tom wormy and the Gman probably a little annoyed that the action at Tom zamad has taken this long and theyre going to review who this one out of bounds off of mcfan doesnt look too sure that it was off Syracuse might be a case where he hits the ball and it comes off his hands last previous players under review for out of bounds lets take another look after the 13th missed free throw of the day for Syracuse that looks like it is off of McFarland Music a reminder of the importance of this game certainly for Boston College also for Syracuse trying to widen the gap between that line of demarcation top 15 get to play at the ACC tournament the little dance you never know what can happen after what we saw last year Michael oconnell shot against Virginia and just a miraculous run five wins in five days for Kevin keatss team meanwhile Isaac mcney leading the way for the Wahoos with 10 so far today Duncan Powell has 10 points for Georgia Tech 25 all from Music jpj Georgia Tech got back into the game with a three ball there four of six Beyond The Arc McNeely hit a couple early threes but hasnt been able to cash in since I feel like Kevin Harin the final week of the NFL season John when hes doing play byplay of two games at a call on the floor stands it is Boston College basketball theyre going to keep it with BC call stands one more look for you woo its tough maybe it wasnt inconclusive enough in the NBA you would hear the term proximate foul right thats not a term in college basketball but these officials watch NBA games too just like we do definitely do all right if youre BC do do you want to attack the three here or do you just need points need points you got to score fast if youre Syracuse no threes Applause still ising Beatles on the bench man under a minute in the third overtime pain the reason why were here cuz he hit the three to tie at the end of regulation too strong on the drive and now Syracuse with 504 to go is made free throws away from surviving and closing out this hardfought ACC win but nothing settled yet obviously cuz the free throws today have been far from a Applause certainty Virginia just drained its fourth three moments ago it was McNeely hitting his third of the game meanwhile the Syracuse free throw struggles continue to plague the orange i Ive seen a lot of basketball in my I dont know if Ive seen this many free throws missed in the game in a long time they missed 14 theyve made 16 now a three possession game with under a minute McFarland gives it to pay hell take it rebound Starling to Bell in the back court BC needs to foul otherwise its over and it might be over anyway my goodness remember when s was down seven in double overtime this is this is a game of runs and crucial crucial mistakes it was 8376 in the Midway point of the second OT obviously since then it has been pretty much all orange back and forth first half in Charlottesville with Virginia currently up one two for two at the line there for Bell its a 193 run for Syracuse spanning the overtime theyve out scored BC 101 in the third o and that is going to be enough you said it John the first to get to 10 in an overtime period would do it and the Syracuse Orange despite to work and extra 15 minutes are going to taste victory at the Dome once again final score in triple o 9586 the orange prevail Applause
