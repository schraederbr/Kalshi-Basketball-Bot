in fact Cs gone with the same lineup he went with Saturday to start in State Farm Arena Louisville responded without JJ trainer and Dennis Evans again in the lineup tonight the cards are with their line for the second straight ball game and heres the cats and the rookie Wagner the gr transfer is Mitchell and this is Bradshaw whos been terrific as of late can you stay in front of Kentucky for 40 minutes that is the question for the team in red Rees on the drive defended in Huntley Hatfield the deflection and here are the cards and the Freshman from Brooklyn Tyler Johnson West Louisville is a downhill driving team their strength is getting to the foul line Kentucky cannot foul in this ball game Huntley Hatfield momentum good momentum for Kenny pay right now and a great way to start the game by hammering the thing inside going right at Applause Bradshaw DJ Wagner averaging 12 and a half points six assists in his last two early ball screen action Louisville impacting that ball not letting Kentucky turn the corner with ease Edwards and heres Wagner with seven to shoot lost it in traffic to Johnson downhill they go Johnson draws the foul the depth favors Kentucky Kentucky wants to play in an 80 to 85 possession game and Kenny pay knows it if youre Kenny pay youve told your guys weve got to drive it get to the foul line allow our legs to to rest a little bit at the free throw line once they get to the bonus but a good start for the cards Sky Clarks Illinois transfer leads him in scoring at 15 and a half Johnson a three and thats blocked out of bounds by Trey Applause Mitchell John cerry told his team today Jimmy do not let them start downhill with the basketball and thats whats happened on two tries while Louisville comes in making what five threes a game at 28 youve got to guard these guys off the bounds if youre Kentucky seven to shoot here is Johnson trying to take Reeves into traffic Huntley Hatfield had it stripped out of there and Mitchell collects but Johnson is getting into that pain early with ease for Louisville heres the senior Reeves three ball from Edwards Mike James and now heres Clark again Johnson oh my behind the back kick into the corner for a James three and so far to me its all about the ability of Tyler Johnson to inside that Kentucky defense four in red has speed right now thats causing the cats problems early Edwards tough shot and Huntley Hatfield had a crack at it I believe last Touch by the cats thats not good offense by Kentucky after Johnson once again bites off that red part of the floor and thats an easy dial up for Mike James out of the corner his 13th threepoint make of the Year Kenny pay talked to us before the game threes are better for his team right now in math I wasnt a math major but Im pretty sure it is unforced a in the front court for the cards first turnover caliper goes to the bench Reed Sheard has come into the ball game The Freshman from London Kentucky and the Uber athlete is Rob Dillingham zero in the blue for Kentucky and the guard productivity for Kentucky just went up a level with Shephard and Dillingham checking in the ball is the best shooter in all of college basketball Shephard on the drive defended well again Hunley Hadfield another rebound look ahead for Tyler Johnson challenges and had it blocked out of bounds by Bradshaw Bradshaw blocked the ball and he also blocked Johnson I mean a ton of contact I know the play of verticality is what the officials are looking at the four to me right there gets smoked and no foul call but the aggressive fight for Louis impressive the first three minutes White had it knocked away catch Titan the screws defensively Rees in transition throws it up on the glass and a foul on Louisville and Kenny pay asked Lee Cassel right away what about down at the other end hes not happy at all with the Miss call after white picks up the foul in transition for Louisville I was confident coming in that you would see a massive massive effort from Louisville tonight now theyve been close theyve lost a lot of games in that 8 to 10o range a heartbreaker to Texas early on a lean back fed Asus but this game means way more than any game that these two teams have been in so far this year Dillingham heres Reeves quickly to Shephard 11 to shoot Clark rubbing through thech screen stuck with it in traffic Dillingham a three white the backside rebound and now weve got it looked like James and Mitchell underneath the basket up near the St here and Ron gr has called Mike James for the foul his first second on theill I do not mind the foul by Mike James comes rushing in youve got to set the rules and say were going to be the aggressor in this game youre the underdog You knocked around in college basketball the last year and a month and youve got to answer early how youre going to play Dillingham a miss and a foul called on Clark a fly by got Dillan on the wrist di Clark itll be his first third on the cards and here goes Dillingham to the line to try and get Kentucky on the board Jimmy in the first three and a half minutes here Rob Dillingham is a special special talent and hes a kid thats hard to guard w because he is an absolute effortless shot maker it comes easy for him squeezing those things off I love the fact that hes risky and fast with the ball and a little bit careless at times but hes dialed it back under Cal and he has that Coach Cal confident Swagger that Cals best guards have always had those three things to me make him very hard to guard yep terrific freshman and hes got the cats on the board here hes averaged 17 points and 40 from the floor in his last couple of games B two of the three here is Johnson into the front court against shepher on the drive Johnson tried to scoop it out of there Mitchell got a piece of it heres Kentucky off a Louisville turnover and a three ball from Rees and not a good Rim decision by Tyler Johnson in Kentucky they are so good and so fast run to the Deep corner and transition for those bombs in conversion offense five in a row by UK Johnson tried to get it to Hunley Hatfield nice catch and score by the Tennessee transfer when Huntley Hatfield is active hes going to set 20 to 25 ball screens per game so far hes tracking that Applause number Dillingham crosses over James spins and scores thats what Im talking about that a risky move with the ball f risky move he has under control so difficult to stay in front of zero in Johnson again on the attack step back on Shephard lilles getting good shots Jimmy and what did Cal also tell our guys do not be surprised if Louisville doesnt hang with us the first seven or eight minutes the fight the passion everything theyre going to bring we got to hang in there and now Kentucky already up two with five minutes Burn yeah four in a row for Dillingham followed by five in a row for Rees thats the cats nine here and theyve got the lead for the first time and the ballot SC of Kentucky six guys in double figures hard to guard individuals hard to guard as a group nine to shoot Huntley Hatfield on the drive and it rolls in W all five guys are just hooping a little bit for Louisville trying to play in space not afraid to let their five attack kuy five off the Applause bounds Mitchell backing down James and scores he is such a good player and its a good sign for Kentucky Bradshaw and Mitchell playing together in an 80 possession game against North Carolina playing heavy minutes not having to slow down with Bradshaw now on the floor Scott Clark shoots and hits 16th three of the year for Clark yeah just a 27 threepoint shooter Kenny P told us they have practice this week in scrimmages only taking threes trying to increase the confidence in the numbers of that threepoint shot Mitchell the Miss Bradshaw the backside rebound missed the stick back got a third cck at it and threw it away to Rees wow time out in Louisville Battle of the brw grass is on tonight whats up guys ciam here with the Louisville cinal were coming down his face I said Mr Bill are you okay he looked just straight ahead and said were playing Louisville today son were playing Louisville I knew then as a 27y old assistant this game was different and it is and it always will be they started 1913 in Lexington Kentucky won 3410 Louisville lost the first four meetings in the series of course they played a year ago at Rough cats won by 23 Mitch three ball at the front puts Kentucky back in the lead that is the danger you and you dont s back quick enough Tre Mitchell just pops out for an open three the arrow has come on the floor for the cats heres Huntley Hatfield and a jump ball itll stay with the cards he got tied up with Mitchell did Brandon Huntley field remember Huntley Hatfield 13 starts in Tennessee as a freshman and he has to prod in this game and going forward for Louisville and be a force he was a top 50 kid out of high school I like the fact that Kenny pay has called his number early yeah felt like his confidence has come back a year ago thought he played as if he was still trying to build back from his transfer heres Clark wheeling and dealing in traffic and draws the foul so Clark will get a couple of free throws after Wagner second foul and the second on the cats dont forget we got good college basketball for you tomorrow night 900 out at paie Pavilion Marylands straight theyll meet UCLA The Rook guard Sebastian J young for the TPS aaging almost 18 Maryland lost all four of their Road games theyll try and correct that tomorrow night in Westwood UCLA Notre Dame and Louisville the three youngest teams in college ball this year in terms of divion one experience and this kid on the free throw line sky Clark he has taken 43 shots off the bounds and 57 layups 100 141 attempts are off the balance and Kentucky has got to stay in front of not only Johnson but 55 in red as well 81 free throw shooter missed them both Shephard there it is again and Mitchell left for the three bounced out Curtis Williams on the floor The Freshman from Detroit W thats a big gam switch like that and not switch back and youre leaving a Kentucky team that makes 10 threes per game with one of their better Shooters wide open Clark oh split the screen in the corner Trey white a three thatll Bound Away sheer tries to get the cats in transition and this is Edwards and he bowls over Clark and an offensive foul on the Freshman Justin Edwards yeah Edwards had his mind made up at the Timeline he was going to get all the way to the rack and Ive heard people you take a charge in college basketball that is a false statement because you can you get those feet set before that plant put hits the ground a fast play and a right call and a good defensive play by Louisville you see Edwards go to calip Perrys bench here so they got Fiero Reeves Shephard Mitchell and Dillingham on the floor now for UK Glenn to White here is Williams averaging just four points but coming off a season 16 in the win against pepperd T to shoot Hunley half field into traffic with a right hand and scores they swarm him but they didnt swarm him quick enough he got that shot off through three white jerseys you want to stay in a ball game when the underdog you pound that thing inside like Louisville has so far to Huntley Hatfield Dillingham Applause out Clark wanted to screen shake and foul by Dillingham losing their discipline Kentucky a couple of times early lis te right now as he going to get a breather but I mean thats a terrific start perfect from the field setting the tone setting the rules of how Louisville wants to play this game really well done hes a former top top 50 kid out of high school like theres Talent on this Louisville roster that is not equated to the number of wins that they should and down talking with Danny Off the Bench also with some of the other cards down at that end of the floor and meanwhile here is Clark who missed two free throws earlier and hell drop in the first there and West two my point about Louisvilles Talent sky Clark chose Illinois over the likes of Kentucky coming out of high school so that tells you this kid here now hes another top 50 kid at the high school ranks set up the second semester at before the transfer but he is capable and where is 55 because of Jason Williams if he handles it like Jason Williams hes going to be in good shape but right now hes only one of five at the line and hes 81 heres Reeves quickly in transition a COR for blocked it but its called go tending by Lee Cassel now you see Kentucky though they are Off to the Races in their conversion offense I believe Kentucky wants to into the legs of Louisville Louisville does not have the depth still without two key guys JJ trainer and Dennis Evans so Kennys bench is a lot shorter than CS heres white Nice Shot off the screen theyre getting good looks Jimmy and thats what Kenny B said we got to get good looks absolutely just simple pin down action right into a 15ot Applause pullup hug on yeno has also come on the floor for the cats for the first time he wears 33 and heres the arrow a three wow third triple of the year for ad do and he is typically a drive the ball on the catch kid 25 on the year but he is a major player for Kentucky get one rebound every four minutes just full of energy trying to answer at the other end Williams triple goes bouncing away here comes out Kentucky Run game y Shephard the arrow and look at Reef slide through traffic got the runner to fall and very quietly Antonio Reeds has got nine to lead all scores interesting then Antonio Reeves was actually recruited back to Kentucky for his last year by this years freshman class in a in a group text saying you are the missing piece for us to do something special and his ability to make a three in the runners in the layup game terrific balance out of 12 in white largest lead of the ball game for Kentucky heres Clark and a foul by Reeds I say why but why Kentucky continues to lose their feet on the defensive end and that Runner by Antonio Reeves he shoots it as well as anybody Ive seen this year in college basketball and hes all of 66 Kentucky moves that ball around has a four round one set with anino on the inside they run a lot of five out as well I just think Kentucky they theyve got that look again and they beat a really good North Carolina team last Saturday North Carolina okahoma off the unbitten the unbeaten list last night heres Clark first of two and hes one of six now at the line and were talking about an 81 free throw shooter so Scott Clark got to hit the t shot in the Fairway here for Kenny pay you just put it in my terms my man get the threewood out no more driver there you go just stay with the threewood the rest of the game Sky youre fine threepoint game and a little pressure offered now by the Cs yeah Louisvilles good with high hands in their press but this is a hard team to press Kentucky Reeves it rattles around and drops in because of that they got too many shooters I think to extend your defense let shoters get loose on the backend I dont like that Louisville press in this ball game Chicago senior now with a dozen leading score for Kentuck fourth best in the SEC coming in is Antonio Reeds Williams think Shephard might have got a piece of it Huntley Hatfield shot clock did not reset five for Clark downhill he goes and turns it over Edwards tries to beat white to the rack and Trey white will pay for it with his second foul yeah hope is not a plan Im telling you you drive that ball Baseline hoping that someone is at the front of the rim for Louisville on their offensive end turnover waiting to happen thats what Im talking drive it thats that team speed of Kentucky is as good as Ive seen in a long long time Ty Johnson so Tyler Johnson is returned there for the cards kuys biggest advantage of six and the foul was before the shot by Edwards so no free throws for the Philadelphia freshman and aine inbounds opportunity for shepher Edwards he got the two anyway yeah really good action to get him running to his right shoulders you can catch it right into the left shot simple out of bounds play the Louisville just didnt have the fight factor to get over that screen first basket of the ball game for Justin Edwards into the corner James a three Hunley Hatfield couldnt get to it eightpoint lead for Kentucky with 845 to go danger zone for Louisville right now Shephard and one this kid is so good because he does so many things he understands first of all how important that Kentucky Jersey is with his mom and dad both Kentucky alums but he is a special special not only talent but how he goes about his game and why he is hard to guard is look at these things right here hes a 57 59 93 guy those are his percentages from the two from the three and from the free throw line he has a knock to get open and his IQ West is his speed hes not the the fastest guy on that Kentucky lineup just Lane to Lane and and I look at him how how hard he comes off the screens hows that basketball the size that he plays with now hes the real deal if you put him on an NBA team with a star and spacing that floor look at James the hard drive knocked around Dillingham the rebound its an eight nothing run for Kentucky theyve hit their last six on the floor make it seven and now Louisville cant stay in front of the basketball man that conversion offense from defense to the offensive end Kentucky and the big BL Rises up in the Young Applause Center I love that se this year but only Coach Cal would be digging through a pilot Costco maybe on a game day Im not sure but thats thats some good stuff right there here is Johnson five to shoot Williams in a bit of a trap against Dillingham Fall Away got it yeah youre going to have to have some of those hanging game you dont want to take hard guarded shots certainly helps if you can make a couple Kentucky on a 10 they hit seven in a row prior to the Cardinal make there that Kentucky bench with 12 points already in this game Louisville with none Reeves inside Brad Shaw on the perimeter for Theo and a second chance Dillingham made the save last tou I Believe by Tyler Johnson you said danger zone the Williams bucket certainly helps Louisville but you got to go back to what you were doing earlier defensively in terms of your hands and guarding Jimmy yeah youve got to get some stops because Kentucky right now tracking you know well over 40 points in the first half I dont think Louisville has that much offense to hang iname gets in the 880s or higher third chance at The Possession Reeves with the right hand hes so good man hes such a tough cover you get focused in on the talent that jumps off in that freshman class and forget about Reeves whos their leading score 17 a game 14 now for Reeves on his six field goal hes six of seven from the floor in this first half of the cats and were going to get a foul on Dillingham which is his second Wagner already has two and six on Kentucky the ability of re to hit those Runners and really tough guarded twos is very impressive weve seen him be a lightning rod as a score he went for over 30 on the road to Arkansas grown West on the offensive end he can do it all from every spot on the floor Johnson looking for an entry point heres white with Edwards defending back to Johnson Huntley Hatfield off the Baseline he stays perfect Jimmys got 10 well hes made nice plays out of the dunker spot and hes settled in right there knowing that Bradshaw is going to be attracted to the ball at The Rim hes had two straight double doubles has Huntley Hatfield hes in double figures scoring in this first half three ball there from Mitchell and people said that the game of basketball has passed coach caliper by thats a Nar created by guys that have never coached and never played the game because Kentucky right now averaging 25 26 threepoint attempts per game and he plays to his talent his talent has hes got skilled guys this year Cal Perrys got his Swagger back as well and it all starts with that guy everyone talks about I want a players driven team I dont I want the head coach to drive the Vibe and you look at the best ones out there I was with Kelvin Samson last Saturday his team starts with best teams alwaysed B linei atennessee those the guys set that tone every day end of a one and one for Johnson is good well and Kentucky is ascending if Louisville is going to build anything momentum wise its going to have to be with this kid at the point it is because his speed can match Kentucky speed heres this press again that Im not in love with it may change as the game goes on Kentucky just smacks it they get the numbers right off the bat under six to go in this first half a handful of possessions by Louisville so far this year Mitchell left it on the front of the rim and Huntley Hadfield another rebound cards with the ball at home down 12 and Clark gets the bounce just hooping lilles just hooping on the offensive end as much as anything they got some Sprint up ball screen actions going on but Kenny pay turn his talent loose to see if they can hang in this game sep a deep three long rebound for Johnson and a foul call Lee Cassell on the Baseline I think Trey white if so itll be his third not a lot of contact by white but enough to knock Bradshaw out of the play coming tonight West Louisville has only played 10 possessions of Zone and they go to it because they see the same I do having trouble staying front of theall that man is a gamble the way Kentucky shoots this thing so Whites on the bench first player in the ball game with three Wildcats have a pair of players with two Wagner and Dillingham five to shoot for Shephard squares and hits he does not get rushed and did not feel the pressure of the shot clock ticken down in his head man that kids good there will be a lot of puppies and kids named Reed over the next n or 10 months in the blueg grass State I promise heres James in traffic blocked but fouled all the way up well you wonder if Reed Shepard before he was born they were telling him stories about UK UFL yeah absolutely they were and I mean Ive been so impressed this kid came in not the most heralded of that freshman class but he has shot up the charts and everybody eyes and rightfully so his shooting numbers hes number one in the nation when you factor in your true shooting percentage which factors in the free throw stripe as well fourth point of the half for Mike James and Jimmy the thing about it is your dad was the most outstanding player of a final four a terrific player your mom was a terrific player I mean its a story book playing out in front of us and the value of Kentucky kids that put on that Kentucky Jersey you you cannot overstate I remember Rex Chapman when I was coaching the Kentucky when he put that thing on it just meant more the richy farmers the Darren Feld houses that have been out there theres something different about those Kentucky kids Cameron Mills right yeah keep on going yeah those guys dads were stars here is James off the turnover and Huntley Hatfield he has been really really good the best Ive seen this year Huntley Hatfield and he has outworked kuys bigs on two or three occasions youre going to run with Kentucky you better make sure you finish on the other end and Louisville they were up against the Rope now theyre back off Applause thats Applause Curtis Willams the Music Music Applause B basketb Applause go Applause Applause first Applause number Music on Applause sh Music Applause e Music Music Applause one Music number Music Kentucky e Applause let Applause thats not this is supped to be when Kentucky plays lville lville comes withal titles or two depends on what you look at from the NCAA but this is one of the top brands in college basketball and they are not supposed to be down 20 at the half to their arch rival Wagner was troubled with fouls only played three and a half minutes in the first frame hes back out there here is Mitchell and now the Freshman DJ Wagner hell gun for three back rim Miss and Mitchell touched it hit a took a hard fall I think theyre going to get skot Clark here for the heavy out yeah when DJ Wagner when he chose Kentucky Over Louisville he kind of got a little bit of a peak about how this Louisville program was going to get off to a start under Kenny pay you consider this grandfather is part of that Louisville staff and Louisville couldnt re him in and then Louisville also lost a key festar guy this year that was on campus for a couple of weeks before he transferred out talking about flowers right yeah yeah those the kind of talents you have to have this Louisville brand here is white he struggled in the first half as well only a couple points and 12 minutes of action but he had three first half fouls as well six to shoot heres James trying to beat Mitchell on the drive couldnt and knocked out of bounds last Touch by Edwards good job by Mitchell to he was on the of the off by Louisville but stayed off of him contact wise if Kentucky can guard the ball in the second half theyre in great shape Clark with one to shoot front rim miss the three here is DJ Wagner dad played for caliper at Memphis grandfather was a member of the 86 National Championship team in Dallas Reeves all the way through hell draw the foul and then Johnson slapped it after the ball got away just slapped it to the bench and out of frustration I think more than anything else against Tyler Johnson y there it is so Johnson draws another foul here a common foul on this a lot of frustration within this Louisville program and that a frustration swing at the ball by Tyler Johnson so theres a foul on Johnson and then the common foul thats two fouls so really Johnson has picked up two fouls which give him four in the ball game on the same play you look at Antonio Reed why he so hard to guard his distribution of his shots W is about as good as youll see from a big guard in college basketball hes distribution of jump shots Runners and layups hes all right on tack hes all of hes all of 66 but 74 jump shots coming in 20 Runners that hes attempted in 26 layups thats really good balance for a half court offense from a big guard hes all of6 and very rely rushed as Antonio Reeves this year in his fth year fifth game of 20 or more here tonight Jimmy hes also matched his season high of 24 that he had in the ball game with Kansas and now a chance to even push it higher both his total and the Wildcats total by the way he exted his consective games with a three Mark to 22 tonight senior from Chicago started originally in Illinois State ironically that is who Kentucky will play on the 29th a week from tomorrow after their holiday break and calip Perry said you guys dont want to see me and I dont want to see you all earlier today heres James inside and fouled hell have a chance I think Bradshaw has picked up another foul and for all of Aaron Bradshaws good work the last two games in wins against pen and Carolina its been a tough night for big number two out of raway New Jersey yeah it has I mean the physical plays have bothered Bradshaw in this game I thought he held up I know he did really well against Bott and was actually more physical than Armond Bott when he went up against a North Carolina star over the weekend but you got to remember this just what his third game hes just he just getting his feet underneath him but he is a special talent and what I love about Kentucky when hes on the floor the doesnt drop the five out is still in play back in good for James he has eight and what happened in the first half when Louisville extended the Press is Kentucky found open threes look at Wagner tried to leave it for Bradshaw who caught it but traveled first no foul on the de Ron Grover tickets James with his second its the fourth on the Phill here in the second half and Dean Wagner is as good as we have in the freshman class at doing that right there his ability to play low through contact and what a sweet kid Dewan Wagner is you and I were standing in the Starbucks line with him today just hes the kind of guy you just want to hang around you become a better person it feels like just talking to him right yeah very enjoyable visit it was fun to catch up with him about you know finishing that first semester and kind of where things are heres white a little bit of a lean in tough shot there and heres Kentucky with DJ Wagner pushing you say tough I say bad tap follow they give it to Justin Edwards with a tough bad shot its a turnover the kuys just going to run right up your backside if not out in front of you its a 26 point game now Clark scooping score nine for Clark and almost three minutes into this second half the cats have just Contin to roll here they just zoned by Louisville again they came in having only played 10 possessions and its just so easy throw the ball to a playmaker Mitchell whos second on the team and assist and then Bradshaw so good out that dunker spot first basket for Bradshaw had average 14 and a half and seven rebounds in the last two coming in on the drive and it rolls out were going to get free throws coming Mike James will go to the line dont forget New Years Eve womens basketb quadruple header on the ACC Network starts at noon Eastern Brook W takes number 21 Florida State against W forest and then Notre Dame Syracuse two presented by food line and then theres Jeff walls number theyll meet Kat Myers Miami team and then state with West and Virginia down a busy New Years Eve of womens basketball on acc Network in the ESPN app speaking of Jeff W he just texted me he said hes sorry missed the game hes out recruiting and in the world of the portal how much college basketball has changed but his team what 11 and two right now send all his kids home for Christmas break as well he is his his young ladies are always right in the middle of that fight in March terrific coach has done a terrific job here on the drive Brad finds wag hang from 15 and Dono yovic hes on the floor for the seventh time this year wearing 13 for Music Louisville who Trails by 24 James and couldnt get the roll and here go the cats again ahead for Bradshaw couldnt flag it down itll go to the Cs Kentucky a little bit sloppy in this second half and this the Kentucky team with so much growth ahead of it gets sloppy and C goes right to his bench not even four minutes in Shephard and Dillingham checking in here comes Rob Dillingham another guy that was handcuffed in the first half fou trouble so to me this Kentucky freshman class is right there with the ones that set the bar for Kentucky when they made their run to the Elite 8 and their National Championship team I I think they are that good and they have that much growth in front of them and that gives Kents Big Blue Nation a lot of Hope heading into SEC play in January rebound finally controlled by Mitchell looked like Caleb Glen had a shot at it instead it belongs to Dillingham quick into the corner for Mitchell and James and the cards clear Dillingham gamble Clark wins Huntley Hatfield another classy jumper off the Baseline for Hunley Hatfield yeah hes the one guy that has caused problems for Kentucky really good at that short Corner 12 foot making plays out of it knocking down jump shots Dillingham couldnt finish terrific move Mo heres Clark so you can come off of Hatfield when he sets that ball screen hes not a shot threat from the perimeter oh carving him up a little yanovich the Miami transfer he has that in this years Freshman Class yanovich by the way Jimmy made his first free throw right there after hitting his first field goal career night ah kind of he only played one game at Miami a year ago before he red shirted he spent a lot of time injured and thats an offensive foul on Theo thirdd four arrow beg you pardon on Kentucky first on hadu Louisvilles been in a lot of ball games this year eight npoint games the two most disappointing games to me they did not show up against depal or Arkansas State thats when the talk really started getting turned up in this part of the state of Kentucky about Kenny Payne heres a drive from Dillingham into the corner for Wagners three and Huntley Hadfield a backside rebound heres Clark ahead for Glenn against the arrow boy couldnt finish it and it is as Will Chamberlain used to call it its in the office tonight down low here goes Dillingham off the window I talked about the riskiness that he plays with that was a risky shot man he is effortless as a shot maker just special stuff out of Dillingham Clark a two ball Jimmy theres no question to Paul and Arkansas state are kind of the bottom of it yeah but we were talking with Kenny pay earlier if you dont have any confidence when you lose the close fit to Texas then you lose the next day to Indiana you mentally you got to rebuild as much as what youre doing physically dont you you do yes and no one understands Lille basketball more than Kenny pay yeah and when he was hired youre bringing in a former player on the national championship team a 10year terrific run as the right hand guy to Cal at Kentucky with all those great recruiting classes coming in get him out of the NBA and he understands he understands the pressure of this job and where they are and where they need to be yeah and right now theyre theyre theyre not close I said it earlier Louisville used to strike fear when they stepped on the floor and its been a long time since this Louisville program has struck fear into anybody shepher inside heres Dillingham oh his versatility you just invert your offense and post up your guard he is stronger than he looks hes got eight in the ball game four in this second half the lead is 19 Clark on the drive ripped out of there James for Caleb Glenn hard drive into traffic Glenn hit the deck here come the cats spot up for Dillingham look out look out four in a row for the Freshman from Hickory North Music Carolina he is the guy that you fear on film when you break Kentucky down on Synergy you turn the sound down and just watch and you think oh my we have our hands full with zero in White watching on film the SEC was teams in the net top 40 ACC comes in tonight I believe with five but that Kentucky isi Tennessee is Old Kentucky I believe one through 10 is probably a little more talented and Auburn although they lack a guaranteed Pro man are they good only top theyre the only team in the and the ACC in the top 20 both offense and defensive efficiency are the Auburn Tigers they are the real deal Ono defending Hadfield who turned it over the college football season more than that guy remember he was benched and ability to extend plays and I saw him last year at Arkansas when right Ry young got hurt and that guy in the open field is like LeBron James bringing it in transition big guy I tell you this I would not count out either SAR or kin dor in the Sugar Bowl either one toet whoever between Alabama and Michigan you talk the Blue Bloods of college football what a pass theres a great look Ono had it blocked that is Emanuel aor for the game is 19 with almost 9 Minutes gone second half here W I look at Kentucky and I look how young they are and you think about it only two of the past 20 teams that made it to the final four started a freshman at the point guard spot and thats what kuys rolling with yeah and but these freshman are not the typical freshman it can be done its not easy a lot of growth ahead of these Kentucky guards the last National Champion to start a true freshman was Kei Clark for Virginia 2019 jayen sugs got his team to the title game in 21 Mitchell of three a COR for tried to capture it instead it bouns away for Williams lead still 21 for UK theres Williams little pull up that rattles out Jimmy you gave me a stat earlier oh wait a second now you got to pause when dillinghams in transition Trey white out of there I dont think Cal is pleased with the decisions by Dillingham the last couple minutes heres sheph for Reeves they like that decision James the foul Antonio Reeves continues to have night for the wild prot those Airborne guys on the offensive end and that shove right there Reeves has to hold onto that rim to keep from coming down in a bad spot you told me earlier today that told you a lot today where you going here 2004 worries me 2004 was the start of a streak that if a team was not 12th or higher in week six of the AP poll they didnt their National Champion comes from that list of teams so if you go back and look at last weeks AP poll the top 12 history tells us right now since 2004 your National Champion is coming out of that group of 12 now Kentucky was not in that group last week they were just outside of it theyre inside of it now so theyll have to break that Trend but capable of doing it Purdue is terrific Arizonas terrific Yukon Marquette kza a lot of good ones but this Kentucky team is going to be right there with the best of them I think when we get to March well theyre showing their and then the cats unforced error a COR for got the dunk and now they step over the line on the inbounds pass and Pat Adams promptly calls for the turnover to belond to Louisville well Kentucky cant go on Christmas break yet and Cs going to give his guys four days off but they still have 10 minutes to finish in this game playing the game the right way and Ron gr getting a little uh trying to get the game management set here so its a clock issue they theyll team to the and Kenny p and John caliper will hdle with their two teams Jimmy you mentioned Kentucky ninth in the country this is their first road game of the year uh they won their last three a season ago when they went six and four on the road theyre going to play Illinois State a week from Friday theyre going to open SEC play at Florida andat the in charlot Louisville scenario a little play with that momentum were talking about Louisville opens at Virginia theyve already played one road game at Virginia Tech theyre 0 and one in the ACC in that early December game theyre going to play at Virginia thats their next game after tonight was it a 10 11 day break 1 13 Fall Away white and one Jordan Burks into the lineup for the wild cats for the first time and Trey white makes him pay for his first Kentucky has lost their Ed just a little B I know theyre still up 20 but one thing bur does have is a Mot that is nonstop I feel bad for his mom growing up because Im sure this kid was all over the place but thats also whats going to make Burks a good player one of these days but again you lose your discipline your balance and lung it a shooter heres white the sophomore transfer from Southern Cal from Dallas and he gets the threepoint trip 19o lead here for Kentucky with Wagner Dillingham Edwards Reeves and Bradshaw on the deck for Coach caliper Edwards into traffic with the left hand and a COR for fouled by Aaron Bradshaw thats his fourth Edwards is the one guy that to me has not found his proo yet there was talk about Edward coming into the season that he was in position to be the number one overall and thats certainly not the level hes played up to strength and his stroke will be the determining factors of his future he needs to put on strength and that stroke 25 man thats thats tough when you think about the next level heres white with Reeves defending a COR for has given Coach pay some nice minutes here through traffic Emanuel slipped it by white but out of the corner Johnson strong with a three Wagner and the cats with Reeves at the back end rattled out just his second Miss from the floor and Edwards follows and thats what Edward needs to be he needs to be a phenomenal Defender a glass eater and a guy that just makes plays around that rim and Clark will be fouled by Mitchell on the way up second on Mitchell that is seven on Kentucky with 847 to play West the discipline that Kentucky runs to in those deep corners and conversion off its really really impressive and you get what you demand as a coach and Cal from the opening practice when I was back there for the Kentucky pro day he kept talking about how weve got to win the race the corner and then we play from there his kids are really really good at couple of free throws for sky Clark his dad Kenny was a veteran NFL wide receiver and he was a must guy out of Illinois Kenny P one of my favorite things about this kid to his favorite music artists Bob Marley and Frank Sinatra I like I a lot of ground between Bob Marley and Frank Sinatra but he likes them both and makes it work for him still cant believe Jack har didnt make it tonight dont let it ruin your Christmas the game was important but meeting Jack har was secondary yeah out of bounds itll stay with the cats dont let it dont let it impact the rest of the could no it could yeah calip Perry there he is John by the way tonight with a win would have 396 in Kentucky 841 in his career hes had 28 of his 31 years his teams have won 20 or more 11 years theyve won or more that is an amazing St hes on top of his game once again as the Kentucky head coach and the Swagger that his young team played with last Saturday think about it those Kentucky freshman West they scored 18 of the final of 20 points for Kentucky in a big boy game against North Carolina yeah and Cal knows hes got a group thats capable of getting that championship for Kentucky not saying theyre the favorites but they will be in the conversation heres re on the drive blocked from behind white and with eight and a half to go Johnson and Louisville trying to find something here offensively Louisville shooting under 39 in the second half the D Ks in ability to choke off that drive and allow that 45 de cut with ease and Edwards squeezes in they are really fast at 94t everyone that c puts on the floor can really really run Brad Shaw Ono actually runs better than Brad Shaw Hunley Hatfield and heres Tyler Johnson threw it away Clark will run it down thats over and back and that will get us to a resume in college basketball right nows to Purdue and Rick Barnes has seen some offensive rebound hes had some good himself yes he has Dillingham right back for Edwards three ball thats really good Action Man Kentucky comes out that timeout they get three or four touches with a little bit that dribble Drive action and Edward just stops from behind it pretty good stroke for 25 shoo absolutely first three of the night for Edwards e of the year for Wagner deflected Clark 22point lead for the cats trying to win their third straight be seven of their last eight going to a holiday break out of the corner James Hunley Hatfield another rebound put it back up Bradshaw raed it out of there possession Pat Adams calls the hell ball and it will stay with the car Huntley Hatfield now 14 and Jimmy hes got his third straight double dou he has been the bright spot hes not missed a shot yet has he right seven for seven in this game transfer from Tennessee who a year ago avered Five Points and five rebounds Clark a triple rings the bell for sky Music Clark he is a talent you he started the first 12 last year at Illinois before he stepped away in the second semester he put his name in that portal in March Wagner been kind of ay night DJ is scoreless came in averaging 12 theres Edwards and hell take the contact and score and now Lee cel out from the basket by Edwards and Ron gr telling John calip to go to the bench here and honestly Jimmy I didnt see what happened Music here Edwards there we the two small on it and Clark hits the free throw its part of the immaturity still thats in that freshman class that was a tripic kid they dont have a bad kid on kuys roster but theres still growth in front of these guys I like their fire I like their fight I like I like their passion for the game their love for the game of ball it resonates every time I watch them Edward will learn from that moment so here is Louisville triling and Clark to work on the drive the scoop no onino on the floor now for the wild cats not a high percentage of layups made by Louisville in this game because of the link of Kentucky that trail threat shot of Mitchell is hot yep and he steps into the ball with a lot of Rhythm as Kentucky guards man they throw strikes they dont throw bad passes to Shooters inside White had it deflected Here Comes Shephard into the front Court Trail three again Jimmy thats money Tre Mitchell a high percentage shooter that he is is four3 in the game thats easy money for Kentucky Applause appreciate 25 heres the advantage for Kentucky James had it blocked by oneno out of bounds wow ug my Heavens 7et 250 lb a sophomore from AI in the emo state of Nigeria he gets to the ball fast he had three blocks in N minutes against North Carolina a lot of guys rebound out of out of their area he blocked shots out of hisa awfully well for a young kid long three by white is good quickly comes Kentucky one dribble and a pass already into the front Court youve seen some spurts from Louisville but just not the consistent play and thats been their problem not just this year but last year they only won four games last year and this is a Louisville program thats theyre not supposed to be down like that Shephards got a season high career high 10 assist tonight turned over Clark Trail shot for Williams hes on the line just lack of awareness of where he was Williams but I like this kid hes a runner up to Mr Michigan basketball but hes got a really good stroke I believe he made threes in their last game against pepperd Reeves through traffic and on the second try He will draw the foul couple of free throws coming up dont forget Christmas Day on the ESPN family of networks you get five count five great NBA games presented by State Farm Bucks and Nick start at noon in theard how about Golden State Denver at 230 you think you pull away from the table for some of that then Boston and La who like that match up I live with girls and two dogs Sixers in heat Mavs and Suns wrap it up out in the valley on ESPN and the ABC tell you what the Warriors and Nuggets thatll make you move away youll find a TV for that Ill get my eyes on it Reeves has got 29 now in the ball game tonight W is over 4000 wins 11 national titles 27 final combin between Kentucky and Louisville and Louisvilles got to rise back up this is not where this program is supposed to be they are one of the top brands in college basketball Al they have not been that over the last three or four years but they got to get this thing corrected in a hurry Kenny pay understands it therell be a lot of conversation after this game you know Josh herd was the interim ad when he hired Kenny pay which tells you that the Board of Trustees former players boosters had a lot to do with that decision and Josh heard all I think what hes looking for right now is are we seeing progress under Kenny pay as this second season gets Music started Ed Music 2 number KCK Music k Music Edward Music Music number 23 Applause a core of four well Kentucky fans have H around in the center to reel in what will be their fifth win in the last six of this series and their ninth in the last 11 and theyve now won 14 of the 24 games played in Louisville in the Applause series thats the kind of talent you have to have not only to handle this SEC that kcks going to chew into but this is a program thats also supposed to be in that final four on a regular basis and I just think they have that look again as the best way to describe this Kentucky team Percy Millers first free throw the year is good his fourth appearance Bradshaw is out here comes Walker horn in the game Joey har Kareem Watkins on the floor along with Jordan Burks and Coach C gets to go home and wrap up a pair of 1499 britches to give to somebody or himself on Christmas day yeah 9575 turned over heres M Miller launching and a COR for the rebound inside and it rolled off the rim foul will be on Walker horn so the so the Syracuse quarterback is number 89 Dan valari from mipa Long Island yesj all the quarterbacks for Syracuse are injured I guess so and so valari who was a high school quarterback or signed at Michigan and then you know what happens in todays world in the portal comes to Syracuse originally a quarterback moved to tight end because in all honesty his best prospects as a pro player are a tight end really yes sir well Im going straight to my room Ill be there quickly because across the street Ive never seen a quarterback wear number 89
