Conley Hatfield the sixth one hell start on the bench because dant Styles is in the lineup with Jaden Taylor Marcus Hill Michael oconnell and of course the big man Middlebrooks and Marcus Burton is on the floor with Bren Shrewsberry Mato Kev ji and Tay Davis who arguably might be one of the most improved players in the league heres Styles three spins out from the corner to get us started here tonight at Lenovo Center and styles had a double double last time out so of course hes a guy that you want to have in the starting lineup playing great basketball for Kevin ke great play ball get going y heres Burton driving against Music Taylor shot bacon Shrewsberry he misses on the three last Touch by middle Brooks itll stay with the yards Jim when you look at Notre Dame what do you see offensively from michah Shrewsberry second team hes just better this year hes stronger he can make that dribble move couldnt do that last year finish around the basket and they just got a really good offensive team theyre getting really good shots and they miss him two really good shots yep OK Connell in the wolf pack here is Marcus Hill whos a bit of a bulldog with a guard I mean just got a great mentality to go to the basket middle Brooks inside Middlebrook struggled in his first game back Mr Virginia Game Y last week and then did play against Wake Forest was unable to crack the field goal column so looking to get on track once again he was playing great basketball before he got sick well now the team can buy one here early well Burton likes to drive he his shot is not back yet he drove against North Carolina Brooks on a kick out Jaden Taylor spots nope well and the one thing weve seen though youve seen the right guys getting the shots you talk about Shrewsberry on one end of the floor J Taylor on the other end You got the right guys getting the shots they havent gone down to this point but both coaches have to be happy with the shots their team will get it and going to get a foul bill cumington on the whistle tonight with Tony Henderson and Matt Potter and the foul is going to be on Michael oconnell for Kevin Keats 52 years of age of course 147 wins now with the wolf pack and 28 in his career and WD with Mr 47 years over here retiring Now Kevin keeps is the third longest tenard all coach all those old guys got got old at the same time heres a AO of three and itll spin in Matt Alo is the transfer from Princeton who was all ivy league a year ago thats his 263 and we open the scoring 2 minutes in and Alo has been a Saving Grace for this Notre Dame team can imagine where they would be without him especially with Burton getting injured loo came in and really handled the point guard position great assist to turnover race up Taylor in traffic nice pass middle Brooks up strong had it raped out no foul here is Burton Shrewsberry and in the takeway for Taylor open floor and Jaden Taylor lays it in thats just what the doctor ordered for the wolf pack they lead the ACC in Fast Break points but those pick six are where they live off of turning opponents over and turning it into scoring on the other end of the floor onepoint lead for Notre Dame the irisher fast Pac quick paced if you will when theyre in the half for it turn over there ja looked like he was trying to hit Alo on the bounce pass Michael Shrewsberry as we said a moment ago second season at South Bend 57 wins in a fouryear head coaching career what a vast basketball Journey hes had though right like that did you see the spent the six seasons as a Boston Celtic assistant coach I asked him this summer when I saw him out recruiting was he wearing his ring if you watch the celebration of the Boston Celtics when they won their championship in June you would find Michael shry in the locker room with the team of course very close with Brad Stevens inside Kevin J had it block from behind by Styles great defense heres Taylor trying to split AO and a hell ball here and that will go to Notre Dame oh what a play by Styles here coach unbelievable came from nowhere thats an easy basket coach ke was worried about his defense and the last two or three days hes been thats what theyve worked on and theyre good theyre off to a good start defensively I mean Notre Dames missed a couple shots but theyve been good coach how do you like that when when you think about when your teams have struggled in a certain area and you go have a couple days to get on the floor in practice and you see them execute that on the floor thats got to be a great feeling for you as a coach correct no doubt about it but you know and the other thing is sometimes when you spend that much time on it then your offense suffers a little bit too heres Huntley Hatfield off the Irish turnover another steal yep oconnell heres Marcus Hill on the lob heres Huntley Hatfield in the ball game now for Middle Brooks double team Brandon forced it up and score oh what a tough shot for Hunley Hatfield against a really good double team wol pack in front for the first time lock of one to go to J but coach look how far out NC States defense is forcing Notre Dame to have to initiate their offense catching the basketball close the half court look at the scoop and score from number three again perfect defense better offense thats what Burton does when he gets pressured youre helping him cuz now he gets by but thats one of the things that coach ke talked to us about pregame was they werent they werent doing a good job of staying in front of the guy that they were guarding OK Connell rings the bell thats a big shot lets take the lid off from three Michael okons averaged about 8 and2 points in the last three games 11 assists just two turnovers for him and a pack back to a twoo Advantage WD I think its fair to say that Lorenzo Charles had the biggest shot in the history of NC State basketball but can we say that Michael okell had the biggest threepoint field goal in his in basketball I think so I think we can say oh listen to beim just ending it well you know youre my ACC historian but but coach beheim stepping in he started all that he started all that stuff got to be valid yeah line its too early for you to be throwing up the goggles right now coach the fans have been kind to us already already but at its going to happen though I feel it Alo and Notre aame trailing four Shrewsberry couple of early looks now Burton against Taylor here he goes to the basket again lost the handle J recovers keba with a lay in but once again is Burton getting into the painted area even though he lost the basketball still putting that pressure on NC State defensively yeah Im Im surprised surprised that their defense has been this good NC State theyre doing a good job a really good job and thats what coach was worried about before the game so thats one worry that theyve really handled we got uh a dead ball will bring us to a timeout here its been a fastpaced game in terms of possession and Tempo in the first 6 and2 minutes and there is our break Timeout on the floor 97 NC State when we come back noted a and its fourpoint Madness were underway in Raleigh Applause Music was Music had for sure uh its my is my favorite mov I say Don the Music Applause way I know one of C well if you know the story of Notre Dame season then you know the chapter Saturday holds OT kadoo down three knocks down a three 48 left the Loos foul sends him to the line at the rare fourpoint play kdo completes the fourpoint play and then the game ends on a burden drop the follow by kesn was after the horn Carolina win 7473 Micah Shrewsberry has fasing perspective on this but this is their worksheet level part at 7 seven one and5 away neutral courts Burton Miss seven games four games decided by five or fewer but you like them Jim a lot at where they may be going I think theyve got a good P forward I would have liked to see him foul there at the end of the game not let him shoot the three but they have a chance to get going now the schedules a little easier Burtons back at full strength so I think they really have a legitimate shot going forward tonight feels big for both teams though Coursey it really does both coming in losing their last two games and then when you consider the fact that you start ACC play and getting Burton back for noted aim is huge but more importantly for the wolf pack the first time theyve been on their home floor since December 22nd so in this league you have to take care of Home especially when you get those opportunities Brion pass into the ball game senior from Reedville into the lineup hes been terrific offensively has always been pretty good on the defensive end of the floor but you love his patience you love the fact that this is one of a handful of young men who have stayed the course been at in NC State now for 4 years his entire career in one place and didnt play much in his first three years but stay the course loves it here and now is a vital member of their ration Cruz Berry the Miss three Hunley Hatfield had a crack at it thats going to be on J keev ji Junior from Centerville Ohio transfer from Penn State his first Brion pass there it is one of eight seniors in the ACC to spend all four years at the current school and uh he had 86 career games in his pocket prior to this season thats a one of eight thats unbelievable but hes one of eight but probably one of four or five that actually play minutes youve got some of those guys as he lines up a three knocks it down WD you heard my convers safe with Brion pregame hes shooting way too well from threepoint range 54 hes got to start taking some bad shots WD he just popped that in your eye coach doesnt want to hear that we give Cory credit for that one 127 packed by five Shrewsberry tries to answer the three wont go down ishmail doof Junior from Quebec in Canada the rebound he wears 33 for NC State WD you passed by that way too quick if coach ever gives me credit for anything we need to stop we need to stop right there celebrate that I have to work hard to find something I know you do thats why so important hotley Hatfield in traffic boy what a challenge both by Alo and keba for the Irish heres Burton ball away against pass thats what he does when he gets that side isolation he hes very difficult to guard he doesnt need a screen in fact the screen hurts it he needs that open side oconnell and the Wolf Pack by three ball screen by Hunley Hatfield and here is a pass triple again that bounds away are you sure now he should shoot yes okay 50 coach Im Taking My Chances bon bon dont pass keep shooting the rock Burton over Huntley Hatfield and thats where Burton has got to rebound thats the one area that Burton has struggled only shooting 30 from three was over three and his return against NC State forgive me against North Carolina at home so thats the one area he really hasnt gotten back yet Marcus Hill will try one and Shrewsberry couldnt hang on to it and lost it out of bounds itll stay with the Wolfpack when we come back almost 9 Minutes in Kevin Keats inspired by beheim there we go pack all the way to Phoenix back after this Music Music aftering a remarkable astounding week for the North Carolina State wol pack an ACC tournament championship that will never be forgotten and now theyre going dancing too another for DJ Birds this is what dreams are made of an unlikely run to the final four for NC State Music with a little tshirt get on the feet and Cat that tshir come on Music this a remarkable astounding week for the North Carolina State wol pack an ACC tournament Championship that will never be forgotten and now theyre going dancing too another for DJ Birds this is what dreams are made of an unlikely run to the final four for NC State and Kevin kss team of course that went 17 and 14 the regular season won five and five base started by by the way falling behind Louisville at halftime in the first game played in DC and we were fortunate to be able to call that game at at the end of that game I mean of course you mentioned the they were down to Louisville in the first round there is none of us who was a part of that that would have said this team is going to win the ACC tournament after that first round win theres no one at this table that said then this is the favorite to win this win four more games in the next four days to cut down the Nets and go to the final four thats just icing on the cake right there get to the tournament and then make a run all the way to the final four and we werent going to talk about that but we were overruled by our producer okay man good going N9 minutes in its a onepoint lead for State both teams are playing really good on the defensive end generally that weakens in the second half ball got blocked from behind by middle Brooks on Nikita constantini and Nikitas probably hurting a little bit cuz hes the only guy that got yelled at in practice today so constant owski by the way who is from the Ukraine started his career at Tulsa then went to Northeast Oklahoma junior college then to Monmouth where he played for King rice and now Notre Dame and so hes had a number of different coaches to get used to their tone and their voice Michael shb used a tone and a voice with earlier today that coach bam kind of took you back to I had a great player running cycling he spoke six languages but at 800 at night when the game started he didnt understand anything that I was telling him I could never figure that out and I love Ronnie cycling you should yeah Ronnie cying took you to a national championship game and won a lot of games yes he did Styles drops a three from deep and thats really where dant Styles has improved his game you think back to four years years ago when he was at North Carolina as a youngster coming in has experiened in the ACC but much more time much more opportunity for him now in year five with the wol 17th three of the year for Styles and Ben Middlebrooks I think is just picked up his second foul and this is an area where the Wolfpack havent been great this season but now knocking down their third threepoint field goal here in the first half two ahead of noted aims only knocked down one of their first seven from Beyond the AR pay Davis at the line third best field goal shooter in the ACC coming in hell knock down the free throw first points for Davis so middle Brooks will come out you see the details for Dantes Styles Cory told you about the double double on Saturday at Winston Salem so theres Big Bend to the bench Hunley Hatfield will come in and wol Packs got a threepoint lead were almost halfway through half one and WD you mentioned it earlier Davis will be in the conversation along with Jaylen Blakes yep as as far as the guys who are the most improved players in the ACC this year but Blakes doing it at a different School even though he was the ACC performer last year at Duke now getting the job done at Stanford Dennis Parker Jr little DP yep and now all of a sudden heres the turnover Taylor for Huntley Hatfield and hes fouled by Burton and Brandon is hurt Huntley Hatfield is hurt under the basket here after the Burton foul Music and Ron Cooper is the trainer for the Wolfpack he will come out to attend to Brandon Huntley Hatfield whos in a good bit of pain it looks like underneath the basket so Brandon who went down in a lot of discomfort is SE is sitting up now which is a good sign on that alone and meanwhile Will Bill cumington Jr and Matt Potter have gone to the monitor across the way here so often times when you see a reaction as such its a shoulder and again we dont want to speculate after Comming foul Two Shots yeah and it said you see Burton just going for the basketball but you thats often times thats where you can get a stinger or something going on with your shoulder we saw Brandon flexing that right arm so fortunately hes up and moving the right arm more importantly as hell get checked out along the sideline so the foul on Huntley hatf or the foul on Burton by the way was his first second on noted aim and Brandons going to go to the locker room and in comparison to back in the day where if you left without shooting the free throw you couldnt return to the game but now he actually can come back out of the locker room and check back into the game glad that they changed that rule from the stone ages coach bam was playing well in the beginning when I we were as coaching you could do that you could go out and come back and I I saw one or two coaches at the end of games the guy always was hurt and and then the one play one possession boom heres the guy back in the game so that was when it was manipulated a little bit but Burton made a good ball play there he just trying to get to the ball again no uncare bad turnovers theyre making some really bad turnovers that are giving NC State points and you dont want to do that its stood as a common foul on Burton by the way thats why you saw Dennis Parker Jr shoot the free throws and its a fourpoint NC State lead is dud from Forbe has returned now after Hunley hfield is hurt remember middle Brooks has the two fouls so they got to go a little deeper in terms of their post play through the wolf P here but fortunately you playing against Kev whos not much of a back to the basket guy as is Davis so the bigger concern is taking care of your defensive board now as you see not D with their fifth turnover and thats one of the areas of concern for Kevin ke with his defense and they have been on point here this evening thus far this an NC State team that I think was challenged is that a good word to use Maybe by Kevin Keats about who they were defensively after the loss at Virginia Forest 100 Styles whos had a nice hand offensively here early setting up shots and knocking down a three of his own Taylor out front working against Burton on the drive and J blocked it is dud followed it just the fifth field goal of the year for the Junior from Quebec with doof getting an opportunity now as you mentioned middle Brooks with two fouls Hunley Hatfield in the locker room being checked out and doof coming in with the offensive board putback taking advantage of his opportunity yeah his first point since the loss of Virginia heres Davis now Irish trailing six and up and under with the left hand goes t Davis he has three Michael shb talked to us about that earlier today taking advantage of the mismatches they will seek them out and when Tay Davis has a smaller player can turn his back his back and get to the basket thats what he does thats when he scores styles on the bounce to do double team there and last touch Tay David thats going to get us to a timeout NC State a fourpoint lead he under eight break and Raleigh Music let Applause I e e welcome back to Raleigh well quick check of uh some of the notes nashley Gator look good last night shocking game there thats but they played great at Kentucky Kentucky made everything to to beat him but its college basketball theres going to be some of those inconsistencies this year uh doesnt matter whos playing Cory was in the crowd for Cooper flag last night yeah the backto back highlights Im not trying to figure out which one was better well we know which one was better the most impressive part to me was after the original highlight dunp the next possession down the crossover to the rim two hand finish it the coopa flag show in the second half after been fou trouble the first half of that game by the way Tay Davis lost one of his under armer curries a moment ago you can see there he had to slip that back on look at you identifying the sneaks early I know it Nikes wouldnt do that for sure Bo here we go see again it would have been me saying it but I would have got in trouble he doesnt get in trouble Burton will drop in a three while you guys discuss your Footwear seven for Burton and Notre Dame quickly to within one now Big Shot the he needed to make that yeah he needed to see a three go through that gives him confidence to continue to take that shot and know they need to see it as well they struggled from Beyond The Arc here in this game this far Styles back for oconnell tend to shoot for the pack Alo out front on Hill double team coming skip to Styles pulls the trigger bounds away ta out and it will belong to Notre Dame quick reminder to you coming up next tonight on ESPN 2 Hunter Dickinson number 11 Kansas its a Big 12 Conference game in Arizona state with Bobby Hurleys in town at the fog tonight 900 on ESPN 2 like that match up big hunt going up against Jaden quainton so Raleigh native who is the youngest player in division one basketball Notre Dame trying to look for the lead here Davis with 11 to shoot skip for Shrewsberry three away got it in the Irish in front kadon Shrewsberry is the fourth best threepoint shooter in the league thats his first points tonight back to back threes for the fighting Iris and now things are starting to flow in the offensive in for Michael Shrewsberry team now on an 80 run coach we talk coach shuberry earlier about coaching his son you got a little experience yeah that its not easy I its fun you want to do it but its its its the and the and for the player theres a little extra pressure to win the game for you wait a second a long one Marcus Hill from right in front of Micah Shrewsberry just his fifth three of the Year about to say up against the shot clock hes not a great threepoint shooter but of course hes a game look at Davis with the hard drive six now or second field goal five points for Tay Davis and weve seen Tay Davis just as coach shrewbury told is when he has an advantage against a smaller player he takes him down low with a bigger guy guarding him he likes to take him to the rim off the bouns Huntley Hatfield fouled at the post and thats Marcus Burton second third on noted a here guys and Tay Davis using screen and roll action but you see his ability to handle the basketball and find the scen but on the other end of the floor Marcus Hill up against the shot clock no hesitation knocking down the three ball right in front of the not a Bley Hatfield squares up on Kevin ji who knocked it the way feels like Jim MC States best offense when they keep the ball moving yeah I mean both teams are playing good defense and NC State doesnt make a lot of frees they made a couple big ones but theyre going to need to make some more problem inside there goes Styles five for dant Styles its a seventh lead change of this first half a nice find from Marcus Hill putting that one on the beam to be able to get it to styles on the interior look away for ji in the flush boy Burton sered that one up the WD you remember Michel sh talking to us about the guy that was hurt most by Marcus BTs absence K he wasnt getting those drop off getting nothing he needs that he needs somebody to drop it off to penetrate and get a good shot up there heres Taylor Jaden all the way through three blue jerseys were there Huntley Hatfield he took the spill under the goal but back on the floor contributing for the wolfb got his own rebound I think the r should is okay WD cut it Loose nicely he he lined up the three ball to make sure it was good yeah hes open up for a reason too were going to investigate that in just a moment heres Burton on the drive and Marcus cant get the roll and were going to get a whistle and Tony Henderson a foul I believe on Davis thatll be his first thats the fourth on Notre Dame so real quick here Brandon Huntley Hatfield two for five coming in shooting threes is that the reason hes open out there probably thats 40 surprised he made two coach let me tell you what I dont need for you to do I dont need for you to talk about threepoint shooting anything to do with threes here in Braley weve had enough issues over the past year you mean my goggles I do you I do mean you with the three goggles that was a it obviously spurred them on to something better okay so I I appreciate taking credit for that yes Ill take credit you got him to the final four heres a skip Taylor will launch for three oconnell the rebound more mty State getting plenty of chances here trailing by one and a turnover last Touch by the wolf pack so the under four here at this first half stop Notre Dame 24 NC State 23 good play at both ends defensively hard to scratch in this one so far in Raleigh Music he e e e e its a onepoint lead for Notre Dame were at the under four Mark here but Cory the ball games got a different kind of feel to it and principally NC States already broken one of their characteristics absolutely they take a 14 threepoint field goal attempts and thats not their strength this is a team that likes to get into the payment area make plays for themselves or teammates especially a guy like Marcus Hill who loves to get downhill and right now Kevin Keats with 14 of their 24 field goal attempts coming from Beyond the threepoint Arc is probably trying to encourage his team to find a way into the paint so is he saying dont shoot threes Jim no I I just think theyre having trouble with Notre Dames defense and they end up with threes cuz Notre Dames helping so much but sometimes you got to drive anyway in those situations Irish byy one looking for more easy score there maybe the easiest bucket for either school this half so who has not had a problem driving the basketball thats the second time weve seen Davis handling the basketball and thats one of the things that Mike sh talked to us about they have a number of guys that can break the pressure and of course if NC State W the pressure 94 ft they can put the hands the ball in hands of Davis you cant pressure him with the power forward Julian rers come on the floor he takes the turnover from Taylor for the Irish so a threepoint lead just ahead of three to play in this first half at righ and it looks like theyre going to seek out the miss match right now Michael Shrewsberry showing his NBA experience giving the ball to Davis and forcing someone to stop Alo back GM Miss Constantin noski could not control it Davis will get it to rooper for the layup on the slide Davis really shows a lot of improvement hes hes doing a lot of things that are really good so Kevin Keats wants a timeout fivepoint lead for Notre Dame w Music Music Notre Dame on a 6 nothing run theyve hit eight of their last 10 shots a lot of it Tay Davis Jim here are the details as you watch him score a year ago he averaged against the league nine points five rebounds shot 47 hes averaging 16 1 12 points same basic rebound hes 6 better shooting from the floor right think you point that out today and I dont think Cory caught that but he was watching something else but hes tough to guard man man he gets to the basket yep against anybody even biger little Styles trying to snap the drought cannot and the Wolf Pack run it down Hunley Hatfield saved it but aos got it WD is that not only throwing you under the bus but putting the bus in reverse and backing back over you that I think he got hit twice I mean and was he not the one who had to take a phone call when we were talking with Coach shry I forgot okay Im just going to throw that out there since we since we going to run the me over with the bus I didnt know we were going to reveal all the other stuff meanwhile Shrewsberry presses the lead with his second three who comes late to both things today were not going to get into that though right Les eightpoint lead for Notre Dame Shrewsberry and the Irish with their largest advantage and a N9 nothing run now and theyve hit n of their last 11 theyve gotten it going on the offensive end and their defense has allowed them to stifle the Wolfpack by keeping them out of the paint forcing another jump shot a long two bonell but you see the Wolfpack playing up against the shot clock on a number of different possessions they cant get anything going to your basket they settled for the jump shot by the way WD you tell coach its not late its called CA time oh my God 75 seconds left and Davis is fouled on the Baseline so a couple of free throws coming for Tay Davis dont forget womens basketball coming up Thursday 500 on ESPN 2 look at this number two South Carolina Texas AM from Colonial Life Arena in Columbia game Cox have won five straight and 12 of the last 13 against the aies a terrible news out of South Carina as the Watkins tearing her ACL out for the season that is a huge loss for South Carolina of course the reigning National Champion ashle Watkins played a huge factor in that a season too tough to beat them down there whoever is playing and the second one is good and once Notre Dame got the ball going to the basket thats the difference in the game NC State cant score W packs attempted 15 threes thats the most theyve attempted in a half this year yeah and they had to settle but give Notre name a lot of credit for really staying in the gaps clogging the paint this is a difficult team to keep out of the paint is hell knocked out his second three of the game they got two threes from a guy that doesnt make threes just two kind of stay close yep lead is seven for the Irish probably two possessions left in the half Davis Baseline heres rooper now remember hes playing because Burtons got two fouls Julian rooper Up and Under with a left hand and the rebound pulled away by Parker and with roer behind the play youve got numbers three on pass on a kick out o connells three front rim Miss and Shrewsberry and thats a shot you want hes a good shoter and a guy thats a guy you want taking that shot so a sevenpoint lead for Notre Dame Micah Shrewsberry and the use it or lose it here in the first half Music Music all right coach 116 seconds remaining marus Bon with two fouls did you check him back in the game on offensive possession absolutely I I played guys with two even with seven or eight minutes to go I played them um I you know part of it was were playing zone so you can protect the guy a little bit better but I just a long time ago I had a player Derek Coleman if he got two fouls and i take him out he would just not play defense the next game once he got one he just stopped playing cuz hes not wanting to be out of the game so I just talk to guys and smart players can figure it out but in this situation this is easy get your best offensive player in the game see if you can get a bucket to go in head time yeah you built a sevenpoint lead NC States only hit one of their last seven noted As got the final option here with 116 to go and here is burton all the way through got caught on the bounce Shrewsberry lost it on the drive Brion pass from mid court and noted aame is going to take post for Kevin ke and WD remember the first turnovers the first five turnovers for not a happened early in the game in state was able to score off of those Jaden Taylor on a hard drive for his second field goal open the frame thats a really good start getting to the basket not settling for three but how about the adjustment coach coach keeps drawing that up on the first possession to be able to get to the basket and really establish a point of emphasis for his team coming out of the halftime locker room Styles has to defend Davis eight to shoot per little running one hander back rim miss all let thr o Connell heres Styles always thought about it into traffic over Davis gets the roll two in a row getting to the basket thats exactly what coach needed to do and he grew it up and they executed it but I love how Styles got to his spot and went to the midrange comparison to over penetrating and picking up an offensive foul out of the corner Alo mat Als first points of the half his second three of the game hes got six and noted aame on the board thats what he did at Princeton you can tell that coach that play was made by Tay Davis once again penetrating and once in state built the wall was able to make that pinpoint pass in the corner for loo well Hill one to find middle Brooks didnt thread the needle heres styles that spins out got a good look though to donrees Shrewsberry on the floor with Burton Davis of course AO Kev J at the post for the IR heres burton all the way to the r pushed it up and in he gets to the basket youre just not going to beat them if hes able to get into that lane like that and for a smaller guy finishes with contact against contact often hes stronger this year hes still listed 190 lbs but you can tell hes a little more tighter physically than he was a year ago Hill misses the three Shrewsberry the rebound the Irish lead is eight the WD ask answer me this is he still listed at 6 feet heres Davis on the drive yes is everybody under six foot is listed at six Connell Marcus Hill feels like Taylors the guy that may have to provide some help here scoring wise styles missed badly from the Baseline they need Taylor to be more aggressive to be more of a score thats one of the things that you know Kevin ke talked to us about they dont have that one guy that can just go get him a bucket and hes going spoiled because hes had that guy for the last few seasons and a locko fouls Taylor on the way up and Matt Alo draws his first first on the Irish in the half one thing you know about Marcus Burton hes always going to be in attack mode the nice crossover loses his footing but still the ility to be able to get into tight spaces and finish amongst the trees the thing that always strikes me Jim about Burton is his balance when he drives the ball and even though hes small he plays big bigger you dont see his shot getting blocked too much hes smart about how he does it and the last play I think got H and he needs that he needs that call so what youre saying coach is he actually plays 6 feet or above even though hes listed as such and hes not even close to 6t tall no but he plays you dont seeig his shot doesnt get blocked very often all right MC States G Going to the bench Brion pass he came in hit a three in the first half is checked in he replaces the aforementioned Marcus Hill meanwhile Jaden Taylor hits both free throws hes got four of NC State six here to start the second still a sevenpoint Notre Dame Applause lead Davis blocked by middle Brooks now okono and heres Dennis Parker Jr on the scoen and thats the way the wolf pack want to play not a turnover but a block shot turns into a transition opportunity Ben Middlebrooks of course who one to top in the ACC I believe second in the ACC and shot blocks per game with a big defensive rejection on that possession heres buron on the drive beats J again Big B on the rejection heres pass Taylor back for Middle Brooks o missed the layup Burton AO pull up two and J follows fourpoint swing right there WD middle Brooks missed a chippy and again give Burton credit for coming over really disrupting his rhythm but thats one that been middle Brooks would absolutely want back and in comparison to it being a fourpoint game now its a sevenpoint Applause lead a high weave back for Taylor Middle Brooks rolling against the double team Jaden Taylor a Applause three to the basket Burton aggressive spin through traffic and turned it over Parker out of there with Applause it Taylor launches and hits oh boy Jaden Taylor now has nine in the ball game and NC State to within four and this is the young man that Kevin ke needs production from Jaden Taylor who was a big part of the run to the final four a season ago stepping up here on his home floor e e e e for 4036 noted aim you see a tight huddle around Mike the Shrewsberry only one of us here in the Hall of Fame uh a moment ago Marcus Burton took it its its like a one on three for me Jim yeah uh turns it over NC State gets a bucket at the other end and during the timeout what do we have here hey you coach your best player hard just like everybody else and he went shoes went right to half court and said you know where you going we got Guys open youre going a little too far pitching out getting a good shot and you dont want to give them points off turnovers and more than one of us is in the Hall of Fame its just youre talking about the naith basketball its its only one of us in that one but theres more than one Hall of fam at this table by the way sir are we counting the little towns now in Virginia were talking about the greatest high school basketball program in the history of the world no its talking about we talking about there we got Notre Dame in possession in a fourpoint game somebodys getting silly shuberry and it rattles in for Braden third field goal hes got eight he averages 161 hes the 11th best scorer in the ACC coming in by the way and thats it thats the addition to his game right coach he didnt do that a season ago hes much better he needs to get more opportunities hes not getting as many opportunities part of it is because Burton is back M Brook fired a no look around to Hill who scores thats where Marcus Hill does his damage he often finishes amongst the trees once he gets into the pain area has zero fear once he gets in there amongst the big man a little hook bounce pass from Ben middle Brooks by the way uhhuh fourpoint lead for the Irish heres Davis feeds ji easy dunk for Kev ji hes in double figures now with 10 thats where Burton helps his team they double him he h somebody second pass dont but that was also a defensive breakdown by Hill who did not drop allowing the easy opportunity on the offensive end for Notre a out of the corner Taylor three I guess theyre going to keep shooting him well thats the guy you want shooting Jaden Taylor their best threepoint shooter maybe not from a percentage standpoint but hes made big shots for them throughout his two years here with the pack 11 now for Jaden Taylor his second three of the half threepoint lead again for Notre Dame Shrewsberry spinning against Hill buron up top three good for Marcus Burton if he gets hit in that shot theyre going to be tough to beat hes got a dozen now five in this half he was hesitant to shoot the three early in the game we talked about 0 for three against North Carolina hadnt made one since returning but now his second one of the game and no hesitation on that possession midle Brooks The Catch had it fall off the edge its two buckets couple of bunnies have not fallen for Ben Middlebrooks in this second half and Burton cant make the wolf pack pay J the rebound second chance for the Irish and the last time middle Brooks missed one of those it end up being a fourpoint swing in favor of the fighting Iris another opportunity now for them to put points on the board after a miss shuberry a three and it got tapped around and Middlebrooks lost it ji and Notre Dame gets a third crack Alo bounce pass kevi had it rejected and now the Wolfpack Come Away cleanly sixpoint lead for Notre D Taylor again sh three threes for Jaden Taylor we talked about it if you want someone taking the threes thats the god they got the fans back in the game too buron trying to beat Middlebrooks B away wont go tapped around and last touch Marcus Hill I believe its a threepoint Notre Dame lead and Jaden Taylors running this show right now Jaden Taylor has found the Rhythm here in the second half not one not two but three threes for Jaden Taylor here in the second stanza Music e e e e Music there we go touchdown the Irish have done it Ohio State overwhelming what an alltime classic the college football playoff semifinals begin tomorrow and continue Friday all right Im going to let the uh analyst chime in here all of you watch a lot of football so what happens well I Im looking to history Im looking to history when you consider Notre Dame and Penn State playing against each other you have two blackhead coaches which guarantees that there will be one blackhead coach in the national championship game which is history theres never been a black coach in the national championship game so history to be made Im going to go Irish though Im going to go Irish I think theyre on a magic run right now as we see bra Shrewsberry continuing to show off his ball handling ability his improved game getting to the rim and laying it up but Im going Im going Irish about beating Georgia I think they gave them a tremendous amount of confidence I like them but Im going to go against you Im going to go the other way I think Penn State is just too physical too big too strong and I think theyre better all right nothing nothing new you going against me though thats not a common place I had to do that back to Raleigh in a moment a Music Music Music Music Music Music supp e Music Music well Kevin J has been terrific tonight so good Cory hes got his first career double double and Michael talk to us about the guy that missed Marcus the most was ke now with Burton back you see with a different energy and of course doesnt have as much attention paid to him on the offensive end the floor you know Jim my favorite thing about ji last year when michah shrewbury talked about this young man who was with him at pen State and then went to know today he said you know you got to have somebody when you take a job you got to have somebody to spread the gospel to the congregation prach well last year thats about all he did tell you what the Improvement of Davis and to a degree of J in a different way has been impressive here to lift the Irish its hard to believe theres seven and seven playing here tonight to be honest with you well inside and an in one for Marcus Hill thats so much better offense when they get him into that lane area well theyre switching defensively so he gets rer really in the middle of the floor on the island but notice how theres no one in the gaps to be able to take away the driving lane so the one move allows him to get all the way to the rim and of course Marcus Hill won the best finishing through contact and getting to the free throw line double tonight for Hill they got got yelled at in practice today Nikita was not there he was the closest guy he should have been there 11 for Hill hes had back to back double figure games hes averaged 16 and change in his last three coming in but hes playing better for the Wolfpack clearly and weve got a twopoint game AO with Constantin noski on the floor Shrewsberry Tay Davis and Julian Roper six to shoot and a bump on oconnell course Bill cumington Jr whistles Michael oconnell for his second first of the half on NC State comes with 1026 to go Kevin keeps doing his close as Jim bayam impression there that was close I mean that was what theyve been doing the whole game thats why hes doesnt like that call and Kevin ke still doing his closest Jim bam impression right there going to one knee biting his hand heres Burton back on the floor thats a travel thats a travel about 15 minutes away my boy C Wallace is saying ball dont lie letting it be known right now after the call Kevin Keys didnt have to say the word they end up getting it back on a turnover and he did it wasnt a makeup call he walked C State chance to tie they have not LED since 2322 Hunley Hadfield with a right hand rolled off the iron I wouldnt let Tay Davis linger look at this spinning layup oh expected itll be a go 10 on dant Styles Davis has 11 WD thats a go 10 now but I believe thats one theyre going to go check out during the break as you look at this that basketball looks as though its still going up that one may be overturned when we go to the break let well get a better look of it here does it start his flight down I think so you think its coming down I think so Im going the other direction of course not enough evidence well wait till the timeout to see what ends up happening with that not enough evidence to over heres Hill two point a two possession game and styles out of the corner misses the three okono slapped it out volleyball it Hill another three no okell going to slap it out again get ready Jim hes got it I pass it to jayl Jay hes going to knock down the shot the next time he get hey hey Tony Henderson just said Alexander a turnover give me that you notice that you and I going for the basketball coach bayam just got out of the way like you dont want any to that anymore Im not getting hit man not sitting over there with the Thousand wins trying to play a ball exactly yeah so Irish maintain the fourpoint cushion mid Brooks cant be good but heres the thing you cant help off that ball soide shootter Ben the steel Ben Middlebrooks lay out oh my goodness his first points of the game and who better to make a layup than Ben Middlebrooks hes missed two point blank opportunities so off the turnover is able to go full court lay it in as you mentioned WD his first Basket in the last two games they got some Crow back into it now yep eight and 1 half to play in Raleigh Burton swws Berry a three back RM Miss oconnell in the pack in transition here goes Michael for the basket and were going to get a foul called basket is going to count all right Tony Henderson signal basket I believe well it hit the net but I dont think the ball was up there when it hit the net as you see okell attacking the basket going up for the shot and as you see Tay Daviss hand hitting the net thats and it possibly hits the rim we have a better angle here it does hit the rim and by hitting the rim that is a good bucket no foul on the play but a good bucket for Conor tied at 51 you see how Michael shy is choosing to beat the pressure its by having Tay Davis handle the basketball to take the pressure off of the guards Burton against Brion pass got him in the air draws the foul pady play by Burton to get P to commit his first second foul on the wolf pack dont forget coming up next on ESPN 2 Hunter Dickinson number 11 Kansas at home tonight at Allen Fieldhouse Bobby Hurley in Arizona State visit 900 on ESPN 2 Arizona State their first time in the Big 12 visiting B Allen Fieldhouse coach did you ever you ever take anybody to Al no we played them in Kansas City one year and locked out they were we won we lock down a little bit but I went to fog Allen last year for the first time to do a game on radio and its its a great place to play basketball As Good As It Gets In the game I think so yeah yeah didnt you beat Kansas in the national championship I think mean how does he bring up the other game I mean how does that happen you know what Im not going to get distracted lets get back to St know today were going to talk about this at dinner later boy get Hakeem war on the line would you twopoint lead after the Burton free throws heres Hill out of a double team oh middle Brooks stop it the layups were just too close for Ben middle Brook got to step it out from Beyond The Arc and make his big shots wolf packs lead for the first time since 5 minutes to go in the first half inside Davis and one on the okell foul how about that answer from the fighting IRS the dime from Burton to find Davis underneath but the big Fells are making plays coach on one end of the floor Ben Middlebrook stepping out from Beyond The Arc the layups were too close he needed to make sure he had some distance between him in the basket and on the other end to find Tay Davis finishing strong on the interior and one opportunity when we Music returnes gentl welcome to the Flor your fantastic spe Applause one Music Music onepoint lead for noted a 720 to go during the timeout Bill Covington Jr Tony Henderson at the Monitor and theyre looking at the two goal tending plays the one on the oconnell bucket where I think pay Davis got his hand around the rim heres bill cumington after review after review both calls of go tening are confirmed all right so dant Styles was a go 10 and noted a go 10 on the okell bucket down to our right so bayam won again that means he pays for dinner tonight right when dont I pay for dinner I was I was going to say that either way Davis the free throw I cant remember going out with you guys anywhere I paid for lunch one time last year really yeah the one at McDonald Pizza it was the pizza place oh the pizza place I forgot yeah 19 Ill pay once again this year yeah we better rally coach make sure its a good one heres Hill squeezing through traffic thats going to be a foul on not to name it is on Kev itll be his second its the third on the Irish of the half I believe with just ahead of seven minutes to go now Im not telling Tales out of school here but both teams are well short of sending the other to the bonus with seven minutes to play its a Well afficiated game and I hate to say that oh my goodness I was about to say that you just give the officials credit that ball got knocked out of bounds last touch I think itll stay with Inc state but I would agree I think the officials on the great job throughout this we got a good crew here tonight now this is Bill Covington Jr Tony Henderson Matt Potter whats the score in this game we got think they know twopoint game and I think are they looking here on shot clock management I think so well I believe theyre trying to figure out because its reset to 20 as though as the offensive rebound I think its more about the timing the big number there we go 7 17 to shoot Baseline for the wolf p in that corner though and heres Hill two Irish got JEA fou down heres uh Marcus Hill on a scoop that got blocked how about Kevin getting up falling down getting up but still blocking the shot we talked about of course the Improvement of sberry and Davis but give kevs eye a tremendous amount of credit too for upping his game here in his second year with the Irish got his first career double double going tonight heres Burton Alo will cut it loose and hit Matt aos got three threes for his nine hes now made two or more threes in each of their last five ball games how about the fighting IRS responding after the huge run by the wolf pack to take a lead in this game the response by the fight OB to build a fivepoint lead right back up hill right back for Taylor who was hot a moment ago into traffic goes Jaden Taylor double team kesn wrapped him up Jr kesn its going to force a hell ball and possession will go to noted Dame here we talk about the growth of Marcus Burton in comparison to trying to force that one like we saw earlier gives the basketball up to a really good shooter alako knocking down to three ball and Marcus Burton trusts his teammates much more this year game one on the return was more about trying to get himself going but you can see trusting his teammates here allowing them to build a fivepoint lead and hes going to have the ball now now hes got the mismatch right here hes going to try to get the rim pivoted against Middlebrooks Ben reached in knocked it away out of bounds into the Irish bench with nine to shoot thats a great job defensively by middle Brooks I mean its difficult for guards to keep Burton in front let alone a big man but middle Brooks does a great job and Coach you mentioned how he was doing his tremendous job on the defensive end even though he missed the two layups he he hes really been the difference on defense blocking shots and help and thats a 5sec count on the iris and how about Michael shuberry right there coaching up a looto those are things you just dont want to see as a coach get the ball in bounds but let me ask you this question yeah would you prefer inbound turnover or the dead ball turnover on the sideline thats my only choice okay cuz you dont want to burn the timeout there right but you got to get the ball in Balance 15 to shoot for the wolf pack they Trail five middle Brooks with J out of a double team heres Hill long two back rim Miss Alo the rebound Applause its its going to be Marcus Burton now every possession hes just going to make a play one to help somebody or get a shot thats what it should be theres Bon splitting and he turned it over pass with the collection oconnell and in took it away what a great play Notre Dame trying to get numbers heres Davis hell come to a stop and Notre Dame calm down or maybe not Burton in traffic Applause foul so Notre name has overcome its own unforced error here and now watch Micah Shrewsberry oh yeah hes getting the Princeton guy and saying something like you went to Princeton and you dont even know where the out of bounds play is third foul on middle Brooks what we got on the line WD whats happening Burton missed the free throw with popping in here some sort of food element I think not to be hes not the guy again if theyre guys youre going to get Im not sure if its bacon if its a chicken sandwich not sure what it is but theres something to be had on two Miss free throws here in the second half I dont know that Marcus Burton is the guy youre going to get that Inc state had a brief lead of 5453 since then a 7 nothing noted a run and its a great little step back on the road to come back like that and a hold off the ball on Braden Shrewsberry against Jaden Taylor first on Braden fourth on the Irish in this second half sometimes in these games all of a sudden they think they need to blow their whistle here we go he gave them WD he gave him credit earlier but its cred time now yep theres middle Brooks and one on the J foul but he missed the shot third on ji fifth on Notre Dame free throws coming up dont forget Saturday ACC Network we got a triple header for you its alumni day at Little John Florida State and Clemson 200 presented by food line in case you dont know State Carolina is a thing its at 400 right here at noo Center and were going to finish at H Pavilion where Andre stojakovic and the Bears welcome Virginia Tech from Berkeley all that on acc Network in case you dont know everyone knows if you follow the ACC you know that this is a thing 247 alltime meetings and youre talking about some absolute battles between these universities when you in North Carolina and NC State and North Carolina thinks theyre going to win every time they fight forever the game but they did not in DC last year for the ACC title nobody else did either except you Jim you were a winner a big winner Cory one of the few tile y Alo Irish by four we go under four here at Lenovo Center and a foul Tony Henderson a hand check I think on Brion pass what did I saying thatll take us to a Timeout on hiny States fifth foul second on pass back to Raleigh in a moment Music let Music Music 2 Music Music Music Applause Music Music la Music Applause Music well you see Notre Dame Fighting more than just NC State tonight Irish have lost 21 of their last 22 ACC Road games and here here after a onepoint loss at the horn Saturday to Carolina thats why we talked at the top coach this is a big game maybe just bigger than the game itself in terms of what you take away from this well this is the Notre Dames playing every game for their season they need to win most all of their games and when they get the chance to win like tonight they have to win theyre not going to be Duke probably so theyve got to win all these other games to get some place for a coach like Michael Shrewsberry in year number two to try to establish his culture how important is to be able to win Road gamees especially when you consider how early it is in this time with young players huge he needs a road win and he needs one tonight and theyre in good position theyve got pretty good control but you still got to figure the out and thats not easy shot clock at six Davis the ball Shrewsberry lines up a triple and bangs it hes done that all year hes been really good all year absolutely helps when your kid can go make a big shot for you over there his dad Michael Shrewsberry celebrating the three both arms high youre youre happy twice for your team and for your son how about three times when you get home yeah yeah yes pass heres Taylor NC State ahead of 3 minutes and six to shoot Styles a triple to answer big response from styles styles has got double figures now time out for the fourpoint differential and 308 to play here a one end the floor Tay Davis making a play you see Taylor get clipped there enough room for Shrewsberry to be able to knock it down on one end but then dant styles with the response but coach WD even better after these plays Marcus Burton walking back to the his sideline bumps into Ben Middlebrooks middle Brooks looks back you got the biggest guy on the floor the smallest guy on the floor a little bit of a star down were going to have an interesting 308 remaining NC States going to have two timeouts left so will Notre Dame you see the similar conference marks at one and two a game difference in the overall theres certain plays in every game and that and gives NC State a chance he misses that shot almost really really hard to get and you talk about certain plays in each game right now Notre Dame with a fourpoint lead how bad do you think Kevin ke and Ben Middlebrooks would like those twopoint blank layups back right now we be looking at possibly a tie ball game back for pressure buron the ball this is a big possession for no game Styles trying to help with the double team heres Davis a locko hes hit a three already couple of them here in the second half and there is a foul called B cumington going to get Ben Middlebrooks with his fourth but Im telling you WD if you would have saw those two that encounter between Burke and Middlebrooks I believe middle Brooks wanted to get a little contact on Burton there but you dont do that when youve got three fouls then middle Brook way too important to this team one more to the bonus for Notre Dame Iris had five fouls andc St dont need two fouls to shoot bonus Davis seven to shoot on the drive against Styles block save to pass W pack in transition here is Hill and the basket another block another turnover another shot down here thats NC State basketball at its finest turning defensive Mis into offensive opportunities Now find themselves within two points here on the home floor Burton 12 to shoot a locko and a foul called on Hill its his first thats seven on NC State free throws from Malo weve seen dant Styles making big plays on the offensive end defensively does the job the kick ahead to Hill whos able to finish with the acrobatic layup and just like that its a onep possession game Alo trying to make it a two possession game at the three stri Alo 77 on the Year miss seven times in 30 attempts oo very dramatic the rim was kind but thats the call right there that they really have made the whole game and now all of a sudden big big call AO hit them both 8 and 1 half 11 in the ball game Notre Dames Got Five Guys in double figures tonight balance scoring sharing the basketball putting him in the position to try to get their first row win in a very long time for the fighting IRS Styles at three rattles out Middlebrooks chases makes the save for pass 146 to go heres Ben playing with four hell draw the J foul four on keevi six on Notre Dame two free throws for Ben Middlebrooks whos two for two in the second half and you got to love Ben Middlebrooks his energy his effort everything he does all the intangibles going after the loose ball saving it in bounds and then making himself available to be able to attack the basket getting to the free throw line trying to make it a twopoint game once again it kind of looks like the foul was going to the basket a little bit so third free throw for Middle Brooks Jim how important this stay one possession for NC State really important they havent theyre struggled in their home this is a must win twopoint game 100 seconds to play Burton for J 11 to shooting Burton Applause again lines up of three Off the Mark J the rebound stripped out of there heres Hill there numbers for NC State opportunity to attack with the shot block out of the play T game both schools two timeouts possession arrow belongs to the Wolfpack Burton for Shrewsberry in a three to Strong pass the rebound 10 seconds and change in the differential going to the horn and a timeout for Kevin ke Co do you like that timeout yeah I I almost think Notre Dame might have needed a timeout there too but I think its a good timeout well were tied because of Marcus Hill absolutely Marcus Hill getting the job done defensively coming up with the strip and then taking as he recognizes Kevin is down its five on four but more importantly theres no shot Blocker in the painted area Marcus Hill is the best that NC state has at getting downhill and attacking gets to the rim and gets the easy bucket to go what do you want to see here you know theyve got to run their offense they got to try to get something going to the basket because the referees are calling stuff now so you want to try to get a drive and you dont want to settle for the jump shot from the outside the problem with the game is nos going to get us attempt back because of his 12 sec 10 seconds so no going to get a good chance at the other end are you first shot guy first look you get first clean look go you got to get a good shot if its preferably going to the basket make the referees make a call and thats what youre trying to do right now 10 and 12 second differential between the shot clock and the game clock so right now WD I believe one of the things you were basically asking was do you run this Spock down coach and get take it as far down as you possibly can to get a look or do you go for something earlier to make sure if you dont score that you have you have an opportunity to extend the game on the defensive end of the floor you got to get a good shot thats what you got to get whether its 10 seconds or 20 seconds okay the other the thing you have to worry about on the Miss Burtons going to get the ball and go thats whats going to happen and you have to make sure you get back on that guy Marcus Burton is on the bench defense yeah so Notre name brings rooper Julian Roper a 64 senior transferred into the program from Northwestern stays on the hes on the floor for to replace Burton Shrewsberry alako Davis and ji are out there for Notre D so you can absolutely guarantee with a make or a stop either one for no defens theres going to be a timeout because Burton will absolutely be on the floor for the last offensive possession the thing that hurts him is now Burton cant get a loose B go thats it its the only negative in the whole process yeah heres pass now and now Hill all the way through goes Marcus Hill Middle Brooks spinning on job eight to shoot pass Five to shoot for Brion pass hell go flip it middle books foul that is the best possible scenario available for NC State for a number of reasons you have an opportunity to put points on the board but if you can make the second free throw you can set up your defense and for of course when you see Brion pass attacking not at all phased by the shot clock does a great job keeping his eyes up and no pun intended the beautiful pass to Ben Middlebrooks to send him to the line first of two for Middlebrook short First missing five tries for Ben so now you get Burton back into the game make or Miss no so we see Michael shrewbury actually signaling for the timeout he wants the timeout I believe either way wolf pack with a onepoint lead P from midd Brooks all in the second half Burton front Court timeout Notre Dame with eight points three to go now coach let me ask you this in this scenario do you prefer to have the basketball at the 28t Mark there or would you rather give Marcus Burton the 94t run to be able to get a good look well everybody coaches their own way and Coach shb is a great coach I would give him the ball and go Id set him some kind of screen half court but I just tell him go ahead best and even with the timeout call like you can call the timeout after the make and take to you that melry to get ACR half court the court to be able to run their offense with 83 remaining once youre here you got to set something up here yeah given what they do the way they operate around the perimeter the way their you know their ball screen offense is engineered what do you think they get here I think they go flat get buron the ball and go I mean thats what I would do just put everybody down I wouldnt ball scream and let him take the shot yeah if they ball screen theyre going to double team him now somebody else is going to have to make the play i keep keep everybody low go make your shot pull up have the two big guys get to the board I know what you want you want the point guard to win the game but what I want to do also is have some false action on the other side maybe a double stagger screen till you got three guys occupying one side of the floor to make them think were going to break sberry but allows one side the floor to be open for Mark to get this from a coaching perspective this is where you get to see Micah Shrewsberry full basketball catalog absolutely and a lot of it is at the next level hes got a lot and again for Michael Shrewsberry at the NBA level he can advance the basketball so hes got a whole catalog of plays to run from this exact spot which is why he goes across half you know you know what makes him a good coach now if the ball goes in yes Ive heard that he can run the best play in the world if the ball doesnt go in its not good now lets also remember there was a 5sec call the last time Alo was taking it out right in front of Cruz theyre going to get it to Burton theres Burton s seconds Taylor is there middle Brooks tries to help buron a pull up for the win off the rim horn sounds NC State a Applause winner that was a great great last
