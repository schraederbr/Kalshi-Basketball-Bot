just not shot to K canle they just havent shot the percentage that we expected coming in but that number will continue to grow these are two of the big ones Foster and Gillis seven and six for 21 respectively on the year coming in so great to see from the Duke perspective Foster getting the first three Cooper flag with a Duke foul for Seattle its Malik Arley uh Arlington Braden malado John cop the guards Malik G and Ma monre The Bigs of creeps two Miss free throws end up in a basket anyway its Gman the 68 sophomore from Seattle with the opening bucket same starters for Duke Foster and Proctor the more experienced back court the junior Proctor misses a three canle flag and malach best freshman class of the country those three are the headliners well see if Duke goes a little deeper oh a stuff attempt missed by Ma monre the Oklahoma State and Georgia transfer closing his career with Seattle he is the most high major level Talent on the roster former ESPN 100 Prospect Foster for kiple freshman from Wisconsin KH kiple feeds flag for three and off the iron tip by malawat out of bounds to the Red Hawks that thats the kind of open shot though that Duke has missed especially against those three top 25 opponents but its one you can live with thats a good shot you know kiple these teams are loading up on Cooper flag and K canle when they get into the paint that was a really good pass heres montree from the drive looking for GMA Seattle team thats won 20 games in each of Chris Victors first three years they were the champions of the CBI college basketball invitation last year a turnover here christopolis loses it to proor another open look for foster is around out Dukes first four attempts off from three well and thats what Seattles going to give up you know weve seen that with some of the lower major teams that that Duke has played Main Army all those teams are willing to give up threes and hope has an off hope Duke has an off shooting night to protect your paint and try to rebound all theado good score a division two transfer whips it to M creep his second threepoint attempt of the Year is off the iron the doubles 27 to9 each of John shires first two years and again they have blown out their three nonpower conference opponent speed Arizona by 14 on the road and lost in the dying seconds to Kentucky and Kansas on neutral floor Proctor pass intercepted a takeaway for the lead guard Malik Arington M into the body of flag and he scores it Matthew Alexander montree for an early Seattle lead Foster then in the canle a three for K canip Foster went right through Braden Applause Maldonado and again KH kiple has not sh he has shot it much better against the lower division opponents than the top 25 teams Duke has played in fact in the two losses to Arizona Kentucky kiple one of 16 from three but again in that Kansas game you go back and watch that game he had a lot of open ones with John which John sh said were good we can live with that those are eventually going to go yeah all for8 three but he was happy with the eight looks and he also loves what kiple can do as a distributor feeding malaks there really played a lot through KH kiple early in the season had eight assists in that Kansas game on Tuesday Le Aron I a host State transfer working it inside TOA around Mal watch and GMA draws the back of the iron heres Proctor five of Dukes first six attempts from three flag terrific Skip and Proctor cant connect you like the shots the Dukes getting early they open looks thats a great find out of that 4 five ball screen by Cooper flag to a guy whos shooting 50 from three you youve got to take open looks that threepoint shot for Duke has got to be a weapon come January February and March Maldonado gets hit and fouled by canle

watches e for only 9999 only at Metro Duke battle tested early coming off a 7572 loss to Kansas on Tuesday is Cooper flag and in that game playing 38 minutes all but 93 seconds heat was just 5 for n and we say just because well heres Cooper flag the number one Frenchman of the country most highly tatted recuit in years you look at a stat line like that Chris you see nine attempts for Cooper Fleck who is an unselfish guy does that feel too little or does that feel right I think looking at his number of shot attempts is looking at it the wrong way like youre not going to convince Cooper flag to take a bad shot like he is constantly seeking the right play I I think that number speaks to Kansas and how aggressive they were to get the ball out of his hands I also think big picture I think John Shire is looking for more ways creative ways to get Cooper flag and Khan canle the basketball I think theyre working too hard to get their shots I think theyre having to do a lot of stuff off of the dribble a lot shot creation I think its one of the reasons they are turning it over at a high rate I mean Cooper flag has 18 turnovers in their six games that numbers too high so I I think you know youve got to theyve got to know where their shots are coming from and youve got to get them in a scoring area more effectively Malik Brown try to set up flag here heres Isaiah Evans The Freshman with bricks a three John sh told us he was going to get Evans into the game early he hasnt played in the three big games for Duke but hes popped in the other three going five for 11 from three seon James to Lane transfer is Off the Bench as well brown with a deflection tried to save it and then he takes it away again this guys hands are everywhere he is a deflection master in the Kentucky Arizona and Kansas games he had 22 deflections in those three games remarkable number two steals a game in the first six for the Syracuse transfer flag pull up two off the window noo M mree with the rebound and I think thats a settle for Cooper flag its one of the reasons hes not getting to the foul line as much hes only taken about four free throws a game which is a low number given his usage and skill set that ball Flo up and in by Malik Arlington the Junior from Auburn in Washington and off the Maldonado free throws and the Arlington 2 Seattle back in front after 6 minutes Applause change proor and flag the two starters on the floor right now for Duke on a hard drive by Proctor will send him to the line going in on Huron Dan The Freshman from China you know Chris Victor Seattle head coach was talking to us about how his team seemed nervous during the shoot today they dont seem nervous to start this game and it helps that Ma mon creef with his high major experience was physical in his first take of the game first drive there by Malik Arrington he was Idaho State last year transfer out of the Big Sky Conference there is Chris Victor who was a junior college head coach at Citrus College was an assistant here before being named interim head coach right before the season in 21 got the fulltime job shortly thereafter and he told is his goal with this program is to become one of the best mid majors in the country theyre going to go to the West Coast Conference next year Gonzaga leaving but Seattle entering they feel like that league is a much better fit for them geographically likeminded institutions at 32 win seasons in a row this team a threat to make it back to the NCAA tournament for the first time in a long time of The Wack Harris tosson got tripped up kles on the floor Brown has the Duke takeaway heres seion James its been a little bit of a slower Tempo start at pass deflected out of bounds well thats been one of the things for a lot of teams you know Duke won that game against Arizona in a half court it it was impressive how Duke was able to control that game both in the half court defensively they dominated the glass and they were able to execute in a half court teams are getting back against Duke and forcing them to play in a half court kles back on the floor for Duke and flag gets a look from three here and missed it track down though for an offensive rebound by James and then flag air mails it into the Bread Basket of a young Cameron crazy another Cooper flag turnover and a miss three you know hes shooting 29 from three on the year hes actually shooting a better percentage in those Kentucky Arizona and Kansas games but I do think hes settling at times like I think he needs to be more aggressive about driving the ball and teams are going to start to DARE him to shoot theyre already starting to go under on ball screens if theyre not trapping them him out of them and I think teams are going to start to say okay make one of those before we change up what were doing with you you mentioned getting easier looks for him and kiple what are some creative ways Duke can do that I think in the post I I think you can post Cooper a little bit more such a good passer and if you force a double he can play out of that I think with Khan you know getting him to curl into the lane stuff like that you know where those guys can catch it with a live dribble and make a play out of there a little closer in the into the scoring area cattle off a vas aan takeaway against Evans Mason GIS on the floor for the first time for Dukes flag sits for the first time tonight heres mon Cree fifth year senior against The Freshman Evans and mrie is fouled on the floor Evans with his first Dukes third no its interesting like Arizona allowed Duke to really run their stuff in a half court and Kansas was not going to let them do that I mean they they showed a little bit of a blueprint in how aggressive they were to get the ball out of flags hands you know they doubled the post they sent two to the ball and thats what Auburns going to do Auburn is going to be physical and they are going to be aggressive theyre going to come in here on Wednesday SEC ACC challenge theres an offensive foul moving screen against the Freshman Dan hes picked up two quick ones and goo will replace him Duke meanwhile with the lead going on 4 minutes 6 seconds without a field goal for its last four for John Shys group eight of the 10 attempts have been from three heres another Gillis from canle Gillis misses another three and open looks is there a point at which you need to just be more proactive getting to the paint not in a game like this but yeah I mean and look Mason Gillis has to start hitting shots cuz its what hes in there to do he shot 46 at Purdue last year and he gives them nothing else I mean hes only averaging two rebounds a game a steel for canle gets tied up and Seattle will maintain possession with six to shoot the trip toan still

you know look hes a culture guy he Garners respect hes 24 years old but hes also 24 years old oh like at some time at some point hes got to wake up cuz thats what hes out there to do is space and make threes hes hes not necessarily A Plus Defender hes only averaging two rebounds a game so hes not giving him a whole lot and thats why I think we saw Isaiah Evans early tonight you know give him a shot see if he can you know make a play and the top seven for Duke has been driving this year with James and contributing Off the Bench Gill been a little slow to start Evans got in there early had struggled tonight Seattle back to the line here there Red Hawks have scored now for their 10 one for two for Victor raikovi in a 1010 game 8 and 12 minutes gone by Dukes last field goal came about 5 minutes ago the malawat layup Foster in the paint lost the ball to Steel the senior Paris a the transfer from Portland State had Brown and Proctor sandwiching him and then Foster fouled about 7 ft for the basket by Maldonado Malik Brown with a terrific chase down for Duke but it started with a Duke turnover you know once again just penetrating into three guys as Seattle collapses their defense Malik Brown makes so many plays like I dont know if hes going to get a block shot on that or not its kind of a vient play that he makes he just such a force multiplier when hes out there has he fit the role you expected him to so far yeah I think so in Spades and he gives him you know he gives him a different look than malawat like malawat obviously know lob threat Rim protection whereas Malik Brown really good defensively versatile you can switch and then hes a very good passer on the defensive end Duke back on front on a canle jumper their first Basket in over 5 minutes Gman to the left hand no rebound Applause Gillis Foster nearly overthrow it for Gillis who recollects for Duke as malag back on the floor after the good minutes for brown great vision by Foster and kiple in the corner drains it the spacing for Duke is excellent and has been all year and as poorly as theyve shot it overall they are all still threats none more than kiple eight of the 15 so far mrie a really difficult shot in plays the angle off the window four points for ma monrie out of Toronto its cut by kiple hell force it up miss his first Miss today after three for three start its got to be a l toala watch alado in the corner mrie his third threepoint attempt of the year hes doubled his season output miss both and a reach in foul against pona KH canle and a Milwaukee Wisconsin Gatorade Wisconsin player of the year first two games of his Duke career it was like this guy is going to be a lottery pick hes the big surprise of the freshman class and hes got a little colder sense though he had some big threes late against Arizona but he did go a little unnoticed in this incredible fresh but class and very quickly to talk to folks who are at due practices preseason they were blown away by kipo and he has been much more than a shot maker for them in the early going well he was 0 for eight in that game against Kansas and still controlled the game for for Duke malan good side for Proctor with a two its important to remember two like Jared McCain last year started Dukes first four games two for 13 from three and then went on a tear Christos passes up to three this is a Duke team that has been mainly excellent defensively this year second in the nation adjusted defensively efficiency only to Tennessee Arrington and a foul there with six to shoot will send Malik Arrington to the Applause Music line its the one thing that you know so far Seattles been able to turn the corner you know thats where I think Dukes Defense John shy telling us today like he feels like all five of those guys

tickets on sale now there is a great basketball Tradition at Seattle University Small Jesuit school Capitol Hill Seattle U you go back to the 50s and 60s this was one of the programs in college basketball 11 trips of the tournament made it to the 1958 title game led by a guy named Elgen Baylor one of the greats in NBA history Johnny OBrien a twotime AllAmerican had a thousand Point season and then the early 70s Financial losses for Boeing which laid off tens of thousands of workers in the city it was known as the Boe bust it really crippled the region it crippled the school in a lot of ways and Seattle moved all the way to the ni 20 years air back to D2 in 2002 theyve been in division 1 since 2012 the slow climb back theyre going to the West Coast Conference next year maybe not getting back to the days of el Baylor but there is great tradition theyre hoping to ReDiscover as brown misses a three for Deke rebound to Kipper flag will pass up a three and flag gets hooked before the shot you know I was I was doing some reading today about Elgen Baylor I didnt realize in 196162 he was an active duty Army reservist stationed at Fort Lewis which is actually in the state of Washington and he played for the Lakers on weekend passes so he couldnt practice before the season or during the season he would just play for the Lakers on the weekend and he averaged 38 and 19 now are you serious thats insane thats old school right there man that should be a 30 for30 alen Baylors weekend side hustle scored 4020 Patrick gungas on the floor for the first half the Duke and he is fouled by GMA after the takeaway and there was a period of time where in the 60s where Seattle as you look at the foul on GMA was churing out NBA players at a rate as high high as anybody at the time by the way shout out to my peeps at Fort Lewis Washington a beautiful Army Post in the Seattle area I I believe its north of Seattle okay Brown another threepoint try thats tipped by flag kiple throws it right through the wickets of Dawson in Seattle has possession and they dont have it for much longer steal for kiple and then Brown got bumped by Dawson it will stay with Duke you know its interesting both these teams coming from Vegas and Duke evidently had a little bit of trouble travel delay when they were coming back Seattle has been here they flew right from Vegas to Durham its not to make an excuse but both teams a little bit slugish here to start this game well in this first half I thought it was the turkey but I think your reality may be more accurate theres Cooper Flags first bucket after no for three start number one freshman in the country Cooper flag and this is the largest lead for Duke it has been a very slow expansion of that lead theyve held Seattle to 4 for 14 shooting and six turnovers and Seattle now 0 for for five from three Mont creep with a foul got entangled with flag M Mont creep with his first this where Coopers got to be aggressive I mean this is again against a really good defender in mon creef plays through the contact and then heres the box out on Music Applause Music Mon up close and personal with a graduate student and thats the Seattle F so one1 for Cooper flag thats the one thing Ds physicality has been tested I mean you know you look at Kentucky and Kansas those those arent just old teams they are grown men teams and you know you hear mathematically Duke is the tallest team in the country but theyve got young bodies like theyre not a big team in fact Kansas look just more physical and bigger than Duke when you watch that game hey Cooper Flags going up against Hunter dickon whos literally 7 years older him Harris Adams the physicality of Kansas Duke hung in there theres a foul as G out for the drive and Josh CH told us like my freshman year our first road game was in January weve already gone to Arizona played Kentucky in Atlanta played Kansas in Vegas so youre a competitor or you want to win yes but he feels like the freshmen have showed such great Poise in these big games and theyve come back from a couple of deficits to take late leads as well well that was the most interesting part about talking to to sh today is he said I I felt great after the Kansas G like cuz John understands cuz this was his process to a national championship as a player the force of winning is cumulative it is built up over time like John lost as a freshman in the NCA tournament to VCU he lost in the second round in the NCA tournament to West Virginia then he lost in the sweet 16 to Villanova by his senior year like he had prepared to win a National Championship youve got to do that now in a shorter time taper like hes got Cooper flag one year youve got to speed up that timet flag gets his way to the rim physically is the third on so the schedule for is that a good way to accelerate that timetable for flag and maybe a couple of others who might be wanting done no question because Dukes going to be in a tournament and frankly theyre going to play games in the ACC that are not going to help them and I also think just as a fan I think John understands and Bill self understands and Hubert Davis understand that as the head coaches at those programs they bear a responsibility for the good of the game they have to play those games Duke has to play Kansas in fact Id like them to do it as a home in home Duke going to fog Allen or vice versa thats awesome saw that with Carolina this year they went to the fog Kansas will go to UNC next year Duke in Arizona finishing a home and home the lead is 10 off the free throws for Cooper flaggers four for four at the line Seattle without a field goal now for more than 4 and 12 minutes tried to hang in there at the free throw line where theyve hit eight shots but theyre four of 15 from the field deep clock again James guarding the ball smothering Arrington a very difficult two and gunga tips it right to montrief whos now 0 for two on Applause dunks right watch the spray for proor flag on the roll flag flips it for James and Cooper soars in for the offensive rebound and he is fouled great activity relentlessness from Cooper flag there was a great kick out to seeon James again the converging defense Seattles willing to give up that three he makes a great pass but hes a multiple play guy like hes never out of the play and thats how you define competitor like we weve heard that a lot and its so true true about him a competitor is never they never dwell on what just happened theyre constantly on to the next play how can I impact winning and thats he is the personification of that foul was Maldonado second its another one and one for Cooper Applause flag now four for five at the line but Dukes going to keep it B watch on the floor with James Proctor flag and then more first half minutes for Evans James is given plenty of space thats a long two Tommy lisy signals to the scores table will be reviewed at the next break at the moment of deep two in Dukes lead as it doz Applause it JS has been awesome defensively tonight big physical guard at 66 225 mree malage contest that shot mres looking for a foul hes all alone on the other end of the floor doesnt get back in the play and it leads to an open three which Proctor Applause misses Dean Stevens will hoist one from deep and hit Seattles first triple not sure where that is on the play sheet for Chris mcor SE James look surprised flag fouled again El whistle hell shoot two more so Cooper flag getting to the line more but finally Seattle hits from Deep Dean Steven

Liberty Liberty Applause Music Applause liyy many we got many Music Applause Play Station Music Applause Music Applause in the wilderness fearless and human Savage o the new John sh told us before the game they need Caleb Foster to be more aggressive more assertive Good Start Chris in the second half yeah you know Caleb has played well against the lower major teams that Duke has played you know hes he was put into that point guard position this year and he just hasnt he has been a nonfactor in the games against Kentucky Arizona and Kansas you know he hasnt shot it well hes two of 11 from three he hasnt shot up a good percentage from the field and John Shire today kind of took to tone said look hes got to be hes got to play better you know we need more from Caleb Foster hes a key guy for us weve heard enough about recruiting rankings probably the last a lifetime for this D Freshman Class Foster was number 24 player in the class last year very talented young player M creef shot stood up there the teeth of the Duke defense and Foster the first two baskets of this second half as duke has opened up its largest lead Proctor gets a switch on Mon terminated the dribble theyve got flag against Maldonado and they couldnt get it to him and then a moving screen against Mal so on Foster weve seen canle and flag as primary ball handlers often as we look at the moving screen again its sort of a chicken in the egg situation Id love to know your take is it those guys are handling because Foster is not playing as well or is Foster not playing as well because those guys are handling more no I think the the handling from those guys is a product of the offense they play they play what is called a flow game which a lot of teams are playing now which is five out theres a little bit of structure but its mostly giving players you know the freedom to make plays and in that your two best players are going to have the ball a lot and so thats how Khan and Cooper end up with the ball and I look I do think theres some deferring from these other guys which there should be the other thing with Caleb Foster you have to understand last year was really a lost year I mean he was in and out of the lineup he got hurt he didnt start working out until August or at least practicing so he didnt even really have a summer so I think hes still working himself back in and that foot injury early and then the stress fracture in the ankle at the end of the year we have started every game this season malado shot grab by flag Cooper will drive it into Maldonado this time Outlet is Foster again and malawat just overpowers Maldonado who has called for his third Music foul malawat is such a weapon hes just different you know and hes hes playing about 19 minutes a game the question is can he get up to 25 I think thats you know a big part of their ceiling as well hes just theres nobody like him you know the way he blocks shots his his verticality at the basket just threw it off my cre and stay with to remember I mean going back to that Kentucky game malawat went for 10 points and seven boards he played 22 minutes in that game before he got cramps if he stays in that game that score may end up Applause different M watch with a quiet night so far 4 and three and 11 minutes flag will get it to him thats not quiet thats different and thats that high screen roll we saw a lot against Kansas in the middle third of the floor so between the two elbows canle and flag and then the extra pass from flag to malow watch and a fourth assist for Cooper its tied for the team lead in assist with kle mree against kiple spitting around him in flag and malat good distribution but golma couldnt finish and heres flag again great find in transition and a bror three thats a weapon Tyrese Proctor stays hot now youve got that third score guy whos going to stretch the defense and a nice job just sort of lazing into the play so kind of following the play catching it in Rhythm kids all across the nation just heard you say nice job lazing and they say Mom Dad see I can do whatever I want put Little Black Friday lazing theres a lot of that going on today oh hes lazed into taking the trash out Steven the offensive rebound a fresh shot clock for Seattle which has yet to score in the half christop is being bombarded by The Crazies not sure he meant to pass it to Stevens who then rattle out a two and it stays with Seattle theyve yet to score the half a Duke has nine flag nice pass here he lazes into it be quick but not in a hurry Tyrese Proctor lazy day after Thanksgiving

which opened January 6th 1940 Duke took down Princeton in the AIL game here probably right around the time that Batman was developed by DC Comic 1940 Good Sense Seattles not scored in the second half I might want to do that 0 for seven to start Dawson wants a ball screen from Steven and he goes nowhere with it Stevens heres a three for panja no whos got James and Gillis in the game with brown canle and Applause proor and the foul against Seattle was Paris Dawson hitting the deck all right Duke is up big 21 points 1508 to go youre coming off of Kansas you have Auburn coming up what is important about the next 15 minutes for John shy well youd love to see if they could get into a rhythm making some perimeter shots you know this is one of those games you know a Get Right game where maybe you can get into a little bit of a rhythm with some game shooting especially you know a Mason Gillis A Caleb f these guys who havent shot well and then you you know you throw Isaiah Evans back in the game see what he gives you and dont get anybody hurt kle had a great find there Proctor came up short after the cut Malik Brown just loves playing defense for 90 ft hell lay off Arrington and theyll take the ball in monre heres vas a panja again fouled by Proctor third of the half on Duke and Proctor first you know its its also worth noting for Seattle theyre playing without Kobe Williamson yeah I mean you call the first foul there was two hands on the ball handler its a good call theyre playing without Kobe Williamson whos a 68 he really anchors their defense but a veteran guy that they have had to play without alltime leading shot blocker at Seattle average 96 rebounds blocking a half the game last year should back in mid December from a foot injury Dawson end of the shot clock violation turnover number nine there is Kobe Williamson at the big curly red hair its really unfortunate we missed him on the floor tonight I mean thats that is a good look right there serious flow thats like Carrot Top Plus from Kobe Williamson its about a nine on that stash too proor slicing and another foul thatll be Mont crees third so free throws coming for tyres Proctor Music

first several years of the ACC deal in an agreement to join the League not taking the revenue share and R last his Mustangs just beating everybody anyway deep three no good from Mal denado and rebound to jams pretty good basketball start as well Andy infields at SMU coming over from USC killis fakes the three Evans into the game first time of the half another Miss 7 for 26 from three for Duke Towson travel Seattle at 25 points in the first half half and Seattle continues to have 25 points nearly 7 minutes into the second there are some cute babies in the F section so they got that going for them and you said this early I cant remember when you said this been a long day but its a memory youll soak up right if youre a Seattle player fan coach maybe not tonight it is a memory that youll carry as GBA cant finish for the rest go like to come here to go to Cameron but as a competitor it probably doesnt feel that way right now it didnt for me I mean I you know we played here twice when I was at Army and lost by 40 plus both games and so you know in the moment its its a little bit embarrassing you know you you kind of drinking Cameron during the shoot around but youre certainly not doing it during the game youre just trying to keep your head above water and you said it I mean you know any no competitor wants to lose like that but later in life to be able to say you played in this building against Coach K against the great teams that we played against yeah I mean thats when you you certainly appreciate what this is and you were notably a pregame player to watch on one of those broadcasts from Dan B Dan B killed me thir the broadcast theres your 17th career start Evans RM rocker more than just a shooter Isaiah Evans and Jos D is interesting saying today he has earned

state of North Carolina out of high school Isaiah Evans has eight heres a three for Dawson Applause though we look for Evans again on a fville North Carolina North meinberg High School James hard to the rack and a foul Seattle seon James has fit in so well here you sometimes forget he scored over a th000 points at two land I mean that thats what he Music did so strong though I mean they just dont Duke has not had certainly in recent vintage a lot of guards that look like seon James John shy loves him for a lot of reasons one of them he told us is he can play James as the only guard on the floor he can play James with Foster proor on the floor as well and doesnt feel like he ever loses Music size and that is a strong 66 220 for seion James there four years at two lane got knocked down by the Gomez screen there leads to a good look for three its misfired by Dawson was not on Dukes Radar really out of high school C J was not on a lot of teams Radars going to two lane which grew under Ron Hunter and has grown had a couple of good years in his four years there but Jay Lucas the associate head coach was a run one who really discovered James and he got into the transfer portal and and Duke was hoping to pick up another guard and they were happy he was the guard they found its funny I I came to watch them practice during the summer and I saw him for the first time and I I asked the will stens the strength coach for Duke I I said does does he need to lose some weight like is he too big and he said hes about 2 body fat theres nothing to lose I hes just literally all muscle in the American Conference he was the sportsmanship Award winner backto back years did more than 350 hours of community service in tance you want a guy whos going to fit into your program on the court and a guy who will be a culture fit off it he is the perfect example of the good that the transfer portal can Applause bring well said he is a delight to talk to engaging Applause authentic see it with 1021 to go Arrington hit the first free throw all three points in the half have come at the line for C Applause allton despite the distraction of my cousin and the Harris Teter subth costume itsit Applause both I do have a lot of cousins so it wouldnt be shocking with one of them more costume what m i was one of eight see were finally getting to the bottom yes this is have a seat on the couch on the roll Foster Miss flag and then got a deflection and got it back now hes not going to miss him oh and flag missed it a Applause Calamity theres a wild drive by Arrington Coopers got the rebound Foster Applause again Midway through the second half Duke has allowed Four Points in the half all on free throws and count that bucket for come on malach Dawson with a foul it was actually a nice effort to come over he read the play Paris Dawson and just late and its certainly for the way theyre calling that now you know since they changed the rule last year Kevin that charge rule you are much better off coming over and playing it with verticality than you are taking a charge you are much less likely to be called for a f vow if you come over vertical if you you try to come and take a charge 95 of the time youre going to get called for a block what do you notice about the way players have driven the ball in the last year plus I actually its a good question I I dont know I the thing I have noticed about the change in the rule is that officials are airing much more side on the call on the side of calling a block than they were the alternative of the old rule calling it a charge in other words I think officials are scared I was doing a game the other day FAU and seatan Hall clear charge I mean easy charge and the officials looked at each other and it took him like a count of five Mississippi to make the call so I I think its had more of an impact on officials was that charge drawn by fa or seen Hall do you remember just wondering if it would have been a pirate blockade heres Seattle rovic is three on the last possession was their first field goal of the half came at the 918 Mark and then the 14th turnover on the next Applause one Im just baiting you into dad jokes and you will not respond Ive got a great pirate joke that if this gets to to 30 maybe Ill Ill break out the pirate joke its solid you dont think everyone in America was watching the game you broke it out in the Charleston Malo watch for three no this is a rarity for D they got malat and brown together on the floor you know its actually it hurts you cuz neither of those guys can shoot it although Malik Brown did make a three against Kansas but what you could do defensively with both of them together is an interesting idea they each hit one three on the air now Brown going to try you know what 26point game work on some things Dawson on the deck gets rid of it heres Mont creef Seattle one made field goal in the half and Mont creef is tied up so hell shoot a one and Applause one I actually you know the three that Malik Brown Music Applause made me its a foul but hes you know thats hes close there hes coming out to make a play the the three that brown made in the Kansas game was his first of the year and I actually at the time one it led it was part of Dukes run I think they either tied it or took the lead but it was a big shot for him to make cuz Kansas wasnt guarding him and and thats what teams are going to do especially when hes out at the top of the key initiating offense like he does so at least he keeps you honest maybe a little bit and I think I think coach shy has and trying to build him some confidence in at least trying that he hit seven at Syracuse last year seven for 19 so one for three this year monrie gets a free throws to go hes got eight two Leed by 12 and the half there plus 12 in the second kiple hes a shooter third three for kipos got 11 points and thats a good takeaway if youre Duke maybe that gets him on a little bit of a run here nice slip from GMA Dawson with a find GMA missed at The Rim kicks out to Cooper flag eight rebounds seven assists and there is a charge the rarely seen charge in 2024 basketball flag second Coopers got a big

appeared on his neck sometime in the second half up wel the contest but it felt like that is a pretty lengthy scratch and it felt like that play right before the break the charge was a little bit of frustration I me it wasnt wasnt a great basketball Applause play almost shooting a two for seven three turnovers but the nine rebounds seven assists so some good and back for flag in a seventh college

foul called on kiple is third Music Applause John sh does not Music agree yeah I I think John has a point in what hes saying to the official its the same call that Cooper flag got called for before the break and that was a charge on flag and I I think kiple was there in legal guarding position Mark cre now four for seven at the line Id be shocked if we see canle a flag again I know Seattles on a bit of a run here but I I dont think you need to to bring those guys back in this game 60 60 surge the 60 jog perhaps 6140 is the next game for Duke Wednesday Auburn comes to town SEC ACC challenge Auburn who has been arguably and maybe some would say not even arguably the best team in the country so far just blitzed its way through the Maui Invitational field flag Proctor Malo watchall on the bench along with kle thats another Auburn another grown man team and they are going to be physical theyre going to be aggressive I think youre going to see a game plan a lot like Kansas had with Duke ccle you know its interesting so many teams talk about how deep they are coming into the season you know were 10 Deep were this deep you get into these tournaments and these benches shrink Auburn remains deep I mean they play 10 dudes and none better than that guy I hes had a national player of the year starts of the Season Janai bro came back from 18 down against Iowa State and then really handled both North Carolina and Memphis if you read uh the Blue Ribbon yearbook preseason or talk to teams everybodys 10 Deep and heres the good thing for Duke they already kind of know what they are as James is foul well see where it shakes out with Gillis Evans maybe Patrick GBA gets in there but in the three tough tests they have played eight and the other games youve opened it up theyve played 10 11 or more but at least a core has already congealed because theyve been in those TP spots early on theyre seven deep and theyve been playing eight Gillis would be that eighth guy I think you know youre trying to can Isaiah Evans get himself in there does he give you maybe some scoring punch that Gillis is not giving you y Jeff Gundy always used to say every team can benefit by playing one less guy and especially in college when the games are only 40 minutes like you need your best players out there I wonder too is har 6 the free throw if in the days of the portal or its easier if you dont play a lot to just get out and transfer are we going to see many more teams like the old school Leonard Hamilton teams that legitimately would play 12 guys I wonder if that shrinks now because its just easier to say Im not getting playing time going to go somewhere El that will play me Harris here balls a three its a good point and I think some coaches feel like they they need to play guys in order to keep their attention but the fact of the matter is in this current climate you can play a guy 35 minutes a game and hes still made transfer so get John sh trying to manage this amazing sixman Freshman Class the veteran transfers Foster Proctor two team looking ahead to 5 and two leading 6440 with 5 and a half to go they have not shot at well 41 27 from three but theyve held Seattle to 23 and 20 from three chopis against Evans step back three and and no good strong rebound by Dan and hes fouled and the one thing that jumps out on the stat sheet for Duke can they foul less Seattles gone to the line 23 times today and that is the 19th foul against Duke in the game well its been something that Duke has done well now that Duke does not get to the foul line much but they have played their defense without fouling until tonight one of the strange early season quirks Dukes opponents are shooting 81 from the free throw line and tonight Seattles at Applause 83 soon therell be some regression to the mean there so youre holding the team responsible for how their opponent shoots from the B no Im not thats why I said it was a quirk I never said that I never said that roll the tape James into Dan no thats the 10th rebound for mrie who is on the verge of a fifth double double in seven games if we can get another Point Dan for Applause three good size goodlooking freshman who was on the under 19 national team for China hon Dan a lot of international flavor to the Seattle Team guarding gungo right now oh could not connect Dans going to be a nice player he he had a dunk attempt in the Ferman game that was it caught me off guard knocked the lights out in Vegas Christos no now the rebound Darren Harris has been the Freshman probably to played the least out of these six Gung only in his second game but he was coming back from a foot injury and John shy will take a time out Duke has not hit a shot in the last 4 minutes so try to close strong here on route to that big

the calendar when we have more eyeballs on the sport but I love that these two conferences are doing this and and you do get some really good matchups ACC right now Duke Carolina pit is off to a flying start be LSU won in Ohio State at the buzzer today is theres a miscommunication between Evans and gunba the next tier of the ACC that has been a talking point for a few years now what do you see early whos maybe in that four through eight range if were going to elevate Pittsburgh up to to Third Clemson I think will continue to get better and they typically do you know historically Clemson can struggle a little bit in nonconference they get better in conference play and then you know they make it El leite aim like last year I think Wake Forest will continue to get better uh their point guard play has not been great and as a result I dont think Hunter Salis has had the start that that we all expected but I think theyll continue to get better Dan got held by gillers for seven to shoot here was the preseason poll week farest did slip in there for first place vote feels like a an important year to get back to the tournament for Steve Forbes whos been so close seven and two the metrics did not love them Virginia and Miami for various reasons have both really struggled to start the year yeah I I had Miami down at the the Charleston classic uh theyve got a lot of soul searching to do they did not look very good at all and part of part of it is Nigel pack is not playing well and they just dont have a good fit the the super freshman they got jalo Betha has had a hard time acclimating threepointer missed by Evans Miami lost all three games in Charleston Drake by 11 Oklahoma State by six VCU by seven gumbo with a rejection on Mon Creek Patrick GBA playing his second college game number five Center in the class of 2024 guy whos been hurt hasnt really played but he is talented you talking to John Shire today he loves him and loves his potential told us hes not yet in full game shape because of the early foot injury but could find his way into the rotation more his M but the all time leading score at George Washington 2134 points Evans draws a contact Evans will get to the line try to snap a three minute scoring draft for Applause Duke well if the Hope was that Duke was going to get some shots going feel right seeing some threepointers go through the net before AUB that has not been the case because a 9 for 34 have shot it just 39 and to be fair credit to Seattle which has defended physically but if youre hoping to take away if for John Shire like your offensive mojo back obviously that hasnt put there tday yeah I I think again I think you have to look at the quality of the shots and this offense is creating open ones the problem is when they have played against more athletic the bigger teams the KY Arizona and Kansas thats when the yeah I mean but again against the better teams the shooting percentage has gone down and I think thats where you know creating shots within that scoring area for Cooper for Khan with some set stuff but they are creating open shots no doubt about that does 18 assists on 22 field goals even in a game like this feel particularly notable yeah the number of guys who have an assist tonight flags got seven of them Proctor four games in Foster 2 so seven different Duke players with an assist you know a good example I was talking to Trevor Marcus who is Dukes analytics guy and in the in the games against Kentucky Arizona and Kansas Cooper flag had eight assists combined in those three games but they they track potential assists so basically he throws it to a guy whos open and that player misses the shot he actually had 24 potential assists huge Ovation for Spencer hubard who will get into the final 206 a senior walk on going to hold that against Spencer Hub forever I was making a point there Spencer the ered had to stop it Double Nickel came in mon by the way fouled out was should have go so his double double streak to end the year uh start the year will end nine points 12 rebounds for ma Applause montree well now you know the whole crowd is going to want Spencer to get a shot up Harris would like to get some up as well you got three freshman in the floor plus Gillis and hub GBA against Dan and he finally got it to drop Patrick gungo first basket tonight thats the one thing you hear about gunga is hes got really good hands and Good Feet and he showed you there an interesting little battle late in the game GBA and Dan two talented freshmen GBA grabs the airball here and hubard take it across the timeline with 70 seconds to go the lead notably its 26 for Applause Duke Evans three in and out one minute remaining SE get to head back home after this long road trip Dan fouled who run Dan to the line for two more the Seattles 30th and 31st free throw attempts of the game Seattle if it doesnt hit another field goal will end this 40minute game with nine made field goals they have scored 23 of their 44 at the line and Dan adds another Applause this is going to help Dukes second ranked defensive efficiency in the country as theyve H Seattle the 196 shooting hubber no left it on the Applause 10 Dawson theres the 10 main field goal for Seattle in the Red Hawks 43 and well look to see Seattle does in whack play try to dethrown Grand Canyon which has been hard to do but ultimately Duke is going to come out of this with a victory shake hands before the games even over well thats sportsmanship a grinded out Black Friday Affair Duke wins it 70 to 48 and next on tap for John shers Blue Devils two days
