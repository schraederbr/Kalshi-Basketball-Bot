told you about Matthew Cleveland and the numbers hes put up for Leonard Hamilton what a career 21st year as the head coach of the Knowles looking for win number 400 as an ACC coach and overall Mike looking for his 600th career victory at the college ranks and hes had a theme throughout that all Tom and hes had very tall teams this is the third tallest team in the nation theyre kind of sneaky tall but nobody on the roster is shorter than six five now they are young as well overwhelmingly the youngest team that Leonard has put on the floor is the head coach of the world and this is uh the defense that Georgia Tech is going to give you multiple looks and look how active they are in their space trying to work it inside and that one will drop in so nice roll for Cleveland to get us started thing is that its a lot shorter bench due to injuries than Leonard Hamilton normally uses so youre going to see guys in the high 30s absent foul trouble threepointer from the corner and there is the three from Miles Kelly theyre 40 and hes just been on a roll as his numbers in ACC play really good overall just about 18 points a game Georgia Tech made nine threes in the win on Wednesday against number 12 Miami 7670 shot 41 as a team inside a 10 on the shot clock for the Knowles and the Baseline comes up short from Cleveland second effort and thatll fall Tim you look at the guy you say hows he averaging the double double and theres an example of it right there just has a nose for the ball hes six seven doesnt overwhelm you physically but always knows where the ball is big game on the schedule for Cleveland he is from Atlanta Georgia and that jumper thats Kelly again same spot how about how about lets Im going to run there until I miss all right Florida state is four and 11 as a team on the season and thatll work from the corner for three Conrad hits it this is Fourth of the year three of 18 coming in and uh but you know theyre going to need some outside production but this Florida State team is not a its not a big part of their offense most recent game for FSU was last Saturday at number 16 Duke and a loss 8667 they only made four threes in that game against the Blue Devils Moores turnaround soft touch and this one thing Josh pastner talked about in the offense getting post touches uh this Florida State team is going to switch everything and Georgia Tech plays the princetonstyle offense but they want to look inside out chairman Moore hit double vintage in the win against Miami with 10 points and six points and he goes up for that rebound right now as a Florida State not getting a lot inside outside of that offensive rebound and wow Debo Coleman he was in Rhythm and Pullman who shoots 33 percent from Beyond The Arc made two threes in the win against Miami on eight tries that Ward really describes Georgia Techs offense in the first three minutes here in rhythm slowly inside double team second effort from Corin throwing away with Howard on the Block initially great save by Kelly Applause Music Georgia Tech Mike has not missed so far 44 and that includes three threepoint baskets belly reversing field and laying it in uh just really putting it all in display here a couple of Threes to start off with and then the great drive inside Miles Kelly who leads the team averaging 14 and a half points per game that pass deflected Coleman comes up with it Georgia Tech just completed a fourgame homestead with the win against Miami you know and that when that win with this lineup Josh passner went deep into the first half before he made a substitution no reason for him to change here eight points for Kelly so far wants to add to the total and he will long range threepointer Miles Kelly and corn and you know what Leonard Hamilton couldnt wait for yet a timeout coming under 16 and just wanted to stop the run right there but how about Miles Kelly Im gonna start to the afternoon for him he got the early wakeup call and two in that same spot from the left corner and he got really great looks on these Tom how about the lead for Georgia Tech built early 167 on the road Music the road early in the first half against the Seminoles Miles Kelly a big reason why has not missed so far today and has connected on all three of his threepoint attempts 11 points for Miles Kelly thats now 10 straight games double figure scoring after 20 points on Wednesday against Miami Mike and that takes us right to the Ford keys to the game jackets and Knoll yeah and Josh passner talked about limit the live ball turnovers you know what those uh things out front hes gonna he wants as many dead ball turnovers as possible and for Florida State its a changing Zone its a little different than anything theyre going to see and uh so far stymied a little bit with it in the half court you know Florida state has missed its last three shot opportunities Georgia Tech is on a 70 run and leading 167 they have not been able Florida state has not been able to get inside of this Zone Mills sends it into the corner green shot clock at eight Applause thats a good way to loosen things up not a great threepoint shooter either weve seen two guys who dont have great averages knock those down but Georgia Tech this zone is more compact than it was against Miami Tom and I I think theyre just gonna theyre gonna try and test Florida State to knock down threes Florida State good to see you Worley hitting that three struggled against Duke three points and four rebounds in 29 minutes as a starter shot clocks down to three Moore was spinning the whistle goes against Georgia Tech offensive foul on that time on Jalen Moore inside Music alleyoop attempt and traffic knocked away from Cleveland good read that time by Rodney Howard in the back of the zone we saw that Miami tried to go to that early in the uh in the first half that lob over the Zone inside Josh Pastor throws so many different defensive looks at you was a concerned of Jim larenagan and sure enough it happened during the course of the game and it changed you got Kelly out front its a oneman front and then they go back into a 23 and it just morphs into different things worthy with the shot block inside of 10 trying to thread it to Cleveland that was kicked shot clock reset to 20 with 1424 the game clock Georgia Tech is 86 overall they had mixed up the lineup until today where they went with the same lineup from Wednesday in the victory against Miami and the 76 points the most in an ACC game early on in the schedule for Georgia Tech three losses in the 50s scoring Applause angular rebound to warley front rim Georgia Tech comes away with it and more well and the one thing this Zone has done is cut down on Clevelands touches in a congested area and a foul and this is where Lance Terry we talked about his game against Miami 24 points for him a season High two off a career high but he got really involved when he was able to get out and run the open floor and he had a nice look ahead that time so Lance Terry the 24 points just two below his career high of 26 he is a transfer from GardnerWebb where he spent three years in that program and I think you talk to the coaches and its its you know you come from that program this is not a slight in any way but to catch up to the size and speed of athletes in the ACC its taken me a little while but hes certainly caught up against Miami and he only had a high of nine points and ACC play prior to the game Wednesday against Miami but Tom three games total 18 points yeah so Lance Terry found the right chemistry with his teammates and that is the three Applause Caleb Mills right now youre getting some threes some unexpected places but thats good news for Florida State Mills with his 10th three of the season Howard had nowhere to go Terry is wide open for a threepointer doesnt get the bounce Howard offensive glass so there is a player shaking up for Georgia Tech as well Jalen Moore on the other side of that but nice offensive rebounding position by Howard foreign just got inside of everybody four white jerseys around him and he comes up with the ball so there was no foul on the play inadvertent whistle our officials Bill Covington Jr Jeffrey Clark and Trey stions thats ridiculous Kelly I mean that was like 30 feet on a direct pass inbounds youre gonna have to extend out a little bit on number 13 that is four for four threepoint distance thatll creep over the front rim how about the quick steal by Cleveland just great anticipation Georgia Tech getting a little casual with that ball to lead down to four through Georgia Tech that happened so fast I dont even know if the crowd understood what happened yeah Ellie he hits another one in the lane right now Georgia Tech has missed one shot as a team and Mr Kellys perfect 16 already so Kelly has made four threepointers thats just one below his career high degrees of the game with five four and back irons onehanded rebound from Jalen Moore who leads this team in rebounding almost six per game for Georgia Tech Applause Music Georgia Tech finished that game against Miami on a 120 run as Kelly picking up where he left off from Wednesday that was tapped by Mills somehow went over to Moore with the shot clock winding down and he was fouled deep into the shot clock so free throws coming up for Georgia Tech and Miles Kelly is six for six and four for four from Beyond 22 feet one and threequarter inches away Kelly 16 points to lead everybody in the first half foreign no matter who you root for we can all identify with the best in Smart Home Security CPI bring in the new year with CPI and well include your choice of three free Smart Security devices CPI Security identify yourself at Dominos were tipping you three dollars for order today five of six on threes for Georgia Tech they only average about six and a half threes per game Mike but and for Florida State thats not bad three of five I mean thats terrific for for them and thats whats keeping them close but um see the we talk about Florida State as young as they are normally Leonard Hamilton would have gone to his bench four minutes ago and the same five guys have been in the game this whole time he will now bring in uh come in with nahima cloud a couple of fresh bodies out on the floor but this uh much later than he would normally substitute meanwhile Miles Kelly is six of six from the floor and 16 points Moore is at the freethrow line for Georgia Tech Applause 72 percent as a team 12th in the conference you would not know it from their previous game against Miami they only missed two and that was right at the end of the game and with 17 of 19 as a team against the Kings from the freethrow line and thats been a strength for Florida State their freethrow shooting has been much better in conference but theyve yet to get there in this game 82 percent in the last two games from the line from Florida State one of the first hand touches theyve gotten by throwing it into McLeod and 74 bounces to Coleman Terry quick First Step pass McLeod did well not to follow him it spins off Applause three thought about three a nice transition defense that time Florida state was really looking to get an easy basket and they had to pull it out they got a three Caleb Mills Applause second three of the game for Mills Applause Hamilton talked to him yesterday at practice he felt like his team would shoot pretty well today for a pretty impression from uh the threepoint line anyway heres the look inside thats uh the nice swing and even that zone as active as it was thats a very clean look that Mills got Mills picked up the foul on the other end to send Coleman to the freethrow line for Georgia Tech Applause house comes in for Florida State and Morley will leave and these are the first substitutions for Georgia Tech 10 minute Mark in this half right Howard is leaving the game for Georgia Tech Smith has set the champion for the yellow jackets also on the sideline and one of the most intriguing Yellow Jackets the trifton Maxwell is going to come into the game didnt play the last two games thats an alley up to Cleveland Music and Josh pastor we just started with Miami and he will go quickly to a timeout if he feels things slipping so after the Cleveland bucket its a fourpoint game again with 10 28 to go in the first well and Clevelands been hes been lingering in the back of that zone looking for this he seals the guy on the back side and its a pretty thats a nice pass good delivery by Tom house Clevelands got eight points four five from the floor very quiet eight point but thats how he is I mean hes a very you know quiet player in the middle of that huddle Matthew Cleveland the sophomore from Atlanta Georgia had the DoubleDouble and the loss at Duke in their most recent game with 18 points and 10 boards seventh career double double and theyre gonna look at Tristan Maxwell and also Mike yeah son of Vernon Maxwell played at uh Florida and then was on the championship team with the Rockets I played against him at the end of my career hes kind of the heart of his career as he was walking off right after their preshoot around he hit a three from half court I was just I just happened to be watching him and hes had games like South Alabama or Alabama State and 18 points in that game knocked down a bunch of Threes lets see if he heats up here a little bit yeah that was a season high he has made six threes in total on the year seeing action in his 11th game missed the game against Virginia with illness did not play against Miami Music Applause with a twisting shot defense is stiff enough on him a lot since that quick start first Miss for Miles Kelly house Cloud its got a Long Reach but not long enough I thought Davon Smith was also a nice spark bike in the second half for Georgia Tech against Miami yeah he had some theres some big baskets down the stretch offensive rebound put back seniors in Loganville Georgia to transfer from Mississippi State scoop no good Kelly hit the deck and it is Florida State basketball weve got a taller cover on Kelly hes having to force his offense a little bit Georgia Tech is led by as many as nine in this first half Sturtevant coming in for Georgia Tech Kelly out getting the Breather has missed his last two shots 16 points leads all scorers Kyle Sturdivant the senior from Norcross Georgia into the lineup for the yellow jackets take it away Lance Terry yeah Perry hadnt scored prior to that three didnt I see a guy get rewarded he had a good defensive play on one end and then just hes going to run to the threepoint line in transition 39 percent from the threepoint atmosphere for Lance turret he made four out of five on threepointers in the win against Miami pretty led the way with 24 points on Wednesday hes at home steal from Georgia Tech two turnovers on two plays Mary had a steam tough angle follow came up short right at the edge of the rim for Franklin and now Cleveland to pull up thats also front rim Applause 12 end to end action and Cleveland wants to slow it up just a bit maybe not a cloud inside and thats fun out an offensive goaltending good call Applause official Trey stions was all over that so the cloud gets credit for the basket thats been another staple of Leonard Hampton normally I mean McLeods got to be lonely hes the only seven footer on the team right now normally hes got two or three last year Mike they had ngom and Butler a couple of seven Footers Lucy Ballard was on the lineup as well all right Georgia Tech with the basketball from the traveling old gold one of their last seven from the floor they started eight of nine Applause Music shot clock at 10 for Maxwell over house wow the clearance hes certainly given himself a chance to score hes come in and been very aggressive and looking for his offense but everything is since that start things have been off the dribble for Georgia Tech not uh you know they havent gotten many good looks the cloud just reaching up for that one and slamming it down a couple of turnovers they threw a lot too low to him and theyre finally dialing in the range at 74 hes going to be able to go up Above the Rim and get it at the top of the box averages just over four points per game for Naim McLeod Junior from Philadelphia Pennsylvania who missed from Smith catch release and misfire from Green Applause Maxwell tries to fill the lane and find Franklin and it came to Mills green is their best threepoint shooter 22 in white with the basketball 43 percent the body of work coming into this game second of the conference McLeod trying to force his way against Franklin with the bump Applause and McLeod using his size on the inside Mills just kind of puts it up there and it hit the backboard and McLeod adjusting to it perfect look theres the angle and the double fisted Rim rocker from McLeod the smart choice in tires the Tucker Center and the Knolls trailing in the first half was 6 51 to go 2926 because theyre visiting Yellow Jackets time for Fresh Market discover the best presented by The Fresh Market and its Darren Green Jr Mikey shot it well but not today so far in ACC play no well you see 45 from three and uh but at 004 so far against the Zone has not found the range yet but uh you know one guy we havent talked about is Cameron Fletcher out now with an injury and he was their other big threepoint threat so thats a big hit for this team to try to overcome that and you know a couple of guys have stepped up but you know we talked about Matthew Cleveland thats not a real part of his game yeah Darren Greene Jr had 16 points in the loss at Duke of their most recent game for the Knowles you mentioned Fletcher Mike the injury in early December at Virginia the right knee and out for the season for Cameron Fletcher the sophomore from St Louis Missouri he had 23 points early on against Mercer double figure six of his 10 games that he played averaging about 12 when he got hurt thats deflected by Smith and out of bounds so Fletcher unfortunately a spectator hes a duck he was a doubledigit score led him in rebounding but again out for the season with a right knee injury suffered in early December at Virginia thats just losing all that production but also shortening the bench and other guys having to pick up those minutes theres green had another chance and still cant discover the best since hes come in the game McLeod has impacted this game theyve cut things off inside off defensively Miles Kelly is back into the lineup Laurie for Florida State Kelly who made his first six shots and that included four or threepointers Georgia Tech shooting 50 percent as a team right now and 75 percent from Beyond The Arc six of eight is a team four of those belong to Kelly well the other good thing is only three turnovers so far so theyre taking care of the ball into the corner Lance Terry nice look everybody drawn in thats where hes going to get it on those crosscourt passes against this defense that closes out pretty quickly second threepointer for Terry Music four of them against Miami now he tries to guard warly shot clock at 10 for Florida State Music Applause Music five Cleveland the fake produces contacts well go to the freethrow line six seven got him up in the air and its just an old mans game and I mean that with all due respect so Howard picking up his first personal Cleveland at the free throw line 76 percent of the season and we have a moment now lets get a message from Coyote Tractor one experience if you work the land youve got to be a jack of all trades you got to have a little bit of optimism a whole lot of getgo Smith wants to run it back the other way finds Coleman launching a three rattles out to Mills then we had a collision McLeod and Smith took the worst of it and hes going to get called for the foul its kind of running back and he was trying to it looked like he was trying to get in front to get to Mills and just got in the way of McLeod McLeod ran him over first on Smith Florida State four and four this season on its home floor 20 at ACC play wins against Notre Dame and Louisville both in December thats Cleveland again to see if they can get him the ball I think hes a terrific option in the middle of that zone just below the free throw line the ability to score there he can make some plays as well but theyve got to get him touches there coming off the DoubleDouble at Duke Cleveland was 10 of 10 from the freethrow line in that DoubleDouble against Duke team leader in points per game almost seven rebounds per game as well technically with Fletcher on the bench leading the team in that category as well five double doubles in his last eight games for Matthew Cleveland and as you mentioned Mike thats what he does in ACC play early on in the schedule averages a doubledouble against ACC opponents yeah and also I mean how many you know four straight now six men of the year for Leonard Hamilton you know because of that bench guys coming off and theyre you know they put up big numbers but hes continued to improve in this tournament with terrific starter all ACC caliber now they own that award over the last four years shot clock at 10 for Georgia Tech were inside of five minutes to go in the first half and Smith fumbles it out of bounds right into the Florida state bench just lost concentration he was looking to see what he was going to do with the ball before he caught it but you know again its a dead ball turnover and you get to come back and set up your defense fourth turnover of the half for Georgia Tech four states won three of its last five games they went one and nine to start the season warley well heres the thing and this Zone has really locked in on Darren Green and he is a little out of sorts right now tough shot from Smith and good job defensively but its going to be interesting to see that theyve locked in on him and I think theyre going to just theyre gonna continue to test Florida States other threepoint shooters first points for Damon Smith Applause Cleveland on a rim Fender from Mills Applause nice job finding him in the back of that zone couple of lobs now quick shot from Kelly at the other end Mike I think he wants to regain the Rhythm he had early on in the half Mills with a wide open three McCloud the onehanded rebound pass stolen by Coleman Kelly trying to get it back to Smith the foul called against Florida State thatll be warley picking up his first the alleyoop from Mills to the leaping Matthew Cleveland great look from behind the backboard its a fourpoint game the covid issues but hey you know thats the draw thats ahead of you and they took care of business in the final yeah they defeated Miami at the tournament as well and then the forefoot against Virginia got to the title game heres our game summary 3430 Georgia Tech took the lead at 87 and they have led by as many as nine it was just in the first three minutes of the game where Georgia Tech took the lead and we havent given it up Florida State hanging in there against the Georgia Tech Team Mike shooting 50 percent Florida State a lot more active especially in the zone denying those denying every pass students Terry just did get it away and then Cleveland pulls it in that was a nice defensive stand by Florida State their best of the game so far and win in the title game for Georgia Tech on Wednesday it was the first time theyd beat the top 25 team since that title game with their Victory against Miami number 12 in the nation this week thats a three out of the quarter from Caleb Mills Applause third threepoint basket of the game and its a onepoint difference yeah just good Patience by Florida State after that quick start this methodically have worked their way back into the game girl from the threepoint line Bob Mills Mike it only made nine threes All Season Cleveland Taps it green is able to grab it and theyre doing it Mike without green scoring hes all for five theyve all been threepoint tries no you just on this end of the floor they Georgia Tech very theyre really locked in on number 22 and even lofting into McCloud he put it on the floor Got Away With It scored the basket in the foul and Florida state is in front with 201 to go in the first half tell ya nahim McLeod has really made a difference theyre just throwing you could you can throw wherever you want to up there he is a head taller than anybody that Georgia Tech has out on the floor right now but thats a nice finish in the half court for the big fella from Philly the first Florida State lead since it was 76 early in this half from seven six to seven foot four standing on the freethrow line just to show his impact hes got 22 blocks and 220 minutes on the floor so you can get to that parts of that over 40 minutes its four blocks a game Applause just his seventh made free throw of the Season gives Florida State a twopoint lead inside of two minutes to go in our first half of play 77th alltime meeting Georgia Tech is working on a threegame winning streak in the series overall Applause inside of 10 for Kelly whos pulled off considerably from his hot start and there is an offensive foul this is really nice mantoman defense by Caleb Mills out front watch this just anticipates him going to the left hand steps over its just been a different Florida State offense or defense Im sorry in the last 12 minutes so Kelly to the Georgia Tech bench Florida state is on a 145 run to take the twopoint lead and stepping on the sideline was Mills and official Bill Covington right on top of that and Georgia Tech is going to take a timeout 129 to go for the first half and again Leonard Hamilton is 600th career win is a college head coach lets step aside for a moment with the Knowles in front of the yellow jackets Music where will your new Chevy take you this year anywhere Music find new experiences find New Roads wellqualified buyers get 299 financing on all 2022 Silverado 1500 pickups or get 2500 total cash allowance on this Silverado with a 27 liter engine plus current competitive owners get an additional 750 cash allowance that atmospheres starting to heat up inside of the Tucker Center with the Knolls coming back to take the lead here late in the first half done in three areas defensively and weve got coming up with driven with Leonard Hamilton yeah great conversation a little preview yeah you had with him always great to talk with Coach Hamilton one of the other two things Mike you were touching upon the um points in the paint 186 right now in favor of Florida State the McLeod coming in having the big impact there and then Dorsey threepoint shooting a little unexpected Florida State five of 13 as a team and threes Moore took a try at a three Franklin fighting with Cleveland and McLeod and Mills Florida State comes away with it Cloud three for three from the floor seven points and the average is about four per game bonus offense and now the final 45 seconds of our first half so glad that youre with us wormy jaminsky in our outstanding ACC production Group by himself picking up for green but he would have done in a half in the ropes Applause 15 points to lead the way in the first half wide open Coleman easy two one of the first Princeton style offense baskets theyve gotten that back cut he was wide open Cleveland is six of eight from the floor offensive foul on McLeod Applause so with 67 seconds to go in the half Georgia Tech will get the ball back maybe a chance for a little mini run here they had the basket they get the turnover here yeah Florida state had gone on a 145 run to take the lead theyre first since early in the half Sturtevant runs it up hell take the three three feet behind the line and miss Applause so Florida State connects on six threes Cleveland made one of them he has 15 points to lead the way and its Miles Kelly with 16 points for Georgia Tech but he cooled off considerably he is maybe Rodney Howard hes got two fouls didnt play a ton in that first early round it was very good but if McLeod comes back in theyre going to need his size I think that Franklin was a little overwhelmed by McLeod at 74 foreign starting lineup for back on the floor for Georgia second floor in the state Robin Howard has not scored for Georgia Tech thats a driving miles Kelly who hit the deck all kinds of contacts itll be Terry for Georgia Tech picking off the foul well you know we were talking about a little ironically hes trying to get restarted but Kelly didnt score in the last 10 minutes of the first half so he was aggressive looking for a drive early on here whirly on the inbounds it was the first foul on Terry Music for nobody knows this Howard with two is the only person really have known whos in any trouble for towards attack by the rim Coleman went to get it went out of bounds and it first indication yeah it is yeah was George attack and now its been changed Bill Covington Jr yeah he came in and played just the Stars Trey pointed the wrong way its all right it happens to the best of us hes joined by Jeffrey Clark and Trey stions are officiating crew and uh youre right Josh pastner didnt like the overrule but it was a good call Cleveland came up short despite scoring 15 points in the first half the most in the first half this season for Cleveland Terry missed sorted Howard so did more Applause early Cleveland touch pass inside the turnaround came off for the attempts that they follow it up Corin had a little trouble yeah he kind of threw his hands up I think he just wanted a stat stuffer to get the offensive rebound and put back but it was a nice it was a nice pass to initiate that sequence Applause Music Applause Coleman on the handle for Georgia Tech jackets of 40 for the game started making five of their first six threepoint tries on the Baseline the feed from Terry to Moore and he got fouled in midair mind you closer again that a product of the Princeton offense to the back cut along the Baseline Warren just picked up his third personal mic yeah but that may be bad news for Georgia Tech if they come back in well McLeod is at the scores table after the make for more lets get a message from Coyote Tractor from my experience if you work the land you got to be a jack of all trades you got to have a little bit off a whole lot of get together Applause McLeod back here to the lineup for Florida State seven points in the first half Mike three of three from the floor from the cloud now Moore is 44 from the freethrow line Cleveland trying to get free somehow able to put that one up on the rim thats the thing we talked about uh you know old mans type of game just creating space for himself and he was telling McLeod yeah run back down get back defensively Im a sophomore I can get up by the way yeah I gotta say the old man is a sophomore yeah runner from Terry misses well and this team he is an old man Applause Music Applause red shirt ears players stick around these days and change programs trying to keep it all straight here look at this see look how he creates a shot right there almost you know maybe got a foul and here he goes hes like go go go go I got this great replay just to illustrate the teamwork between the two uh get your seven foot four self back down in the paint green shot clock winding down hes in the box score and that was a massive shot for him you know youre youre a big time scorer like that and you throw a zero up at halftime and youre just waiting for that first basket Music Terry shot clock at 10 Kelly more preserving The Possession you know with McLeod in there he couldnt go back up with the offensive rebound Holmen fires a three maybe a timeout Zone if they score seven point lead Florida State green Music green got a pack in the corner seeing the cloud trying to establish position tapped by Worley and that goes out of bounds back to Georgia Tech the yellow jackets have missed their first six shots of the half they got a couple of free throws and now Smith will join The Fray for the yellow jackets remember they made their first nine shots in the first half and five of six from three Applause only made two threepointers since Applause again they havent been away from Atlanta in almost a month passed away game December 10th at North Carolina Terry on the drive he really has been aggressive in going at McLeod and thats what you have to do against the shot blocker but you know for for right now if youre Florida State you want to drive him off the threepoint line and make him score inside if he can so Terry joins Kelly as doubledigit scores for Georgia Tech and now three of nine from the floor for Lance Terry Worleys offline Terry goes high for the board Music Mills trying to close on Kelly a little isolation there for a moment its a little too much dribbling right now for Kelly trying to beat McLeod dribbled it into the floor and lost it yeah he had a mind to make that happen What A Catch by Cleveland on the pass from Mills time out on the court Applause how about the pass from Caleb Mills to Cleveland ahead of the field great hustle in two and a seven point lead Music its bow time thats not a phone in your pocket itself presented by your local Ford dealer Florida stayed at 50 percent shooting for the game and the advantage on the boards as well 2418 and that man number 35 is one rebound away Mike from his fifth straight DoubleDouble its a great knack for the ball you know and then where he uh sets up offensively done a lot on the Baseline theyve gotten some lobs to him his midrange game is good he has a knock knock for getting on the glass just tied his career high with eight made field goals for Matthew Cleveland his career high and points is 23 more Baseline strong move green rips it down even there I mean youre looking for McLeod to see where he is he affected that shot green got it back Applause Coleman pulls it in surveys the landscape pass was tipped by Green Mills up ahead to green and hell lay it in Applause that was youve talked about Josh Pastor wanted to limit the pick sixes that was a lazy pass by Coleman you just you turn over there against Florida State its going to be two points Applause powered with the ball for Georgia Tech Falcon went up against the Seminoles its going to be on Mills Goldmans pass was tipped Mills up ahead collaborates with green who lays it in Florida State by nine Music no matter who you root for dirty protecting the paint well and you know Miles Kelly was at the top of the scouting report for good reason and he showed for Statewide in the first 10 minutes six of six from the four since that time they played a little bit more closer attention to him hes missed his last five shots down there theyve really cooled him off coming off a 20point performance for the win on Wednesday against Miami for Miles Kelly as Mike mentioned made his first six shots still the leading scorer right now with 16 he and Terrier in double digits but hes missed his last five so all those points in the first half of Miles Kelly sophomore from Stone Mountain Georgia Applause oh yeah another steal Mills hands it off to Green what I tell you about that uh first basket Tom and uh just the things have really opened up for him he got knocked down the jump shot got a layup in the open court and now he feels back in rhythm grain hits his first three of the game thats Now 44 made threes he leads the team Georgia Tech turns it over again goes in with the right hand and a foul after the jam Applause my goodness a couple of really loose possessions and how about right into your living room Jaylen Worley Music over Lance Terry Georgia Tech by the way Mike just took its last time out of the half Florida State on a 90 run and its been all its been live ball turnovers exactly what Josh pastors worried about any just very loose at the ball and thats as good a finish as youre going to see Applause high flying Jalen Worley the 90 run over the last two minutes and 18 seconds Georgia Tech turning it over three times in this half and Coach pastor had to take his time out you want to stay tuned for the Ford fast break its presented by your local Ford dealer and its coming up here in the second half starring Mike tominsky the star of that last play was Jalen Worley sophomore from Mount Airy Pennsylvania has the crowd up and out of their seats here in the Tucker Center Music you know its if we saw we saw that the highlight of the you know the 21 agency with nobody in the building now we called some games like that during covid in a play like that we just saw would not precipitate a timeout because there is no reaction at all it was such a weird time but thats exactly the type of play that as a coach you want to calm down and uh Josh passers New Philosophy I mean hes going to burn his timeouts if he feels like he needs them especially for Florida State on its home court 62 percent on the season from the stripe Worley Florida state in the second half Mike seven of 13 from the floor Georgia Tech with the basketball now they are just one of each shooting in the second half so far Applause green picks up the foul first for him all of his points coming in the second half seven points for green just knocked down three moments ago hes the best threepoint shooter on this Florida State team and his turn with the ball has ten following up his 24 against Miami and he goes by McLeod and its you know theyre going to switch Florida State switches a lot and youre going to find matchups like that but still thats pretty aggressive take on the left hand off a guys 74 Terrys 24 the most by a Georgia Tech player this season Music New Orleans quick First Step around Kelly and the kick around Music taken by Smith on the turnover twoonone with Bowman hell try to do it himself offensive foul and that was green who had the position Applause heres the look and this is you know thats a big defensive play to make because it looked like Georgia Tech trying to make a little bit of a run to get back in the game a basket there cut it down to 11 so Coleman to the Josh Pastor bench and again that shooting has just cooled they were eight of nine theyve made five threepointers to start the game coach Pastor couldnt look for a better start to the game Mike right now hes feeling a little differently with 12 30 to go in the second half but you know thats not going to keep up but still to plummet to work theyve gotten is uh its a pretty steep decline Worley with the jumper 52 as a team in this game for Florida State that includes seven of 17 some threepoint distance against the top defensive team against the threepoint shot in the ACC in Georgia Tech yeah and if in this day and age if youre going to defend the threepoint line its a good place to start but Smith a nice answer Applause right here house with the ball Cleveland 19 points this leads everybody with those 19 corn back iron Cleveland wanted it a bit of a push off so the foul against Cleveland how about Jalen Worley just doing it himself individual effort over Lance Terry for the jam and the Knowles have the 5744 lead foreign I love to have one of my own Music the Tucker Center its tough for the opposition special in the ACC Mike the last seven seasons at home for Florida State their record is 516 and theyve got the lead 5744 and uh four of those losses coming in one year so they they had four seasons where they were undefeated here at home against ACC competition so this is a very very difficult place to play Music 20172020 undefeated home records for the Seminoles here at the Tucker Center opened up in 1981 Smith on the dribble Smith had two Florida State players get tangled up easy layup and I thought Howard did a nice job too of sealing some guys inside Florida State 20 and ACC play at home this is green stepping into a three Mike that was right online perfect rotation we had a great look at look at from Courtside you know thats the thing and then hes up there and he forces a turnover off of Georgia Tech amazing what happens when you start finding the basket but uh boy for Darren Green Jr and thats what I thought you know for Shooters the one thing you cant do is stop shooting you know 0506 or whatever you are and youre going to find the range eventually and have that Shooters Amnesia its got a couple of threepointers on eight attempted threes thats a distant memory the first half right now all of his points in the second half from Green Junior hes got 12 five of 12 from the floor overall after that driving layup 45 made threes for him thats the most on the team Terry Music difficult shot attempt on the drive green has started this game over five as Mike said come on strong again again remember me hes making the 3 3 layups Applause fall from just off right or Center too he loves that spot hes now got 254made Breeze in his career Mike as a transfer from UCF follow the attempted follow that was more this is the spot that hes spent most of the time with at the half and you know through the stretch that um Matthew Clevelands not been a huge part of it 19 points for Cleveland in the game Smith a little hes going to come out of the game it was an awkward Landing in fact youre talking about Cleveland just four points in the second half as Smith Goes to the bench immediately takes that right shoe off and his teammate at the freethrow line Jalen Moore sophomore from Birmingham Alabama Applause six points for more scoring double figures and eight of his last nine games that include 10 against Miami on Wednesday and well see you know theyve got a lead and they may get some people in at the end of the game but this is its pretty much been an eightman rotation for Leonard Hamilton in this game which was too shy of what he normally puts out there keep counting two shifts of five players for him the dribble from Mills to shake the defender second chance thats Cleveland offensive glass Applause you know you say double double you and expect Armando baycat to do it you know hes just hes done it his whole career at Carolina but uh theyre starting to say the same thing about Matthew Cleveland hes now five straight games with a doubledouble in his third 20point ten rebound game for a doubledouble this season Applause except for a couple of backdoor Cuts has been just a lot of dribbling I didnt quite have the ups that Worley did on the other end to finish was whirly back defensively against Terry and now Lance Terry has the rebound got nowhere to go against warley thats a pass in tight quarter isnt taken back by Greene Kelly with a tough pass he couldnt finish it off for Hamilton tell them Worley take a timeout 809 to go on the game clock Mike the lead is 20 just like that and uh Mr Green has had a lot to say about that lead Mr Green is red hot 15 points at all in the second half but hes made three threepointers Knowles by 20 this is time for the fast break Music 6747 Florida State after leading by three at halftime has taken complete Command of this game takes us to our Turning Point brought to you by Coyote Tractor in the second half for green and theres all this is the first shot to the hit of the game and uh then it was all right Im back again you get an easy layup like this as a second shot and he has just been knocking down threes right from that same spot on the floor been a terrific Outburst for him he has really fueled this 28th to 11 half thatll do it 15 points in the second half after going scoreless in the first half for Darren Green Jr from Charlotte North Carolina Mike Music hes got over a thousand points in his college basketball career Cleveland cant add to his total that jumper would have tied his career high Smith is back in the game and thats a forceful move by Franklin to bend that rim were not talking about him its six seven and thats going to bring McLeod back into the game but uh Franklin very athletic hes one of the best shot blockers in the conference despite his size third in the conference turnovers in this second half a big story as well seven for Georgia Tech Mike leading to 14 points off of those turnovers for Florida State and Im Im pretty sure most of those if not all of them live ball turnovers Curran double team knocked away fortunately for Georgia Tech fans Miles Kelly is sort of disappeared from the scoring column in the second half Mike Music Kelly just picked up the foul as well but the thing about Florida State you know for Kelly 66 but they can counter with some really long Defenders on him and thats thats really seemed to bother him after the quick start that hes gotten all of Kellys points in the first half they just challenge other people to step up and score four to three pointers in the first half and yet to score in the second half with Corin at the freethrow line Applause McLeod coming back in he was a big factor in that first half Mike with seven points another size almost double his average of presence on the defensive end of the floor theyre trying to move him out get him involved in the screen rolling away from the basket again this could be a historymaking game for Florida State head coach Leonard Hamilton and Smith is able to steal it back and attempt to three long rebound to Comer driving moved by Coleman challenged McLeod a few times that Georgia Tech has been able to score off offensive rebounding Green in the first half was four for five Applause hes in the corner Cleveland was looking at him the side of the drive and then Cleveland with a bit of an awkward Landing hell Trail the play Kelly threepointer and uh you know for Josh passners got Franklin and Howard out there on the same you know to try to counteract some of that size for Florida State as we approach the six minute threshold Mills Up and Under and in Caleb Mills beautiful use of the rim that time going underneath and finishing where there was no shot blocker hes into double figures now with 11 points 13th time this season double figure score Kelly got in the way of Cleveland no call trying to get it to McCloud foul prior to McLeod getting it and attempting the shot Kelly went flying right in front of us what a nice pass too right underneath nobody on the weak side good finish good concentration looks like green on the pass to Mills and then he floated in there rocked the baby to sleep and then put it up on the rim so Florida state with almost six minutes to go has already hit 70 points they average 686 per game and thats Smith in a conversation with the official its a brief one you see and were talking about Kelly too but um Lance Terry has also been really quiet for Florida State or for Georgia Tech Im sorry its locked in on him yeah he has 12 points but as Mike mentioned relatively quiet he was very loud on Wednesday he was allowed to rambunctious against Miami yeah well youre allowed you get the attention of The Scouting Report wow Darren Green step off see now you know what hes if youre to the point youre not even thinking you know youre just amazing definitely in the zone right now owlette Mills tried to serve it to Cleveland it was knocked Away by Terry good hustle to get back and that is off of Florida State a little bit of a late pass right there heres the guy I mean you know hes out now hes standing in the logo and taking shots which by the way leads the league in logo size midcourt in the ACC but even so he was a good three or four feet behind the line Applause so youre talking 28 feet or so Applause maybe not quite that far away but still heres Coleman hes got a three towing the line yeah he got involved he uh had a little floater right before that all right Cleveland with the basketball had his best game of the season against St Johns when he had 23 points and 13 boards both career highs creeping up on those numbers today against Georgia Tech McLeod the miss Coleman again 420 to go in the game Applause Georgia check just 30 percent shooting in the second half Florida State up near 54 heres your difference right there from the floor Coleman trying to work that Baseline cut off by the defending of Cleveland Terry trying to beat the buzzer it is a shot clock violation yeah the Florida state just so much more active defensively since about the 10 minute Mark of the first half the Knowles in command of the visiting jackets with just under four minutes to go at Dominos were tipping you three dollars for being the seminals in control of this one for head coach Leonard Hamilton coming up later Clemson and Pittsburgh are going headtohead and they are both undefeated and at the top of the conference standings yeah and its uh you know Hunter Tyson has been a big big boost for Clemson and him coming back and of course Blake Henson is having a terrific season for Pitt pit started one and three this year and made it this is a miraculous recovery from that got some big wins over North Carolina and Virginia but uh Hey kudos to both of those uh you know best starts since 1997 we saw Clemson get a home win against Wake Forest and Coach Brad Brownell has his team undefeated in Pitt since they joined the conference their best start with ACC play clock ticking down on this one Mike is all Georgia Tech to start this game about Midway through the first half Florida State took control and theyve got a vicelike griffin Franklin at the other end Music he said some pretty nice moves the last couple of possessions foreign Music straight win against Georgia Tech in this series at home on their home court Georgia Tech had actually won three in a row in the series including Mike that 21 title game in the ACC tournament well Leonard Florida State yeah Leonard Hamilton told us yesterday that he felt like his team was he said hes got a feeling my teams going to shoot well tomorrow and he was right on the money now Terry just hit a three Applause cant count Georgia Tech out just yet 14 point difference two and a half minutes to go and uh Leonard Hamilton wants to timeout to talk about things maybe that might be the theme of the conversation so while we have a moment after the timeout by Florida State Matthew Clevelands day 21 points 12 rebounds so hes two points short of his career high in scoring and one short of his rebounding career high set both of those numbers against Saint Charles earlier this season just a very understated 21 and 12 for him just very efficient very businesslike just took what came to him offensively I mean Worley you know had the real loud dunk and green is bombing threes but this guys just getting work done you know again midrange games do you see that now in the college game but thats what hes about hes knocked down to three though or but can really figure out ways to get the ball up on the rim inside thats why he is our hearties star to watch coach Hamilton to solidify that 600th career Victory and it would be the 400th as an ACC coach for Leonard Hamilton joining very elite company closing in on the time maybe had this court named after him closing in on that I dont see why not Mike we were at Bobby kremens court on Wednesday its Jim Boeheim court at the Dome maybe down in Miami at the watsco center just a thought Music only coach Smith has their old arena name thats true Coach K his names on the court dude obviously theres three hes had a robust second half stat line Cleveland able to hang on to him its a 10 Mills got the defender in the air side stepping and missing Smith actually we might have made it real interesting and now just two minutes to go Music take this clock all the way down score holds and Florida State will be 30 in conference play on its home floor and after a one in nine start for them uh find themselves three and two now Applause Cleveland Music closeend chance to tie his career high as it bounces out 21 points for Cleveland Music Applause the second half story right there for Miles Kelly looks like Smith might earn a trip to the freethrow line how about Kelly has still not scored like in the second half weve got more ACC action for you coming up tonight 7 30 check your local listings game and time in your area NC State against Virginia Tech and you know for for Virginia Tech I think the guy when Justin mutts has a big game they play well and I think hes going to be a big key for them tonight Virginia Tech trying to end a threegame losing streak Kevin Keats at NC State two and three in conference play but youre very loud win against Duke at home Blue Devils were two and two in conference play and then BC is giving them all they want right now Worley might have had to highlight of the afternoon Mike with that individual effort yeah I think its definitely the highlight of the afternoon for sure or else you could throw a nice little package for Mr Green Jr in there in the second half dunk his second half were inside the final minute and deep in the shot clock for Mills Terry on the Run trying to go around green and he does calculating the end Applause the lead is 11 theres only 35 seconds on the game clock Georgia Tech will not foul Florida State overall in the game Mike 51 from the floor and a slight Edge on the boards 3331 well when theyre when theyre up over 50 field goal shooting and shooting three the way they do theyre going to be awfully tough to beat anywhere but especially here after that strong start for Georgia Texas 31 percent rest of the way and its Florida State from coach Hamilton 7564 as an ACC coaches four hundredth career win and overall career win number 600 for Leonard Hamilton yeah and uh you know I made made mention of his age and we joked about it yesterday but he looks that was the youngest
