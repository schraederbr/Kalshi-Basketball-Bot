place is jumping and Duke wins the tip as we get underway as they chase win number 27 trying to go to 18 and one in the ACC Duke getting some good news today Tyrese Proctor had missed a game because of a bum knee hes back in there the first shots going to be tapped out all take a look at what theyre doing yeah Trayvon Builder going to be physical with Cooper flag try to bump up off the spot and see how far it is that flag actually is trying to post up so thats part of the recipe flag with a Miss on the first one Wake Forest coming in at 20 and9 12 six in the conference as we showed you Joel lonardi our bracketologist says they are on the outside looking in right now and Obi to be completely honest even though this will be a huge step in the right direction if they get this win Im not sure if this is enough to get the Demon Deacons in especially after the week they had last week it may not be turning and firing Trayvon Spillers who comes in averaging 10 points a game we take a look at tonights starting lineups brought to you by CDW as mentioned Proctor back in there along with kiple James flag and malat James with a misfire and hrth with the rebound a starting lineup brought to by CDW for Wake Forest and as Salis and H goal thats the way weight goes it really is they take the majority of the shots on the offensive end but they also set the tone defensively where this wake for team has been a much better defensive team than weve seen from Steve Forbes groups in the past the problem is offensively they have a difficult time putting the ball in the basket flag in the corner played only seven minutes in their victory over fisu as he got hit around the eye that was in the first half came back strong in the second half G nipple going for the save and out it goes back over the wake and give the Demon Deacons credit an early start defensively keeping the Blue Devils out of balance offensively not getting the shots that they want Duke 0 of three from the field to start the game you know if Wake fails to earn an NCAA tournament bid again one giant weakness is going to be the threepoint shot they only make 29 Beyond The Arc among the worst shooting teams in a conference from long distance the pull up pop that one drop by Johnson hes a primary offender only 22 at the threepoint line HTH on the drive Salis trying the window but no rebound knocked right out of the hands of Fon Reed Proctor with a pull up crowd would have loved that it really would Im not sure John sh loved it too much especially when you have it shot the basketball well and again he trusts tyres Proctor but Im not sure if thats the shot youre looking for when you havent been able to scratch as of yet makes 41 Salis again on the Run heres Proctor now will pull it out H came back to defend Mala watch up high hes going to let it fly once again I dont think thats the shot John Shire wants as he calmly walks back to the bench but the Blue Devils now 0 of five from the field Salas with another Miss and a whistle so about 3 minutes in you and I have done a lot of Duke games this year this is the longest they have gone without getting on the board well youre talking about a team that scored over 100 points in three of their last five games so they rarely ever get off to slow starts but you see John Shire right now hes more concerned about the fact that the Demon Deacons continue to beat them on the offensive glass K picked up his first foul H Salis last year in the upset at Winston Salem over duuk had 29 Points so keep your eye on number 23 for weight tonight shot clocker Factor down to two Salis took a look at it launches a long one and nothing but air and a shot clock violation Steve Forbes head coach and year number five for Wake Forest was around this time a year ago his team pulled the upset Duke was number eight at the time that was in Winston Salem and ignited a court storming that injured Duke allame Kyle Phil and after that W Force went on to lose a couple of games that they thought were winnable and part of the reason why they didnt make it into the NCAA tournament last years at large bid they go on the road a couple of weeks ago and get a win at SMU then drop a couple of win opportunities back to back as we see Spiller continuing to be physical with Cooper flag a lot of black jerseys around Cooper anytime he attacks the basket reing in committing the foul so canle to put it in Duke still without a point canle off the fake another fake heres the two great Patience by KH K nipple and you can recognize the demon Dickens are going to try to run him off the threepoint line but the patience to take the dribble in and then the pump X allow him to make the first basket of the game for the blue doues and for one of the Four Freshman that Duke started on Saturday against Florida State and they won it by 35 yeah the FR scored 63 of their 100 points in that game so we got to say its a pretty good group of freshman OB in and out by Music hild so a chilly start for both teams here at Cameron Endor tonight on this last big Monday flag to drive it and the kick they move it to canle got a great look it almost went Im not sure anyone would have this game at 22 after 4 minutes being played especially especially being that its here in Durham where the Blue Devils have been spectacular on offense All Season alone Johnson good drive couldnt finish Spillers couldnt get it malow watch and a tie up there and a foul that will go against Wake Forest and Johnson as those two battle for the retest it was their ninth conference Victory by at least 25 points that is the most of any team in a single ACC season and then you add in the beat down at madon Square Garden over Illinois and so the Blue Devil team offensively has been playing great over their last stretch but when you consider the first 5 minutes of this game only two points I dont think anyone would have thought that coming into this one now stunner canle to put it in 14 points a game for him loose basketball for a moment off another fake and just threw that one into the back court and camon viation H going down and its going to be interesting to see do they go over and look at this could have very well caught an elbow from K canle as B Smith goes to check it out and well have a conversation with Roger s but hild being physical gets the arm in there could have been a foul on him but you see that right arm come out from canle and does it make contact Im not sure if theres anything extracurricular on that and again when you look in the first first foul is actually on Cameron hiler he grabs canle going to the basket maybe we get an angle but the right elbow does come through and as the right elbow is higher than the shoulders OB that could be something there our officials tonight Roger SS BT Smith and Tony Henderson a really good crew here and they are at the monitor very early in the game and Hildreth getting those Chicklets looked at make sure everything is where theyre supposed to be remember there was no foul on the play no whistle blown on the play it was a backourt violation in the end and still tied 22 and an ugly start here tonight at Cameron offensively I think if anything comes from this it will be because of the height of the elbow again its not a lower and when you think about a basketball move rarely does the elbow come up that high I dont think there was anything that kle was intending to do but as the elbow comes up this High thats the concern but part of it it doesnt come up that high because he is Tangled Up with hildr who commit the first foul on that one it wasnt called but he brings that arm up and I think that after riew its incidental contact itll be Wake Forest ball in the Baseline 20 on the shot clock and thats the reason the incidal contact comes because its hilds arm who br brings kiple arm up otherwise his elbow wouldnt be that high I agree I think they got that right and coming up next third ranked Houston is about to host Hunter Dickinson and Kansas that is on the way on this big Monday when we finish up with Cameron indor how about Houston with backto back Big 12 titles in their first two years in the Big 12 Calvin Samson absolutely one of the best time out wake will take a time out difficulty getting that in well be and when you consider that was the last time that takes you back the 1997 year which so many records were broken and so many different players are trying to achieve now what Tim dunan was able to do in 1997 but the demon deas would just love to get a win here in Cameron Indo a 42 lead for flag quiet so far a long one nothing Fallen yet with John shy looking for offense so he brings Isaiah Evans Off the Bench slim who had 19 points to lead the Blue Devils against Florida State running the floor now could very well have found the opportunity James open got the three the K kiple makes the right play goes to the balls side cion James able to knock it down to give the blue doubles a lead and what launched that fast break was Cooper flag excellent defense over the the top without committing a foul to jar that one free Johnson off the dribble bouncing inside and it rolls home and thats really where W Forest took a big step forward this year with Tyler Johnson going into the starting lineup at the point position you and I had the Dem of deacons in Greensboro beating Michigan of course a top 25 team early this year and they had Hunter Silas primarily at the point guard position flag wide open for a triple hes sitting 38 and thats the most space hes seen in this game Trevon SP do a great job already being physical with Cooper flag not giving him much space to operate however CP able to get open and knock down the three on the last possession Duke number one in the ACC 39 Beyond a threepoint line houth over the shoulder got knocked to the deck no whistle Isaiah Evans on the drive will lay it in instant offense we talked about it John sire saying we need a boost you go to slim give him his opportunities normally does his job do his work beyond the threepoint Arc but this time attacking the basket using that limp to score over the top Slim came up big on Saturday with 19 but look at with another way to be physical with Cooper flag is to force him to have to defend does a great job chipping it away as you mentioned without fouling and then that steel turns into points on the other end but when you give Cooper flag this much room you mentioned OB shooting 38 from three hes going to knock that down it was a scary moment the other day in the first half against FSU he couldnt see it really blurred his vision when he got hit only played the seven minutes in the first half Salis with a tough shot thats where Salas is so special when you get him in the midrange not shooting well from three especially an ACC play under 30 but still getting the job done as Slim comes down and knocks out another one OB right on Q you need offense and slim fastest release in the East man he can get rid of it has five quick points that brings them alive here at Cameron in a big Way El beond the three canle on him body to body jumps into the paint well short and thats going to be a foul against Fon Reed the big senior for Wake Forest those are the fouls Fon Reed has to stay away from OB hes been his en enre time at Wake Forest in foul trouble and when you have fouls as such it ends up hurting you late game theres no Advantage for him committing that foul the hunter Sal snaking the screen getting to the Baseline thats almost like working with your trainer thats textbook the way Hunter Sal is able to get to the Baseline with the separation averaging 19 points a game well short that one comes right to to Juke Harris The Freshman is Evans looking for a foul on that possession thought he was qu Defender would hand the cookie jar AS Hunter sales does catch tyres Proctor in the air leans in have two free throws when we return Salas the 65 senior will be at the line Duke starting to get rolling offensively and a fan favorite really bringing this crowd to life at Cameron indor on a big Monday he has loving it and from distance he can be deadly for is he a crazy guy with the tow I think absolutely well maybe hes a former crazy with a towel maybe thats what it is yes now youre overthinking oh yeah I went too far I went too far my bad OB 138 and Salis with number two and that one will go home hes at 81 for the year Duke averaging 83 holding opponents to 61 and thats the thing that point margin 22 points per game they have been dominant all season long you me we mentioned Arizona in our previous promo Duke actually went to male and got a win Gillis in the game cant bury the Long Applause Way Mason Gillis was instrumental in the victory good run here and for a quick strike by Harris but when Duke won at Winston Salem and that game could have gone either way the guy who settled down Duke was the veteran the gra graduate from Purdue Mason Gillis yeah Mason Gillis with 11 points in that game knocked down three threes especially one late under two minutes so he was huge for the Blue Devils in that game but we continue to keep track of how theyre going to guard Cooper flag but the difference is youve got another freshman guarding in Juke Harris so you have to bring the double team to get the basketball out of his hands Juke Harris has had a very good freshman year but Im not sure hes ready for that defensive responsibility of guard the Cooper flag 101 yet quite sure who is true to that Salis with his first foul put Proctor at the line two fans delighted he is back after missing basically a game and a half with the bone bruise on the knee coming in averaging 12 points a game 76 at the foul line and hes really been the reason that theyve kind of elevated their game its been tyres Proctor you weve seen coopa flag KH canle play very well all season long but when tyes Proctor became that true third score going on the road multiple games over 20 at Boston College same at Clemson you think about what hes been for this team thats the reason I think they elevated but being able to win without him was an even more significant sign for the Blue Devil the Australians such a big part of this and the success of Duke and why they are 26 and three 17 one in the ACC Salis again boy what a difficult shot hes made a couple it really is and hes been able to make tough shots he uses his size to elevate over the top but look how quickly the Blue Devils get back down floor GL for an answer but no B watch up and over everybody Proctor is open and a lot of iron but down it wet its got to feel good for Proctor to be able to see one go down from three and again it doesnt matter how much time you miss missing one game can truly throw you off Applause Rhythm a kick out for Reed too strong hell get a second effort thats wake Force has really been able to do damage in this game getting multiple opportunities as Second Chance shots Sal wants to get one off and draws a foul on the shot Salas proving to be a lot to handle for the Duke defense here early on and this is another we we talked about it you dont just be physical with Cooper flag when you have him on the offensive end of the floor you you have to try your best to post him thats what Clemson was able to do to get a win against the Blue Devils a few weeks ago and especially on at Little John Coliseum they forced Cooper to have to defend in the painted area Ian shefin was able to make it a very physical game wore Cooper down and there was no Mason Gillis in that game so Cooper actually had to play 38 minutes and was actually cramping by the end of that game and of course two cons said theyre optimistic about getting Malik Brown back is that shoulder continues to heal we shall see thats a significant loss as great a Defender as he is Im just shocked at 10 minutes in I hadnt mentioned that cuz thats thats been my thing with the Blue Devils theyre a great team regardless but theyre an even greater team when youve got Malik Brown in the fold he makes them so versatile especially on the defensive end of the floor and as their offenses that theyre able to play five out when they have him on the floor now the and malow watch tangling there right around the threepoint line and the foul will go against the Duke Blue Devils and John shy heat it up malawat picks up number one yeah theyre going to get malawat for that as Baloo comes over to try to get in position to hedge the screen and malow watch really vacating his space doesnt go to set the screen is actually taken off but does create the contact with Belo its not a popular call here but it absolutely is the correct Applause call flag on Salis out of bounds off Cooper flag another look back so you see as malat is trying to take a run to the rim but look at the left arm shoulder of malawat where it makes contact with Belo John S not happy about the result of that call Applause Music Applause Sal shot clock down down to three hes out at midcourt they chase him he doesnt know and did not get the shot off had a couple of violations but thats because of the Trap you think about malawat and seion James trapping Hunter Solis off the screen just blitzing and blowing up forcing him all the way back to pretty much half court Hunter Sal had zero idea that the shot clock was getting close to the end flag will drive it leing in takes a makes the bip hes headed to the line well were documenting it throughout the game just how physical weight is trying to be with number two didnt pay off that time it did not we need to document how many shots he makes with his right hand in comparison to with his left as he attacks here once again Cooper going to the left hand getting it softly up on the rim through the contact but we watched him all season long especially when he had ATT the basket finishing with that left hand but forget about the next level for a second if we can do that for Cooper flag I know thats hard to do for a lot of people but were talking with Chris Carwell today the outstanding assistant coach for Duke he works for about 30 minutes at every practice with flag on game day and specifically about stuff like how much contact you can expect tonight and hes coaching him to expect this in the NCAA tournament every single game absolutely because the only time that you really seen teams be physical with Duke this year and be successful was at Clemson and so whenever you find that recipe to be able to beat the Blue Devils the kick ahead and flag unable to handle that one but whenever you find a recipe that could cost you a win as we see the fourth turnover for the Blue Devils other teams are going to try to emulate it NC State tried to do it dant Styles played very well but he got in foul trouble youve seen other teams try to do it against Duke they havent had the success that Clemson had but its still going to be the recipe to try to be successful especially in this building a swing once again foris interrupted James got his hands on it kiple on the drive going in strong and a foul K kiple missed an opportunity there whenever you have a big guy that does the job defensively and Sprints the floor and we and K batch has shown us time and time again he is more than capable of handling a lot thats one youve got to throw it up to the big fella and give him his opportunity to go dunk that home it still could be two points but theres a difference in two points a two points with they what they dunk and they lob here in this building gets everyone excited free throws H got to reward him right got to reward him absolutely got to reward him Johnson with a foul and G nipple 91 at the line he is number two on the Duke team in minutes played behind Cooper flag so far three points tonight tonight and in a normal year he can very well be the AC Rookie of the Year well Duke with their biggest lead tonight on top 2214 it has not been an offensive showcase for either team yet Johnson a sophomore from Brooklyn wants Reed to touch it trying to move flag out of the way flag will Comm the foul with 801 to go here in the first half thats number one on Cooper I I still think that his spectacular dunk against pit back in January that poster is his finest dunk of the year maybe not allog together in terms of style monster points but I say this because it meant something in the game the game was not determined yet agree and he got angry and thats what he did on the other end of the floor the other dunks have been spectacular I granted that but they dont mean as much I I agree whole Harley with your point but Ive been watching Cooper flag since he was 13 years old as you get a look at that dunk and it absolutely meant something but Ive seen Cooper do better and I believe thats where it numbs me his mom and I actually had a conversation regarding it you did yeah she felt as though the dunk at Kansas over Floyd Binga was better than that one and so again there will always be discussion about Coopers best dumps but thats not a bad discussion to have OB when when were talking about all his STS combined when youre arguing like for7 which one was the best youre pretty darn good flag with it up high H with swatting at it knocked it away its loose again shot clock inside 10 flag on the spin looking for room to operate got it downstairs great patience James with the basket yeah I love the way Coop was strong with the basketball in the Trap but more buling to give it up and get the assist in comparison to forcing a bad shot made the sevenfooter nine points a game backing in malawat and it was Cooper flag who came over for the deflection Johnson from 14 Cooper flag with a rebound kle that wont drop H watch beat everybody to it flag thought about it Gillis does and offt Target andle great Hustle but saved it over the Wake thats a microcosm of this Duke team though as he just gets downhill and just blows a tire on that possession I dont know if he was trying to get a Applause call and a whistle with 638 to go 24 15 the Blue Devils Steve Forbes on between 20 points when youre a freshman and you can rely on getting 20 points a game between quad one and qu qu two games that may be Wen award but you put there yeah were trying to figure out you know what he is not the most serious candidate to win mhm across the board hes won the ACC rookie of the week enough times they should name the award after record yes a record 11 times for him surpassing Kenny Anderson Tyler hansbro youre talking about some of the best to ever lace him up in the ACC as a careless turnover from hildr Captain Reed on the slip never even turns his head and those are type of plays that Steve Forks you know cant really when you got veteran players like hild and Reed you cant explain that happening especially coming out of a timeout yeah particularly a game that is so important to them cant be more important his flag will draw the foul meanwhile wake has not made a three they over for four from threepoint land Duke is four out of 15 but this is a giant issue for Coach Forbes and his team just 29 from threepoint land for the season and talk with BJ about the exact same you and I talking about how does this happen coming out of a timeout how do you have that miscommunication between two veteran players F Reed and Cameron h both fourth year college guys and they been in the system now with Coach Forbes for with held with four years after Reed now in his second season Cooper flag at the line and makes the pair he has 10 here in the first half a check of the ACC standings Duke at 17 and one and Louisville and Clemson followed by Wake Forest Wake was a preseason number three pick but OB this is why John shyers talking about his team has to have a sense of Des also Louisville and Clemson are both on their heels that shot nearly went Reed will pick up the foul trying to get up and stuff it to converging on him around the 10 and hell be at the foul line as seon James picks up his first but just as you mentioned OB he tries to go dunk it thats why he gets the benefit of the doubt of getting the call whether theres much contact or not if he goes up light and tries lay that up its a clean block but when you try to dunk it and play with Force often times the officials will give you the benefit of the doubt Ive seen that call the clean block many times but take another look but there is contact to the body down low and theres also contact from Patrick gumba on the backside I tell you what if Im after re I absolutely want that call and drops that in Reed is a guy they can rely on to make shots 5 7 from the field flag on the Move Evans here it comes does not need a lot of room to get a shot off heres hildr now attacking Spillers blocked by flag and its kicked out of play by James itll be W for his ball but Cooper flag with a rejection yeah Spillers who was a great shot blocker himself attacking the basket but that time meeting Cooper flag who does a great job staying vertical as you watch cop go up vertically with the jump theres contact but then its able to get the body and I believe theyre going to get a offensive foul one hildr here yes number two 532 to go in the first half hild just pushing off a little bit of a chicken wing the Cooper flag not allowing him to get out and defend but doing it right in front of the officials is going to get called each and every time and for Wake youve got that danger zone right and thatll go the other way theyll tie it up with Evans who will pick up the foul have to give the defender an opportunity to get around the screen no longer can you go up and put a body on a man youve got to give them a step defens Steve Forbes working side by side with Roger SS back for salz he can heat up with anybody in this conference double fake on flag he didnt bite he had nowhere to go re is open long distance but no rebound tapped and controlled by Duke James to the paints scooping it up no down he goes great job by kiple to get to the loose ball FL on Applause hildr and G with travel and a turnover for Duke and thatll be their sixth they only had four the entire last game and had zero in the first half last game with 12 assists so but giveway Force defensively a lot of credit for what theyve been able to stall the Blue Devils offensively only 28 points with Duke with 37 remaining but you also have to look at the Blue Devils and what they do defensively give them tremendous amount of credit for stifling the Demon Applause Deacons the man out of Worthing England on the dribble no place to go at Reeds already taken two threes hesitant to let that one go yeah thats got to be his weak limit and a tie up and hell stay right here in this s with just over four minutes to go in the opening half Wade Forest is very much a an improved defensive team from a year ago much better than a year ago holding opponents to 68 points 40 shooting and they knew coming in they were going to have their have to have their number one defensive effort of the Year absolutely its when youre playing against this team in this building you have to be able to come in with you know and really locked in on your game plan and I believe theyve done that to this point I think theyve done a really good job when you look at what theyve been able to do with the Blue Devils throughout this game Duke only shooting 364 from the field eight of 22 so give wake a lot of credit for what theyve done defensively but on the other end of the floor only shooting 25 they have missed his last seven opportunities and so when you think about Duke theyre just as good defensively as they are offensively Harris h says not here another Duke rejection with the shot clock winding Applause down and now at five malawat cleaning up the mess and thats one of the areas where you talk about being a great defensive team you always have that guy the rim protector behind you when you do get beat get in a compromising situation to be able to take care of business behind you LS already had two shot clock violations Spillers just beats it it actually went up and over the rim and so thats another Applause flag with a misfire there out watch great save and laid up and in by canle coach Greenberg I am throwing that off the glass now I might throw it off the glass to myself however Im throwing it off the glass me and mil watch both see see which one of us gets to it first but Im absolutely going to give him an opportunity you would have been creative with it I absolutely would have OB W Forest really cold oh0 for their last 10 they have made a field goal in seven minutes before that one Spiller started the year off shooting the ball really well from Beyond a threepoint Arc he struggled in ACC play only 29 from Beyond the three but makes a big one there and again there really hasnt been tremendous separation however now this time Khan throws it up to malat we often see the Blue Devils start the game out like that yeah you know I think they were listening to that toss from the studio they should have been listening to coach HTH Zips that one Salis again Salis and flag good match up tonight and flag wins that uhoh this going oh got to two onone Proctor will lay it off the iron two on one give it to Proctor early and then foup just run to the basket Proctors going to throw it back up would have been another highlight in camera but a missed opportunity for the blue devil thought we were looking at a kooper loop off the window H cant finish St Mark OB heres Proctor on a run out Proctor made that one far tougher this time that was twice is difficult yeah Reese was looking for a degree of difficulty but a little conversation guard cant they got along a little better there than they are tonight funny how that happens when you put these Uniforms on knocked away but kiple will get the foul as he went for the steal his second personal Obie we I saw this play earlier I asked our great producer and director to be able to clip this one okay I dont need Cooper flag doing this do you see that right arm in the compromising position now again this dude plays as hard as you possibly could play he doesnt think about injury but but those of us who are fans and and want to see him achieve everything Im going to need him even if hes diving on the floor dont stick his arm in there in that scenario because theyre already missing Malik Brown with the with the dislocated shoulder we dont know when you get him back the last thing the Blue Devil fans need to see is Cooper flag getting injured on a play as such and at least one NBA general manager at least one I think there may be about 10 he said whoever is lucky enough to have him in the end yes very true 209 to go and Reed at the line makes it 3422 he has five Applause points piple to the paint Proctors open pipple kept out alive James will drive take the hit went for the lay in malawat still battling Proctor off the fake kles the open shooter and weve seen this one the Blue Devils a number of times throughout this game giving up a good shot to get a great shot they havent always worked out for them here in this first half but it absolutely does on the last possession beautiful hook there by at Reed and then he goes back with the twoo small sign to the sevenfooter and Applause Mal Mal just two in taller yeah but in s defense Cooper also did that in the previous game talking about the W Force Defenders being too small to guard him James a triple 40 24 with a minute to go before halftime this one getting away from Wake Forest well we knew Duke would make the Run we talked about it when the score was two to2 but Wake Forest has to find a way to settle themselves offensively and make sure they get good looks each and every time down the floor bu got in the air couldnt find anyway gets it off to Reed and hell drill it and epon Reed with another celebration going back hes now one for three from Beyond The Arc but that is something that can help his team moving forward going back down the floor now an important opportunity for the Demas to get his Applause stop got it to the rim but could not make it and if youre right now Juke Harris get the last shot of the half Dont Force anything an opportunity for you to get this to 10 maybe 11 going into the halftime locker room but if you can have some type of momentum on an offensive run it absolutely helps you in the second Applause half four seconds to get up a shot Salis gave up the dribble Harris with a wild one off the backboard thats how the first half comes to an end Duke on top 40 27 to lead the Duke Blue Devils the number two team of the country Duke opening up the second 20 minutes with the basketball James going for flag went for a stuff F he couldnt finish it and that one kind of got on Cooper quickly the play was designed for him to slip but the pass and of course the right play by cion James was already in the air before Cooper got there threw him off balance a little bit unable to finish at home Cameron Hil coming off 28 against Notre Dame he just wouldnt let them lose that game crosscourt Salis Johnson wants it and connects from threepoint L Ty Johnson if hes making threes thats a bonus for the Demon Deacons theyve struggled from Beyond The Arc but again a great offensive possession for them on the first one especially forcing to miss on the last possession defensively kle spins in the paint left it short wake looking for that early momentum as the second half gets underway a sold out Cameron IND the 540th consecutive sellout here at the Reed who made a three at the end of the first half going to pass that one up Salis Airborne hit it hes going to the line looking for a threepoint play and opportunity for a 60 run to start this half for the Demon Deacons we just mentioned a 171 run for them at Wake Forest a month or so ago and now you see the Demon Deacons coming out of the second half very composed after their conversation with coach for in the lock for wher flag is second personal Salis 81 at the line heres their top score at 19 to G hes also their leading assist maker and its a sevenpoint game Obi a stop here could do wonders for the Demon Applause Deacons coer flag for kiple in the paint again nothing there Proctor back in the lineup at to missing the the last game with a knee problem shot clock down to five down down to two Mala have to look and that one well short flag Picks It Off to the other side of the a for two of course who would else who else would make the play get offensive rebound to put back on what was a great defensive possession for Wake Force just unable to finish it off and keeping Cooper flag off the offensive glass the basketball Savvy is ridiculous it really is and more importantly understanding his timing always in the right place at the the right time to help his team get wins Johnson with Pro there right on his hip thats a tough shot he makes it really is Johnson aggressive to start this second half he has nine points tonight 4235 wake trying to make a game of it flag slaming on the brakes off balance to hit the shot going off that one leg weve seen it made famous by of course Dirk nitzki Kevin Durant does it extremely well Cooper flag adding to his bag making that a part of his game Johnson again round the back this time SAS hes got 10 to shoot got a cross over nearly lost it now the pull up and he cant hit Applause it Cooper flag of national Player of the Year candidate willll pull up and fire and drain a three you remember our conversation talking about the second half he averages 81 points per game in the first half second half 12 points already off to a great start here in the second OB filling it up seven points for Cooper Reed wants it got a great look in a three this was Fon Reeds game coming out of high school he was a shooter again often times we tried to get a force him to get in the painted area Lo his size much more but hasnt lost the jumper Steve Forbes allowing him to Showcase it here tonight 4738 dke proor for James flag again working on Spillers and a very difficult shot wont roll in there is a whistle Cooper looking for a foul on that one Im wondering why he didnt shoot the three hes already hot had all right after knocking down this onelegged falling back jumper off the bounce knocks down to three thats the last shot before this possession he had all right to take the heat check at the top of the key as soon as he caught the basketball second foul on Applause Reed kles and he gets hit in the act of attempting a three thats the wrong guy to put at the line 91 the we can say that most likely the first 10 10 points of this halfway score by freshman KH can nipple with three opportunities at the free throw line and hes pretty much automatic when he gets there now I know Im putting myself OB in Jinx territory but thats the confidence I have in Khan at the strike well pretty darn good there as you mentioned also pretty Dar good from threepoint land leading Duke there at 39 one of the Four Freshman that Duke started Saturday he had 14 in that one along with five assists also an excellent passer on itic at the lines you mentioned didnt touch the rim all three free throws all net never touch the rim saw his mom at halftime she said Music hello so now wake needs an answer H running into a wall left it short flag picking the rebound yeah the problem is Hilder running into that oh B no duks missed a couple of slams I normally see most of cps Dimes coming I didnt see that one The Look Away L malat has to finish that one off I was just talking about how good he is handling the basketball in the L and making it into two points H with using the body to get free but Pro is sticking to him Reed backing out theyre going to guard him now I think the rest of the night shock down to six Johnson gets a look at it down to three heres the kick for Spillers and cant bury Applause it so the Blue Devils is looking to expand on the lead they have had nine conference victories of at least 25 points this year they had R Rush shot over the ACC flag off to James just got to canle but hes on the line and thats a turnover second opportunity I felt like Cooper flag have taken the three pump faked and gave up an opportunity and the team ends up with a turnover three of the associations top teams will highlight our espnnba Wednesday double in the Eastern Conference the Cavs and the Heat at 7 SGA and OKC taking on the Grizz NBA Countdown tipping off with our coverage at 630 Eastern Time Cory just 5 minutes ago was in Phoenix doing an NBA game and I was bragging about my Cavalier Wahoo connection with DeAndre Hunter and Tai Jerome who combined for 57 points last night in their win for the cavali over the Portland trouble laders in overtime flag sizes one up and yes knocks down a three give him 20 why not shoot the other two when youre go when when its going this well for you just shoot the basketball when theyre giving you space let it fly off the fake downstairs Reed got it deep and hell draw the foul Fon Reed headed to the line the senior from Richmond Virginia and foued by malawat who picks up number two Music so whats in store for Cooper flag Im going to say all of the above on this chart right here I do believe he will be HC Player of the Year and HC rookie of the year I do believe he will be the wooden Award winner and the number one pick in the in the 2025 NBA draft the question is does he challenge Carmelo Anthony as the best alltime one andone player by capping it off with a national champ chionship thats what Melo did at Syracuse thats what Melo did at Syracuse thats the reason why hes number one in my book as as you see Kelly up coaching her baby up and shes probably thinking actually shes coaching up K malawat who shes maybe just as close to as she is her own twins well you know we heard that from John sh early in the season this is a very close Nick group among the parents that they root for each others kids like hes never seen before and thats one of the things OB and a lot of it has to do with you have moms and dads who not only played the game but coach the game but they understand how important it is to ro for other players success look at the parents every one of them is up arms up ex celebrating Showtime slim knocking down another three at four threes against FSU when he makes at least three duke is n and0 doubled that up in the first half against Auburn Mak six and change that game here where the blue devs beat the number one team in Cameron in traffic no chance on that one kipple in the open floor and a good job by Frederickson to step in and Lodge it not many turnovers out of the Duke Blue Applause Devils Frederickson with a leaner for two Parker Frederickson the sixo sophomore out of Bixby Oklahoma they expected a little bit more from him from threepoint land this season on that topic Evans on a misfire comes right back out high for flat on the drive the spin the feed heres James Cooper flag just looks over at the and gives a little Michael Jordan type shrug his fifth assist as he gets cut off in the paint but of course has a tremendous Vision to find seion James who continues to shoot the basketball extremely well Cooper flag against the double team makes the right play finding James whos now three of five from Beyond The Arc 11 points for him and Cooper just letting his guys know Im going to make the right Applause play well these fans know what his future is we just documented that this is their last home game they are soaking it up Duke by 18 and contrary to all the talk of him coming back this is his this is his last home game as well yeah the number one slot awaits Cooper flag look at that draft board there he is number one canle six malaan seven Proctor number 40 and James and Evans but they really should have had a freshman night here they they really could have absolutely had a freshman night four possible freshman in the mix however I believe Isaiah Evans if he decides to come back and I think tyres Proctor could very well come back as well Isaiah Evans could be the ACC player of the year next year if he decides to come back really and a lottery pick hes a lottery talent and when you consider hes coming off the bench playing behind KH canle Cooper flag Etc but but a summer of work and then coming back in being the guy next year do 59 points including all 19 of this second half keep in mind by the way the tar Hills have ripped off five in a row probably playing their finest basketball of the season right now and going to start a much bigger lineup against the Blue Devils this time than they did when they started four guards the last time now playing at 67 69 and 68 up front trying to match the size of the blue dou the tallest team in America reach in foul by Hunter Music sales 1133 to go you know over the weekend Duke won by 35 points against Florida State and the venerable Leonard Hamilton will be retiring at the end of the season said as far as he was concerned this was the most connected and the best executing Duke team he had seen here at Cameron indor well when you consider how long hes coached against the Blue Devils and again against Coach K his teams thats a tremendous compliment to John sh and what hes done but when youve got guys like Mason gillers coming off the bench making threes and more importantly playing his role seon James stepping into the starting lineup after the first seven games and seamlessly running this team extremely well and weve talked about the Freshman so much for a good reason as they continue to be excellent each and every time out take this lead of the kns here for the Duke Blue Devils they will to that Mason Gillis coming off the bench important for both the Tar Heels and the Mustangs when you consider not only trying to boost your NCAA tournament resume but also your ACC tournament resume who gets that double by and is in that fourth seed and more importantly that gives you the best chance of having that matchup against the Blue Devils to have an opportunity to get another quad one win thats the big fish uhoh follows no this time again cant get it to go although had really no chance to dunk that oh you got dunk it backwards a b backwards yeah thats why you you put that one behind the head you dunk that one backwards and break the backboard oh yeah or that oh let not do that cuz with the way this way the gym is set up it may take us a while to be able to fix that one on the drive off the window nice touch by The Freshman Harris yeah Duke Harris has had it really good freshman season for the Demon Deacons continues to grow each and every time out again becoming a much better Defender getting about 18 minutes a game flag on the attack and a foul two and just like a broken record finishes with his left hand again you know Steve Forbes told us earlier today he won to push Cooper to his off hand which raised the question which one is that is because you see him going right able to attack but finishes with the left this the second lefthanded and one that he has throughout this game and weve watched him throughout the season going left dunking on people Im not sure that Cooper has an off hand I believe operates equally as well either the side Reed with his third foul 22 points and Counting for the Freshman from Newport main who leads Duke in scoring rebounding assists and steals not to mention minutes but but how about the efficiency 22 points on only 13 field goal attempts and this is not a night where hes really lived at the free throw line hes five for five from the free throw strike this will be his sixth attempt but he hasnt lived there like he has often times in double figure throw Go free throw attempts dungo keeping him alive as the big guy comes off the bench Gillis is open and one he missed he hit a couple early and gr great hustle here by gangba hes made a couple of plays but a great play by isah Evans there not shooting that one allowing Duke to be able to run offense and run some time off the clock six to shoot flag pulls up and drains it from the exact spot where he just missed a free throw right however this one counts for two so maybe Coopers just doing the math in his head you know forget that one point let me get it back and go get a BL hes better when its harder he has a hand in his face 6943 Applause Reed to work on another big clearing out some space in the paint but a whistle here with 851 to play and gungo with the personal back to flag a moment ago as you see Cooper flag trying to get the screen set for Mason Gillis directing traffic pointing tyres Proctor to his but when everything breaks down Cooper flag has the ability to be able to put the ball on the floor go make a play and make a tough shot recognizing the defense is trying to track him down from the rear fading away knocks down the midrange hell take a breather and wake to put it in from the Baseline Cameron hrth has had a rough one in this one hes coming off 28 as mentioned and an excellent performance against Notre Dame but this is a different story tonight a turnaround by Harris but no and a rest in job here for the rebound its both Reed and Gung be hit the deck been a little bit of a battle over the last couple possessions with Reed and Gung but two guys from my great state of Virginia speaking of the 2025 commencement speaker here at Duke another Virginia resident whos actually in the state of Virginia right now just finished dinner with his father the great Calvin Hill will be Grant Hill hes going to be speaking at Dukes gradu ation this year now I tell you what Im not hes not going to make that shot I dont know what kind of camera tricks they did right there but look at the students as they recognize Grant Hill as the commencement speaker for 2025 outside of the artificial intelligence that allowed him to make that jump shot at the top of the key great job by the facilities here with the Blue Devils a legend they just loved it I mean what a great treat that is here you are just you know months away from graduating from duke and thats one of the gifts you get Grand Hill is your commencement speaker but think about how many seniors there are over in the Cameron crazies and that will be a part of this so WR a passage as a senior year you get an opportunity to be on the sidelines for each and every one of these games and a great job by this you know prestigious University to choose this moment senior night to be able to give them the gift of Grant Hill to some people not to me some are more senior than others obviously by the way we just had double technicals on Reed and Proctor and another whistle here with 842 to go and has gotten away from Wake Forest and any hopes that the Demon Deacons had of getting to the NCAA tournament really would have hinged on winning tonight a major upset hell be at the line Juke Harris to shoot only 56 for Steve Forbes youve got to consider that theres always the opportunity to win the ACC tournament and again in years past we may say no its not going to happen we did see Duke go win four games in four days in Brooklyn back in 2017 I believe but then you consider what we saw a season ago with the wolfback winning five games and five days and they didnt stop there went on to win another five games till four games to get to the Final Four so anything can happen in this league especially once we get the tournament time you and I did a number of the NC State games last year and we knew they were better than their record but maybe a couple of wins in the ACC tournament I think they would have been the light not what they did it was just a problem there was no way to predict that you would see that and the teams that they beat to get there you got to consider of course Michael okell shot off the glass against Virginia to send the game into overtime and eventually win that one DJ Burns was absolutely phenomenal but it was a true team effort a season to go and its going to take that again from one of these teams in the ACC to be able to hold that tournament Applause Crown Proctor off the inbounds cant sink it kiple going for the loose ball Corrals Applause that K canle finds Gil p f it and will lay it in he has eight points pretty quickly too Off the Bench OB from up here in The Crows Nest I almost jumped on that pump fake makes it Giller sold it extremely well they wer a long read open in and out this time although hes had a good night shooting Applause it Proctor is not going to wait hell drive right past everybody he has eight points tonight but look at the Duke bench everyone up Cooper flag demonstrating the move by tyres Proctor K malawat seon James all applauding the effort of their team on the court loose ball Gung be hitting the deck Evans knocking to wait around G nipple with the rebound back up for two and du just flat running and everybody should have someone like this running their basketball program and she is the first general manager in college basketball and I we have heard heard other coaches call John Shire a Visionary three seasons ago before he became the head coach already had contacted Rachel Baker course he knew he was the coach in waiting behind Coach K had contacted Rachel Baker about once he took over becoming the general manager for the Duke Blue Devil team recognizing nil everything that was coming and with the transfer portal and weve had other ACC coaches called John a Visionary and of course John one of the younger coaches of not the youngest coach in the ACC to be called that means a lot but he absolutely was just that and bringing in Rachel Baker kills for the Triple no and the rebound comes free to Spillers 77 47 Duke well Duke in many respects was a step or two ahead of a lot of schools not everybody but a lot of schools and shes phenomenal we had a chance to chat with her recently and impressive barely scratches the surface with her yeah re is my little sis of course former Nike executive uhoh coper flag with a twohander he has 28 Rachel Baker of course very close to Cooper Flags favorite NBA player who happens to be celebrating his 27th birthday today it won Jason Tatum Proctor for a triple rebound bounces around Gillis controls it back for Proctor and a couple of really good looks remember Proctor first game back so shaking off a little bit of the rust and again no matter how much time you miss could be one game it could be 10 games its going to be difficult you getting back into action and those are shots that weve been used to seeing Proctor knocked down blocked by flag that triggers the break Proctor oneonone on hildre and backs it in tell you what the way this game started I didnt think there was any way in the world Duke was going to get to 81 points tonight well we talked about it theyve scored 100 points in three of their last five games OB didnt SC only score two points in the first five minutes of this game but then its been an offensive explosion ever since Cooper flag with the finish on one end and on the other end denying an opportunity hes been flexing a lot and Rachel even flashing A Smile as Co Cooper denies an opportunity been flexing a lot OB he aint strong enough to flex right now but his game absolutely is super strong well a lot of that best player in the country resume tape is going to come out of this game I tell you what I think its time for Cooper to have a seat and get his Ovation the final Ovation from this crowd is cod kiple knocks down to three ball I believe its time to see Spencer Hubbert in his last opportunity as well as many of the seniors here to finish it off at Cameron indor knocked away and Wake Forest will retain possession with four and a half minutes to go the ACC Womens Basketball Tournament begins on Wednesday in Greensboro ACC network will have all the first and second round games as well as two of the quarterfinal matchups first round coverage beginning at 1230 Eastern with the nothing but crew and thats going to be fun Louisville and noted a sharing the ACC regular season title going to be interesting to see those go at it Hannah Hado Olivia miles the amazing back court of noted name however they took an overtime loss at NC State the last time those two teams matched up so looking forward to seeing if those two teams will make it to the n i to the ACC Tournament final or will North Carolina will many of the other suitors find their way into the mix of course our former colleague Carol Lawson here at Duke theyve had a very positive season as well Frederickson knocks that back and WG Forest down 84 to 49 and well see how long Cooper flag remains in the game and Kipper 2 is up to 17 points underneath for an easy basket for M well John ss going to make sure that the crazies get an opportunity to give each and every one of them the proper Ovation so most likely after the next media timeout he will take them out one by one to allow this crowd to be able to say goodbye and re just lost it back over to dke and we have a timeout 3 oh what is senior Applause today Proctor negotiates in and a kiss off the window John Shire wanted to timeout Applause Music afterwards 334 to go and Evans back on and here comes groper flag heading to the bench and getting a great Ovation at Cameron in their final home game malawat gets a big hug too hipper flag 28 points eight rebounds seven assists thats not a bad send off Applause OB not too shabby one more year theyre chanting the Cameron crazies and everybody Applause else and look at Kelly and Ralph its its its entertaining however its not a good business decision OB no Cooper saying lets run it back yeah okay he said it a couple of weeks ago he teased Everybody by saying no I think Id like to come back for another year yeah but let me tell you what that would not be a very good business decision to come back and now tonights game check in brought to you by All State so you made this point I think beautifully in the first half hes been a second half and man when he Music explodes Proctor now out of the game as well as John shy here in a senior night starts to empty his Music Applause bench but about three minutes to play Harris jumping inside cant Bank it in so for Wake this will be their 10th defeat they will drop to 12 and seven in the ACC Duke about to improve to 27 and3 at 181 in the conference Harris cant get that one to go and coming up next number three Houston take it on Hunter Dickinson and Kansas Johnson off balance around it out heres my guy theres Spencer Spencer hover the grad a 5 a graduate getting ready to check in OB B was two for three from three against Florida State last time out as meon Gillis knocks down another three John shy will take the timeout and roll it to get the subs in the last time we will see seon James Mason Gillis on the floor at Cameron indor in the Duke uniform Duke up 9151 back to Kevin Applause Music Applause Music Applause audio 210 to go Spencer Hub into the freay here on a senior night at 58 about 157 lbs out of Los Angeles California Frederickson yes Spencers the only guy I talked to from the Blue Devils pregame went over and said told him I said I saw you got buckets against Florida State last time out I need to see you shoot the basketball again mom of course watching from La spensive celebrating his senior night last year and deciding to come back a fifth year so he did not take part in the festivities pregame today Stanley bordon is the sevenfooter and fires that one out bordon 7 ft 241 lb a native of Istanbul Turkey doesnt get a chance to play obviously very much but man in practice he gets beat on he really does but thats probably the first time hes seen a double team in his entire career with the blue devil might be true at 22 to go Gordon gets a hand on it on the steel and deflected out of the sky by Applause Spillers the crowd is just dying to see hover score they absolutely are really all these guys they want to see them have some success on their last time here playing in front of this crowd and youve got to imagine how great its been Coach K showing up who of course this this crew playing their freshman year with Coach K in his last season to now playing for John Shire in year three where after this win he will have the ACC record for most wins in three years as a head coach surpassing Bill Guth of University of North Carolina Duke about to go to 47 and3 Cameron Endor under John shy sounds like a Coach K number Applause they do for to and the bench loves it well the guys who never get a chance to play and theyre playing for the last time on this floor get into the contest regardless of the score Johnson on the drive and takes a hit makes the shot hell go to the line with 17 and a half seconds to go Neil bovic off the bounce a little Up and Under the nice left hand to finish it off and the entire bench up demonstrating the left hand showing you just how connected this team is as you mentioned coach ham talking about it this team especially defensively so connected they share the basketball extremely well this is a team that has a great chance especially if theyre able to get Malik Brown back back and healthy of hanging a sixth National Championship Banner in this building thats what everybody here Cameron has in mind iss your final score tonight as duke runs away and hides against weight 93 60 the final impressive it was very impressive and from the 15
