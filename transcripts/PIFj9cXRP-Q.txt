and Jerry Heater underway from Raleigh And talk about both teams putting up over a 100 points in game one of this season so far Well right away theres the pulling part of Darien Williams game Goes to the block and its blocked inside by Daniel Rivera for UAB Early on playing them straight up Now one of the keys for NC State will be their transition defense Starting five of the Blazers Its all new Debbie right All new players this year Just really one returner Uh one of the seniors on this group So Coach Kennys trying to get it figured out here Kyron Lindsay Martin traveling violation Quick athletic quick off their feet And Andy Kennedys team they can defend as well And this is going to be a challenge for NC State Theyll be bigger and longer at every position Look at the starting five here And there is a lot of length on this team Well talk about that as this one progresses as well Ball inside here to Ben Allen for the first bucket of the night Two possessions two passes to the block I think thats where NC States advantage is with that size Robinson over to Jacob Meyer on the drive and he ties it at two Jacob Meyers a lefthanded player but hes got great balance in his game He can shoot the three but he also can go off the bounce You see him right there going to his right Thats what we were talking with about earlier about these guards being able to get underneath and get to the wing Smaller guards understand how to make plays off two feet They also know how to get a straight line drive off the bounce and play underneath the size of NC State Another bucket for Van Allen Luben and a foul is called here Its going to be on him Van Allen Luben does a great job Does his work early the dribble handoff and then the roll to the rim He gets the low post bucket and then he scores on a roll I was saying to you earlier I remember his time back at Notre Dame but then since then he was at Vanderville and North Carolina last year and now here he is at NC State Hes got to be a smart guy Hes been to four great academic institutions as well as good basketball programs Which one do you claim Right Well NC State fans I guess hope he claims NC State Heres Ahmad Robinson Meer pulls it up and hits Meyer played his last season at Depal Averaged nine points a game 16 starts Hes a very good threepoint shooter That time he steps into one inside the threepoint line Started his career at Coastal Carolina Bucket is blocked Thats a second block already for UAB But inside the bucket is put back up and in Good job there by Williams screaming 221 fullourt press And again out of bounds turnover for UAB Andy Kennedy told us today at shootound hes still trying to figure out his guys right Its a lot of new guys adjusting to the new landscape which is college basketball which means your roster is going to turn over pretty much every year Hey said its one of one of our harder seasons that you know hes had in terms of coaching I dont just get started as a threepointer off by McNeel only because he doesnt know what this team can quite do yet He wasnt sure how they would respond to this environment I think theyve responded very well early in the first couple of minutes So far so good Ball knocked away and a steal Heres Holiday Thats what NC State does Get their hands all over the ball and a foul on the drive and Paul McNeel Jr will have two Its a good job of running off their defense Thats something that is a habit Will is trying to instill in this his guys Turning teams over and quickly striking on the other end And Paul McNeel going to get to the free throw line off his aggressive sprint up the floor ahead of the ball And how big of a season can this be for McNeel in and Snell Jordan Snell only two returners on this team but you know he had a little bit of a tough adjustment to college last year but boy he had 16 points in that first game and hes going to be a factor this year He was one of seven guys in double figures in the season opener Hes added 20 lb of muscle to his frame Now hes a slight athlete He doesnt look like he put 20 lbs on right But the strength and conditioning staff was really pleased with his effort so far Got a steel There he is McNeel on the bucket Thats a great double team over midcourt Cause the turnover Foul line pull up is good by Jacob Meyer And one of the things UAB has done well early against the pressers Keep the ball in the middle third You dont want it on the sidelines against a pressing team You dont want it in the corners You want to keep it in the middle third of the floor Buyers and theyve been able to set up a zone because theyve been able to score So Andy Kennedy changing up his defenses early Now its a steal here as West takes it for UAB Bump and scores it anyhow First bucket other than Meyer for the Blazers Theyre within one May baskets his own misses Its been man NC State likes Darien Williams on the nail tapped around and rebounded by Evan Chapman And back to your point Debbie about what coach Kennedy was saying yeah obviously you got to score but when you were able to score youre able to get back in center of the defense like you said That way you can control the tempo a little bit on the road That was a big factor for him in this game here as well is tempo Heres a three ball but a lead for UAB No rebound by Musa Saga Williams wide open for three and rebounded by Chapman again Derry Williams isnt going to get that many wide open looks A mistake by UAV but Williams cant make him pay in transition Heres Meyer pulls up again and hes off to the fast start here in this game tonight Eight of the 10 and the Blazers have a onepoint lead 22 for Meyer in the season opening win for UAB over Mississippi Valley State Williams again having good luck there Debbie but hes missed both And this way Andy Kennedy can call off the sets He can go deeper into the shot clock He can shorten the game You dont want to have a lot of possessions against a team that likes to run and press like NC State And Andy Kennedys team has done an excellent job early Yes they have Just under 6 minutes in theyve got a onepoint lead Back to Raleigh after this Tonights baseball team Congratulations on yourthletic achievements Heat Heat UAB by a point here early Theyve had an outstanding run over co with coach Andy Kennedy here You see it five straight seasons of 20 plus wins Debbie and and the appearances in the postseason as well Hes got 392 wins over his career He has been outstanding consistent and very successful I I covered his teams when he was at Old Miss twice He was named coach of the year by multiple outlets in the SEC Hes always won everywhere hes been Well and think about this Lets highlight that note on the bottom uh a little bit more there 124 wins in the last five seasons Thats coming after CO We know what its been like now And the the way college basketball is 11th best in the nation Thats incredible Thats impressive Missing out of the water there was Lindsey Martin Here come the Wolfpack and its Matt Ael in for the first time tonight The true freshman out of Baltimore just turned 19 years of age And here he is on the runner Hes a bucket I mean he can score in a variety of ways and hes aggressive for a young guy You and I both talked to him earlier a lot of maturity as you said just 19 years old And there are some mock drafts believe it or not projected him in the possible first round next year He told us how much he loves college Hes having a great time here in Raleigh Thats a lot of credit to Will Wade too as well He said loves what he has here Doesnt over penetrate into size pulls up on balance Said hes working on his defense Look at that 24th ranked in the ESPN rankings coming into this Hes a math guy Wants to get into business someday He said be around people potentially maybe like a manager in the NBA at some point Of course after a long playing career Right Exactly I always premise that right Debbie when I ask him say after basketball whatever that is right because we all know everybody wants to move on Checking to see that last shot hit the rim 1326 to go first half Shot clocks at 20 Abels going to put it back in Did not hit the rim Heres Hollowan Trey Hollowman Staying in that matchup zone Able Oh nice rebound that time by Sier over the top without fouling Terrence Arsenal now got it NC States not forcing anything offensively Theyre moving the ball Well theyve got to play inside out against that zone Arsenal who in game one kind of said he felt his Achilles tightening up a little bit and didnt want to risk anything only played in 10 minutes comes here from Houston London for three No good And the rebound by Sonia screaming Three ball No good Arsenal Offensive rebound Hollow Arsenal again They did make 19 threes in the last game Im wondering if theyre settling a little bit early 0 for eight to start the game outside the arc I was just going to say Debbie good call That tied a school record with the 19 and both teams are over from the threepoint line Well take a timeout Just under 12 minutes to go here in the first half Wolfpack now by three video on the radio hand speakers Heat up here Heat Heat Incredible job and especially the last couple in Mc to bring Will Wade here An investment by NC State to put Will in charge with his staff Its a high energy group I think Will Wade is showing a lot of respect to Kevin Keats the former coach here who state in that final four a couple of years ago He doesnt call it a rebuild Not in the landscape of where college basketball is right now Well nobody expects that either right Expects you to By the way the ACC is back Just in case that second count Harlem had just scored the previous bucket for NC State Well Wade you know when we talked to him earlier its all about the relationship with these players going out to breakfast with them lunch having oneonone meetings going out and really showing these guys that he cares because he coaches them so hard and he can yell at them He can be in their face at times if he needs to be because they know that he cares about Well if thats the only way now in the environment that were in tough love is a a hard thing to come by You know Adam Howard is the offensive coach Brandon Chambers is the defensive coach and Wills got a lot of staff over there with resource to be able to win and they expect to win right away Wild they had to put it up The shot clock was going down Thats why Hollowman UAB Ball and I like that approach I mean there are teams and staffs that do that with the offense and defensive coordinator kind of like you know football obviously But I think then you can be more of a a manager right And youre not worried about Yeah you have the vision you know youre youre youre thinking two possessions ahead Youre not worried about play calls you know things like that that you can just manage the game in a different way Analytics plays a big role in what Will Wade does as well but he also has tremendous feel for the game No points over the last four minutes plus here for UAB They had a 10 to9 lead Six nothing run here by the Wolfpack Rivera on the drive No great outlet by Van Allen Lubin as they say that off the hands out of bounds off of Holland UAB is ready to attack Close outs Every move of the ball there low on the catch and theyre ready to drive Theyre looking to get in the paint Of course NC States defense is designed to stay out of the red zone is what they call which is the lane They are trying not to give up any middle drives They dont want the ball in the middle of the floor Gez we got the red zone We got offensive defensive coordinators here Yeah Well theres still a little cost for football Yeah exactly And that got blocked inside by Arsenal And its thrown away here by Rivera And backto back rebounds and three ball goes down for Evan Chapman Chapman shot 35 last year from the threepoint line for a 68 guy shooting from the outside if youre a big guy these days For sure Thats right Exactly halfway through this first half Nice pass Rivera got it from Chance West in the no look Thats why NC State doesnt want the ball in the middle of the floor They did not do a good job of their transition defense And that was the number one key today in shootound that Will Wade emphasized to his team We have to keep them in front and make them execute in the quarter court Almond Dang Its not there Rivera attempted and a foul is called as it was rebounded by NC State and Arsenal heads to the line The rebound and then the second time that Ben Alubin turned it over I mean hes going to get credit for both those turnovers I believe And then this is in transition up the floor Wester does a great job of getting to the middle of the floor and getting an advantage twoonone on the back side of NC States defense Foul was on Westery his first Pretty clean game so far here Just two team fouls for UAB one for NC State If youre Andy Kennedy and you take it in like a four stage process every 10 minutes I mean not too bad here Were tied at 15 I mean I think hes had a good control of the tempo of this game And when you go on the road this is what you want You knew your teams going to compete You knew Andy Kennedys team would be prepared And theyve g they come in here and theyve made plays early Now its all about trying to sustain this you know for a full 40 minutes See I think Andy Kennedys fine getting deep into the shot clock right now because hes calling every set in the quarter court Selene London here has it for UAB Working on Luben A three ball on the way Thats no good by Chapman because NC State switches on everything Thats why Andy Kennedy is making those calls So then Allen Luben did a really good job right there defending on the perimeter for a guy that usually plays in the post Certainly Whats the goal for NC State and why theyre switching all the time You switch to steel Youre trying to speed the team up Youre trying to make them uncomfortable You try to make them make a decision on every movement of the basketball West for the two Hes got four and the Blazers are back in front Copeland back to Arsenal and hes blocked inside Rivera Thats two today for him Back over to Meyer Hes rejected by Ael Couple substitutions coming in We look ahead to our mens basketball double header next Friday night as Duke gets set to host Indiana State and then NC Central is at North Carolina Speaking of the Tar Heels down 37 to 29 at the half tonight at home against Kansas and they have outscored them by 21 to win it 87 to 74 Huge win for Hubert Davis and North Carolina And a big win for the ACC A lot of conversation about the league being back but you got to win the games in the nonconference and thats a big one for the league McFersonson is in Only played in seven minutes in the last game McFerson junior out of Queens here by Lester UAB is really cheering driving those switches You know when they get an advantage theyre going strong and hard off the bounce Robinson had his hands in the chest of Ael Picks up the foul off the bounce He hasnt gotten too involved just yet Ahmad Robinson number four like his ability to meet his fifth school and hes got some bounce to his game Hes got a lot of experience as well Hes a a hard righthand driver to the rim Now UAB is on a nine to one run here for a threepoint lead Timeout coming at the next whistle Under eight to go and theres going to be foul Its on Kylin Lindsey Martin and it takes us to a timeout UAB looking good on the road in a tough environment 1916 early on here from Raleigh Thank you Im not surprised I mean the small quick Theyre athletic Theyre theyre quick off their feet Yeah they look more athletic than NC State You want it Yeah I think we should save it Save it if you want Yeah Yeah Im looking at you like youre out of your mind I know Debbieys like What laughter are you doing there What are you doing What do you think thats gonna laughter I think we should um I think there got to be one more crazy thing in the arena and then you could do the the marriage proposal Mike and then something else Im serious Like I think thatd be funny Yeah thatd be good Thats the kind of stuff Yeah So what are we doing back there Oh yeah Yeah lets do it Yeah Yeah we got to set that up You got a picture of his wife You got a shot of his wife Yeah shes shes right behind uh their bench right where Megan has Yeah shes right there in the green top Yeah thats her And thats Megan her daughter His wife Kimber there in the green and one of his two daughters Megan on the right They actually Andy and Kimber met here at NC State Kimber was a student athletic trainer and thats how they met I think she probably takes a few angles laughter So far so good for Coach Kennedy back here tonight with his team on top by two Seven and a half to go H for three That is no good Offensive rebound Another crack at it here That is Ari G that time on the drive Block and foul Theres Ahmad Robinson Yeah Ben Allen Luben has been stuck on the top of the floor on a couple of switches and thats by design Thats Andy Kennedys offense pulling him away from the bucket and making him guard on the perimeter He comes with a closeout and Robinson this is where small guards play underneath bigger guys He just does a great job of attacking that close out Theyre taking advantage of what you said Thats Logans second personal foul too Its really going according to the game plan here for UAB right Theyre slowing this thing down Theyre converting on the offensive end Theyre getting second chances You said it earlier Theyre getting back to set up their defense and then theyre taking advantage taking advantage of some of these switches and mismatches and just got move in a second personal foul I thought NC State would take advantage of their size on the block early We saw the first two possessions were postups to the low block They really havent gone to that much since But now that Darien Williams is back in the game they put him in that logo area around the nail where hes a tremendous playmaker Chapman on the foul And this is what youre talking about here I also thought the same thing The length and the size for NC State might be a problem Look at this But so far it has not been tonight Well look at the wingspan of these six guys that are under 7 ft tall And look at Terrence Arsenal Hes 66 with a 71 wingspan Thats pretty impressive That helps on the defensive end and recovery And it should help on the glass NC State has had their last field goal back at the 1145 mark here of this first half as Abel missed the three Robinson on the drive Scoopy runner rolls off Copeland comes away with it Back to Ael Matt Able just has a balance about his game Look how quickly UAB is back up the floor Able gets called out NC State likes to score up their transition game They rebound and then Copeland advance passes up the floor Matt Ael has numbers and takes advantage Ael was the first player to commit to Will Wade here at NC State 13 days after Will was announced as head coach three ball and Abels got the rebound off the West Green miss Since Jacob Meyer had eight of the first 10 points for UAB NC State shut it down McGee misses on the three and uh theyre now 0 for 12 from threepoint range So the exact opposite of game one where they had a tied a team record 19 threes made Theyre 0 for tonight When NC State played North Carolina Central they adjusted by put Darien Williams in the middle of the floor right where he is right there Thats a great way to get threes You go inside out for a three not a pass around the perimeter Right on Q Great call as Paul McNeel gets the three The first of the night for NC State Exactly what you just said because of them drawing their defensive attention You you you make the defense collapse then you get a catch and shoot three Meer bottom dribbling He lost the handle Did that go off of NC State though Yes it did All right back to your point about Williams here So watch Darren Williams working in the middle of the floor Look at the defense overplaying laid on a close out because theyre worried about the preseason ACC player of the year So they collapse on him inside and that leaves a wide open triple Yeah At one point you saw three green jerseys around him So I get you dont want him to hurt you but a team that is knocking down a ton of threes you got to step out as well I guess until they hit one which they finally did Roberto to the corner for Meer Thats not good on the three and a rebound by Sier Sier does a good job of getting off the contact Thats a couple of rebounds that hes gotten over the top of a UAB player Copelands pass is intercepted Five turnovers now And Robinson from Meer to the 10 NC State has to be a little more patient on the offensive end Just move the ball play inside out Let Darien Williams get a few touches Copeland for three Thats good Claudier Copelan coming from the geese with coach Thats part of the freedom that Will Wade allows his team to play with You turn it over You dont hang your head You go make the next play Smoke back on top 25 to 22 5 minutes to go in the first half Rebound to tie it No By Robinson Fight for it Ael has it Good effort there by Kyron Lindseay Martin but couldnt get it for UAB Williams Tough shot over Lester Theres Rivero screaming Rivera working on Williams Help comes from behind him and instead its Meer trying to Good patience on the block Good basket cut by Meyer First player in double figures in scoring here tonight Hes got 12 to lead all scorers in this one Right back the other way Paul cheering McNeel for three Now theyre starting to feel starting to heat up a little bit Nine for McNeel NC State by four Rivera got it Straight line drive down the lane line Good pickup for UAB from the portal Transfer out of Bryant and UMass from last year Daniel Rivera 10 points in game one Also the foul as Copeland drives in Hell have free throws when we come back NC State the lead is only two here tonight Much different type of ball game for both teams here in game two of the season basketball alumni receive including Albert DJI Alex Ladies and gentlemen Its fuzzy Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Okay Yep Yeah Yeah Okay Good Thats great Thats great 12 points Thats a game high Or excuse me Meyer Jacob Meyer and Darien Williams only two so far for NC State Well this first shot was blocked He missed a couple of threes early Will Wade took him out sat him down Now he has come back in and he has put him in that playmaking spot in the middle of the zone and he is capable of just making the game easier for his teammates He does not have to score to have an impact on NC States ability to win Am I wrong But scoring certainly helps Keeping the press on Six points for Copeland Fourpoint NC State lead Heres Meyer Back to Robinson for three And the rebound by Sier Siers been all over the glass Hes got six rebounds Make that seven inside the Williams Couldnt get it to go Second try Yes And a foul Its a good recognition because NC State had a mismatch inside with Robinson whos listed at 510 And Im not sure hes that tall Having to deal right here trying to front Williams And Williams just walks him up the lane And then good pass away from the D and he stays with it Second foul on Rivera for UAB And how about with Darien Williams who you know we just showed only had two points Now hes got four a chance for five But he doesnt have to force it because theres so many other great players around him Well he he has the ability to impact the game in a lot of ways I had him last year in the NCAA tournament at Texas Tech and I noticed that he had slimmed down I thought he was trimmer So I asked hes down 63 in body mass Thats a tremendous number I mean he looks really good Well and I just thought that your point earlier was great about getting him down low there as a nice dunk goes inside here for Evan Chapman because he draws so much defensive attention You know its not just a scoring Williams He gets the assist Good guys free for shots He makes the game easier Mhm Hes two of seven from the field now Once again now hes starting to get going here Well hes a matchup issue on most nights at 66 Thats the bullying ball part of what his game Robinson misses on the three Offensive rebound though Good job there Pulling it in was Kiron Lindseay Martin Meyer pulls up No another offensive board Missed it Chapman Theyve had multiple opportunities in the offensive glass Thats now six offensive rebounds for UAB but only five second chance points He just goes Barkley right here on Meyer and then makes a play Smart great vision good cut on the backside Sier was the recipient of that one And two assists now for Williams And all of a sudden here NC States up by nine points Fouls going to be called Will Wade just got a technical Yeah hes so fired up after that play And not sure why hed be that outraged on you know a foul there Youre up by nine Teams getting going here And then all of a sudden he gets called for the technical Coaches dont like a loose ball foul You know like when the balls on the ground and its kind of a loose ball Now did the foul cause the ball to become loose right there in front of NC States bench And Billy Coington Jr didnt hesitate no to throw the tea at him Is it a foul Sier was called for a foul All right So here you go Yeah but they called a foul I mean I would think he got him on the arm Yeah I think theres a foul there But you know what I think right now Coach Wades averaging a technical a game here at Raleigh He hadnt won the other night too You know what I They won 114 to 66 The Red Reckoning loves it I can tell you that So the foul first then the technical and UAB And now another foul here as Meyer goes to the line Really what its done is its it you know got the crowd going a little bit here Billy give me the stare down Billy its my boyfriend Different vibe around here nowadays huh I mean you know youve been around here all the time I mean Billy Coington Jr is one of the veteran officials in the game And its an emphasis sportsmanship on the sidelines an emphasis Copeland got called for this foul for NC State One of two for Meyer Thought process here in the final 120 You know we talked to Will Wade about two for ones and that and that sort of thing right here Theyre going to look to score quickly They like to get three possessions here in the last 120 Williams got fouled Maybe a three for two maybe instead of a two for one Yeah its going to be Westery who picks up the foul So Williams will head to the line here Thats the 18 foul Its a one and one They may get more than three possessions out of this Well you see Williams who started one for five and hes had two of his last three two for two at the foul line with an assist on a basket too in this little stretch Yeah two assists total three rebounds And just like that hes tied for the team high in points with McNeel with nine Its always going to be a balanced attack with NC State And its not going to be one guy every night Its going to be a different guy every night Well you said it earlier with 10 players in double fig or excuse me seven players in double figures in scoring in game one That was the most theyve had since 2017 Steel Arsenal No the follow is there from Copeland Copelands got aid Meyers trying to do everything And a foul is called here You dont want to commit that foul when he is out of control Meer does a good job of getting to the free throw line right here Watch Arsenal and look at Copeland stay with it screaming Thats NC States game right Theyre going to get into those passing lanes Steal score steal score Thats the mentality What about as an opponent Do you think more of like hey lets fake this pass go back door here in order to try to do that I call that a pressure package Like you have to have ball fake shot fake back door cuts dribble entries those things to alleviate some of the pressure I think Andy Kennedys team has done that This is a really important last 43 seconds here for UAB They got to keep this within a few possessions screaming Largest lead for UAB was three at 207 Largest music lead for NC State was at 4131 just a moment ago And 13 points now for Meyer for the Blazers who are down by eight Yeah theyre going two for one right here Thats why theyre letting the ball roll in before they pick it up The quick three ball is able stays off 20 on the shot clock screaming play shot 10 to shoot 25 seconds to go First half Tough one there Rebound UAV contact Yep Robinson No look inside Good on the bucket that time from Kyon Lindsay Martin Offensive board Meyer The put back in and out Four seconds to go and rebound by NC State That is not going to be it No good if Pearson even if he made it And thats the end of the half them tonight Hes like Listen guys this is a better team Okay this is a good team coming in here at UAB And theyve showed it so far in this first half Well see what we get here in the next 20 minutes small quick good off the bounce and taking advantage of switches So Van Allen Luben picks up two fouls He goes to the bench Hes got to guard perimeter guys in this one through five switching defense UABs taking advantage of it just like that Yep Thats Rivera on the basket 4135 now Sixpoint game here Backing in the post Van Allen moving Lets see on the other end This is what Van Allen can do I mean he is low post back to the basket Offensive player thats going to be the third on Rivera on the drive here Copeland basket and a foul Tuck the contact and converts I think youre going to see a more aggressive NC State team here in the second half Both on their ability to put it on the floor and drive it They went three for 16 from three in the first half I think theyll set up their threes in a different way here in the second by establishing their play in the paint first cheering Robinson bounces it inside and a dunk by Kyron Lindseay Martin Hey when you dont have great ball pressure and you load up your pressure in the front of that press you can get beat with advantages on the backside and NC State should never be giving up a rim slam like that against fullourt pressure Not going to make coach happy on that one for sure Theres a little bump in the back It wont look good on film tomorrow Now again no good Westry the rebound You cant get the let the ball get sticky either You got to keep moving it Copelands three of five Hes got 11 points That leads NC State tonight 13 for Meyer for UAB Number 12 in Green Hes the top scorer in this game Hes got it Robinson Nice crossover got by Williams Took it in No And its tapped around and the Wolfpack and Hollowman have it How about that explosion by Robinson How quick off the bounce McNeel pulls up and hits Thats a two He hit the gamewinning threepointer in this exhibition game they had over South Carolina They had three threes in that game really turned it on at the end of last year 24 versus Wake Forest Double digits four of his last eight games Now in the starting rotation for this team inside Lum Yes Largest lead of the night here for NC State at 11 And a nice drive here by Meer Hes got 15 Staying in that zone on May baskets NC State more aggressive off the bounce hadnt taken a three here in the second half Solomon who spent three years with Tom Mizo at Michigan State as you would imagine super tough He plays fast hard aggressive as evident of that drive right there Instead of settling for the three on the reversal you see the gap and Hollowman does a great job of closing that space off the bounce music Yeah Trey Hollowman you play for Tom Mizo youre going to be a competitor Youre going to be a tough guy and youre going to know how to play defense Think about some of the guys that hes brought in right And from those programs just to your point there you had how about Terrence Arsenal right Samson Darian Williams playing for Grant McClin Yes And all all winners cheering Yeah I mean theres so much experience on this team and also postseason experience as well Uh there it is right there All these guys had at least one win in the NCAA tournament And look at Terrence Arseno underneath Kelvin Samson went all the way to the championship game it in Every guy talks about Paul McNeels development in the offseason How much time he put in You can see it on display here again Twoonone on the backside of NC States pressure and UAB makes him pay Thats happened a couple times Rivera again but its a 12point lead now for NC State 1621 to go second half 76 gas courtesy of 76 109 Yeah Move it out 3 Number one number one Is this the 3 2 1 NC State music has extended their lead here in the second half to 12 points behind the play of sophomore Paul McNeel Hes got four triples in the game Two in the first half music and two triples already in less than four minutes here in the second half NC States doing a good job of going 212 on offense against that 32 zone defense and theyre getting in the gaps Hollowman scored on a drive in the gap the possession before McNeel hits a three in the gap Good ball movement by the Wolfpack Certainly is They started this game 0 for 12 from threepoint range Doing much better now Four of the last five They hit UABs going manto man on this possession Williams Got it Dont you feel like on the way to the Ramy just sheds defenders Yeah and and it looks so under control and almost effortless a little bit right there on that last one I dont think you can knock him off his line I mean hes too strong But a good job to do it without foul Just kind of bullying his way in there He doesnt toss an elbow or extend his arm He just uses his shoulder Meyer splits to a double team That doesnt go The tip is there by Rivera Thats 10 for him Andy Kennedy knows his team just needs three stops in a row to turn this game around and then he needs three scores Copeland on the kick Coleman checked by Meyer Wow Put a hand in his face for three You better make that if youre jab stepping jab stepping in a corner Thats seven for him Werent going to be able to keep the wolf back down for long from the threepoint line Its a steal Williams unselfish cheering and applause One of the things that will Wade points to is the assisted basket number for his team 12 assists on 23 main baskets so far How about in game one they had 27 assists Westery Yes cheering Westery in three years had 27 points in his college career He had 23 in the first game and already hes hit double figures Excuse me hes got eight spent time at Auburn and Syracuse and then youre right is really going to take on a much more prevalent role at UAB Time out This is the kind of unselfish play Will Wade wants to build the foundation of his offense on Make the easy play for an easy Heat Heat Heat Heat Hey I Heat Heat You going to take me home tonight inside rock All right Debbie So back in the day in Reynolds Coliseum music the noise meter hung from the rafters And theyre trying to bring that back a little bit here now right I mean its a part of the history of Reynolds Coliseum The noise meter hanging from the ceiling how they built them for the Wellade era I think the fans love it Uh it just shows you how much excitement is in the arena how loud it can be in here You were talking about Reynolds earlier and uh just the history and tradition of that place Well you go all the way back to Dixie Class again the formation of basketball really in the south It flows through Reynolds and through NC State A lot of history here two national championships 1974 of course 1983 Jimmy Meyer no good in the front end got it back Now Robinson for three out of bounds cheering cheering One for 14 from threepoint range for UAB tonight The shooting got started off pretty well here in the second half UAB was 6 and N NC State eight for nine That was a few minutes ago Got a little mouse in the house action NC State didnt see it Oh its foul Thats going to be four now on Kiron Lindsey Martin go Fourth school for him was a Georgia Texas Tech Murray State now here at UAB See if hes going to be subbed out by Rivera And that will be the case Andy Kennedy might not have that big 7 foot guy at the front of the rim but hes got great rim protection He has good paint protection And theres these guys are quick off their feet Well theyre playing hard You got to make up for it right In other ways Bad pass there by Chapman And again inside of the defender that time Meyer three balls Chapman trying to make up for it Clangs that one Mcneels got I dont think the last couple of possessions are Yeah Good execution by UAB You kind of wondered when they start to get down a little bit right And all of a sudden that starts to happen and you want to take over on your own cheering Anderson for three Nope Chapman again Theres Desan Anderson cheering relocates Thats a three Thats no good Last four shots for them have been threes They just dont have it tonight Theyre one for 17 Oh speaking of threes Jerry Deng hits it cheering Hes got range They like him out there sometimes shooting those shots And UAB a foul is called underneath They have just gone cold now cheering Jerry Deng 69 for the Wolfpack off the bench And this cheering is what he does Dribbles into a wideopen triple NC State starting to pull away music sound music cheering Who needs something cheering Christmas music Its a good message Sing music music music Please music We talked a little bit about the new staff here for NC State and how all these guys work together Well theres Adam Howard Hes the offensive coordinator to the left drinking the water Brandon Chambers hes the defensive coordinator next to Trey Hollowerman And then Vernon Hamilton who played at Clemson music while Will Wade was at Clemson is a part of the coaching staff I mean these guys are Brandon handles the defense Adam handles the offense Vernon handles the recruiting They all work together in tandem Ive been in practice with Will Wade He lets his assistant coaches work I think Will Wade wants to get the basketball on any uphill pass Hes yelling at Paul McNeel He should have had that steel on the pass back up to the top Sier now for Copelan on the drive Got through for two When you turn a corner like that and you get low your leverage is your advantage He was with Syracuse for two years He actually had his careerhigh when he was with Syracuse here at NC State 25 I called that game Oh wow You lit it up in the second half Copeland nicknames Q Gets it over to Ael Back to Copeland Its a three ball Its good 16 for him tonight Ty McNeel for a game high And a foul as West drives Q Copeland maybe a little hook right there Got away with it but then he steps into this one Good balance by NC State here in the second half And we talked about Chance Westery and the other places that hes been to as he goes to the free throw line Hes a fourstar basketball player out of Harrisburg Pennsylvania And he really missed the last three years of playing Two knees and a sinus issue And Andy Kennedy said after the first game it was good to see Wester have some success see the ball go through the net He had 23 points He only had 27 points in his three years prior Hes just not had a a healthy start to his college basketball career Well we had a nice conversation with him today Hes a smart kid Hes a high IQ basketball player Hes going to continue to get better Finally able to get on the court and get some action going I mean he said that hes hes been able to stick with it Anything thats happened even in bad days and you know learning communication and just kind of get back up to speed Hes going the other way here McFersonson music A few more smiles now here Francis did where where did this one turn in this game Like where are you seeing the difference All of a sudden its a 20point lead I thought it turned in the first half the latter stages when Darien Williams got going But that was the difference He made a couple of baskets He made a play on the inside on a dive He got to the free throw line I think thats when NC State started to separate He only had two and then got up to nine to your point rather quickly This ball knocked out cheering Well now heres the thing First off youre only able to review back last year and previous a ball going out of bounds at under two minutes left in the game and in overtime You always remember seeing the players swirling their finger around like reviewing You cant do it Well this year you cant do it at all It has to come from a coachs challenge if you want to review a ball going out of hands You get one challenge if you have a timeout If you get it right you keep your timeout If you get it wrong you lose it Yeah Lets take a look at this This is part of some of the new rules this year right For the coachs challenge So if youre successful on your challenge you will receive another one and a final challenge So you only get two total but you have to have a timeout to challenge a call And so heres the things you can challenge Out of bounds basket interference and goalending and restricted area plays Now in the last two minutes of regulation in overtime theres no challenge necessary on those plays except for the out of bounds So the officials still can go over under two minutes take a look at basket interference goalending restricted area but only out of bounds has to be challenged by the coach And I know they were trying to speed things up a little bit and the reviews at the end of the game but in my opinion its like you want to get the call right you know and I I always kind of side on the side of the officials there where if you do call one I know sometimes you got you got to go to the next one next room and people oh the games take it for whats cheering and applause it take an extra five minutes to make sure you got it right What happens Demi in a game this year another 10 seconds they might get it wrong and nobody can challenge What do you do then if somebody wins Yeah You you got to believe the officials are going to get it right If you ask me the advisors this the observers and the people that work with the officials theyll tell you that you know the officials grading on every game is usually a high percentage like high 90s Oh no theyre great Yeah Im just saying I I talked to all three of them before the game tonight Bill Cumington Jr Tim Cardy and Jerry here We said Hey look we get it but theres never a time where we want to go back into the locker room at the end of a game and say to ourselves oh jeez we might have missed that You know what I mean At a Christian time We havent seen a lot of challenges um early Not certainly not many in the first half Okay I havent seen that that happen too often but were you know were only in the first week Were still in the first week of college basketball Yeah Robinson applause 10 turnovers tonight for UAB What about potentially wearing teams down This NC State team that theyve got I think thats a big part of what theyre trying to do from some of the habits theyre trying to create defensively Theyve got a great rotation and theres Darien Williams He just makes the game easier He sees all nine players cheering Got it to Sier bucket To be the kind of playmaker with his skill you got to see all nine You can read the weak side You read your primary He can get to the second and third level Watch the vision right here Its a screen Simple screen and roll He sees that nobodys helping from the corners You got two shooters in the deep corners Middle third wide open What a great bounce pass too to get to him there Rivera gets the bucket here for UAB So theres Williams that line 11 four of nine from the field four assists Spent two years in Nevada as the Mountain West Freshman of the Year last year at Texas Tech Kansas wanted him too and Bill He stayed come here Robinson nails a three Kind of has a quick play to the crowd but its a 21point difference He did shoot a couple of air balls Thats the crowd but maybe hell silence the crowd That is the second threepointer made tonight for UAB First for Robinson Knocked away Robinson has it cheering Pops up another three Thats no good And its going to stay with UAB when we come back Wolfpack theyve led by as many as 26 in this game Its 21 now with 724 remaining Everybody please welcome your state We tip off a new season of college hoops Whoa Throwing music Nothing in this world Okay give it up for you Heat Heat music We tip off a new season of college hoops Whoa Throw it down big fella The hot young talent Let the celebration begin Welcome back college basketball here on this Friday music night And well Wade fired up here for NC State Theyre up by 21 but thats not what this guys built about right He wants this team night in and night out to play hard play the right way cuz when youre not in a 21point lead right Debbie Some of the plays that they made will matter even more cheering Im a big believer in however a coach schedules its their vision over the kind of habits they want to create with their team right So if youre playing a lot of teams that youre going to blow out you expect certain things to go your way Coming off a timeout Darren Williams gets a great look at out of three But you know 50 of the baskets are assisted Theyve got 11 turnovers I think Will Wayne expects a little bit better execution And you look at the scoreboard you think why would it matter But it does matter right now cuz you get into conference play and every possession matters No doubt Heres McNeel Hes got 16 tonight Copeland leads all scorers with 18 We got four players for NC State in double figures in scoring tonight 55 shooting from the field here for the Wolfpack Copeland on the bench Four turnovers to go along with his five assists I think he knows better than anybody else how much Will Wade wants him to take care of the basketball Well thats the thing when you played with him before there and to come here I mean that gives you a a head up a little bit notch above terms of knowing what your coach is looking for A foul here NC State threepoint shooting talked about it with the 19 threes they made in game one They started this game 0 for 12 Contents I think they started playing inside out I mean it wasnt just coming down and shooting threes It was getting to the nail playing inside moving the ball collapsing the defense Of course McNeel with those four triples He leads the Wolfpack in that category tonight And when youre able to get out and run and get transition going right all of a sudden you get two or three of those in a row and then the lead started to get up to double figures Well you got to control the defensive glass and that that was the other thing I I I thought UAB got some offensive rebounds in the first half NC State turned the ball over a couple of times in transition off of rebounds Thats something that theyll clean up Everythings fixable but theres certainly been great effort and energy by both really by both teams Well that is a good point because Im sure well wait a look at that Theres been 13 offensive rebounds for UAB tonight cheering Robinson bounces in here for Meyer Got it back Steps it in midrange No good Rivera Theres another offensive board Hes fouled going up Good work on the weak side Really carving out some space music music Third for Van Allen Luben music There is a a player that does a really good job of getting to the free throw line Certainly did a UMass for Frank Martin 26point lead still for NC State Tomorrow morning 1000 am Eastern The ACC huddle crew Were going to be in Virginia UVA Charlottesville Going to be ready for another full day of college football 2hour pregame show Previews expert analysis featured stories

colleague Paul Bianardi who said Matt Ael huge rise as a senior ranked him 24th in the 100 top 100 rankings of the best shooters in college basketball his father Doug able So he played for Paul when he was an assistant coach at Boston College See the balls not getting stuck Playing inside out Piece of the paint kick for three And the thing with Abel is that he was originally committed to Miami and then coach Larenga retired and left really midseason and then now comes here to NC State and a prospect at that What the Drive there for the two West cheering Hes got 14 McNeel for three cheering Meyer trying to do a little bit too much there Foul on a rebound Chapman his second One and one here for NC State Pretty good crowd tonight here The Lenovo Center the atmosphere the red reckoning is a

week They get us hooked up with interviews and players and coaches and really connect to the team They really do a great job of advancing the storylines of their team sharing the narratives of each program and helping us advance the great game of college basketball that we absolutely love Three ball from Danny Thats good 10 threes now made tonight for NC State London Yeah Yeah Look at this 206 total points in the first two games Thats the most in the first two games of the season since the 9091 campaign for NC State Its a lot of offense And Will Wade will tell you its generated from a defensive lens and sharing the basketball Two things really important to his foundation Good defensive habits speeding up the game high possession game then sharing the basketball Crazy enough UAB has nine steals and NC State has six in this game but the pressure and ability from this NC State team and depth is going to prove to be a factor and what teams have to really recognize coming in against this group And I know you always say right defense wins championships You hear that one all the time right But you know when you have offense right I almost feel like youre never out of it You know thats the way I see the game I always see it through an offensive lens If you score you can set the defense You can play whatever D you want I mean obviously you have to defend but this games about scoring Well especially today and unfortunately with some of the the rankings and the numbers that you know you have to do to get your standing up there Its it scored a lot of points and its knocking off teams sometimes in a big way The net efficiencies all that stuff important every game matters Guess the steel foul going up Want to thank our great crew here tonight our producer Lucas Raycraft
