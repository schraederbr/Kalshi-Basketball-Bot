former old Matthew Cleveland back in town Taylor Bowens been really good Chandler Jackson and Jalil bethia ready to rock this is the second time these two teams are meeting Mario Missi Eric Divens or if our entire group ready to play ball rivalry basketball didnt get better than this well you said it rivalry basketball and these are one of these games where you throw the records out of the window these two two teams do not like each other and theyre going to go as hard as they possibly can Watkins early jump shot there from the corner Florida States leading scorer sixth in the ACC Mak it a case for all ACC honors Cleveland Betha Ugo chuku Johnson and kid NOS won 80 to 65 back in early January Cleveland back on his former home courts going to the line and this is something from Matt Cleveland we have seen especially over the last eight games there is an assertiveness to the way he plays and Miami is following their leader well you know Matthew Cleveland he has get off to a strong start he has to be aggressive at The Rim but Miami overall as a team they have to get out to a fast start give themselves some confidence they dont want to play from behind on the road 0 and seven on the road this season looking for their first road win Miami actually hasnt won an ACC away game 13 consecutive contests since the middle of last year theres Matt Cleveland from Atlanta sixman of the year at Florida State the three 30point games this year with Miami lead the conference Cleveland has really improved every facet of his game Watkins steps into a three that rims out offensive rebound y now the birthday boy Chandler Jackson turns 21 today birthday bucket gets us started and we were talking to coach Courtney and shoot around those were one of the keys for his Miami team not letting Florida State get paint touches which collapse the defense allows to get easy shots like that and opportunities on the perimeter great job by Jackson getting in 2 feet into the paint knocking it down double team comes to he turns it over Ball B in the NOS dangerous in transition Watkins three ball launches right side miss everything well you want Watkins your best player on Florida State to be aggressive but settling for those first two threo shots is probably not what coach Hamilton would want him to do you want to start off setting the tone get to the basket being aggressive see if you can get to the foul line well Ed hes launched three times from Beyond The Arc go for three to start he does have a much improved shot from Beyond The Arc this season 35 hes an improved threepoint shooter but he excels at getting to the free throw line tops in the ACC and to start the game off get yourself going be aggressive get to the rim feel that contact get your blood going a little bit three ball in the corner not there two2 after Clevelands free throws nice offensive rebound and feed and the dunck from Brandon Johnson the senior from Raleigh are you Brandon Johnson is another guy for this Miami team that that hes capable of scoring 20 point 20 plus points a game but he hasnt really been consistent like Miami needs them to be but besides guys like Cleveland and Lin kid Johnson is another guy that could really be an X Factor for this Miami team averages nearly eight points a game on the transfer Yan at the glass flushes it home oh thats an aggressive dump there from Yan who had a double double 20 and 10 against Miami earlier in Coral Gables this year for Florida State to win basketball games they have to have Malik Yu be aggressive early in off you see what happened against clenon they really shut him out of that basketball game they lost by 30 points he has to look to assert himself early in this basketball game for Florida State that was a good pass inside as kid able to finish from the right block kans lead by two theyve played better over their last six games for Bill Courtney near turnover thrown away picked up by Miami Johnson kanes want a run Divine no go Tru three ball in the air yes sir thats Jal Betha and thats a great sign for the Hurricanes Jalia Beth hes one of the most talented freshman in the country slow start to the season but as the season has progressed hes starting to show his talent hes starting to find his way nine for Miami you working against kid trying to get to that right hand and does faces and heaps how about a little touch from you and I just like the aggression youre 611 youre skilled you have a good body size go into his chest bump One buch swice play off the contact and finish at The Rim great job early on by Malik euan asserting himself pass to the right wing on the attack block shot Taylor boo top five in the ACC and blocks one of the bests to reject transition three Davis cant connect its a Florida State team folks that does not shoot the basketball well and they have struggled all season from Beyond The Arc they dont shoot the basketball well and when youre going to the rimage Miami you know theyre going to have shot blockers there so you got to go strong you got to play off two feet you got to use your pump face you know what they do well they block shots tops in the ACC theyve got another one there and they steal the ball well Applause Music heres Jackson turning facing a floer hes got four on the day he turns 21 NOS down by one Watkins Yu those are the two guys who really have been consistent for Florida State this whole year if they can get another guy really to step up Jackson or Davis theyre going to be that much better kid with another Bucket from close range what have you liked from the way Miami has started I think Miami they just have to be able to assert theirself on the defensive side of the ball stay connected be physical then offensively they have to be able to move the ball get Florida State moving side to side so they can open up them gaps I think early on theyre doing a good job of trying to be aggressive driving the ball to the rim Watkins aggressive to the rim cant connect slow start for Florida States best player hes 0 for four Miami leading by three their McDonalds allam starts it off with a triple jalo Beth one of the most talented freshman in the country starting off early and on the other end bullbull says no no one of the Top Shot blocking teams in the country Music support spe spe e Music Miami leads Florida State by three here in Tallahassee the second of two meetings Nolls won 80 to 65 in Coral Gables back on January 8 you see what Malik euu and Taylor Bowen were able to do the nlls actually theyre season high in threepoint made field goals at 10 came against the canes but thats a different Miami team isnt it one that was getting used to coach Courtneys style now theyre more connected a better unit as theyve moved into February well coach Courtney he we were talking to him in shoot around he said after that California game they had to talk to the team and thats when he really felt like this was his team theyre playing more connected theyre moving the ball better and theyre more active on the defensive side of the ball Taylor B Bowen active three blocks that one against his former Applause teammate AR this is a team when you go into the lane you think you have a shot but then a guy comes the weak side with a 74 wingspan and gets a block fou at The Rim on the other Music end if Im jir Watkins I know I could shoot the basketball but why would I settle when I can get to the rim every single time like this and have a chance at an and one or an opportunity to make two free throws you cant settle when you excel at getting to the basket get to the basket and thatll open up your perimeter game Watkins who leads the ACC in free throw attempts and free throw makes knocks down the first hes in these scorers T oh Le Hamilton one of the legends of college basketball 436 wins he has done it at multiple stops including at Miami I mean just one of the greats and hes calling it quits here at the end of the season in tallah has well its an honor to be able to call his games and we have the SM new game the the end of the regular season game for Florida State so its honored to be able to do that but I love what coach Stan Jones told us earlier today obviously a Hall of Fame basketball coach but hes a leader of young men hes much more than a basketball coach he hes a a guy thats transformed these young men lives and that means more to him than than being a basketball coach was is super important especially now in this era hes built it on the backs of terrific defense creating turnovers the noes have forced three of them now Watkins left corner going to work against J thats a pretty move couldnt finish but a foul calls all if Im jir Watkins Im only shooting the basketball right now when Im wide open you see him jab jab good change of Direction into a spin cycle and I dont know if that was a foul right there by Joe B but just Watkins being aggressive to the rim thats when the referees are going to give you the advantage and if Im jir Watkins just continue to attack the basket aggressively and youll have the advantage and youll get opportunities at the free throw line hes done that the last couple of possessions Eric he has tied this game at 11 AR he hes a guy who I believe has a chance to play at the next level hes versatile hes a big guard hes strong obviously he has to he has to improve his jump shot even more but teams are looking at him as a second round pick if not get picked up in free agency but hes definitely given himself a chance by how hes played the senior year versatility length and ball handling ability can switch on multiple positions ton of NBA Scouts here tonight including Carlos Bozer our own ACC NW Carlos Bozer we go Choop working against Holtz tries to find the middle inside at The Rim nice pass extra Pass open three rattles out Jo B couldnt Applause connect dang one of Florida States best threepoint Shooters had a great look thats a great opportunity for Florida State and thats how they want to play long rebound get out of play Fast have open opportunities how about Cleveland torquing his body with a little finesse well another guy whos a big guard 670 hes going to have a chance at the NBA level he gets to the basket with the best of them in the country Miami leads by one after the Miss from Watkins and they turn it over how about the job that Bill Courtney has done for Miami hadnt been easy right the N excuse me the two wins of the 11 since Jim Lena stepped down on December 26th but you can start to see the shift right the last six games the guys are playing for yeah exactly we said it earlier it came after that California game when he really felt like this was his team now and over these last five six games you see the difference in Miami theyre playing connected theyre playing with more energy offensively theyre starting to move the ball and theyre a team that they could always score the ball area but defensively theyre playing much much better theyre playing play really well on that possession didnt they got a deflection Watkins struggling from the floor so are the NES four of 13 back door cut kick to the corner Johnson ball movement right side now Ogo chuku a three thats no good back iron Watkins has it and uku he only has four threes on the year so thats not his strength but we talked about it in shootter around hes a guy when hes on the floor for Miami theyre a much better team team being having him at the point guard position Jerry Deng also turning 21 today two birthday boys on the nlls team some Music twins Thomas three ball off to the left NOS are o for seven to start from Beyond The Ark Cleveland wants a transition three thats off the back ey and he grabed his own Miss on the attack too strong alier Malo pushes it ahead to Hol Hol Baseline Drive to Thomas on the left corner heres Den oneonone against Cleveland H drives Baseline floater front iron but hes fouled back and forth early and tally in this rivalry match up off e e e e e the accs committee for racial and social justice in conjunction with its member institutions have identified February 13 to 23rd as ACCC Unity week as a part of this initiative members of Miami and FSU Join one another on the court to demonstrate their commitment to seeing each other as equals and treating each other with respect and dignity at all times recognizing that our differences dont divide us but make us stronger Matt Cleveland four early points to lead Miami s got a bucket here whats stood out so far I think Miami is doing a good job of being aggressive really both teams have gotten some open looks they just havent been able to knock them down FSU 07 from threepoint line I think Arya thats a sign get to the basket put your head down try to get to the free throw line like you having the opportunity right here here oh cant connect on that first free throw both teams combined over for their last eight in this game you saw the graphic that popped out of your bug there right the threepoint shooting so far not going either teams way the NS havent made one seven tries theyve gotten some good looks say h icy shooting NOS couldnt hit a bucket against Clemson over the weekend either 7246 loss it just kind of felt like there was a lid on the basket against the Tigers who sweep the NOS this season yeah well both teams arent great threepoint shooting teams shots like that one just not going down and if youre not shooting the ball great and youre getting to the rim having opportunities the rim and not making those it could be a long game Florida State just has to continue to be aggressive getting to the rim and those will fall eventually and then Miami threw the ball away thats their fifth turnover and thats one thing that coach Coury talked about they have to be able to take care of the ball they want to try to get out and play fast but they want to be selective when they play fast and be able to make good decisions theyve done a better job of that in recent games the ns are number one in the ACC in forcing turnovers per game heres Yan Baseline Drive oh he Steeps out of bounds he stepped on the Baseline the PA announcer was confused there was a whistle after he made the basket but it was a signally stepped on the Baseline yeah and I like the aggression I just think when he gets the ball he has to be able to make a quick decision Miami has to do a better job of bringing that double team early but when Malik Yuan gets the ball on the post down there you have to be more decisive be quicker to make the decision great looks from our cameras as Place erupted thinking they had an A in one students have packed it out sold out the students section anytime Florida State plays Miami and anything you can count on the students to show up Drive turning trying to face Schwarz losing the ball in the air kick out jobay three ball cans it Paul jobet the sophomore from France and thats what he does he can shoot the basketball and he also can get to the bucket but Miami did a great job of continuing to drive to the basket Drive kick out they got an opportunity up a along scrambled Drive in the basket again kick out for a jump shot Joe Bay did tie his career high with 13 against Florida State when these two teams met back in Miami Thomas he finds himself wide open again not there Florida sts 0 for8 from Beyond The Arc but thats the opportunities you want great ball movement Swing Swing for an open shot just dont knock it down but youll get those opportunities as you continue with that ball Movement kanes by four schs Joe Bay working against Swinton The Freshman hangs in the air thats tough shot great defense from AJ Applause swint its a great job by him Miami getting two feet in the paint collapsing the defense kicking out Jo B doing his job knocking down the open jump shot Al Jo averaging five points per game on the year also at 13 in a game earlier this season against Syracuse one of Miamis Best wins came on the canes home court in watsco Center Cleveland with over 30 on that night Miami does have two wins in their last four games they forced the turnover there and both teams are making it harder than its supposed to be on the offensive side of the ball and thats one way to do it Stan McCrae just go ahead get it put your head down get to the rim and finish with the left hand both teams let the ball stick too much they got to get it from side to side and try to find those gaps and attack off the ball movement well whos going to do it for Florida State without Watkins in and whos going to do it for Miami without Cleveland in the game good questions nonetheless could Malik Yan be the answer Watkins in foul trouble against Miami back on January 8th against the kanes and it was Yan who stepped up with 20 big points and Taylor B Bowen who stepped up with 16 but whats crucial for Florida state is whos going to be able to get the ball to Malik Yuan you have to have a guy who can get the right angle right passion angle to get him the ball where he can be a expected thats a tough shot for Betha off to the left battling for it down low NOS Come Away With It Kyrie Hui was in there for the canes huan good pass dang launches from the right wing and he connects all three of those for Jerry Deng here on his birthday ARA how many guys at the center position can dribble the ball up get their themselves into the post and then make a rightand hook pass across the court to their teammate to knock down an open three Malik Yan is showing his skill set right there stayen McCrae his three ball off to the right knocked out rebound long McCrae lays it in AJ stayen McCrae transfer from Samford a th000 points score nearing that Mark in his career dang just hit one is second off to the right rebound chased down to the corner by you what a pass dang its foul so how about the big man and he had Snake Eyes Malik Yan hes pulling all the stunts out showing his passing ability Miami by three in this Music rematch e e e e Music that is must TV give her the ball are you kidding me and its a tie game he Dr I cant believe what I am witnessing the streak Liv for the wi cant wait for champ week oh in the ACCC tournament it should be a lot of fun Miami leading Florida state 20 17 and we look at the game summary here I mean tough shooting from Beyond The Arc for both teams Cleveland and Watkins are two stars have combined for just eight points what stood out from this game so far about Midway through the first half well Miamis doing a good job of being aggressive they have seven assists theyre moving the ball well they got to do a better job of taking care of the ball but they want to try to continue to get that ball mov in the half court and if they can get out and transition and get some easy opportunities at The Rim Florida State on the other hand they have to continue attacking the basket theyre going to drop eventually if not youre going to get opportunities at the free throw line if you continue to be aggressive Miami only 13 assists per game averaging this season so the seven of them as this is a pass all Sten McCrae couldnt connect he almost had an assist for Cleveland just showing you the togetherness theyve been able to play with they found some chemistry some continuity and an understanding of what coach Courtney wants here over the last six games or so I think early on Miami was really playing a lot of isol ball they werent trusting each other now you see over these last five games theyre starting to trust each other more passing the ball moving it more and and Cleveland has really developed into more of a leader and guys are playing off of him he add to by necessity great defense M Miami forc the shot clock violation we just talked about Miami theyre improving defensively in what his defense is energy and effort in its activity just moving around flying around getting your hands up on shots Miami did a great job of that on that possession Bill Courtney told us he felt like it it was his team after the California trip right they get beat by Stanford pretty good there in game one game two they lose an overtime to Cal but you started to see the ingredients come together and since then the canes have won a couple of games Notre Dame Syracuse as we mentioned played pit tough played Louisville tough hasnt been easy sledding here and Coach Courtney joked he said look it is what it is but these guys a lot of seniors want to end their careers with wins and not losses and we technically still got a shot to make the ACC tournament I dont think people really understand how hard it is to take over a team midseason these guys were used to playing under coach Lara and now they really got to develop trust with with Coach courney even though he was assistant coach its a totally different thing being the head coach so you just like to see these guys starting to trust their coach and you know even though their record doesnt show it theyre starting to play better theyre starting to play more connected and more importantly theyre starting to be more active defensively in transition Davis count it through some contact as well we are tied at 20 on the bucket from The Freshman are you I know one guy whos not worried about the contact and thats Deontay davidon former football player hes going down hill with his head down and hes looking for the contact finishing at The Rim you can see the aggressiveness for Davis over the last couple games full court pass looking for Davis too Applause strong this former football player once he gets the ball with a full head steam hes just going right at you putting his shoulder down and hes not afraid of that contact and you see right there uchu just uh lost his footing but Davis with a good job just attacking the rim aggressively you was playing quarterback there two hands full court in this 2020 Applause game kid attacks lays it in and ARA I think for Miami in the half court set they have to do a better job of of finding Lyn kid hes doing a great job averaging almost 12 points but hes a solid low post scorer hes effective in there and when the double team comes hes a capable passer ly kid on his third ACC School in his career started at Clemson then became a really good basketball player at Virginia Tech in blackburg now at Miami double double against pit in his last matchup thats a foul theyre going to give Yan two shots that was Nifty from Malik Yuan on the pass he almost just tried to volleyball bump it into the net was one of the most skilled bigs in the country for him his whole thing is he has to be more aggressive you you have to be willing to be physical as that position at an inside position be assertive and I think if he does that hell just be that much better but ukuku has to do a better job of getting over there early on that dive from y he was throwing the Hail Mary on that last pass speaking of guys who know how to throw at full court full field down the field theres Jordan Travis along with Malik Benson Jared verse Amari Gainer said Malik Benson he was on the team this past year Trey Benson Arizona running back for the Cardinal second round pick guys back in town ACC Championship team from last season was that a goal 10 yes it was kid with a really nice move Lyn kids got eight points early hes done a nice job down low for the kanes and on both ends for Miami and Florida State when youre able to establish your big now it it makes the defense come in a little bit more now it opens up opportunities for jump shots in the perimeter and drives from your guards b b three ball off to the right long rebound coralled by ston McCrae kanes by three Hugo chuku into the Corner Johnson looking for help threw it away intercepted by Yuan Watkins in that right corner guarded by Johnson pulls it out six in the ACC and scoring steps back and he buries the three thats got to feel good for jir Watkins and I think thats the difference for jir Watkins this season early on in his career if you backed off he was going to attack you now if you back off he has the confidence to shoot that right in your face stayen McCrae steps back as Watkins hits the deck play on got away with the push off right there too Davis probes Watkins attacks steps through euro that rims out theyre letting him be physical so far but you you see jir Watkins just hit one on the previous possession now they have to come out a little bit further now that opens up that drive it was good defense by Johnson kid cross scor pass Cleveland three ball oh that was pretty from Matt Cleveland Smiles on his face well it feels good to come in here against your former team and and hit it you know a tough three and hes here in the booze but look hes one of the most talented players in the country oh speaking of talent that was tough great finish from Yuan and thats why theres NBA Scouts theyre here for Malik Yuan among other players Watkins and Cleveland but the skill set that y has is really rare at the center position he can pass he can dribble and he can score the ball he just has to be more aggressive number one in the ACC and field goal for percentage is you has been a big boost out of the Jo ranks for the nolles B Bowen stays on his feet Watkins Euro Step has it taken away Taps it out Jacksons three rims out oh are you kidding me B Bowen High Above This Tallahasse sky and how about the length of B Bowen going up there with the extra effort getting the tip in on the offensive rebound great job by bow Force turnover no one to run Davis takes it himself lays it in with the left hand time out taking Miami Florida State a burst of energy as they take the lead here late in the first Applause half and Watkins can drive the ball but he says I can also shoot it you better step up young man and on the other end Matthew Cleveland showing his much improved threepoint Applause Music range e e e Applause Music Applause how about the Defensive Rookie of the Year Jared verse with the Rams first round pick hes still talking to Jalil Betha Miami star freshman Jak trap Jordan Travis and Trey Benson oh theres the QB qb1 J Trav and Tre the second round pick of the Arizona Cardinal there is no love lost and Im telling you folks Jalil Betha was talking to the court side seats and saying Im a Birds fan Im an Eagles fan and he can talk he can talk hes from Philadelphia number three Philly went through the Rams Jil got to enjoy that look the E won the Super Bowl thats tops right there but then he just showed him his watch you see Peter War I thats my guy right there all time great thats a OG OG one of my favorite football players watching growing up yeah the tuck just went electric here in the break as they showed those guys on the Jumbo Tron ARA MTI Eric dandorf speaking of electric Ed in the building Bea oh that was nice little kiss and thats what he has to be better with his decision making be decisive rip go through get to the rim if you have an open opportunity but dont make the game basketball complex Nolls by one Timeout on the floor entertaining first half so far Music Music coach ham leading by one lets present to you Saturdays mens basketball triple header on acc Network Georgia Tech in Boston College start the day at 2 Eastern Then followed by 18th ring Clemson in Dallas taking on SMU thatll be a huge game and then Virginia Tech Miami cap the triple header Ed youll be and chest Nut Hill Ill be in the good city of Boston Georgia Tech is playing really good basketball right now and Boston College is coming off a win so it should be a a good match up Saturday strong drive by Jackson blocked out Oak foul called on be again just being aggressive to the basket youre going to give yourself an opportunity to get Applause fouled its a great job by Jackson a quick crossover and then just get downhill aggressively and its a foul by Betha right there Florida State needs other guys besides ying and Watkins to step up and be aggressive and I think Jackson is more than capable of getting to the basket and getting opportunities at the free throw line like this Jackson cant connect on that first free throw he joked with us earlier today he said he got to get a dub before youre allowed to celebrate your birthday he said theres no birthday thats fun when you dont win on the court if I if it was my birthday and I lost Im going right home Im getting a good meal and just going to sleep you cant celebrate your birthday after a loss you got to wait till the next day or something well coaching staff was joking and letting him know he had a 900 am class tomorrow I dont think it matters for these college kids foul called that is the third on Florida State who lead by two 31 29 42 seconds and a couple tips left again Ari like we were talking about in the beginning of the game throw the records out the window when these two teams play theyre going to go hard at each other its been a little bit of Helter Skelter basketball both teams are not shooting the ball particularly well but you like the aggression both teams have getting to the basket trying to create late in the shot clock nice pass o foul P Jackson was trying to slap the ball out of the hands there down low and look when you get the ball in the paint regardless if its a foul or not you you just put the refs in a tough position right more likely than not if you get into the paint and youre aggressive youre going to get a foul call they are going to say it was shooting and ston McCrae was going up with it AJs got a chance for a couple free throws knocks down the first hes got five pretty good first half here from ston McCrae the transfer from Samford where he was an all socon 13 member also led to socon and Steels got 24 of them this season for Miami amongst the team leaders shoots it well from the charity stripe 82 as you saw there on the first connect well hes another guy from Miami whos been playing really well last three games averaging almost 15 and A2 they shooting at 46 from the threepoint line Miami fork in the AC DC in free throw percentage one of the strengths of the team theyve been a pretty good offensive team All Season Bill Courtney was telling us that earlier offense isnt the issue for Miami its when youre giving up 80 points its tough to win any game theyve done a pretty good job though defensively in this first half thats got him tied at 31 shot clock off nolles on the attack b b attacks the rim stops turns midrange off to the left rebound by Kid hes got some time 1 second here full court he launched in the air is too strong do a better job of taking care of the ball and offensively for Florida State they have to be do a better job of getting ball M Coach danan Jones talked to us early talked about 225 passes a game that Florida State needs when they go below that they lose every single one just six assists against Clemson on Saturday for FSU a foul early on Cleveland assertive right out of the gate here for the canes who are some players that you want to see step up obviously Watkins and Cleveland will have the headlines as Matt makes the first free throw you and and kid have been good but who else is there a third option for either team that could have a big second well your best guys you want to get your best guys the ball so Matthew Cleveland you want to give him the ball you want him to be aggressive downhill and then Florida State you want to get Watkins the ball and if these other guys can step up and make play thats just an extra for both teams Jalil Betha was called The X Factor by his head coach hes got five in that first half you and on the drive thats Nifty Tor his body and still had the balance to finish its just its rare that you see a center with that agility and that Mobility you see the little change of pace and then just tur the corner being aggressive to the rim Malik Yu has to be decisive with the ball great job by him right there in that possession he was 10 of 14 against the canes in the first matchup theia m range no active from Cleveland gives a second chance Johnson finger roll got Taylor B Bowen in the air and AR this is Johnson is another guy hes capable of scoring 20 points hes hes done it but as of late hes really struggled offensively he has to look to get involved more and be aggressive on that side of the ball and he also leads the Kane in in assist are there ways the canes can help him do that well you have to be able to get him in spots where he can be most effective and be aggressive towards the rim you would think in that mid post area and hes hes an all right hes a capable threepoint shooter if you can get him off a driving kick you want to see if you can get him open opportunities that way as well so Miami team with two conference wins on the year theyre windless on the road away from the watsco Season watsco Center this season I should say Malik euan fou and is at the line but Bill Courtney told us look it was tough keeping the guys together he said there were moments where the heads were hanging and you could just see it it was like how do I go back to the drawing board to keep their Spirits high he said maybe you go to Cameron and you realize that Dukes going to be tough there you come back home to the watsco center you get blown out by SMU its that the guys have led together and Matt Cleveland has really stepped up and theyve started to believe in what they can do here towards the end of the year theyve got a shot to make the ACC tournament its still there on the table look man its not fun when youre youre losing that amount of games when youre playing basketball all these guys have a certain amount of Pride and theyre going out here not to just play but to win so its just good to see them out here competing early in the season they werent even really competing now theyre competing theyre playing hard theyre playing with more effort and energy great effort and energy from Chandler Jackson got the tie up possession Aro towards Florida State Jacksons given him a nice lift in this first at least in this second half and ARA to your point earlier what can the other guys do to help their respective teams well just what Jackson did be a pest defensively Davis be a pest defensively when you get the ball Drive downhill be aggressive create opportunities for yourself but for your teammates as well m b when was able to get close to the rim couldnt finish that was a tough attempt Miami three ball off to the left from Johnson and a foul as kid and Yan were battling in the paint the foul is on Malik Yan that is his first foul but you like the ball mov by Miami great job get downhill 2 feet in the Music paint yeah I mean theyre just theyre bumping down there you got you got to let that one go I dont know if that was a soft call right there we go chuk who had a nice first half against FSU earlier this season hes been quiet so far in this one Davis lost the ball we go chuko side of the rim a whistle late a lot happening H at The Rim after the play as well it is a foul on FSU its on you for Florida State youre disappointed because Davis had a great opportunity at The Rim on the other end you turn over and you create another opportunity for Miami get to the rim and ukuku hes a guy who he he struggled shooting the ball in his freshman year but youve seen some bright spots right he hes a guy who could handle the ball hes an explosive athlete he can get to the rim we were talking about it in shooter around with coach Im not saying hes Russell West Westbrook by any means but he has that type of explosiveness and in a young Russell Westbrook he he still had a lot to learn at that stage but Yuga chuku if he can get his decision making and improve his jump shooting he can really be an impact player going forward for this Miami team hes got some straight line burst no doubt about that as he goes to the rim really the only ball handler Miami has right that can play the point guard position at a natural ability he played well against get Florida State again on January 8th he got hurt the complexion of that game changed late in the first half the nolles ended up pulling away for a comfortable Victory turnover from Jackson up ahead Ugo chukus got a couple of teammates doesnt see them in time and then lost it oh its got to be frustrating for the canes what a pass from you into the Jackson and he lays it in well both teams have had opportunities in transition and they have havent converted and a lot of times they havent converted it end up going on the other end and getting a fast break opportunity which they convert so both teams have to be able to take advantage of these turnovers that theyre created Clevelands three from the left wing thats now going to go down seals looking for the lead down one we were tied at 31 at the break screen set Davis thought about the three got his man in the air launches off to the right icy shooting continues for both of these teams Leia left hand another block shot Cleveland OH b b it a man on a mission kick out a third chance Ugo chuku no and Davis comes away with it into the hands of Watkins three on three Watkins crossover crossover dribble attack turns Fades tough shot off to the right and it its just not a shot that you want if youre Florida State you can get a better shot by that but how about B bow on the defensive side of the ball G two blocks in a row great job by m Miami recognizing the mismatch undersiz Jackson get the ball into Lynn who has been an efficient five for five today hes two and 64 from the field I think itd be a good idea to get him the ball around the rim no doubt about it hes got 10 and eight Timeout on the floor and cant tell Florida State took the time out or if they are stopping either way Miami leads by three and B Bowen one block two blocks it looks easy but when B Bowens down there its not great job by B Bowl protecting the rim e e e call the accs committee for racial and social justice in conjunction with its member institutions have identified February 13th to 23rd is ACC Unity week kanes on top of the nolles here by three early second half action from Tallahasse ARA MTI Eric dindorf our entire crew got Chris Matthews Cory Huffman in the house producing and directing 900 here on acc Network late night with the canes and the noes and AR its really been a defensive battle but both teams have had open opportunities at the rim and on the perimeter theyre just not able to finish iy shooting from both Watkins turning facing and he connects thats a big time shot first points of the second half from Watkins from the midrange you just want to keep being aggressive regardless if youre missing or making keep being aggressive and creating opportunities for yourself nine points five rebounds for jir here is Ogo chupu hes got a mismatch against Maloo see if he recognizes it oh Luke said what mismatch give me that ball well thats the length right there of Florida States defense mowen sticking with it had a couple chances what a bright sequence for alier Malo how about the big fella guarding the point guard on one end getting the steel running the floor getting the offensive rebound and getting the put back great sequence right there by Malo talking to Leonard Hamilton about maluk earlier this season he said thats a modern Center in the NBA right the way that these guys are forming their skill sets really believes in what maluk will become in his future turnover even better defense from Miami and itll lead to two points Johnson puts it in and you it its almost kind of you have to laugh because one team turns it over has an advantage they get to the rim and then they turn it over and the other team comes back and has the transition opportunity its been a lot of back and forth like that this whole game air ball from Thomas and then a foul on Davis it looks like kanes by one well step aside be right back e e e e Music oh how good has Cooper flag B hes a wooden award candidate ACC Player of the Year favorite he has been as advertised and then as we move forward to the projections for the Big Dance Wake no longer a part of the fields Ed thoughts on this I mean theres a lot left to play for just three teams though from the ACC and the ACC tournament could be a huge difference well those those first three teams I think are a lot talking about Duke clemon in Louisville and then you have wake and SMU who could still play their way in to the NCAA tournament but you would really think that one loss would put both of those teams out give me those five on your all ACC first team yeah I mean hunter Salis the best player you could go back and forth and say cam hildr but I mean hes one of the top players in the SEC and you got Chase Hunter Chucky hurn leading the conference and steal second and assist obviously Cooper flag and Maxine REO the double double machine I mean if you want to argue with me I want to hear it because theres not too many guys that you come at me with well theyll find you on social media I promise they know where to find you on social media but Chucky Huer you convince me of it just the way that he impacts so many different areas for Pat Kels team let me ask you this who would be sixth the first guy out cam cam h i mean he a lot of people think hes the best player on weight for he he is the heart and soul but I did the game last weekend SM at wake force and I tell you what Hunter Salis he was on a different level just attacking the rim getting to the free throw line playing defense so it it its tough to to put cam hildr in that uh in that first team all ACC but um that thats my five I think hey if if you want to come at me on Twitter on IG let me know what your opinion is and Im happy to hear it there a foul on Jerry Deng after champ Jackson gave the nolles the lead with the midrange floater and then he knocks it out of bounds I like your picks I got nothing against them and I think you know guys like RJ Davis and jir Watkins Malik Burton JJ Starling from C I think all those guys will be at the table as they try and figure hildr as well as they figure out first team and second team its been a really good year again in the ACC though for stars yeah of and look jir Watkins has been one of the most consistent players in the country I think he has one game under double figures you talk about Marcus bur hes leading the league and scoring in the ACC but all these guys that Im talking about their teams are winning right theyre having an impact on their team winning playing winning basketball and besides winning theyve been playing really really good in conference I was organizing my notes and all I wrote was Devils Advocate heres five names just a comeback Ed I might not even agree or disagree I might not even disagree and really out of that group you Hunter salz might be the only guy where you could be like all right Ill plug in cam hildr right there but Im theres not too many other guys that you could really go to the two locks for sure Cooper flag and Maxine right no totally for sure and and you would think Chase Hunter I think Chase Hunter is a lock as well yep give me those three you know whos played like an all ACC first team member the last eight games Matt Cleveland for Miami he has played at that level nine points in this one averaging over 23 points per game in his last fate hes given Miami a boost mccains are down by one lock into the NOS leading Cleveland travel too many steps and C your point area hes undoubtedly one of the best players you see him right here one two I dont I dont think it was a Applause travel he looked like he took two steps right there two long steps but he looked confused as well yeah oh you know what when players get call for a travel they always look confused I tell you that I when I got called for a travel I was always going to be confused Jerry Tang looking like Eric demor from the right corner he buries a three Rs by four I tell you what that was something that Florida State needed a jump shot to go in but you see mayi coming down to the other end and you might as well throw a delay kid right there shooting 100 from the field right now kid looking like a man on that jam Music SS by two foul on Cleveland here you go Rim rocker Jerry D hes been consistent shooting the basketball for Florida State which they really need but how about link kid on the other Music end e e e e e Music Applause thats a big game for Florida State against their Rivals from Coral Gables because you see whats coming up for the nolles theyve got six conference wins 15 overall wins on the season but to end this the season its a brutal stretch uh it it its tough looking forward for Florida State but we saw what North Carolina state did last year if you get in youre going to have your a chance right it it its one game at a time and I remember my freshman year we were a ninth seed going into the Big East tournament no nobody had us in the NCAA tournament but we won four games in four days against some really good teams and if you can get in the ACC tournament you can start rolling having some momentum getting into it youre going to give yourself a chance anything can happen once you get in determin play Eric what were some of those conversations you your teammates were having that time of year as Cleveland goes down is fou its just one game at a time right you cant look too far ahead you got to take care of whats in front of you and I think the biggest thing is you want to you want to stay connected and you just want to play as hard as you can you got to compete at a high high level look at this level you have talented guys but usually the separator is how hard youre playing how hard youre competing and are you staying connected as a team through the adversity in this league in the ACC I think a golden example as Cleveland knocks down the free throw is Kevin kes NC State from one season ago right they able to win every game in the tournament they win the ACC Championship and then they make a run to the final four it can be done it can well it definitely can be done and just to be honest with you it makes for great TV right to see these guys that have been struggling the whole year to be able to get into conference plate and get on a rooll like that itd be interesting to see what team can be that NC State of last year this year just provides a blueprint even if its a low percentage shot it gives you some hope and something to work towards but that makes seaing so important and if the nles can get at least the first round by itll be less games and less days to try and win every game in the ACC tournament honestly even like a team like Miami whos at the bottom of the conference but theyre neck and neck to be able to get into that 15th spot and if they could get there and they get in the tournament who knows they get rolling they start winning a few games start feeling good things can happen Bill Courtney told us that today said we all know weve got a shot playing for each other a lot of guys who dont want to see their careers come to an end Matt Cleveland one of them hes got 12 points that leads the kanes Betha step back rattles out Cleveland attacking the rim there attack in the glass but he knocked it out of bounds and a Ras for that first round by the old are right in the hunt just a couple games shy right now pits got it Georgia Tech at nine its going to be a fight to the Finish there here in this league well you want to make the route easier for you going forward right so if you can get that first round by but the whole thing is to get into the tournament once you get in now its game by game and you just try to hopefully hit your stride when you get into that ACC tournament the seol lead byx one here against their Rivals D ball fake and kicks it out to Jackson swings it Cleveland was fighting for it three on the clock he got to get something up Thomas with two at the buzzer lost it l is footing as well Bea hes fouled the Seas parted and Betha found a wide open Rim noes clipped him in the end hell go to the line for two and look beia is a a very talented guard but the previous possession before that he was just pounding the basketball pounding the basketball pounding the basketball you have to be able to make better decisions with the ball in your hand if you dont have it get rid of it and move the ball you cant just have the ball stick in one place for that long its just going to end up in a bad shot great job by him just being decisive attack and get to the rim McDonalds allam misses the free throw number nine tar Hills highlight our Thursday night ACC Network womens basketball double header Maria gak dang leads Carolina against Georgia woy and cuse at 6 Eastern then Virginia Tech host Stanford on another great night of womens college Applause hoops and are I think too for younger players thats just you learning how to play basketball right moving the basketball if you dont have it right away move it get off cut cut and get an opportunity for your teammates but pounding the basketball usually ends up in a bad shot Thea ties the game with one or two swts three Ball P it AJ switon burying the triple and theres a great example of CH Chandler Jackson just making the extra pass to switt whos a another T forward how about L kid just give me the ball around the rim and Im going to finish for you he hasnt missed a shot in this game you and got turned around kids got the double double six of the season and backto back double doubles Y strong Drive C and one and I tell you what they worked on that quick short drop right there coach Stan Jones had him working on that and shoot around the day right he got to make that quick pocket pass great catch by y finishing strong and aggressive at the rim with the little star down right there hey Hey look its okay to have a little little bit of that in you right you got to stare down you got to feel good by yourself but its great to see Florida State execute what they worked on in the shoot around great pocket pass right there thats the third assist for Jackson Miss free throw s Second Chance three yes sir time out Miami the energy and hustle from Florida State and they lead by six little over 8 minutes to go Music Music NOS lead by six after the timeout from Miami they Hustle the energy and the effort leads to a second chance three from swin well they say the best time to get an open threepoint shot is off an offensive rebound and how about the other guys stepping up S hit his second consecutive Music Applause three AJ swin who missed a chunk of this season with an injury has started to play well for Florida State as hes developed in his freshman year at a Cabin John Maryland Florida States first commit six big points in the second half its the largest lead for Florida State at six a little under 9 minutes to go in this rivalry game if we take a look at our game summary from the noes and the canes you see uans had a big contest here tonight hes six for six from the floor kids had himself quite a game as well hes been pretty efficient what do you need to see in the final 9 minutes or so for both of these teams to come out of here with a win well both The Bigs have not missed a shot link H is seven for seven then six for six for for Malik euan but if I mind you cant let the ball stick you have to get some movement if you can get the ball to link kid in a spot where hes effective I would do that Florida State continue to be aggressive get some ball movement look for those open opportunities Sten McCrae shot was partially deflected it rimmed out heres swing is that a Bright sequence for the no the attacks lost it on the way up through some contact heres Cleveland hop stab ball it was poked away and this fan base loves it oh they theyve given him a hard time tonight y against kid couple of moves wrap around how did he do it and I tell you what man this kid skill set is superior when when he gets around the basket his footwork his touch his agility 100 shooting from the field for Malik y a magician around the rim back door cut but it was deflected Cleveland lost it on the way up and foul called on SN NS by eight its been the U show and AR you call him a magician but how about this up and under good footwork finishing with the left hand Malik Applause Yuan e being like just a kid from Maine and people were just kind of underes are you serious he e e being like just a kid from Maine and people were just kind of underes me are you serious well hes appointment television for third rank to Cooper flag he gets to play the canes on Tuesday at 700 you see the one and two seeds released from Joe lunardi the Blue Devils one of them its going to be a fun March Madness man I tell you what Cooper flag is the real deal I mean hes doing everything for Duke hes scoring hes passing the ball right hes playing defense I mean hes not underrated at all or spoken too highly of hes a guy that will be the number one picked in the NBA draft come June he was supposed to be really good and I think most people thought he would make an impact immediately and was a Phenom are you surprised that its looked as easy for him as it has especially after the first few games of nonconference where he was going through a gauntlet of opponents there on neutral courts I think the big thing for him is hes super skilled hes super talented but hes the guy on the court who plays the hardest like hes competing at a super high level and thats thats really the separator when youre that good when you have that skill set but youre one who really gives it all on the court I mean it shows thats why its going be the number one pick in the draft yes he will speaking of guys with high skill sets down low at least tonight Malik euan he connects and then the response there as well from Johnson Yan oh he couldnt put it down but a foul is called there was a whistle that was a pinpoint pass to finean well how about the pace that both these teams are playing with right now Taylor Jackson it really almost looked like it was going in but I dont know if that is that a a Miss no they didnt count that as a Miss cuz he got fouled so its still perfect still a perfect eight for eight but maliku in this whole game has just been aggressive hes been assertive hes been showing his skill set bringing the ball up passing the ball Making Moves In the post finishing with both hands hes having an outstanding game today and excuse me I said I said Cooper flag underrated I said hes not overrated hes I mean hes hes a guy whos lived up to all the expectations hes been good for college basketball in this Applause era you knocks them both down 5951 really in this second half for Miami theyve been turning the ball over and they havent been getting into their guy who is shooting 100 for the field along with Malik Yan they have to do a better job of making decisions with the basketball something that coach Courtney was talking about at shoot around there was a spirited shoot around for Miami earlier today and they huddled at the end of it as most teams do and they talked about again make it hard on Florida State no easy drives be together be connected play as one and theyve done that for the first 30 minutes of this basketball game and over the last couple Florida state has asserted itself especially down low wats thats a deep three halfway down and out to your point are its really been decision making for Miami once they get in the half court they havent been making good decisions with the basketball at all got 14 turnovers in this one they struggle to protect the ball the large parts of this season season and then you just see even right here on this position the balls sticking theyre not guys are just standing around and look youre going to get opportunities like those with a guy like Matthew Cleveland but you cant sustain through a whole basketball game shooting those type of shots even at eight against pit before that seven straight with 20 points M have done a nice job though defensively on him hes just three for 11 even with those 14 points hes got seven free throws out of eight attempts just the length athleticism that Florida state has at every single position its going to be tough for any player what a pass from Thomas behind the back the in the second half Florida state has really started to move the ball better guys are touching it theyre feeling good and when when everybody on the team is touching the basketball they want to share it right they know its coming back to them and thats when you get better opportunities at the rift heres Schwarz toia inside to kid cutting to the back B NOS took it away Johnson now swarz steps back lines up for three no you it rebound hes got five of them hes trying for the full court pass fenetic here at the Tucker Center A little sloppy jump ball possession arrowed to Miami Malik Yu is still 100 from the field Justin Thomas right there just knowing un was right around the rim hitting with the behind the back or half behind the back pass but great job by y just being available and I mean he has to be having a career night tonight 22 points 9 for n from the field five rebounds three steals has been Mr do it all for Florida State we were talking to ns associate head coach Stan Jones about you and maturity right as he grows on the court and how hes learning to battle through tough moments and Coach Jones said when he asserts himself early in games hes had nice nights hes been an impact for us and one of the best bigs in the ACC tonight hes done that against Miami well when youre when youre one of the best players on the court every time you step on you have to set the tone and be Asser of when you get the ball in effective areas be aggressive and and show that youre one of the best players on the floor dont be soft when you get the basketball be aggressive and set the tone he would has done that tonight he gets a quick breather 22 big points heres kid whos had a nice night himself lost the ball on the way up didnt get a clean attempts seals defense has been fantastic here in this second half and right here Florida State just execute offensively get some ball movement get a clean look Miami shooting just 32 c this half 7 to 22 not on the same page Watkins must have took his eye off Thomas for the half second that Thomas let the ball go and those are just the unforced errors that you you cant have you know even going forward for you know trying to get some momentum in this game youre up youre up eight points but you just want to continue to build on playing well little over four North Carolina Syracuse womens on Thursday at 600 Carolinas got a heck of a basketball team speaking of womens basketball Miami and Florida stage just played as Cleveland cant connect Watkins into the front Court Thomas moo and strips Ill tell you what it has been a sloppy today but Florida States doing a great job of just making it tough for Matthew Cleveland every time he gets into the paint first points of the game for Schwarz he was cherry picking got rewarded Davis thats well done from The Freshman one thing I really like about Davis is he he doesnt let Miss shots and turnovers deter him from being aggressive he continues to be aggressive getting downhill thats a big three from schars timeout taken by Miami a little under three and a half to play in tahashi Big Shots here from Schwarz in Miami he keeping the themselves in the game Schwarz knocking it Music down e e B Music a tight finish in Tallahassee but I want to remind you our next gymnastics meet is right here on accn in the ESPN app Sunday afternoon number 16 Stanford squares up against Clemson at Little John col ium coverage beginning at 400 pm Eastern ly kid in the canes they cut the lead to five despite Malik euans best efforts hes got 22 and five to lead Florida State hes got four 20po games by the way in his career and two of them coming against the Miami Hurricanes this season well Florida State they were just up eight points and then obviously now theyre up five but unforced turnovers by Florida State rushing in the halfcourt set you have a guy on your team who hasnt missed a shot you think you want to get get him the ball and try to play through him I was about to ask you who gets the ball here seems pretty obvious Davis at the moment handling Point Watkins top of the key Thomas on the curl good defense there from Schwarz and right there you have to you have to get him the ball Yan sets that screen sets another R Watkins probing the defense lost out of bounds it will be and a this Applause it and its going to stay with Florida State well Arya Justus in Thomas coming off that screen you got to find maliku right away he was just wide open you missed him then you tried to get it to him and and now youre playing with no spacing and it look at everybodys bunched up and you cant pass the ball when everybodys together like that you have no spacing Watkins clean look from three no Davis weak side rebounds its been a tough night for Watkins just two of 12 as Davis is fouled by Clevelands thats just Miamis 15 foul and if Im Florida State I need to take a big big deep breath and just relax you get the offensive rebound right there just take it out you dont have to try to go right back in when you have nothing going on Coach Hamilton looking for a victory against Miami one final time here in his career at Florida State and really if Im Florida say Im just involving you and whether its in a hand off whether youre coming off a down screen and looking to drop it back to the post or if Im prir Watkins I put my head down and put my shoulder in his chest and get to the free thr line so what you wanted if you were Florida State right Ed you had Watkins on a strong drive with you and cleaning it up in case he was in case he missed it and wasnt foul but Watkins will go to the line for two theres 245 left in the game I want the ball in in two of my best players hands jir wkins get the ball pick and roll situation try to get downhill if not play through Malik yui Watkins cant make the free throw every Point critical now Miami will love that really Florida State they had this game but but they continued to turn the ball over and just be Helter Skelter offensively and Miami has gotten opportunities hit threepoint shots and just continue to creep back in kanes are still in it Watkins does have 10 points now 33rd time in double figures in his career in the ACC Johnson kans down six need a bucket nope they turn it over instead number 15 on the night theyve been turning over all night and they theyve had their opportunities to get back into this game but when youre turning the ball over that much youre just youre bound to lose I looked over to my left and Bill Courtney put both hands over his face well that was a bad pass they didnt have an angle on the pass and he didnt have positioning in the post Watkins driving again hes fouled again so jir Watkins Florida States best player taking matters into his own hands here late when you turn the ball over you just give extra possession to the other team and eventually theyre going to take advantage of those extra possessions you see right there jir W is doing a great job and doing what he does best get downhill draw the foul Watkins makes the first of two preseason all ACC team member for a senior out of Trenton New Jersey started his career at VCU has been one of the accs most consistent players all year long leads the ACC and getting to the line hes got eight more attempts here tonight hes Liv there got to give him credit hes had seven big rebounds for Florida State despite the scoring struggles from the floor well he has great size at the guard position hes aggressive going to the ball that was really nice from Ugo chuku and we talked about him he hes just an explosive athlete he can get to the rim needs to improve his jump shot needs to improve his decision making as a point guard you got to know what spots guys have to be on the floor and you have to be decisive with your decision making under two to play Watkins fouled again Miami cant stay in front of him at the moment well when jir gets the head of stee downhill and he finds that little crease hes able to use his body to be strong and those angles and he just forces you to call those fouls at The Rim just by how aggressive he gets there see coach hes working it that foul was on Matt Cleveland hes got four of them both him and ly kid each with four fouls and he he just really struggled the whole game they three for 12 1 for three hes done a great great job getting to the line 78 but Florida state has really been making it tough for him every time he gets to the rim I mean their length and their athleticism its just making it super difficult for Cleveland to be able to finish Watkins has left a couple points at the line does connect there got a friendly Bounce from the rims 67 to6 turnover again for Miami oh and Bill Courtneys exasperated top of your screen thats been the case for Miami the whole game 16 turnovers and just continuing to give this Florida State extra possessions and it looks like its too little too late for Miami you start fouling if youre the canes now or at this point you might wait out the possession season high in turnovers for the canes Watkins on the drive strict under a minute to play on the attack laid in by Ugo chuku its a fivepoint game so the NES have kept Miami around with some turnovers of their own and some late life for The Music KES I dont know if Florida State wants to win this basketball game turning the ball over and ukuku doing a good job being an athlete like he is finishing that at The Rim but both teams have been turning the ball over at a high rate and just giv opportunities to stay in this game Florida state has for Miami combined 29 turnovers for Miami and Florida State see the timeout situation there both teams are in the one inone bonus possession arrow does favor the nolles Music late in the season in the ACC this is big for both teams Miami still hasnt won away from the watsco center this season and Florida State looking for three wins in their last four after losing their previous four well a loss right here would really I mean its a slim chance for Miami in their ACC Tournament of hopes and obviously a loss for Florida state would put them out of the first round buy ACC tournament conversation but they want to both teams they want to continue to build momentum going forward give themselves a chance to get in that tournament conversation for Miami and then hopefully win some more games and then talk about North Carolina State what they did last year can Florida State be one of those teams simal hoping to get a win against their rivals they have dominated this series 13 of the last 14 have Come Away with a seminal Victory including four in a row nothing butet coming up next foul there Watkins and the NOS leading by five rocks really just has to knock down these free throws if you can do that you take care of the ball you think you could seal the victory but at this point anythings a go right now the way that both teams are turning over the basketball he is eight of 10 overall on the night you see it there on the right side of your screen those two misses have come each of the last two trips and besides one besides the basketball sorry about that but besides the basketball player that Watkins is a great story about the number change and we talked about it earlier in the season but changing his number to one hes the first person in his family to be to be able to graduate from from college and he wanted to be able to show his his cousins and his younger siblings that youre capable of doing that as well great story jir Applause Waters they just announced in Arena Jamir Watkins now 1500 career points between the two schools VCU and Florida State got a round of applause stick back back there for Joe B Miami back to within five 44 seconds left Nolls take a timeout Watkins was asking for it and was granted NOS will have one left Music yep Im Music ready brought to you by Malik y hes been doing it all night hes showing his skill set handling the basketball get to the rim being effective on the offensive glass finishing Malik is really one of the most skilled centers not only in the ACC but the country and hes showing it tonight verse Miami shooting 100 from the field this is his second 20point game vers Miami team hes had four 20point games all year but Malik Yan 22 points 99 from the field five rebounds three steals he deserves player of the game tonight at 20 points and 10 rebounds against Miami in game one foul on the Applause floor if youre Florida State you just want to be able to knock down these free throws but on the other end you dont just want to let Miami come back and get right to the rim you want to try to get a defensive a good defensive possession to stop and try to extend this lead even more if you can Jackson into double figures hoping to celebrate 21 in style one more these are critical now for Florida State looking for their seventh ACC win second one oh friendly home bounce Music 7164 I want to shout out my guy Chuck the Sid at Florida State done a lot of games in the ACC I tell you what Chuck is a Class Act hes one of the best not only in the ACC but in the country Jo Bay throws it down with authority you dont just want to keep letting Miami score baskets you want to try to get some stops but now you just want to be able to knock down free throws if your Florida State Thomas Al and there you have it Malik y with the Duke career high so only4 points and maybe the cherry on top on the attack kick out Kanes looking for that three Joe Bay pump fake now fires off to the left clock ticking Johnson Cleveland cant connect one last foul with 4 seconds and the fans are going to come to their feet here at the Music tuck oh its just a cherry on the top for Malik Yan having a career night 24 points nine rebounds three steals a couple assists malikan has been doing it all tonight and just like we talked in the beginning throw the records away these teams want to beat each other badly well Florida States now beaten Miami five times in a row and 14 out of the last 15 excuse me five rebounds from the leag
