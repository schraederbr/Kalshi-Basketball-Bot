Miami in the home white omir bot will jump and its thear Hill with the tip and the Freshman Elliot Applause Music kdo Ingram shot airball take a look here at the starting lineup brought to you by eBay notice no Kean George in the lineup from Miami nursing a sore ankle is binley Joseph getting the start for the Applause Hurricanes kdo to RJ Davis whos probably the best player right now in the country Davis and gdo stepped out of bounds turnover Miami basketball a little different this game for North Carolina normally when you watch the tar Hills play the first play is designed to get the basketball inside to Amando Bott hes looking at Hubert Davis right now putting his hand on his chest saying thats my fault I believe thats what coach Davis wanted but the tar Hills didnt execute Music it heres Nigel pack gets the high screen for omir pull up jumper good first two of the game and what the first field goal he made in the last two games did not have a field goal at Virginia only two points in that game so Nigel Pac already off to a much better start than he was great Point pack just two points against Virginia no field goals that jumper Smooth by Harrison Ingram hes the X Factor for this team BC Harrison Ingram his ability to be able to shoot the ball from Beyond the AR but also rebound has given North Carolina a tremendous Dimension that theyve carried with them over to accomplish play Stanford transfer come a fan favorite already from Chapel Hill Cleveland bell heres pack with five on the shot clock inside goir with three turnaround jumper short Ingram the rebound and nearly lost it though had RJ Davis on the corner wide open he missed him on that one offensive rebound kick it back out to the Freshman David open three thats why he has to get it when hes open the ball has to go to number four didnt have a great shooting game last time 7 for 22 against Clemson but he can get hot in a hurry ACC leading score averages 21 a game omir he can knock down the three that ones too strong offensive board blocked and here come the tar Hills they want to push it car Ryan shot injected by omir NORAD omir doing a great job recovering on that play Cormac Ryan nice off the bounce is able to get past omir but omir not giving up on the play comes up with the block shot unable to save it but denies the Applause two Ryan to Davis got space you cant give him space and already Less Than 3 minutes into this game RJ Davis with his 21st consecutive game with multiple threepoint field goals which is a North Carolina record shooting over 40 from distance wga poer his shot in and out Davis pull up too strong thats okay you knocked down two already thats a heat check for RJ Davis early in this Applause game pack with the handles to omir back out to pack that three is no good cadell the ref freshman with the board hes at his best when he does that penetrate great recognition by Elliot kadoo recognizing Amando Bott had Nigel pack behind him everyone trying to get back to help out pack no one stopping the basketball eightpoint lead here for North Carolina we played about four minutes here in the first half Matthew Cleveland with the rock Amir took a look at the shot clock bullies his way inside left hand jump hook North Carolina will take that if Miami has to work that hard to be able to get a bucket Hubert Davis will allow that part to be able to happen great defensive job by amond bot on that possession float game good by The Freshman Elliot kadoo in attack mode early and where we sit during Miami games right in front of the North Carolina bench we can hear Hubert Davis telling his team attack attack attack heres omir that shot to no good B CAU another Applause rebound Cormac for three good Jim Lena worked all week on taking away the 5c layups and five effort the enthusiasm was his concern well and Hubert Davis when we talk to him pregame told us that he did not believe in The Hangover or the Trap game leading up to the Duke game for North Carolina but all evidence points to the hangover is real and had a little survey with many of the North Carolina faithful here they also agree Matthew Cleveland driv uses the left hand nice back door cut by Cleveland and delivery to be able to finish nice execution by the Hurricanes coming out of timeout but theyve got to find a way to get some stops on this end lead is nine heres the travel by Applause bot Matthew Cleveland recognizing Bley Joseph in a tough spot Cuts back door the great cut and the nice pass from Joseph to be able to finish it off and then Miami able to force a turnover on the other end once they trapped amondo Bop and Coach the basketball heres back binsley Joseph now behind the back step back rims out Bott another board leads the ACC in rebounding looking to get it inside to bot round the horn Ryan misses that three Bott had a mismatch on that possession the Trap got Ryan a wide open look cormack Ryan unable to knock it Applause down heres omir Powers his way to the hoop and lays it in you can see nor Chad omir intent on being aggressive to start this basketball game that was his sixth field goal attempt off already Withers has checked in for North Applause Carolina nor Chad oir got started one of five from the field however hes not going to be deterred this time in between two tar Hills to be able to finish with the reverse layup and NORAD omir unlike Armando Bott will not get much of a break throughout this game unless he gets in foul trouble Jim Lena keeps omir on the floor as much as he Poss Poss L can because the hurricanes are a different team in a much better way when hes on the Applause floor heres Davis hes already knocked down a couple of triples inside B drps it home great find from Jaylen Withers who checked into the game and Withers will be able to bolster that front line one of the primary substance tions for North Carolina hes had a success against this Miami team especially here in this building in this Louisville Cardinal Applause day omir crosses over Bott shots no good got it back tried to power his his way knocked away good defensive play good Applause hand thats three is good by Ingram doing it on both ends of the Court the 5 Second threes the five second layups Hubert Davis wants as many as they can get does not want to have to run offense if their primary break allows them to get good looks Jim Lena is trying to stop it it has not happened here in the first seven and a half minutes youre right that was one of the things he talked about we cannot give up the 5sec three they going to call that foul on Ingram coach Davis loves the enthusiasm Huber Davis was a very a reserved player he was very calm as a player shooting guard shoot the cover off the basketball but you never saw a lot of emotion playing against him but as a coach you can see it DC hes got the emotion going over here on the sideline he also understands how important this game is recognizing now Virginia and Duke only one behind them in the Lost column and he wants to maintain that lead over those contenders behind him Coach Davis looking for his first win against Miami as well and his third third season head coach has his Alma moders Pat knocks down to three for the Music Applause canes oh and turnover Withers with this lineup now with Withers at the four pushing Harrison Ingram to the three and North Carolina does play with this lineup at times but its not something they use often without Seth tremble available for the second straight game Ingram will get more minutes on the perimeter heres pack hit that that three look he was just one of 10 from three in the previous two Music games North Carolina getting the buckets easy and early you see jayen Withers with the beautiful F to amondo Bott and then Harrison Ingram early in the shot clock able to knock down a three ball as North Carolina DC play but those expectations may have been a little too l considering all of the losses they had coming into this year losing P another three losing both Jordan Miller and Isaiah Wong I had to pause for a second cuz I saw the cross from a from a Nigel pack was you knew the three was going to be good after the nice move Withers and kadoo will back it up and run the play Drive rejected by Pat Applause poer and theyre going to call that offensive screen on jakai Robinson now we normally pause to watch Nigel pack knock down a big three but going to the replay to see a block shot is not something that happens often for Nigel pack but he did it like he does it all the time the big block Elliot Kad going with the right hand if he keeps that the left he doesnt get a shot block but give Nigel Pac a lot of credit for showing up on the defensive end getting packed with just one of 10 from distance last two games hes already knocked down a couple here today heres Bott gets double team kicks it out Davis to kadoo the Freshman too strong jaai Robinson getting minutes with no Kean George in this game jakai Robinson getting an opportunity stepping up with a rebound early buer shot in and out itll be toar Hill basketball coach Lara made it clear to us that with jakai Robinson he was going to do the job defensively may not give them much on the offensive end of the floor but he would never question his energy and his effort he knows thats going to be on the court heres bacot rolls shots no good Cormac gets the board nice kick thats a shot that Paxton has to take and theres the freshman and Elliot kadoo looking simply at Paxton woic recognizing hey when I drive the basketball I cracked this paint throw out there you got to take that Paxon wji a not big time threepoint shooter but just checking into the game maybe not comfortable taking that first one I guarantee you the next one hell let it fly so heres the Freshman Elliot kadoo knocks down that first free throw hey tomorrow at 2 Eastern well have the womens basketball matchup of the day here on ESPN in the app you got undefeated the number one team in the country South Carolina they host Paige beckard and number 11 Yukon Monumental matchup here on the network as the Freshman knocks down both of them Im locked in for that tomorrow 2 pm oh without question eightpoint lead here for Carolina give Miami credit theyve been able to stem the tide a bit here now an opportunity to cut into that lead after allowing the tar Hills to get out to a double figure lead early pack again Nigel pack is up with individual matchup hes heard all the talk about RJ Davis is the best guard in the country hes the best player in the ACC Nigel pack stepping up here on his home floor heres RJ blocked binley Joseph hes their best on the ball Defender now early in the season benley Joseph was the first to get into double digits and block shots for the Miami Hurricanes which is saying something when your point guard is leading you in Block shots I got to check the numbers but benley showing hes got that ability back to W back to Davis drives the Baseline floater but Applause Music foul that ones on Matthew Cleveland so here comes RJ Davis in score in the ACC hes a 90 free throw shooter and now down to Second Joe Gerard passing up RJ RJ was shooting 95 for the majority of the Season had a couple misses that took him into second place but still the alltime leading free throw percentage shooter at the University of North Carolina and keep in mind with RJ averaging 21 points a game the last two tar Hills who average 21 ended up winning the wooden award and that was Tyler hansboro and Antoine Jameson its pretty good company to be in great company heres Joseph Blows By The Freshman and hell go to the Applause line third thats on CAD tell you what I like about this matchup so far Huber Davis and Jim L andega putting their two scoring guards on each other its not as though Bley Joseph who is the best defender perimeter Defender for Miami hes not guarding RJ DAV hes actually guarding Elliot Cad and allowing Nigel pack to take on that match up against RJ theres Kean George and hes got that that ankle injury again Kean George turning his ankle 3 minutes into the game vers Virginia on Monday night and when he was injured the Hurricanes were up 7 to2 went to block a Reese beakman shot came down awkwardly landing on that ankle as the other top freshman point guard in the league Elliot Kad continues to find his way to the rent say other I should have said one of them theres a couple at Pittsburgh getting the job done as well slit and lost the basketball was Joseph got to open for three too strong great look for Harrison Ingram though put so much pressure on your team when you got your fourman who can step out and shoot the trail three Music ball heres pack throws it up to omir that awakes the crowd sixpoint lead for Carolina Corner three no good rebound Cleveland here come the canes how about this diving on the floor is Davis kadoo extra pass Wii three no good Wii Applause again two good looks from Paxton roen unable to knock down either one of them that could have stretched out the lead Bley Joseph trying to have some get back maybe a little rust on that possession kdo will slow the pace down here and inside 8 minutes till the half sixpoint lead for Carolina kadoo yes the Freshman out of West Thorns New Jersey its a big bucket for Elliot kadoo thats not his strong suit hes of course a capable threepoint shooter but he does a majority of his damage getting into the lane that three gives North Carolina a ninepoint lead a little more breathing room NAD omir talk about bully ball somebodys been in the wait Applause room net oir with amond Bott on the bench starting to flex his muscle first on the oop and secondly as my man BC says its just bully ball on the and Nigel pack have scored 18 of Miamis first 20 22 points in this game and they team up for a beautiful alleyoop on this possession pack getting into the paint and finding omir way above the cylinder where hes able to finish it off for the Highlight nor omir got 12 double doubles this season leads the ACC in double doubles hes one of the top 10 candidates for that Carl Malone award which goes to the nations top power forward he knocks down the free Applause throw you know last time kanes have beating the top five team here at home got to go back to February of 2016 they knocked off number three Virginia there cor oh you had to do that huh BC okay knocked off your Cavalier now you know you went to college in the state of Virginia felt like you would you would you would do that you know you know you were at Hamp University at the same time as my roommate father of course Chris Harvey is my roommate Dr Harvey the president so we had that connection I got so for you to throw it out there like that with the UVA that kind of hurt a little bit coming more from you but thats okay though I know its only done in Laughter love Sixpoint lead here for the DAR Hills shot no good theres air again for the follow but a foul and Hubert Davis did not like the way NORAD omir took Jaylen Washington to school on the Block before the timeout so hes get Zaden High into the game to give High an opportunity to go up against NORAD omir and omir is winning on that one as well hey we got six college basketball games highlighting our ESPN schedule today of course the feature matchup you get fourth ranked Kansas 13th ranked Baylor Big 12 Sonic Blockbuster game thats next 6 Eastern three Pacific right here on the network its going to be rocking in the F fog Allen Fieldhouse Ive never done a game there as a commentator but actually played in the fall as omir is getting the steal and this one of the things that he can do oh omir turned that ankle a little bit on that possession they going to get RJ Davis for the reach in you can see omir walking it off and give RJ Davis a lot of credit and thats a great call Bill Covington right on top of that you saw Davis grab omir above the shoulders to bring him down and you see omir just walking that off I saw him turn his ankle on the way down hes definitely checking out something something on that left left leg however this guy is so tough hes not concerned about it by the way keep on that that last series of events Armando Bai got himself a rebound you know he is now passed Tim Duncan hes now third all time in ACC history when it comes to rebounding Ron shavick Dicky hrich in front of him and how about this lead now is cut it down to only three how about Zay High getting in the mix and coming up with the offensive rebound which is a staple of what the University of North Carolina does especially along that front line you talk about Amando Bott and his rebounding prowess and its the first time we worked together so youre probably would not familiar but of course Mondo is my baby boy Ive had him since he was in the seventh grade trained with me but even though hes my baby boy yeah theres an as beside that record because all those other guys did it in four years right this is you know four and a half years Hond at this point so but he is the alltime leading rebound at University of North Carolina and he did that last year which there is no asri beside that thats legit one thing too for Bott you you look at this is the 155th game that he has started thats a North Carolina record and now you see the asteris Applause 156 game hes played in that too on Carolina recer passing up leaky black but he will have he has had a legendary career will be mentioned amongst the great at North Carolina just like great defense by Elliot cadoo getting into the passing Lane and coming up with the steal yeah Joseph turning it over good Pass High missed everything on that one heres Pat pulls up got kadoo closing out a little short on that one you can do that with most players however you cannot do that with Nigel pack he has once you cross half court range and shows it off on that last possession lead is now just one for Carolina make it four thats the answer right there the accs most likely Player of the Year RJ Davis knocking down the three ball in response to Nigel pack getting a big bucket throwing it up for air knocked Away by high good job good defensive play by him here comes Davis back the other way fade rolls off is high again hes active snag and here com popper throwing it up great pl Play by AJ Casey to be able to get that is red hot AJ Casey saving what would have been a turnover gets it back in bounds and Nigel Pat knocking down another three his fourth already here in the first half its raining threes here in Miami thanks to Nigel pack Ryan misses 124 run for The KES popper count it and Applause one Miami T of the game Nigel pack pulling up in transition knocking down the three ball and then once again Nigel finding himself with enough space to make a big play wgaa getting in the mix the and one opportunity when we return Miami hes after missing his first in fact pack and omir have made 28 of Miamis 34 points and their first lead of the game but after the loss at Virginia where Miami only scored 38 points this is what you would expect for two guys who helped lead their team to the Final Four Season to go the response you have to show up as Leaders of this team Jim Lena has to be able to rely on Nigel pack and nor cadir to bring this type of effort and energy every night this place has been a house of horrors of late for Carolina couple of seasons ago they lost here by 28 steel Joseph block by Harrison Ingram great play by Harrison Ingram right there I would have loved to see benley Joseph dropped that one off and allow AJ Casey to be able to come up after coming up with the steal and dunk that one to keep the momentum alive for Miami heres Pat fading score fourpoint lead Nigel pack showing that he can get it done too he knows about the scoring prowess of RJ Davis but Nigel pack has been the guy here this afternoon Ingram turnover Here Comes Joseph stolen by RJ Davis up ahead to Ingram he D it home that was a great defensive stop by RJ Davis not just a scorer anymore competing on the defensive end of the floor plays the three onone defensively the best possible way you Applause can wga popper shot no good bot another rebound two minutes till the half lets see if they find Applause Bott Davis a pull up from three right in the face Joseph how about the backto back plays from RJ Davis the steal on the defensive end to throw it up ahead to Harrison Ingram for the dunk and then coming back knocking down the three ball with the contested hand in front of him to regain the lead for North Carolina Applause Joseph NORAD omir gets bacock on his back back tips it up and in the second jump from omir Bott did a great job recovering and defensively affecting the first shot but omir was the first off the ground for that second attempt to be able to tip it in one minute till the half extra pass and offensive foul on Ingram AJ Casey getting an opportunity and make the best of it showing Jim Lena he can help this team does a great job moving his feet defensively you see the forarm come out from Harrison Ingram thats going to be an offensive foul each and every time Bill Covington right on top of it Miami now with an opportunity to increase their lead and try to carry this momentum into the halftime locker room thatll be the second on Ingram under a minute onepoint lead for the kanes omir with the left hand Jim Lena feels as though nor Chad oir has an advantage against Armando Bott when he has the ball on the perimeter it showed and great execution by Miami on that P Davis driving scoring off the glass we are seeing a number of great individual efforts already in the first half of this game w onepoint lead from Applause Miami P will hold it for the last Applause shot PS way off B cut the board and Carolina will go into the locker room down one keep in mind over Carolina trying to win three straight that would be the just the second time in program history they have done that last time Miami has won three straight over North Carolina 2013 2014 and yes it was Jim L andega who did that accomplished that popper lost it kadoo back the other way pushing driving and tied up by NAD omir great job by omir getting back and for Elliot Kad that really was nowhere to go and that one I love his aggressiveness and Hubert Davis wants him to stay in attack mode but thats one hes got to draw the defense and kick it out Davis Corner three no good omir the board by the way Jim Lena and his team 12 two when theyve LED at the Music half at three good great recognition by wle pop seeing the Trap once he caught the basketball knowing that there were two Defenders guarding Nigel pack knew that the opposite side would be open through a blind pass biggest lead of the game from Miami stolen by Cleveland spinning and the tip is no good Ingram snags the board and here comes the tar Hills Ryan in transition kak Ryan knocking down his second threepoint field goal of the afternoon Ryan was 0 for six from three against Clemson on Tuesday and one of 10 from the field encouraging sign for North Carolina to see him get going Cleveland thought about the three omir will take it here comes David bacot calling for it hes calling for it hes got him on his hip got to get it whenever you can look at your teammate whos posting up and you see his number you see that 5 on front that that basketball has to be delivered Bott working hard on the inside against omir and simple for the simple fact that you got to do whatever you can to Tire omir down and try to get him into foul trouble and five count turnover thats the ninth for Carolina ends up being a dead ball turnover and again Id like taking the 5sec call in comparison to turning it over live turnover or calling the timeout simply because you have an opportunity to set your defense poer challenge by Ryan thats a grown man rebound by arond Bott with another grown man going after it Nadia and stolen Joseph the corner poer good look for wer popper whos over 40 threepoint shooter but Nigel pack was open on the other side benley Joseph just didnt see him and hes been the hot guy you want to try to get the basketb on his hands as much as you possibly can B Cott sets the screen rolls Ingram the three knocked it down thats the spot for North Carolina we watched cor M Ryan hit one from there now Harrison Ingram backs it up to give North Carolina the twopoint lead back and forth we go and that bump by cor M Ryan thatll be his third RJ Davis coming off the screen to roll recognizing there will be attention whenever he uses the screen the crosscourt pass right in the shooting pocket for Harrison Ingram to knock down a big three popular three no good hell call that one on Armando Bott and thats the battle weve all been waiting to see Bott and omir underneath we talked about Armando had a grown man rebound on the last possession this time omir picks up the foul Joseph open missed that three popper kicks it out wide open in and out cant get it to Applause fall Davis pushing and draws the Applause foul oh we got a technical foul on NAD omir coming out of the Applause scramble and it had to have been something that was Applause said Paul cells giving the explanation to Jim Lara and Coach Applause L coach L with a couple of words for NORAD omir as we see after the foul call the crowd is not happy about the call and omir just very vocal with Paul sells on that one enough to where SS decides has been enough hes going to issue the technical foul to calm it down but Im not sure that will calm down anything in this building I think it may make it just a little more Rowdy lead is now four as Davis will go to the line now Carolina all of a sudden on this 80 run make it nine you s a nine 90 free throw shooter to the line for two technical free throws and then two more for him who was fouled on a shooting foul and just like that an opportunity to get a sixpoint separation between the two teams and a fourpoint possession for the tar Hills so its a 10 run now and a sixpoint lead for Carolina heres the dribble hand off weave and theyll get bacock with the bump its second and after the technical foul this game is going to be caught a little tighter from here on out so any bumps are going to be called especially when theyre done in the open floor like on that last possession Cleveland his three is short pass stolen great play by benley Joseph there recognizing where he was on the floor oh and he drives and lays it in benley Joseph was the star a week ago in the second half against Virginia Tech on this floor play Big in that second half and now trying to make plays to help his team get a win here against North Carolina Davis jump stop no botts there to clean it up thats Armando botts strength thats his superpower right there he has been an unbelievable offensive rebound the entire time since he walked on campus at the University of North Carolina and comes up with two big Second Chance points on that hes got nine boards a double and stolen kadoo he will lay it in they double pack but give Bott a tremendous amount of credit for the Trap is staying with the Hedge with Nigel Pac forcing him to throw that pass across his body which was a pick six for Elliot kdo and there another offensive foul on Matthew Cleveland setting the pick great atmosphere here at the Watson RJ Davis taking the challenge of guarding Nigel pack and you see the Trap Armando Bott stepping up just got called for a foul still stays with the head and look at the pass that Nigel pack is forced to make across his body Elliot kadoo with the pick six going the other way for the easy layup in North Carolina with their defense stepping up here to start this second half in the midst of a 142 run over the last 333 and meanwhile Miami has missed eight of their last nine shots heres Ingram inside to bot Bott misses the bunny and thats one where Bott has to finish but more importantly its better for him to take that shot then throwing it out for a less aggressive opportunity but love to see him go stronger to the rim but he has to be more aggressive in order for this team to be successful heres the bunk by cor M Ryan and thats going to be the fourth foul on Cor M Ryan Paxton wji will enter the game and we also have to mention North Carolina playing without Seth Trimble for the second straight game Seth Trimble probably the best perimeter Defender for these North Carolina Tar Hills and they miss him at times like this yeah didnt play against Clemson not playing again tonight P fading missing vott board hes got 10 of them Kau open three no good here comes pack tried to draw the foul on Applause Bott I love that no call there however Tommy Mory on top of it does not call the foul on Bott because he stood his ground on that possession however Harrison Ingram does pick up a foul and now the foul starting to mount up on the tar Hills their fifth foul here already of the second half Ingrams now got three cormack Ryans got four of Applause them five on the shot clock for Nigel pack Joseph Drive lays it in and it was the same possession the same trap however Paxton wji just unable to get there he was right on top of it just unable to get there but not not being able to get that steal allows benley Joseph to have a driving lane for the easy two driving the Baseline Wii Applause kadoo back to Ingram in the corner and he draws the foul and Joseph hell go to the line and shoot three great decision by Elliot cadu just missed the three gets into the Gap and then finds the shooter Harrison Ingram on the wing although hes unable to knock it down has an opportunity to the free throw line to put three more on the board for the tar Hills hes the junior out of Dallas he was the co ACC player of the week just last week dont forget six college basketball games on our schedule today the biggie fourth rank Kansas hosting 13th rank Baylor big 12 Sonic Blockbuster it is next 6 Eastern 3 Pacific I was telling you the first half BC I never caught a game at fog Isen however I did play there on the USA team we had training camp there because my coach was won Roy Williams and so therefore we spent a week in Lawrence Kansas and we had exhibition game and there is my guy Old Roy we had an exhibition game there and was sold out to come watch a USA Basketball scrimmage I about that head shot block here come the jar Hills Davis inside B cotton hes held counted by omir they say no basket but once again Armando Bott working hard to get the basketball whether the shot counts or not thats not the important part the important part is he gets it and omir gets another foul so now thats the third on nor Chad omir and if youre North Carolina that is the best possible sign for you because Miami is a completely different team in a much better fashion when nor Shadow Mir is on the floor hes got to have a seat heres bot going right to work count it and one this is the aggressive Amando Bott that everyone is chiming for in the first half we saw the Armando Bott Georgia Tech style when he goes for nine points and nine rebounds this second half Armando Bott is the young man whos had backto back 20 and 10 games which he now has 25 of for his career thats on Michael noo whos come in for NORAD omir free throw no Applause good B cut is now four points away from another double Music Applause double heres NOCO Michael noo who started the Syracuse game with NORAD oir starting to get more and more experience Jim Lara loves what he does just understands that hes inexperienced into Bay again he DPS it home and hes now the third alltime leading scorer in Carolina history and mama said thats my baby boy theres Christy shes up shes on her feet yelling as Armando Bott her son catches it in the post and finishes strong the tar Hills finding some momentum here on the road building a 10point lead in Coral that list Ralph Samson Tim Duncan and now amondo B playing in his 156th game which is a record as you mentioned earlier the most ever played in the Carolina Applause blue wga popper with five on the shot clock oh the crossed over and missed the jumper jakai Robinson coming off the bench the beautiful move move unable to finish as Elliot Kad just runs back smiling he knows hes going to see that later however with Robinson not making the shot Im not sure itll be on Sports Center yeah I was going to say that was that was Sports Center top 10 written all over you knock down this Music shot you know what well show it anyway well show it anyway cuz in the park this is what we call million dooll move gotcha 10 cent shot K Robinson with the beautiful drop but it cant get it to Music go play in those games weve had some here already Carolina and Miami as RJ Davis will go to the line Brian let me tell you talk about that Baylor Kansas game coming up next do you know who what big man teamed up with Armando Bott to win a peach jam title back in I believe that was 2017 teammates Dickinson Hunter Dickinson and Armando Bay can you imagine that front line gosh and Justin Moore from Villanova I mean those guys were great one of the best aou teams Ive seen out of Team Takeover wow Music Applause DC heres Jose nor J omir checked back in Joseph off Tipp back out but to Applause Davis botts working hard Ingram floater and hell go to the Applause line so much attention being paid now to Armando Bott especially with omir in foul trouble with those three three woko just challenging recklessly out giving Harrison Ingram an easy driving lane to get to the ACC for the pullup and I see youre a floater guy you you like floating oh I yeah I cant Laughter stand Nigel P will check back in you know keep in mind pack and omir combin with 34 points in that first half here in the second half zero and thats been the difference this North Carolina team defensively was the best defensive team in the league in the month of January now Virginia may have taken those rigns in February but with North Carolina and with their ability what they can do defensively hu Davis told us in the pregame theyve slipped a little bit over the last couple games theyve got to get that back but if they get that back this is a team that cannot just win the ACC they can win it all he said he told is rebound and play get back to playing our defense in this game as nooku noo knocks down that jump hook and noo with an advantage over Harrison Ingram a much taller player on the Applause Block Ingram sets the screen and that injury pass they tried to get it inside to Bon thats a tough angle but love the fact that bill Covington Tom Warson coming together on that to make sure they got that call correctly Elliot Kad trying to feed it and you see woko does get a handle that basketball thats the right call as Jim Lena looks on Coach L has to be a lot happier as we see Nigel pack limping off the floor grabbing his left knee look like and that with the health concerns that Miami had all year thats another one where coach L cant afford to watch oh Runner by Applause Music Davis Jaylen Robinson with an offensive foul see if the kanes can get a bucket here well with Nigel pack having to go out of the game interesting to see where they get their scoring from popper too Applause strong and hop out the reverse up and in and jaki Robins has given Miami positive minutes thats his first bucket but does a great job defensively and now coming up with the offensive Rebound in the second chance point oh theyre working on Nigel pack on the bench and theres a three by RJ Davis BC hasnt he had the answer all evening long all evening long Davis with 25 averages 21 and its been a relatively quiet 25 yeah it hasnt been the explosive I watched him go for 36 against Wade Force about a month ago which is his career high another offensive rebound Second Chance opportunity for North Carolina Armond Bott with another Applause rebound itll stay with the tar Hills with 9 minutes left in this game I think Nigel pack look heading to the locker room Miami already playing without keesan George Matthew Cleveland I talked to him pregame hes about 75 wga popular maybe 80 but this mind team just cannot find its way to being Healy tar Hills attacking the board the buler finally pulls it Applause out oh how about that wer hey he made have sold it a little bit all you got to do is you got to see does the forearm extend wer popper on the drive D wji gets in front if that forearm extends its an automatic call whether they sell it or not both teams with 11 turnovers Davis a step back three W tried to tip it out baset and itll go to the kanes Paxon wji getting minutes as we look at the numbers you mentioned it earlier BC 34 points combined between Nigel Pac and nor Chad oir 16 and 18 respectively in this second half 0 for six from the field nothing going on the offensive end heres omir now working on Bott left hand yes but thats a tough finish for North NORAD omir again you you never want to give up two points but if they have to work that hard to get them you simply hey Pat him on the back great job you go down but one of the things about North Carolina youre going to have to stop them from scoring on the other end oh how about that dime by The Freshman Davis kick out Kad for three tell you what weve seen Elliot kadoo much more confident shooting the three in this game if he gets the confidence to start taking and making more of those this North Carolina team will flat out Unstoppable RJ Davis in attack mode getting downhill into the paint finds his backourt partner The Freshman Elliot Kad he got time to line it up get the laces right BC knock down the three ball who is now on the Nay Smith Basketball Hall of Fame balling and Walter Davis should absolutely be in the Hall of Fame as we see Nigel packed back on the floor and back to business the opportunity for the and one we just watched Nigel pack go to the locker room or whatever they did it worked because as soon as he steps back on the court hes back to getting buckets hitting with that Mr Miyagi and hes back you know our audience might be too young to know about Miaki youre right wax on wax off tell you what also on that nsmith ballot alongside the late great Walter Davis is my young fell Vince s thats right Vince Carter whos played the NBA record 22 seasons and Shout out since youre talking about that Julius pord right Pro Football Hall of Fame Football Hall of Fame so play for this Carolina basketball team yep pack misses the three still limping somewhat and you know what Julius Peppers didnt just play oh he was Julius Peppers has a 21 10 rebound game in the NCAA tournament thats more than just being on the team no no no no he was a he was a player oh Ingram that ones too Applause hot 10point lead for Carolina 640 to play you talked about Julius Peppers second round pick of the 2002 NFL draft and who can forget what he did for this team especially in that Elite eight game against Tennessee Ron Haywood had fouled out helped Propel the Carolina Squad to the final four did I get for three I I cant let you do that you said second round pick he was a second pick second Pi Im sorry second pick youre right youre right thats a difference in money yeah yeah youre right oh yeah a lot of money who you talking about you right about that big three on that end for Miami allows the crowd to get back into it Davis had a wide open look nor jet omir snags the board and Davis has normally been the answer hes been the guy thats responded for North Carolina but a cost turnover yeah popper stepped out of bounds and thats going to be the 12th turnover of the game for Miami their magic number is 11 or less this is a team that averages 12 and 1 half turnovers per game and an opportunity to cut into this lead a little more ends up being a turnover giving North Carolina the basketball back with breathing room turnovers at certainly been a Bugaboo for the canes of late Davis step back three thats no good thats a great contest by North Chad oir they got numbered Cleveland pulls up got it turn around jump good lead is now just five smart play by Matthew Cleveland recognized he got a smaller guard on him gets to a spot raises up knocks down the jumper cuts the lead to Five Points for the heels 70 run Bai rocks the rim wer popper went down on that possession 79th career double double for Amando Bott you see Ws popular slip on the wet spot nor Chad omir caught in between whether to go take away the shooter or get back to Bott in the quick find to Bott whos able to dunk it and pick up that 79th career double Applause double five minutes left in this Applause game heres omir hell call that on Bott thats going to be the third on Bott great decision by omir putting Bott in Drive hes had success with that we saw a lot of it in the first half and now he has the opportunity to get to the free throw line this is huge for Miami because you know in the second half Carolina has shot 12 free throws Miami just one but Carolinas been the more aggressive team again you know of Miami fans will look at that and say oh North Carolina got all the calls but the reality is North Carolina created those calls attacking the paint and trying to get the basketball inside DEA and omir missed it and of course you want to come back youve got to take care of those opportunities thats the front end of a one and one miss and a missed opportunity to to cut into the lead with the clock stop they Blitz Music kadoo Cormac open in the corner no tipped out by Ingram look at Harrison got making those plays these are the winning plays that Harrison Ingram makes he comes out of nowhere to tap the basketball out not only do you get another shot attempt but you kill more time off the clock cut down L it in the Freshman blew right past Applause Cleveland Elliot kadoo with 18 strong performance by Elliot kdo especially on the Applause road under four Applause minutes Joseph step back three no Davis runs it down and knocked away from him RJ Davis saying Nigel pack in front should have simply just played oneonone on that possession popler ends up being a fourpoint swing which should have been a easy two Nigel pack still limping around gimpy if RJ David attacks him thats pretty much a short two and the turnover ends up being an easy bucket on the other end allowing Miami to make it a sevenpoint game to 13 rebounds but its really been Elliot kadoo thats been the robin to the RJ Davis Batman throughout this game a careerhigh 18 points for Elliot Kad whos been very aggressive becoming that third or even fourth score yeah with Harrison Ingram in the mix as well for the Tar Hill freshmans been great today he has been fantastic for Carolina and then the kick out Davis extra pass Ingram from the corner in and out theres Bott to tip it out theyll start it up again and use some of that clock theyre going to run the exact same action as before to get that screen up top for RJ Davis it was Kad on the first part of this possession Davis tried to get it inside to Bott Ryan has it stripped and here comes Joseph back the other way 230 left on the clock and Jim Leno will call a timeout well take a quick break 229 left in this one Carolina on look at out making sure you hit that bed on time action to try to get najel pack a look coming off the screen but RJ Dave was doing the job defensively as well air ball by pack and lets see did they get Bott for that one yeah they did no they got yes so thats going to be fourth fourth foul on Bott 214 remaining and a game th this game is far from over seven points sevenpoint lead for North Carolina opportunity to get two at the free throw line for omir this could be a fivepoint game and 214 thats a lot of time to play with four fouls especially for guys who physical is Bott Applause Noir both the free throws are good lead is five I think we mentioned it earlier Carolina 0 and four this season in game decided by six points or Applause less 2 minutes five point Applause lead the Freshman turns it over up ahead to omir the follow by Poler lead is three here comes the crowd and wat go Reach In by Applause popper the Great trap off the screen you see NORAD omir getting out Kad with nowhere to go on that possession omir is unable to finish it but give wler a lot of credit not assuming his teammates going to finish there for the twoand followup dunk but popper committing the foul at midc court sending Elliot Kad to the free throw line and the Freshman is 63 you said it this game is not over 60 run by Applause Miami one of two a little bit more breathing room but the momentum completely on the side of the Hurricanes here on their home court cutting into this lead notice how pack lead it to Joseph to bring it Applause up heres Joseph driving the extra pass Inside poer Yes off the glass twopoint lead great decision by benley Joseph not settling but getting to the rim and dropping it off for the layup for wer POA one minute left twopoint lead for Carolina theyre on their feet here at Watco High screen by bot Davis hes always had the answer that was rejected by omir BC Im not sure rejected has enough emphasis on what just happened here this is more than rejection thats more like a SP one run by Miami Carolina has not made a field goal in the last 3 minutes and 30 Applause Music seconds cor M Ryan will inbound to Davis nearly stolen it is stolen Ryan almost got it back benley Joseph making plays we talked about how he was such an influence for Miami in the second half last weekend vers Virginia Tech he does it again comes up with the loose ball the steal corack Ryan give him a lot of credit getting back defensively stopping what would be the easy two for Matthew Cleveland but Miami now an opportunity to tie or even take a lead Carol Carolina has put up four turnovers in the last 330 of this game yeah wiga poppular looking over to Jim Lara asking do we have any timeouts making sure kanes can tie it or take the lead inside omir blocked by bot and Ingram was fouled by pack what a play by the big man we highlighted this matchup from the opening of our show North chir does a great job carving out space but amond bacock coming up with a big block shot and thats just the difference in being 610 611 with the wingspan Bott omir having a little conversation over there but both guys with a smile Ingram two of five from the line here today he shoots 56 and with that Miss still a onep possession game even if he makes this one a three can TI got it down three no timeout Miami one of 12 from Applause three here in his second half heres Pat got beide on him hell pull up its short omir tried to chase it down with all of that time Miami had enough time to drive it and try to get it easy two or a kick out however Nigel Pac has been the guy I dont mind that shot but at the same time they could have taken the two and just made it a onepoint game do you mind it with the time left on the clock that I think they killed a lot of time to be able to do it I think on the initial action when you dont have the three try to drive it get downhill see if you can get a layup thats Nigel pack with Amando bacock guarding him 30 ft from the basket Ill take Packs chances on that heres the foul and corack Ryan can salt this one away hes a 87 free throw shooter itll be his first time going to the line in North Carolina not has just one in RJ Davis but two very reliable experienced guys going to the free throw line at this stage of the game karmac Ryan in his sixth season in college basketball hes got a lot of experience in these moments Notre Dame transfer good not the a transfer via Stanford transfer so I can tell you right now corm Ryans got some heavy Hardware hanging on the wall I can tell you that buddy but hes also got ice in his veins at this point of the game hes been here so many times to try to ice Applause wins second one to rolls off heres Applause popper and draws the foul on Bott and that will be his fifth hes fouled Music Applause out Applause and the players looking over to the bench as Elliot kadoo checks in theyre saying bring us some size Intel rebound because the only way of course that and thats a great call by Harrison Ingram cormack Ryan both the transfers Hubert Davis talking to the officials about the coach larga using and you get 30 seconds right I mean at the end of the day you have your time someone fouls out you get your Applause time heres wer he knocked down that first free throw now heres the one right here this is the rebound you have to get youber Davis going to go with jayen Washington coming into the game and now you put the size out there because of course Miami wants to be able to tip it out on a intentional Miss tip it out to their gu beyond the threepoint on someone got to make sure theyre covering up Nigel Applause pack heres the hard Miss did it go off Carolina I do believe it did however at this point you can go review it under 2 minutes the officials can come to the Monitor and look to see who it was off of and you see chasing over theres Harrison Ingram and then theres Matthew Cleveland and it looks like that is off Ingram thats going to be Miamis basketball with an opportunity underneath Ingram did hit that last great work by our camer cre baby went off the fingertips of Harry Harrison Ingram you see it once again that right hand as Harrison Ingram tries to go gather the basketball absolutely hits it out the dont even need to go look at this theyve seen it in live action no for Applause certain North Carolina going to take the Applause timeout so theyre going to call a violation theres a violation there is a violation thats why theyre not going to give it to Miami a violation theyre saying Miami ran in beyond the threepoint line the threepoint line so the basketball has to hit the rim before you can enter if youre outside the threepoint line the ball has to hit the rim before you can break the plane and so the violation negates everything going on with the basketball going out of bounds North Carolina calling the timeout you see outside you look at Matthew Cleveland as soon as the ball goes up hes inside the threepoint line so you heard it he broke the plane before it hit the rim Bill comington coming over explaining Matthew Cleveland before the basketball hits the rim and it actually hit the backboard first Cleveland was already had already broken the plane so that is the absolute correct call by the officials on that one you see Matthew Cleveland to the top right he breaks the plane now however the ball hits the backboard before it hits the rim so hes already across the line yeah its close its close but thats the right call 21 left Ingram inbounding they get it to Ryan and thats it Carolina wins it what a game Yuber Davis gets his first SN over Miami our final score Carolina 75 Miami
