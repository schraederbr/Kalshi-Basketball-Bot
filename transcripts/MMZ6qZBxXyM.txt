off from PCEL Pavilion Carson Tout in there for the Irish and Jack Payne in there for the Vandals Notre Dame wins the tip And here is the main man Jaylen Harelson for the Irish New starting five for Notre Dame after an injury to their star point guard Marcus Burton as Jaylen Harelson traveled The five for Notre Dame will be Cole Serta Jaylen Harelson Braden Shrewberry Garrett Sundra and of course Carson Tout And on the other side for Idaho its Robbery Johnson Payne Rasmuson and Mitchell Same five for them as theyve had in every game this season This will be the 10th timeout for the Vandals Theyre six and three Now quickly this one goes into the corner and on the drive was Rasmuson but he couldnt finish Harrelson quickly the other way takes a screen from town I think Notre Dames great when Harelson pushes the ball quick in transition I think they get better opportunities early Shrewberry had it blocked Up ahead is Mitchell and he lays it in Those are our first points of the game Great defense on the board Great perimeter block Blocking a perimeter three is a challenging thing to do Great defense there by Mitchell and then getting out on the finish Itll be interesting to see what kind of feel Notre Dame has for this new look offense as Harelson picks up the foul there He draws the blocking charge on Idaho Here is a look at coach Shrewsbury in his fourth season excuse me third season for Notre Dame Best start with the Irish Theyre seven and three and have yet to lose a game at home And they had a couple marquee wins here recently beating TCU beating Missouri a couple of those marquee wins that just build on what coach Shrewsbury has been building on the past two seasons and continue to build here in the third season Obviously with Burton out looking for different people to be able to step up One of those being Harelson Youre seeing it early here Two great drives a one travel This time he gets the block being able to find ways to get to the rim and be efficient and effective for Harelson here tonight Haroldson knocks down both free throws just a 66 shooter on the season but hes done plenty of work at the line Thatll happen when you go to the rim as much as Harelson does Heres Pay dropping it off for Robbery Golden Mitchell threepointer off the back iron Fight for the rebound and a jump ball in underneath That was Johnson and Serta tangled up near the circle And Sertas got to box his man out and create space He made a little bit of contact but didnt quite get that space Get turned around to be able to get that rebound Its going to be a lot of long rebounds with Idahos threepoint attempts tonight They go into the post with Rasmmanson defended by Sundra The two number 12s and Rasmuson couldnt get it to go Another battle for the rebound and its Notre Dame basketball Rasmmansons had some really good games Hes a freshman for Idaho one of the top players in Idaho and just has been able to make some big impact for them Look for Idaho to be able to make a lot of plays for him down the other end Preseason Big Sky freshman of the year Shrewberry step back three and it is good And he continues to do that If he gets space hes getting it just enough space Gets a shot off knocks it in Shooting the three at a very high clip this season is Shrewsbury 44 on the year Rasmuson the other way Oh a nice spin move and the banker cuts the lead to one Great move just being able to attack find his spot Great finish Eyes on the rim Now Harelson defended again by Payne into the post Spinning and scoring Tough finish for Jaylen Harlson Harelsons really good when he gets in the paint gets that five six feet gets his back to the basket spins off finds the rim off the glass Robbery inside now defended by Tout spinning good defense does not matter though Robbery a tough hook shot really good move and coach Purple talked about they want to play inside out just to be able to get to their spots in the threes and now TA with the little push shot havent seen much of that this year Luke no really good if Ta can hit that shot just creates a little more space for drivers to be able to drop those off 5 feet Music Now right side its Colton Mitchell and he turned it over Heres a look at the headman for Idaho Alex Brible in his third season as the head coach of the Vandals and having his best campaign much like Micah Shrewsbury is with Notre Dame And he really talked about a shoot around having a thirdyear full rebuild for where hes at Really is proud Had nine returners here trying to build a culture 33 GPA He was talking about trying to build that culture and be able to have guys that want to stay that want to compete competing on the defensive end right now Sundra couldnt catch the pass now the other way A missed layup Shrewberry in a battle comes down with the rebound Notre Dame looks to push Shrewberry inside for Town Double teamed Kicks it out Sera one more Shrewsbury had thought about it and now Notre Dame resets Tout now off for Sundra Harrelson looking to drive once again Defended by Mitchell Double teamed Got to get a shot off here 3 seconds Shrewberry the floater No good Harrelson the offensive rebound Fading away and nearly banking it in Sundra chasing for the offensive rebound But its Idaho basketball frenetic possession there But well go to break with Notre Dame leading Idaho 9 to6 on the ACC Network Extra Heres Mitchell now Number of changes for Notre Dame Logan IMS into the game Brady Kaylor in there with him And a foul down low Bo Johnson was fouled Thats one you just dont want to foul You want to force him in You got him right there Force him into that tough shot Johnson the Fort Lewis College transfer He was first team all ARMAC there a season ago Is 163 points per game or second in the conference Knocks down the first free throw shooting just under 70 from the line this year And he started every game for the Vandals this season Music calmly sinks both free throws there Heres Logan I for Notre Dame Another player taking on a bigger role after that Marcus Burton injury Notre Dame announcing the star guard is out indefinitely after undergoing an ankle procedure as Harelson lays that one in Hes got six early points Great set by Notre Dame out of the timeout to get Harrelson downhill on that handoff Being able to have him attack being able to get to the basket Great job by Harelson of finishing Heres Johnson working again stepping back now on the post Idaho goes again This is Rasmmanson trying to spin on Tout has to give it up Good defense by the senior Johnson step back deep three No good Shrewberry the rebound Music Screen from Tout and now Tout inside Three sets for IMS IMS finds Harelson on the cut and the foul Jaylen Harlson imposing his will inside early and Harelsons just doing a great job that time of cutting off the ball First time set ran for him after the timeout But here being able to get and heres after the timeout Just great finish with the right hand on the inside And then this next play being able to be here on that cut Harelson just finds an opening as man looks other way looks for the help side makes that back cut Great job by Harelson of being aggressive both on the after timeout set being able to get in that play being able to get in the paint and then off the ball just making a great read and a great cut And he sinks the free throw there He is so effective as we mentioned earlier when he gets to the rim Hes shooting over 75 in that area this season and already doing some damage early inside Toward again defends Rasmmanson who spins little hook shot Boy a crafty play from the freshman Couple of freshman playing well here to start this game Both Rasmmanson and Harelson Real offensive engines for these squads Heres Toutame working it around Sir Mohamd into the game for the first time today His turnaround hook shot is short Rebound Joba This is Brickner now off to the left side Threepointer is good Rasmmanson And theyll shoot the threes Rasmmansons found some confidence being able to score a couple times inside Then gets open three in transition Steps up and knocks it down Shrewberry takes a screen from Tout Great defense from Johnson Has to pick up his dribble Music Now Sir Mohamd left side Drop it off Tout Another floater And this one rolls in as well Two for two on the little floater inside for Tout Yeah the little push shot working today I think its a headband Now heres Rasperson Little twoman game with Mitchell on the left side They go in the post with Joba Kaylor defends Joba Turn around No good Tout the rebound Here comes Shrewsbury IMS again Its Shrewsbury in the corner With a handoff from Tout trying to work his way inside Mohamd will line up a three and hit a three Thats big for Serges confidence Coach Shrewsbury was talking about just getting him confident getting him aggressive You can see him on the sidelines hyping him up after that three Coach Shrewsbury understands that confidence is the fuel for players to break through That is huge for Sir As Sir Mohamd was shooting just 8 from long distance coming into this one So a welcome sight to see his first attempt go down and Notre Dame has opened up a sixpoint lead They got the matchup they want Jo Shrewsbury guarding him Yep Forced to kick it back out though Johnson late shot clock Got to get one off here and does not draw the foul Now we have a referee from the other side of the floor that does call the foul But Notre Dame leave with just 1 second left which means that Johnson will go to the line to shoot three free throws Theres a look at the foul there Pretty clearly contact from Shrewsbury on Johnson as he goes up for the shot And you never want to foul a threepoint shooter So Braden Shrewsbury is sitting on the bench now uh for fouling a threepoint shooter And you definitely never even want to leave your feet in that situation being able to be there You want to be the second jumper at all times when youre a defender You want to be able to leave your feet after they do Really good job by Johnson to be able to draw that foul Late shot clock First two up and good from Johnson trying to get a threepoint play the oldfashioned way All three of them coming in here They wont count towards their attempts but this is the real oldfashioned way right here Knocks down all three Hes got five points all from the charity stripe and its a threepoint contest I think Notre Dame here offensively Id like to see Sir Mohamad be able to attack the paint and be able to get in With Harelson out theyve got to have somebody be able to create here Here is Sir Mohamd with two screens Does work his way inside Has to kick it back out for though Theyve got Serta now Another guy whos taken a step forward as of recently Mohamd had the floater blocked and a nice rebound there by Mitchell Now left side its Brickner inside Oh big block from Kaylor Here comes Ein the other way Mohamd will tee up another three and hes two of two Sir Mohamd Confidence and rhythm is a funny thing Sir Mohamd sees it go through one time all of a sudden hes on a shooting streak and gets the deflection there So how about this before the threepointer from Mohhamd from Brady Kaylor That was a great job you know come across being able to be that second jumper we just talked about Thats a great job being the second jumper And then Sir Muhammad with just great confidence steps in left right holds his follow through knocks it down Thats got to be such a welcome sight for Mohamd who had really struggled from three and from the floor as now Mitchell throws this one away Mohamds two of two from deep tonight Definitely some miscommunication there from Idaho since Brickner came out after that turnover So I dont think that was the play call they were looking for Heres Jaylen Harelson back into the game for Notre Dame Still their leading scorer tonight Kebaji also in there Heres Kaylor after that block Works his way inside and the lefty kisses it off the glass That was a great finish Kaylor finding some confidence on the defensive end and then being able to finish on the offensive side Heres Mitchell trying to get something going Threepointer right side Missed it short Harrelson has the rebound That was Clapper that time from the corner Harrelson still pushing in transition Kaylor thought about the three Nice pump fake there as Logan I has it now left wing Jai thought about the three momentarily and now I has it Great defense from Clapper IMS deep inside Got to get something off here Fade away No good Jai fight for the offensive rebound and has the offensive rebound and it stays with Notre Dame How about this though Last possession for Brady Kaylor Fantastic job on the drive Just that finish He finds the angle as he gets there and just attacks attacks the rim being able to get there on the finish Great job by Brady Kaylor So Notre Dame with their first baseline out of bounds of the day Thats something I know you wanted to keep an eye on Luke Heres Harelson off that baseline out of bounds Double teamed Long pass for Kaylor Nice job to go up there and grab it Five on the shot clock Jai banging inside Hook shot Missed it short Joba strong rebound Its a good move though I think Notre Dames got to find paint touches here And that that time paint touch came from Jai rather than from the drive on a post up Mitchells pass was deflected and now Joba has it back for Mitchell Mitchell averaging 12 points a game this year for the Vandals The red shirt sophomore Idaho State transfer has been strong for them Heres an air ball inside from Joba And now I the other way spinning and nearly scoring Robbery has the rebound Heres Clapper And now Mitchell again whos touching the ball a lot today One more note on him Preseason all big sky So big expectations this year for Colt Mitchell And another turnover from Idaho Third of the game for the Vandals Coach Purple urging his guys to slow down They actually had somebody get caught on that zoom action there on that down screen and they just couldnt execute on it So Idaho is executing Theyre just not making those next plays I think thats where coach Pribbles talking to him Just just gave him told them to calm down right now Theyve had some big wins on the road But this is part of that building and growing when you get here against an ACC opponent as youre here Just asking them to execute Well their win over South Dakota State which marks their last victory was just the 11th time in the last decade the away team won at South Dakota State So an impressive road win as Harelson wildly throws this one off the backboard but as I was saying an incredibly impressive win for the Vandals in their last time on the road And coach talked about he felt like that that game is part of a threegame series for them This being the third third in that series and theyre looking for this to kind of be the championship of after two wins in a row being able to get here Raspersonson lined up a three It was no good Now heres Jai trying to work in the post on Robbery spinning Great defense from Robbery and Jai threw it away Here come the Vandals on the break Its Clapper stripped by Shrewberry and it will be Notre Dame ball Excellent defensive play from Braden Shrewberry 246 752 to go first half More after this themselves I think just not executing on some of the sets So look for both teams to clean it up here last eight minutes of the first half and be able to continue to impact finishing out halves Notre Dame did a great job finishing out halves the last couple of games So look for them to continue that emphasis here Still a long way to go in this first half 740 Sera left side Tout another push shot That time no good Halfway down and out Here comes Clapper I think that counts as a heat check on the floater after two in a row Well any shot attempt is a heat check for TA just doesnt shoot a whole lot Hes in there to rebound Heres a guy thats in there to score Rasmmanson And the hook shot is good So he does score there Hes really good at just being patient Just being able to be in that dribble a couple of times find his spot squares his shoulders Hes a talented freshman Heres another talented freshman Harrelson finds Tout underneath Takes a bump and lays it in Six early points for Carson Tout Great pass from Harelson Tout had his highest scoring game in a Notre Dame uniform in that win at TCU He finished with 13 before fouling out Clapper now finds Rasmmanson spinning on Sundra and again the hook shot is good So how about Rasmusen inside Hes got 11 points He sure just done a great job just getting to his spots again and again Hes making the same move but he just does such a great job of setting it tough to guard Haroldson walled off Sundra thought about a deep three and Harelson getting in deep once again and hes stripped that time Its Idaho basketball And Harelsons just making plays Hes done a great job of being patient being able to get there Theyre their way theyre helping Theyre helping so deep with their bigs The Roberry is so far back that they have space So if he commits at all hes finding tal on that extra pass pass Harlsons making great reads right now Brickner on the drive drops it off Robery lost the handle but it stays with Idaho Brickner had a great week last week for Idaho He was named the conference Big Sky player of the week So another guy in this Vandal lineup that can do some damage Bo Johnson will inbound here Finds Robbery in the corner Johnson on the drive in a crowd Robery push shot and now a push shot from the other team Good execution Baseline out of bounds for Idaho Music Just a fourpoint game now as Harelsons back into the post Defended by Brickner Spinning nearly scoring that one rimmed out and a foul on Harelson as he fought for the offensive rebound And I just dont think Harelson needs to foul there I think thats one of those plays as a freshman Youre frustrated because you didnt get a shot here but that thats a thats a spot hes got to let that one go Thats his second foul Take a look at it here See its a good physical move Good job being able to get in the paint and then he just didnt get it So I I get I get the hustle but lets make sure were hustling being smart We dont want dont want Harelson sitting on the bench because of a foul Its just not a smart foul Heres Jack Payne Now Rasmusson right side leading scoreer for the Vandals today Johnson lines up a deep threepointer and Bo Johnson brings Idaho within one We knew Idaho is going to shoot a lot of threes Theyre never out of it if youre a threepoint shooting team the way they shoot it Quick ball movement here from Notre Dame and I was fouled Its just the fourth team foul on Idaho How about this from Bo Johnson Luke He does Hes way behind the threepoint line Doesnt need a lot of space Confident Knocks it in If you shoot 30 33s a game you get a lot of reps I looking for the answer No good Idaho have the rebound Payne comes away with it Now hes backing down Shrewberry picks it out Rasmmanson He hits the threepointer and Micah Shrewberry needs a timeout as Idaho leads Notre Dame with sure Very confident for a freshman basketball player 122 run in the last 2 and 12 minutes for Idaho Notre Dame trying to steady the tide here offensively Here comes Ims Crafty dribbling Nice pass to Tout and he breaks the scoring drought for the Irish and ties the game Great job of Ims just attacking that drop coverage Rober so far back in that drop coverage and then Tout being able to roll pin his defender and be able to get a finish Great read in the pick and roll there Rasmmanson again inside Kaylor blocked the hook shot and Mohamed has the rebound Second block for Kaylor Now Shrewberry on the drive Kaylor thought about a three now drives himself lefthanded and was fouled on the way up Kayla read the scouting report after seeing Razerson hit multiple righthanded hook shots out off of that block He got it He knew he was coming Yeah he was he was ready for it this time Well show you a look of it here Just a great job of waiting on it being the second jumper Took that little push Rasmmansons done a great job of setting himself up creating space He creates a little bit of space Kaylor takes the space and be able to go out and contest it Shrewsbury defended by Johnson Good defense Heres Tout driving it himself Lefthanded Okay Luke How about Carson Tout Touts been fantastic on the offensive end Great finishes Couple of great floaters If they can get the rebounding that he does at such a high level and to go with some scoring inside Now Johnson a floater Full speed knocks it home and were tied again Fastpaced back and forth game Shrewsbury stepped out of bounds on the right side and its another turnover for Notre Dame will head to the break with Idaho 30 and Notre Dame 30 on the ACC Network Extra push shot working almost like Isaiah Hardenstein It does look like that Its its just there just real quick Hes low Hes up Shotss not in his hand real long but going in real consistent Rasmmanson again blocked by Kaylor his third Kaylors been the best defender on him so far Hes had a lot of buckets but Kaylor has for at least the last few possessions really guarded him well Kaylors got that long frame and showing it with his defensive prowess today As heres Mohhamd nearly a tough finish How about that rebound from Tout Kaylor pump fake Now they work it out for Serta He attacks and Tout almost got the reverse to fall but was fouled And Notre Dames done a great job in this pick and roll coverage that time by Serta but all each of these times by tout just being able to be there and being able to com compete on this end On the on the other end Ka Kaylors done a great job defensively like you said hes just long hes athletic hes timing it that second jumper being able to be here but this pick and roll coverage just that little snake dribble Roberrys back and that drop coverage again and again So Serta making that read Touts doing a great job of rolling hard forcing him into that twoonone if they can get in that right spot And Notre Dame continues to make great reads in this pick and roll Music Lane violation on the second attempt from Tout there so it wont count Now Roberry on the bench with two fouls Youve got Harelson on the bench with two fouls for Notre Dame Heres Bo Johnson And its been he and Rasmmanson carrying the scoring load for Idaho They work it over for Johnson Heres a quick spot up three for Mitchell No good Kaylor flying in for the rebound and hes fouled Kaylors really stepped up Notre Dame needed somebody else to step up Kaylors taken his opportunity tonight here in the first half and has really stepped up Hes had a nice finish on their end Played some good defense Big rebound out of his area Thats a big thing in rebounding Not just rebounding where it comes to you where you box out but go and get it He was someone this staff was very high on Top 100 consensus recruit Hes only a freshman as heres Mohamd a sophomore Nearly got the floater to drop but couldnt I know Serge missed a couple of those inside but I like his aggressiveness and his activity Hes getting two feet in the paint Hes had that floater He had the one earlier that just wasnt the right matchup that got blocked but hes really done a great job when hes when Harelsons been out Its been Sir Mohamd And I think he has to attack the paint with the lineup that Notre Dame has Him attacking the paints a good thing with the shooters all around him So heres Mitchell Rickner rejects the screen now Fires one across Bo Johnson No good Sir Mohamd the rebound Under two minutes to play And this one backtapped out of bounds Itll stay with Notre Dame though Mohamd will inbound Tries to sneak a pass in for Kaylor Deflected Heres Mitchell dropping IT OFF OH MY GOODNESS Brickner tried the stuff Missed the jam though Stays with Idaho Heres Johnson driving on tout Fouled Count it And the basket Hes having a great first half Great focus on the rim there Great finish off the glass going to the line to get three points the oldfashioned way Great drive here by Johnson Just gets an angle and then on that angle TA cant recover Swipes down Probably doesnt need to Swipes down on as as he swipes down gets that immediate foul call Great finish off the glass First foul on Tout Johnson knocks down the free throw Hes six of six from the line and hes at 13 points here in the first half Notre Dame again trying to respond Heres Mohamed Nearly traveled but able to get it to IMS Serta has been quiet tonight and does drop this off for a little turnaround floater Missed it short tout with one hand tried the put back and now he fouls job two Theyve prevented Notre Dame from scoring in the last three minutes Now heres Mitchell Another guy thats been hot for Idaho is Bo Johnson Hes working on Serta Heres Rasmmanson now defended by Kaylor Wild shot just sort of throws it off the backboard Now here comes Mohamed in transition trying to push the pace Pretty good defense by Kaylor again Heres Serta on the drive and gets the layup to drop that ties the game and breaks an over three minute long scoring drought for the Irish And Sertas first shot attempt I know that hes got to continue to hes been patient but hes probably got to find spots he can do a little bit more of that Thats also his first twopoint make of the season So maybe more twos in general on the season not just the game Now Idaho holding for one shot 10 seconds to play first half Pico Johnson has it for the Vandals Right side Rasmmanson missed it Fight for the rebound This ones good if it goes and its no good So thats how well go from three And I do think one thing for him with Marcus Burton out as Sir Mohamd and Harelson are being able to find ways to attack the lane and attack the paint creating opportunities for Cole Serta he may have to just with this lineup and be able to get there create a little those opportunities for themselves He did on that two that he took but we might need him Notre Dame might need them to do that a little bit more here So Notre Dame opens the second half with the ball This is Jaylen Harrelson to inbound gets it in down low for Shrewsbury whos defended by Mitchell and is fouled This matchup taking a similar shape to the last time these two teams faced off The only time these two teams faced off all the way back in 1982 Notre Dame won that game 5048 So similarly lowscoring game today as Sundra hits the turnaround Great execution from Notre Dame on the baseline out of bounds A quick dive for Sundra there Gets just enough space with a nice turnaround Heres Robbery deep in the post on Tout Physical battle down there and Robers fouled Thats going to be three on Carson Tout just a minute into the second half Nots been really good baseline out of bounds sideline out of bounds all season but here Sundre makes the play look really good being able to get another point per possession And you want to be great at those baseline out of bounds silent line out of bounds You want to be great as the season goes on Coach Shrewsbury he hes I dont know I think his pen over there is like a wand I mean hes a wizard with a board over there And so he does a phenomenal job Baseline out of bounds sideline out of bounds Notre Dame heading into this game was at 93 points per possession is across the country in that 93rd percentile Sideline out of bounds baseline out of bounds Interesting to see how that develops here in the second half Robbery hits both free throws there Back tied at 35 The big mans an excellent free throw shooter up near 80 now Harelson spinning gets his own rebound but Robery comes down with the second miss Coach Shrewsbury wants a foul on that one with Harelson being able to attack In a pretty physical contest all night long One of the reasons why its been so low scoring Idaho goes back to Robbery in the post trying to bang down there with Tout Not able to draw the foul that time And Tout the defensive rebound And now nearly a steal as Payne came flying in from behind the play for the deflection And Idaho trying to play inside out rather than off the dribble Trying to play inside out here off the post Playing with Roberry Had the first move there Not a bad move on that that possession Applause Heres Harelson now to handle Hes cooled off after a very hot start Made three of his first four but hes missed each of his last three Kebachai Cole Serta goes to the floor Ends up with Harelson and 10 on the shot clock again on the drive and that time he banks it home Great job by Harelson being able to finish They were trying to go to him the whole possession Idaho took it away to start and Harelson just would not be denied Found an opportunity to be able to get the rim Now its Payne Harrelson fell down Now Payne works it over for Bo Johnson Raspersonson Now its Mitchell Raspersonson again into the post He loved this in the first half Five on the clock Spinning gets deep inside That time no good Notre Dame confused on the rebound but Shrewsbury eventually does pick it up and now he drives the other way and a blocking foul on the Vandals That time it was Mitchell hitting the floor Fantastic job by Harelson but really a great job by Jai setting the screen just being able to get that space Screens Jack Payne there gets him an angle and look at the space that Notre Dame does a great job of space on the weak side Jai with a great screen Harelson turns that corner with a great finish Now you love that overhead Luke uh look Luke Well just cuz Notre Dame spacing so good Jack I love being able to see how good Notre Dame spacing it is and its tough to see at home sometimes I love being able to see the way they space the way they find matchups and attack those matchups when they have an advantage Harelson meanwhile scores on backtoback possessions And its a fourpoint advantage for Notre Dame as Chai picks up the foul Johnson on the receiving end that time Jaylen Harelson Luke has been the driver for Notre Dame as we expected today And he has started both halves Im looking for him Had a little bit of that foul trouble getting that second foul in the first half Im looking for him to do it for a whole half now I think thats his next challenge is to do it for the whole half Great start by him and a great start More continuation by Johnson here with another three Yeah continuing his play from the first half 16 now for Bo Johnson And thats his second threepointer Heres Serta off the curl Slip pass inside for Sundra Now Shrewsbury on the drive Serta tes up a three And its the second half So it goes down Second half Serta sticking with his storyline from the season so far Thats a welcome sight for Notre Dame and coach Shrewberry Have to get him involved in this second half especially in a tight game like weve got here Heres Johnson trying to answer Good defense by Sundra And now its Brickner Rasmmansons got Serta on and likes the matchup Yeah Rasmuson trying to make Sa pay for the mismatch Robbery lines up a three and he hits it How about the big man stepping outside Idahos got everybody shooting threes here Big shot great shot great form and followthrough by Ro So we will head to break after a couple made threepointers that they can get to the second half the closer Heres Harelson now taking a screen from Serta now getting the hand off from Jai but he lost the handle Stays with Notre Dame Pretty good action out of the timeout Not surprisingly Coach Shrewsbury Harrelson to inbound Throws it out deep for Shrewberry tries to get it back and now a fight for it in front of the Notre Dame bench and itll stay with the Irish 12 on the shot clock Great defense as weve come to expect from Bo Johnson whos been all over the place tonight Harrelson finding Serta trying to work his way inside but theyre going to get Robbery for a kick here Jai might have had a dunk if not for that So smart play by Rober even if it does reset the shot clock to 20 seconds Roberry hits a three Next possession hes kicking soccer balls but uh hes making some plays finding different ways to make plays every way he can This Idaho team is scrappy Yeah nine points a game to go with six rebounds for him Harrelson throws it in for Jai who had a quick catch in the paint Harelson wanted it back Shrewsbury pull up three Its good And we highlighted already but Jai has a great ball screen right there Just a fantastic ball screen Shrewberry knocking in With that make Notre Dame has made their last four shots and are now shooting over 70 from three Theyre five of seven from deep Heres Raspersonson now for Idaho getting inside on Shrewsbury Loves that hook shot and he goes right back to it And that one was a left hand I thought he was going to go back to the right I think Shrewsbury did too And so Rasmmanson comes back with a left hand Well hes been so good Hes been hunting those mismatches and just getting inside and burying defenders with that hook shot Heres another guy that likes the drive Harrelson trying to find Jai lobbing it inside Interior passing Harrelsons fouled on the way up and hell go back to the line So we will go to break Notre Dame for got a couple of those here today and they are fantastic screens Theyre a screen assist Capital S capital A So heres the man on the receiving end of those screen assists a couple of them Jaylen Harelson He knocks down the first free throw and hes now four of four on the night Couldnt make it five of five though as he cant overcome the announcers Jinx I I wont blame you Heres Pico Johnson now Finds Brickner Another match up for Rasmide for Rasmmanson Loves that hook shot down there That time he spins free but he lost it And itll be Notre Dame ball Good D by here I know you like this grittiness from Logan I He has Hes Hes done a lot of things that are the small things Just pokes the ball away there Gets it off his leg actually and just makes a play Tout now back into the game after taking a seat on the bench for a little bit Working on three fouls Shrewberry finds Harelson Hes on the drive defended by Brickner Into the post goes Harelson spinning Boy thats a physical move from Harelson but the banker goes And the spin was so fast He found an opportunity and he spun And when he spun he got all the way turned around to the basket Johnson lines up a three No good Tout battling for the rebound but a jump ball Its going to stay with Idaho But how about this physicality bully ball on the other end and he does He just sets him up sets him up finds an opportunity and then all of a sudden he gets just enough of his weight off to the other side and he spins off it Gets all the way to the rim Twofoot finish to all off the glass Just really good job by Harelson Hes so good in the post and when he gets against guards at just backing them down and then finishing either way Heres Jack Payne Now its Joba Idaho trying to weather the storm here Notre Dames made their last five Payne no good A pinball for the rebound and its Notre Dame ball Applause Pretty good defensive possession there by Notre Dame coming off of Idaho set some great screens So coming off reading those screens being able to contest and compete Heres Sir Mohamd now whos cooled off after two early threepoint makes Two of six now Drops it off Tout Another floater Gets his own rebound and skies for the putback Floater to the tap in by Carson Tout Really good job by Sir Mohamd on the read on again Just patting the stats a little bit Luke he needs a couple extra rebounds Heres Mitchell now finding blasting game into the game for the first time and in the scoring column immediately That was a really good shot Just finding his spot Gets it off quick Not a lot of room First bench points for Idaho and just the fifth player to score for Idaho I lost it now off his own foot And this is going to be a backcourt violation Lets take one more look at this Carson Town miss and put back Luke well the floaters still been good He needed a heat check on that floater after hitting a couple and then decided to go ahead and finish it himself Then on the other side Idaho just found drived into the paint That paint touch and then the kick They didnt need a lot of room but knocks it in on the other side Idahos not going to be out of this The way they shoot threes they are not going to be out of this game until that final buzzer sounds Yeah Rasmmanson had it tipped away They continue to go into the post with Rasmuson Its been very effective today Hes got 16 points and hes taken 15 shots Its tough because Idaho has shooters all around him So you cant go help you cant go double Rasmmansons a willing passer Idaho 40 from three today Six of 15 So well below pace for their normal 31 Heres Mitchell He lines up a three and he hits a three A hierarching shot over Kaylor Boy he banked that one in off the ceiling Heres Mohamed on the drive The floater No good off the back iron Battle for the rebound And its Payne who comes away with it Mohamds been good at getting to his spots He just hasnt finished those plays but hes getting to his spots and been aggressive Idaho on a 60 run Theyve cut it to one Rasmmanson this to take the lead No good Tout strong rebound Kaylor with the defense again Kaylor has been the defender on Rasmuson and has done a fantastic job of either contesting or blocking every shot Heres Serta Still relatively quiet Grabs the pass from Mohhamd Now drives on Joba and lays it in And Sertas going to have to do that He knocks down threes He can hit shots but a couple of drives has been really good If hell add and expand his game that way he becomes a threat Seven points today for Serta Hes yet to miss a shot Heres Payne now inside for Joba Defended by Ims This is a size mismatch here A lot of grabbing Joba The hook shot is short Kaylor has the rebound And now here comes Tout Look at the big fella handle it a little bit Work it over for Kaylor Heres Serta with a screen again on the drive and hes fouled So to the line goes Cole Serta whos been aggressive on these last couple of possessions trying to keep Notre Dame in front More after this on the ACC Network Extra himself to the line Hes a fantastic shooter at the free throw line So being able to get there and I think if Cole Serta will add that hes already got the threes Hes had the big second half So hes having a good season here And as hes able to add being able to get to the rim the way he has a second half he becomes a really dangerous player Knocks down the first one Start has yet to miss a free throw this season Yeah I I was just waiting I was waiting just to decide You know what Well get there But no jinx yet Cole Serta is immune to that So 20 for 20 for Serta now this season Outstanding from the charity stripe Heres Jack Payne working on Mohhamd Nice spin move and Payne hangs and finishes Really good move inside Great job on the first defender and then great job against Tout with the finish on the rim Physical finish from Jack Payne And those are his first points of the night Here comes Serta again Midrange pullup Missed it short Gets his own rebound Spots up and hits the three Its worth more points from there Hes a really smart Notre Dame student athlete so he decided three points was worth more than two I think is what he did the math on on that one Efficiency Good job Here is Rasmuson Kicks it out Payne no good And an offensive rebound for blasting game And Col is frustrated He He knows being able to have that rebound there He missed that box out Makes a great play on one end Hes got to be able to go the next one Pay in the post Defended by Mohamed Scoop layup No good Tout has the rebound and pushing the pace himself Now finds Serta Nice pass Got a nice bump Heres Tout spinning and scoring Notre Dames guards all of them across the board have made some great little pocket passes inside as Carton Touts rolling and Carson Tout is making some plays inside Indeed he is Heres Jack Payne finding Mitchell Step back No good But the offensive rebound goes to Joba who kicks it back out Payne one more for Mitchell Threepointer again No good Sundra the rebound Here comes Ims pushing the pace for the Irish They get it to Tout and now heres I lost it momentarily now off the screen Here he is on the drive in traffic Still spinning Oh my goodness Thats a Houdini act from Logan Ives You know theres two foot finishes and then theres fake three times and get a twofoot finish Great job by Logan IMS of getting into the paint and finishing 70 run for Notre Dame 10point lead Heres Jack Payne Rasmusen here Mitchell on the drive Joba lines up a three and he answers Idaho cuts the deficit to seven but the Notre Dame offense of the game now excuse me there he is in the corner Heres Harelson double teamed way out by the half court line Tout finds Shrewberry wide open and he hits back to a 10point advantage for the Irish Idaho trying the adjustment to double team there coming out of the timeout Notre Dame great reaction being able to knock down a shot making the play Thats tricky to do with how outstanding a passer Carson Tout is for a big man Heres Robbery Silky touch inside Idahos got some bigs that have hit a lot of hook shots tonight They just have some fantastic skill development The game tonight has been a skilled game Not a lot of turnovers being able to execute on each possession and playing here Arrelson spinning no good Tout the rebound and is fouled on the way down Notre Dame leads Idaho by eight as we hit the under eight break and we will be back who you just highlighted to inbound Throws the lob up to Kaylor who nearly finishes and tout the tip back I think Kaylors asking for an assist on that one since uh couldnt quite get it there Good execution out of the timeout Kaylor probably could have come down with that rather than try to finish it Heres Idaho on the other end now trying to answer Boico Johnson back into the game now wide open and its Rasmmanson decides not to shoot it Back into the post he goes Double teamed now Brickner from long range Hes confident You can just see it just the way he physical on defense Confident on that shot This whole Idaho team I mean they are not out of it at any point in time Harrelson back into the post trying to get free gets the tip back to himself and is fouled Luke how about Carson Tout with 17 points tonight Hes done a fantastic job of just being able to roll to the basket being able to finish at the basket You we know he can rebound and so thats for Carson T thats like waking up in the morning hes going to rebound But for him to be able to score and rebound to be able to be as effective as he has tonight hes been phenomenal at being able to get on the glass being able to finish being able to get into space and then hes hes just been really really good on the glass He has double double for Tout Thats a monster stat line hes working on 17 and 11 And I know I know hes not getting assists but he has been bringing the ball up the court multiple times just to push the ball for Notre Dame as well Harelson misses both free throws there So hes now four of seven from the line on the night Heres Mitchell on the drive and laying it in Great finish Great job getting to the rim Great finish Here comes Harrelson the other way Defended by Brickner Works his way deep inside and just buries Brickner under the basket and banks it home Harelsons got a matchup and he has to take advantage of it Hes doing a phenomenal job of taking advantage of it when hes got it Back into the post goes Rasmmanson Defended by Kaylor Another block Number four The block party for Kaylor Here comes Harelson Spinning free Now Town Drops it off for Harelson Hes on the drive No good Brickner the rebound Here comes Johnson Pull up three Johnson is unconscious Its a tough shot in transition Idaho again confident has a shot blocked gets a stop turns around hits a three Right Just a team thats not giving up Has had some confidence on the road Idaho seven of 11 from three in the half Heres Shrewberry And thats a great screen on a dribble handoff by Carson Ta Weve talked about J screens but great job by Notre Dame execution A little zoom action handoff into Shrewsbury Raining threes in PCEL Notre Dame hasnt missed a three this half Now heres Mitchell working on Kaylor Mitchell on the drive and that time hes fouled hard He goes to the ground and weve got a whole flurry of action to take a look at Luke there there are threes on threes happening right now but just shooters with great confidence and then teammates setting them up here over and over again So passing ahead throwing it ahead being able to knock down shots on the other end knocking down just a great screen great execution off of zoom action a screen into a dribble handoff passing it there to Shrewsbury Great job of knocking down shots by both teams right now So now Mitchell an 81 free throw shooter misses the first Lot of action for Mitchell tonight as he knocks down the second one in the preseason all big sky selection averaging 12 points a game on the season That was number eight for him tonight Heres Tout still working on that double double Finds Serta Little airspace Air ball Tout the rebound Kicks it out Shrewberry No good Another battle for the rebound One by Rasmmanson Good comes Brickner Johnson inside for Joba Defended by Tout Unable to flip it up and in Serta corrals the loose ball Heres Harelson slowing it down now for Notre Dame as were under five to play Finds Tout under the basket and Tout drops it home Good read by Harelson on another double team Theyve sent double teams at him because he scored so well but he is passing the ball equally as well 19 for the big man Rasmmanson again inside is a good matchup for him Kicks it out Mitchell pump fake relocate Rasmuson lost it Battle for it Still loose Jobas on the floor Heres Mitchell a three No good Town has the rebound Shrewberry pushing the pace and now slowing it down as were under four to play Threepointer from Serta is good High temperature hoops from Cole Serta in the second half NBA range second half Serta Music Now heres Mitchell working on Kaylor Notre Dames opened up an 11point advantage Rasmmanson inside Joba threepointer No good Kaylor the rebound Largest lead of the night for Notre Dame Idaho have not scored in two minutes Harrelson backing his way in spinning on Brickner and scoring 20 for Harelson And hes just had spots where hes just gotten to his spots gotten to his finish and done a fantastic job Timeout Idaho Notre Dame by 13 And the fans are fired up inside PCEL Pavilion Cole Serta a heat check to rotate And Jaylen Harrisons making great reads great passes and when he gets oneonone hes scoring He is scoring every time he gets a oneonone matchup Now Serta nearly has the steal for Notre Dame but it stays with the Vandals under three minutes to play As you mentioned Luke its the second straight 20point game for Jaylen Harelson So making his mark early in his Notre Dame career This is just his eighth game in a Notre Dame uniform And I think when confidence and opportunity meet you have something that might be a breakthrough For right now for Jaylen Harrison that confidence is there his opportunities there and right now hes on the chance a brink of being able to have a breakthrough as hes heading into his early season here and he played great defense there on Jack Payne as Notre Dame trying to extend the lead already 13 with two and a half to play in this one Harrelsons in the post They double team him now Shrewsbury open in the corner No good Tout nearly the offensive rebound Here comes Mitchell Mitchell inside and lost it Notre Dame ball Great read by Harelson though to get Shrewsbury the shot Missed it But thats a wide open Hes in rhythm Hes in range This is the person you want taking a shot Harelsons making great reads I I love that hes being able to attack oneonone but I love that hes not forcing it when the double team comes And thats sometimes you get too confident and you still attack with that double team Hes making the right reads right now Notre Dames on a 70 run as the clock ticks below two minutes Irish content to take their time here Harelson nice crossover Shifty move there Shrewsbury Five on the shot clock Floater is up and good And its a 15point advantage for Notre Dame Good patient possession Heres Payne Now Johnson loses Serta but couldnt finish And Sertas got the rebound Well Luke talking to coach Micah Shrewsbury before this one he called this a real mustwin game for Notre Dame and theyre on the way to doing that with a great performance here late in the second half And every teams trying to build a resume so they can go to March Madness They can have an opportunity to get to the tournament This is that resume builder where youve got to be able to win at home Games here taking care of business Idaho is going to play it all the way to the finish I think Jaylen Harlson playing a complete game in the second half is huge But I would add to it too defensively hes been good Hes been on the glass Hes gotten deflections He seems like hes just had more energy Hes talked Hes moved If Im coach Shrewsbury Im really encouraged by the season that Jaylen Harlsons building and has built tonight Add to it just Carson Tout being able to score along with the rebounding that he has thats top in the country And Notre Dame a great game to build on here today Harrelson unable to convert there but Notre Dame gets the offensive rebound And with just a 3second difference this one is all but done Notre Dame going to win this one over Idaho Four players in double figures Serta Harelson Shrewberry and Tout as the shot clock expires with just 37 to go Unselfish by Tout to take the turnover there senior vet move Dont expect anything different from him Do it all guy for Notre Dame And thats our final The Irish 80 the Vandals 65 Notre Dame led by Jaylen Harelson and Carson
