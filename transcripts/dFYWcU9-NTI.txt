in foul trouble DJ Burns can do that win the turnover battle NC States done that the last two games here in the tournament crash the offensive glast 17 offensive rebounds in their win over Syracuse and also you cant be scared and for the wolf pack aint nobody scared Obie they have forced a ton of turnovers here well talk a lot about that as we are underway Duke winning the opening tip Duke with 24 and7 n State 19 and 14 coming in Mitchell trying to get it downstairs and burns got a hand on it and a quick turnover right there a turnover early and can the wolf pack capitalize on it did a good look Duke did a great job getting back defensively not giving up a transition bucket Casey Morel up high n State forcing 35 turnovers in the first two games here in Washington DC to follow away Marcel and that one will drop mitcher Will flag down to rebound nice defensive stand Brock Proctor on that possession Bowski with the touch working on diara on the Baseline and off his foot and out of play NC now NC State holding off Louisville and a stunning performance by sky Clark in the first one he had 36 points in round one but they won the game NC stated it 9485 that was without DJ horn he returned last night as you get a look at their starting lineup and therell be no DJ horn in the starting lineup Kevin ke going to stick with whats gotten them here to this point hor is it taken away by filipowski now horn beginning on the bench as Proctor gets it out High long one coming by roach off the back of the iron and a foul and a rebounding freay as you got a look at Kevin Keat seventh here at the H for NC State and Kenny engineer a couple more wins here DC that foul will go on burns by the way thatll be number one John shy has had success in this tournament hasnt he was the MVP of the ACC tournament in 09 yeah the first person to ever win an ACC tournament as a player and a head coach H Davis trying to capitalize on that this year he Duke the reigning champion of the ACC tournament on the Baseline Mitchell fights for his Miss and hes from behind offensive rebound for Mark Mitchell and thats one the area and thats going to be the first on diara but both The Bigs right now for NC State picking up a foul early and of course when you consider DJ Burns and his supports are being on the floor as well as the are thats one of the areas they cant get in foul trouble against this dud front line DJ Burns in 27 points against Duke on the fourth of March 12 for 19 shooting but for much of that game he was a oneman band do completely shut off the threepoint attempts and the perimeter game once again Burns going for it thatll be knocked out of bounds with 1828 to go here in the first half and on the board yet OB I believe weve seen Kowski on the ground already three times in this game the tone has been set its going to be physical here in the quarterfinal round J M by the way the outstanding freshman took a shot in the pregame warmups he buted heads accidentally with a teammate that was jayen Blakes angel will have more on that coming up Taylor drives the lane off the window the no and filipowski picks up the loose ball Ires Proctor here here Duke missing a freshman guard in Caleb Foster hes out with an injury oh swing pass Mitchs underneath at a very tough angle couldnt finish it yeah you got to finish that simply for the Highlight factor that was a beautiful dime for Philip palski wrapping it around a Defender to give Mitchell the good look ah the top 10 that might have been exactly OB tailor last six games he has been absolutely on fire averaging 19 points a contest and another turnover this one is not off to an artistic start heres McCain and two strong theres Duke just getting on the floor for the first time in the tournament after the double buy and I also believe even though North Carolina state has played a couple games theyre a little bit of jitters in this one they understand of course its always different when youre playing against the Blue Devils diara lips to SL but weve seen sloppy basketball from both these teams to start the game three minutes in neither team is scor try to put an end to that but cants Rell with the rebound the former Virginia star hell zip it downstairs to the RN he loses control of it these two teams are 0 for nine combined and nobody seems to want to hang on to the ball 50y bounce in the lane McCain will draw the foul whenever you play against the wolf back one thing you have to determine how are you going to guard DJ burns are you going to double team or are you going to allow him to play 101 OB you mentioned 27 points for him in the first match up between these two Duke guarded a manto man one1 the majority of that but you see now theyre going to be able to bring the double team throughout this game to not allow him to get going 31 minutes for him in that game allowing him to stay on the floor and operate offensively Mel with the foul a moment ago and DJ horn reporting for Duty for the wol pack morcel will step off for a moment we in the top scorer for the pack 17 points a game 43 from three he came back after missing the Louisville game in round one to have 16 last night which included a dunk yeah it did we asked him pregame how he was feeling he said he was feeling good got some medicine got a good massage on that hip flexor I said you still bouncy he said absolutely I cant wait to get another one so he wants to show out on the break but had all 16 of those points in the second half last night then Middlebrooks into the contest off for horn Taylor was shot clock down to seven here oon the fire and knocks it down and NC State is finally on the scoreboard yeah the first made field goal of this game the only other points were J McCain at the free throw line I dont think anyone would have picked that four minutes into this one with these two high powerered offense Kowski getting a lot of attention and thrown away again Duke looking like they havent played a about a month this point is Swit in by horn as he will drill it from the wing and DJ horn not waiting around through the second half to get a scoring going as soon as he comes off the bench hes able to get a threepoint field goal to go the first of the game for either of these teams Kane over the top and and up and in nicely Run play and again filipowski going down but the presence of Mind by flip to not land and bring that down he knows where he is on the court already by the basket lays it up before the help defense can get there man does he take a lot of punishment on a nightly basis arcain harassing horn DJ horn to grab and carry North Carolina flips it up and a whistle two as he made the basket hell be off to the line and NC State grabs a seven for Advantage our ACC tournament quarter final NC State and shy on the wolf pack go coach sh told me that NC State is a different team now because theyre playing more confident and connected especially on the defensive end through the first two games of this tournament they forced 35 turnovers theyve also collected 23 steals he said they want to make it a track meet we want to make sure that were controlling the pace in their last meeting they only gave up five turnovers they already started the game with three in this one so hes saying if we can contain their guards we can end State Cinderella Quest well last three possessions NC States cleaned it up theyve gone three for three their first six they went 0 for three and turned it over three times and no coincidence that that three for three has happened since DJ horn check into the game he has two of those field goals himself the other by Michael okell with the first still goal of the game for the wolf pack but they seem to have settled in and thats often an advantage for a team thats played on this floor already we mentioned its been a while since the Blue Devils have been in this type of competitive action Kan weing Advantage above that right eye taking that pop and a headt going to be on the line there seven was on the shot clock 1439 to go in the half Obie flip has made a number of nice passes in tight quarters however Duke has not been to finish give Thea and middle BR a lot of credit defending the rim roach from the elbow no rebound by Taylor Taylors really been their scoring star most of these recent games these last five or six hes been the man for the wolf pack yeah averaging close to 19 points over their last six games has said backto back 18point games here in the tournament Kane on the drive or Connell sticking with him Ryan young the 16 gr if I ready a check in for John Applause shy Sean Stewart we number 13 for Duke had a terrific game against these guys and righ as he came off the bench for 12 and five yeah Sean Stewart playing more minutes down the stretch here for the Blue Devils as John sire has started to grow a lot of confidence in the freshman and hes made that pay off for his coach Kane using that lightning Quick Step to get inside for two and thats an area where Jared McCain can often be effective we know about his threepoint shooting but when hes able to get into the paint and attack making plays for himself or others that adds another dimension to this Bo devil team Ved to the all ACC rookie team uhoh diaro is right as he goes for the slam and its screamed out but a play like that for him Obi just energizes not only the wolf back but himself he going to the offensive glass now youre going to have to worry about him on every possession where a shot goes up last night DJ Burns was imploring him dunk it dont give it up dunk it who got the message OB I think he did Bowski and a Nifty spin will finish down thats a tough move by flip right there recogniz theres no double team coming showing off his strength in that seven foot frame to finish easily over the top of the Y Taylor outside the three backs it up he steps back and fires got it he wanted badly to take that shot and he drilled it youre absolutely right OB he was not passing that basketball he made his mind up early he was getting a look Ro a little too high up Proctors fingers and out of play the big fell is battling it out Mohamed diar finishing strong and KY filipowski recognizing no double teams coming Im going one onone and Im going to win this battle NC State with a victory last night on a big run in the second half and they rolled Syracuse 83 to 65 lets go to Angel well guys with Muhammad diar right now hes acknowledging Ramadan and he cannot eat or drink anything from sun sun up to sun down so the sunset in DC today was actually 715 he checked out of the ball game hes going to go to the end of the bench meet with the nutritionist she said shell begin to give him fluids throughout the game but wanting to make sure that he has enough smoothies throughout the game theyre going to be feeding him those a lot of stretching in games too thats going to be a traveling violation on Ryan young and another turnover for Duke respect the discipline of this young man and more importantly the way the wolf pack faithful have supported him in the training and nutrition staff knowing exactly when they can give him because once again during R he cant drink anything during that time either so course playing basketball you need to stay hydrated and seven offensive rebounds last night really showed up in a big way Burns trying to get in close and takes the hit as well the btic 69 grad getting in tight and drops it in over the shoulder come to the back he actually returned with a little patch over his eye he actually received three stitches but the most impressive thing about this and Cory I know youll appreciate this he had a smile on his face the entire time thats why coach shy says hes the swag in energy of this roster he is absolutely Angel but you know I blame Jared for that because he was playing defense why are you playing defense pregame OB theres no point in it actually before the game you said why is he even playing defense in the game exactly Mitchell will slam that down beautifully run by the Blue Devils be in the Huddle prior to this during the timeout Jeremy roaches was talking to Mark Mitchell specifically about finishing strong I saw Jeremy make the gesture go up and dunk it and you see Mark Mitchell taking that leadership from the captain and paying off on the floor set some Giant games this season become a very valuable guy for Coach sh oconnell on the Baseline hes walled off diara on the fake shot clock down to four Burns straight on yes hes got such a nice touch yeah thats it OB he just puts it on the rim so softly even when it does hit the rim he still has a chance to go down because hes got that soft Applause touch North Carolina such an impressive win today an awesome victory over Florida State 92 67 in our first quarterfinal Bop with 14 10 RJ Davis 18 points filipowski leaning in flips it yes itll go wanting a call on that one as filipowski looked as though he extended that forearm however di did a great job getting back up as you see Philip palsky battling with DJ Burns and thats exactly how you have to attack a great Music score John shy the were being too ancy calm down more open finish it please we dont have to come down and take quick shots let it happen the thing where we cant get hurt is not talking down here you got to play every single play on defense then on Applause offense nice find underneath as DJ Horns able to get his third field goal but on underneath out of bounds thats one of the things that John CH was talking about they got to communicate defensively that shouldnt happen Ro gets it up there and a whistle with 104 remaining in the half and the other quarterfinal today was pit knocking off wake 81 69 maybe a critical blow for Wake Forest as far as the NCAA tournament pit never trailed in that one 19 to 12 NC State foul going morcel that is number two Jeremy and so roach to shoot he will shoot two at 87 at the Music line and rattles in number one we have everything covered on selection Sunday again it all starts at 6 Eastern Sports Center at ESPN Reese and the guys look at the mens field of 68 the brackets announced followed by by Bracketology and at 8 the womens field of 68 revealed Bracketology coming to in a complete breakdown immediately following well I believe this my God Dan shman now refers to it is its actually Rees Andrea and the guys now so its not just about Reese and the guys anymore as my little sister Andrea Carter is now in the mix so you know I think J BRS didnt necessarily like being reesing the guys well thats what thats what the promo says so were going to have to edit that no we got to edit that that actually to be Burns short filipowski had the rebound come right to Applause him RO with a missfire and a big rebound by diara Michael O Connell has had a really good tournament 16 against Louisville at 16 against Syracuse as well hes got it beyond the threepoint line hor will let it fly and again Duke crashing the glass the Duke limiting NC State to one opportunity straight on oh absolutely bottoms by tyers 37 beyond that line thats whats so dangerous about the Blue Devil team they are more dangerous than transition shooting the three now with no Caleb Foster available still out with injury they dont have as much Firepower but with the three guys on the floor they are still dangerous from Beyond The Arc theyll get Proctor or I should say roach for that foul thatll be number for one Jeremy roach simple quick kick ahead and as the defense rotates towards Jeremy roach tyres procer steps in confidently and knocks down the three ball and when he is making shots it takes this Duke Blue Devil team to a completely different level especially when he is confident on offense well Duke is starting to do that right they started out one for 10 they made five of their last six shots so Duke is awake Music Taylor diara he will fire that up there but too strong so once again theyre one and done filipowski bouncing for Mitchell gets it out for power he cant connect and reaching in theyll get McCain underneath as he commits the foul thats going to be two on them and we mentioned no Caleb Foster so now the depth for Duke on in the back court is nowhere near what it was Caleb faler who pretty much singlehandedly won the game against Michigan State for the blue deers still out with injury and so of course the depth in the back court is not the same as theyve had the majority of the Applause Season Taylor off the fake finds the lane to teardrop no Bowski running the floor but cant finish it how about this race resource style a to lay it in back and forth they go one things for certain when the wol pack have an opportunity to transition theyre going to take advantage of it Jen Taylor didnt even see the outla pass from di but he put it so perfectly in place he was able to pick it up the stri lowski slams it down after a dribble just kind of opened up for him but flip has been very aggressive to start this game and I love seeing that from him when he is this aggressive then of course he puts so much pressure on the opponents defense eight points for him all ACC first team also Sporting News third Team all americ Burns runs into a wall of whites off the fake dribble down horn got it a threepointer deadly 43 Beyond The Arc 249 Proctor looking to answer and now its heating up its heating up now we knew the offense would arrive it was just a little late arriving they took the first four minutes off but now both these teams shooting at a high clip and playing at a much faster Pace titens up to a twopoint game under seven to go in the opening Applause half Burns and filipowski toe to toe the chasing down the loose ball and on the line hell turn it over Angel Tois OB they want to make it ATT track me in the W pack off a Miss turning good defense into great offense playing fast break basketball exactly to the Delight of Kevin Keats now we wish him nothing but the best in retirement wont be the same without Joe meanwhile NC State with a 2422 Advantage here on the Duke Blue Devils first time they played 10 days ago Duke turned it over five times in the entire game already turned over five times in this one and three of those in the first couple of minutes of the game so theyve settled in offensively right now both teams have found a rhythm going to be interesting to see if either of these teams can get any separation but OB I would love to see this one be a nip and Tuck Affair for the entire 40 Applause minutes filipowski on the move on to the left hand thats TP to stop he has put North Carolina State on notice theyre going to have to deal with kosi this entire game when he starts going off the bounce and every move has been aggressive defensively too already three steals as he connects again and thats 12 points this been a Difference Maker here often times I believe hes kind of been deferring to the guys on the perimeter but right now Kowski letting everyone know who the best player on the floor is and leading Duke on a seven zip run or will fire from the elbow and its around it out over the top Mitchell good catch and a slam and another Strong finish from Mitchell message received on the sideline stop trying to lay the basketball up dunk everything on the interior force them to foul you to take away opportunity a went down got back up caught the pass going to work on filipowski it spins out almost made it but thats going to be the second foul on filipowski and thats the only way that you can stop him in this game is to get him in foul trouble and get him out of the game CU off the bounce he is attacking muhamed with no chance on that possession and then defensively KY filipowski getting into the passing Lane and great body control to be able to finish and even if he did Miss OB he was in great position to be able to go back up on that second jump and tap it in so middle Brooks to the line to transfer from Clemson and the 73 foul shooter rattles in the first one and now filipowski with that second foul will step out with 526 left in the half and also Jared McCain on the bench with those two fouls as well so you got a lot of fire power for the Blue Devils sitting on the bench watching and they finally developed some type of offensive Rhythm see if NC stay can take advantage of it with those two guys on the bench foul Lines been a big weapon in this tournament for the pack they were 20 for 24 against Syracuse last night and they had made 53 of 64 in two games at the line a lot yeah thats always going to be important especially this time of year and what should be a close game is taking care of business at the free throw line dont want to give away Applause points roach out High roach to attack no opening there as they sealed him shot clocks at three Mitchell Hees it and here comes NC State they 5 and two all time in the ACC tournament games in Washington DC so theyve liked it here middle Brooks Connell with a short range jumper no TJ power the 69 freshman getting some minutes here in first half for the Duke Blue Devil Applause roach bouncing it for young kick out for power here comes that glances off the iron and Horn wants to go Dio two and oh couldnt get it to go second effort though Tapped Out for horn heres diar from the corner thats one thats the why make the two when you can get three and a timeout give Jeremy roach a lot of credit getting back defensively forth and diara to miss the layup however the offensive rebound gives them an opportunity to step out their first offensive rebound of the game and Di capitalizes with the corner three holding shooter3 National Champion North Carolina State wol Haack Jim valano and all three guys Danny fer and that back court CLC State all representing the DMV extremely well and the M the high school H Jared McCain back on the floor now for Duke these last four minutes before the break here at Capital One arena in Washington Pass inside for young theyll kick it out proor is the open shooter got a tremendous look yeah Bobby I think Duke has been a little too unselfish at times Jeremy Road should have taken that three in the corner I mean again not that it wasnt a good look for Proctor but roach is a better shooter also we saw them pass up a easy layup early to kick out for a three that they didnt make rolling inside middle Brooks and deny but a whistle and Mitchell cant believe it but I believe with this one cl Armstrong had the foul down low so before middle Brooks was even able to elevate the foul was down low on this possession you see as Mitchell comes across watch you see the left hand hooking on that arm that was a great call by Clarence Armstrong he was right on top of it in Great position to be able to see that but I love how players when you cuz you clearly know Mark Mitchell you actually fou him and then so the reaction of no way yeah no we actually saw that that was a clean call certainly got him with the arm there middle Brooks at the line 610 Junior out of Fort Lauderdale and drops it in so twopoint lead for the pack as they look for the upset tonight and look for their third consecutive win here in Washington trying to play their way into the semifinals hope as we keep track its been a 60 run since C lowski picked up that second foul but Jared McCain back on the floor playing with two had to flip it up in the air after the save right to Middlebrooks Taylor shut off that Baseline and hes on the line right in front of the Duke bench and he turns it over we have seen seen that call more in college basketball this year than I ever remember before you know what its really been the last few years since the NCAA moved the threepoint line back from 199 to 21 and change whatever it is now I been happening more and more yeah but you got less space over on that sideline as of course the threepointer has become even more important throughout this game you guys are playing with bigger feet this year yeah I think thats it or maybe their shoes are just bigger Proctor with a pull up from 16 Applause Music you want to attack yeah if youre DJ horn you want to attack finds Burns no if you want to put Jared McCain in any action see if you can pick up that third Applause five M hopping into the lane cant stick it NC State talked about wanting to push it push it push it they wanted to track me tonight as much as they could get it high rebound for Applause Proctor and Mitchell will swing it roach off the dribble guarded tight there by Taylor and coming up on two minutes before halftime mitell from the corner he will drill that one thats a twopointer mark mixer much more decisive in the shots that he needs to take and when he needs to drive it that job tough time doing a great job recognizing that proor did all the work all he needed to do was shoot the basketball look at how far away Burns is from the basket starting this move on young racing over McCain for the double he flips it up there but it wont drop but Duke not choosing the double team until DJ Burns puts the ball on the floor McCain yes that a roll out and D back in front by two points in the paint Duke is double up in state filipowski getting into foul trouble but he was on fire before he went to the bench shot clock at eight Taylor Burns shot clock down to two OK con long one got it a triple but another Di and from DJ Burns giving okono just enough time to get that shot off over the outstretch arm of Mitchell fouled here 451 to go proor will fire Mitchell hanging on to the rebound kept it alive and a second effort here for Duke Jeremy roach 14 points a game proor with a shot clock to five it opens up a b thear with the rejection now heres the decision do you make a play Young dead young made that play right there and if youre Taylor youre looking at that clock if you dont have a definite Advantage you pull that back out and get the last shot of the half Taylor tries to take it to the rim however Ryan young having no parts of it as Kevin Keats calls the timeout to set up the last possession of the first Applause half dou so well see what Kevin Keats has drawn up here for a final play in for ok seven to get a shot up they want horn to touch it he does two to get a shot in the air on the drive he hits it horn at the horn what thing for certain Obi DJ horn he aint scared one thing he is going to be an attack mode from the time he steps on the floor until the clock says triple Zer and it says triple Zer to end the first half with DJ horn laying on the floor however after getting a bucket angel with coach Keats perfectly executed Duke was just two for n shooting it during that span yeah and its a different team both on offense and defense when flip is on the bench but now back on the floor to start this second half look to see him be ultra aggressive knowing how much they need him and just seconds into the second half a foul here DJ horn also opening up in the lineup in the second half he did not start the game lets go to Angel well guys I was catching up with Coach sh and he said containing J horn was the game plan coming into the game and it Remains the Same Way in the second half he was not pleased with the open looks that he had in transition especially from the threepoint line so it was just making sure that the team understood where he was on the floor at all times in the second half Casey Morel the dunk off the inbounds second time that NC States gotten a wide open look on underneath inbound plays give Kevin Keats and his staff a lot of credit designing opportunities for his team to get easy buckets so is the wolf back by five a lot of contact here here as we get underway filipowski knocked to the deck he spent about half of this game down on the deck I dont think thats anything new we really need a Tracker Obie how many times do flip hit the floor it was probably five times in the first five minutes of this game we saw him picking himself up off the floor but its always going to be physical when youre playing against F Kowski because he often times initiates the contact forcing you to have to hit him back yeah I dont think he Minds it at all diara his second foul inbounded to filipowski he spin right into diara and he tied him up no foul there thats great defense by diara and more importantly not leaving his feet The Possession ER will keep it right here for Duke off the inbounds for the Blue Devils thatll glance away to shot by Proctor so NC State trying to build on a fivepoint lead they are the 10 seed horn will lifts y came out of nowhere and he finished it got high up over everybody it took North Carolina State almost the entire first half to get their first offensive rebound after coming off 17 last night but now you see why the so effective Mitchell on the dribble left to Applause short and he stayed with wins here in DC Over Louisville and Syracuse there really havent been many close games in this tournament yet I think were going to have one here OB I believe this was coming down to the wire because the wolf pack do not look like theyre going away and of course we know the Duke lels are always up for the fight I think youre right it feels that way diara tried to roll in and is lucky to save it shot clock is at three and a whistle here and thatll be an offense its going to go the other way keeps with an argument Now Kevin keis not happy with this as we see Mohamed diara tight roping the Baseline stays in bounds but horn gets the offensive foul on that one but what was missed Jared McCain got away with a foul right there he actually held the r which would have been a dunk Warrens first Applause foul and theyre going to dare you see DJ Burns helping going to DARE Mark Mitchell to shoot that three even though hes knocked down one already Ro will rounding out another rebound for diara Applause oconnell for moreel at 25 in round one against Louisville the working on Mitchell gets into that paint love this match up right here OB B Morel and Jeremy Rose those two guys teamed up to win a p Jam Championship together with ar bot so those guys have a great relationship Applause the NC State by seven horn to drive it and flip it up there OB Ill tell you why that was such a smart play by DJ horn Jared McCains playing with two fouls he understands the important of Jared McCain so hes going to put him in action force him to have to defend before the game we know that its been a battle throughout this one a rivalry of sorts but its been fun to see him battling it out tonight guys six points so far for him two for five shooting hes got it on the wing he finds filipowski for the quick strike nice execution by the blue D after the timeout getting filipowski an easy look but when you have a sevenfooter that can play with such motion like that off the basketball you get those type of upper things 14 for filipowski talk about great footwork and great touch burns with another two Duke hit started out very slowly in the first half if you recall they rolled for six he roll for five in this half before filipowski bucket hit like another tried to go to the other side of the iron will bounce it here and back up top for Jeremy roach shot clock to seven and he lost the handle on it another turnover for the Blue Devils and thats the way that this Wolfpack team thrives on offense they turn you over and then they go down and make you pay for those mistakes burns up to set the screen okell hes got to go you got Jeremy roach you got to go that one DJ Burns went a little too quick trying to beat the double team getting there hes got to take advantage of those opportunities with roach behind roach long range yes sir 44 beyond that line and speaking of taking advantage of opportunities Jeremy roach with the Cross Match gets back no one picks up a lethal shooter for the Blue Devils on the other end or getting trapped but he got out of the Pass crosscourt okono open yes sir and answer for the pack DJ Burns vision is Elite OB he he just surveyed the floor finding where was the open guy when he saw too many uniforms around him to drive it Mitchell will finish it 46 39 NC State the winner moving on to the semifinals tomorrow at Music Applause 930 pass getting to H for a twopointer hes starting to heat up hes starting to heat up OB he is now in double figures he has played great this tournament 12 points for oconnell five for six from the field two for two from Beyond the threepoint line number one SE North Carolina to take on pit the first semifinal at 700 pm tomorrow here from DC with Dan J and Jess filipowski running right into diara who collects the rebound again Im have to correct you on that one over its actually J with Dan and j i stand yeah thats it but again we got to point out who the stars are here about that put those guys in their place yeah Morel fairly quiet to this point slamming on the brakes with a Applause turnaround Duke looking for some Rhythm here filipowski tangled up with morcel has been grabed that shirt Mitchell DJ Burns not going to go out there and guard Mitchell and thats what you have to do if youre Mark Mitchell theyre going to dare you to shoot those threes and I believe Ryan gr gave the signal thats going to be a two Mark Mitchells foot on the line theyll look at that one at the next de ball 23 against Notre Dame 23 against wake and diara will draw the foul weve got 1323 to go in this one NC State on top of number number two Duke ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by lack of defensive communication as you see Jared McCain gets hit with the screen KY filipowski does not switch and take away the opportunity trying to stay home with the r allows Casey Mor to get the easy dunk on the underneath out of bounds play so sh was talking about communicating defensively breakdown there and he said thats one thing we cant have regardless of ma shots Miss shots we cant have that and speaking of made shots Mark Mitchells bucket before we went to the timeout was ruled a three so the score is now 4842 in comparison well with rulle a two on the court yeah before the timeout mcain picked up his third foul that has diara at the line 65 as he hits number one NC State trying to continue a Magic Carpet Ride here in Washington and and play their way into the semifinals tomorrow win tonight would be their 20th of the Season say what Obi he does not look like a 65 free throw shooter there neither one of those touched the rim they were all bottoms of the Applause net filipowski a 14point game Maine looking inside hell spin to the paint for two and thats the way Flips going to have to play every time he gets an opportunity in the post if theyre not running somewhat at him immediately he has to look to score I think Duke has been a little too unselfish in this game trying to share the basketball and over passing his productivity per minute higher than anybodys on the floor tonight okell with a pull up too strong mber battling for the rebound Creed it but right to Duke McCain poked Away by Middlebrooks and no foul he just deflected it great Hands by Middlebrooks getting back after the scrum but flip on the offensive end has been spectacular sees no double team coming recognizing that di as good as a Defender he is too small for flip and flip once again back at it going to that left hand but they cant stop him hes going to force Kevin ke to have to bring the double team 50 46 dude Clos in the Gap 18 points so far for Kyle filipowski Taylor off the middle Brooks downstairs going to work and rolls off the Iron Duke grabbing Big Time momentum roges trying to split the defense fouled on the floor almost got through those two but he gets hit with exactly 12 minutes to go duke is if not in the semifinals absolutely in the championship game Duke to put it in 12 minutes to go filipowski 9 for 13 shooting it the rest of the Duke team 10 for 33 so he could use some help and a collision is McCain went down tying up with horn before the ball was ever inbounded but McCain looked as though he may have turned his ankle he was grimacing as he tried to get through that screen of course he was held up by horn but let watch look at that right foot you see that right ankle turn on the way out number two on horn he got hit before the game ever started took three stitches above that eye as of a headbutt with a teammate prame gr hes taking a beating tonight Proctor off the catch wants to drive it for two great recognition by tyes c not that the three would have been a bad shot but attacking the bass getting the layup was even better as two Defenders stayed with flip and the Duke fans in the house and they plenty coming to life here they pulled with in two horn and he takes a shot a foul against Duke here Proctor Garden really close thatll be number one Tyrese Proctor Applause Bill Covington having a conversation with DJ horn after the call DJ placed the basketball he didnt push it into Proctors chest he just lightly placed it there which of course is a no no in the game love the fact that the officials having the conversation and not handing out a technical foul however if it happens again they will be quick to hand out the te B on the inbound on the drive and shovel that pass to Middlebrooks Marcel a Determan drive and down it goes plus the foul that was a tough shot that was absolutely a tough shot and a tough move by Casey morcel getting downhill playing in front of 25 friends and family here watching him at home and of course his other friends and his family on the sideline celebrating the strong movement of course you always got to have a flex in AR you must thats what I do when you make one of those big time calls you when you show off the pipes Im over here flexing behind you most people cant see that but its actually happening and thank God they cant McCain has just been hit with another foul thats going to be number four on Jared McCain and now TJ power into the game in a tough spot simply because its going to be difficult for him to defend any of these high power guards for the wolf pack 11 minutes to go filipowski body to body on burns got it back he finished it he earned that one big time absolutely did great job defensively by DJ Burns as they both go back smiling down the floor burns did his job but flip just did his better laas at 20s 10 for 15 from the Applause floor Morel long range cant drain it rebound Ted out High Morel grabbed it he got there first and finished it last with the slam 5550 filipowski touching it every time down the floor as he should draws the whistle there and it almost rolled in hell be headed to the Music line they get middle Brooks for number two the offensive glass Ben middle Brooks tapping it back out to Casey morcel who sees a wide open Lane goes in flushes with two hands to build the lead back up to five for the wolfback and Ry Bowski went off for 22 points and nine rebounds having an even better game this time course last year won the ACC tournament Most Valuable Player but he is in a dog fight tonight and another free throw on the way makes 67 and one of two right now I would expect to see Kevin Keats find a way to get TJ power involved in movement to see if he can find a way to defend Casey morcel whos caught in fire here over the last few possessions Morel with it there it is at the foul line slamming on the brakes shot clock to five horned with a leaner no middle Brooks it did touch iron reset of the shot clock not that it matter because Taylor was ready to fire itll be in the first half it with the Blue Devils all over the offensive glass but now Ben Middlebrooks Mohamad di starting to flex their muscle on the offensive ground roach really hunting contact no whistle torn Away by Middlebrooks and a foul against Duke Ben Middlebrooks making a difference the 610 Junior coming off the bench absolutely Ben Middlebrooks crashing the glass offensively but more importantly strong with the basketball delivers a strike out side to Jadon Taylor who knocks down the three ball guys to revisit what coach sh told me before the game even though they saw this team 10 days ago this is a more dangerous Wolfpack group because theyre playing connected theyre playing more confident he said when DJ horn missed the first round this team understood their role how they could impact the game were seeing them very connected all but one player has scored on their roster that certainly happened here in Washington well as the shot go in and out because really they werent playing great in terms of wins and losses they lost four straight games coming into the ACC tournament and in those four games they lost a turnover battle as well but they have been on top of things here since theyve come to DC McCain back in four fouls lost the dribble and lost the basketball thats out of bounds and not a lot going right at the moment for the number two SE Duke Blue Devils its been a tough evening thus far are for Jared McCain however hes one of those guys that hell stick with it continue to fight this fight but give the world back a lot of credit for the way theyve defended the all rookie selection although when he gets hot look out 8 threes in Florida State you and I were there for that record performance one doubled it down to Middle Brooks try the other side of the rim but no Duke to run McCain wants that paints and a whistle foul here against NC State stops the clock with 819 to go foul Morel is number three McCain an 87 foul shooter OB Ive been in that spot before especially as their first year as a freshman coming out and playing in the ACC tournament and that first game I can remember my first game in the ACC tournament I was 5 for 20 from the field things did not go well for me 5 for 20 for for the game yeah oh yeah I got good good looks wow with jar McCain things havent gone well for him however he still has opportunity to make a difference in this game the blood issue I think here as Middlebrooks came out to get some attention yep on that hand he has been a whirling dervish here tonight for Coach Keats really has what a luxury Kevin Keats has to be able to have a guy like Ben Middlebrooks to go out and give him quality minutes with DJ Burns unable to play extended minutes in this game Ben Middlebrooks has given them all the energy and effort that hes needed as Jay bis would say its not the ACC tournament if somebodys not bloody now that is a great point and Jays been around a lot of ACC tournaments well you both you both know very very well 819 to go and okono is being called Over by Ron gr I believe he cant come into the game quite yet theres two shots on the foul so DJ horn has to stay on the floor till after the first shot and then at that point there can be a substitution so horn lingering on the floor right next to Kevin Keats MCC and itll be McCain at the line to shoot two freshman from Sacramento California and now conell in DJ and DJ can go take a seat and ailen hip kept him out of game one against Louisville as it turned out they played really well without him he came back and scored 16 last night he played 36 minutes in the first game against Duke only had eight points in that contest he has been much better Applause tonight Taylor back from middle Brooks into the double and now Mitchell beging Off Taylor in the corner proor comes over to guard him shot clock at eight Taylor got it up to Mitchell with the deflection great job defensively by the Blue Devils on that possession more importantly playing without fouling giv away with the block shot now an opportunity to cut into this Applause lead roach off a great fake out from McCain hes free for three has not been his night rebound battered around a bunch of times and off the dup doubles scar with the numbers hes more concerned about the W he does have four assists in the game philipos with the 21 the rest of the Duke team 31 points in that game of Mark for Jeremy Rose 21 points for him he was the robin to F Batman in that one but hasnt been able to get it going here this evening back for Burns Burns trying to spin to that iron its tapped up and out but the mistake and you see the frustration from flip Mark Mitchell trying to come over and block the shot as a shot blocker when you go for that if you dont get it it opens up the backside from offensive rebound that was easy pickings for Applause the filipowski determined to get under there into a double diara slaps it away and Horn pulls it back smart play by horn dont have numbers nothing going there thats going to be a foul filipowski wow in a chiny one 641 to go number three on the seven foot sophomore take a look as you see Philip palski just holding on impeding the progress of DJ Burns and as he stays close Clarence Armstrong close enough to be able to make that Applause call diara wants a long one d crash into glass but down by eight with 6 and 12 minutes to go filipowski stepping into a triple okal with the rebound sees diara up ahead back for Marcel for the slam and thats the biggest lead tonight for NC State up by 10 6252 Mitchell got it up there despite some contact and he drops it a pair Applause Music NC State the number 10 seat up against the number two DJ horn look at Casey Marcel getting in the mix oh look at diara a free and this is the third game in the third day for these World pack however they have been quicker to the loose balls more energy for the team in red than it has been for the team thats rested six to shoot horn to morcel trying to fake spin on Mitchell H it back up to 10 Casey Morel fifth year DJ Burns fifth year DJ horn fifth year they dont want it to end right here OB these guys are trying to keep playing they look like a very different team than the first time they F the Mitchell well knocked out of three and thats the third time hes made them PID for daring him to take that shot big bucket from Mark Mitchell whos up to 16 NY State making a huge difference on the glass in this half six offensive rebounds in this half and 11 Second Chance points horn close in will draw the foul DJ horn a really good foul shooter will head to the line once he catches his breath yeah he he told his team hold up one second let me get a chance here to rest Proctors third foul and Horn to Applause shoot and its down to 449 at number DJ more and 82 AAG about 18 points a game at ACC play the pack not as good here at the free throw line tonight as they have been throughout the tournaments only seven of 10 from the charity strike this is a team that dominated the free throw battle as D we see DJ hor missed two and that could be costly those look like tired foul shots yeah we got to bring up the fact that he did not play game one he is nursing a hip Applause flexor filipowski waiting outside for the ball but Mitchell gets it in the lane hell drive it and score it five straight points from Mark Mitchell he has shown up in a major fashion for the blue doubles here as of R they havent gotten the production from the back court they used to DJ Burns again and foul so now OB the cheap foul that flip got battling with DJ Burns that was three so now this is four four fouls 414 remaining and this is when you look at it and say those are the fouls you have to stay away from flip youre too important to this team you got to be on the floor now hes playing with only one foul or a disqualification his 21 points 12 rebounds but now four personals and another miss here at the line for the wol pack first couple of games they were shooting about 82 collectively they had made 53 out of 64 in the first two another one for burns that one he gets middle Brooks back in now for the wolf pack and burns will take a seat and that play this substitution is to get to the media timeout you want Middlebrooks on the floor def defensively to try to slow down Mark Mitchell who has gotten going here on the last few possessions 405 left in Washington great Hands by the knocked away Morel collects Applause it and the wol back on top 6559 and with the ball Heats calling out a play from the Applause sideline KY MO looking to get a shot in the air 6 seconds on the clock hes determined to take it off the window no it comes right to diara and it drops in and hung up there forever and fell the unstung hero for this Wolfpack team muhamad diar getting the job done on both ends of the Applause floor palski going straight and made it hell be heading to the line a money shot for filipowski 311 to go as we go to break well take you inside the Huddle of Kevin Keats moments ago get back guard to three they getting too many wide open threes fellas lets go Theyre not going to miss them all hey take good shots please were not as shot clock Des for we got time move has done the job offensively and defensively this entire game four offensive rebounds for Mohamad diara who has played 34 minutes of this game filipowski will be at the line and looking to finish up a threepoint play 23 points 12 rebounds for filipowski also added three steals tonight pressure here from duke broken by Nancy state so heres the thing right now Obie when when Duke is going to press you if you got numbers you got to attack this is not the time of the game to bring it out and use a bunch of clock and allow Duke to set their defense you get an opportunity you have to take advantage of it still keep your foot on the gas B one backing away taking a better look at that shot clock and drills the jumper mark look his well and he got to his rhythm dribble Mark Mitchell has to find a way to disrupt his rhythm he allowed DJ DJ horn has made that shot a thousand times in the gym by himself 16 points tonight Proctor looking to answer leaning in and itll roll home thats a tough bucket by Proctor and once again attacking the basket not settling for the jump shot fast approaching two minutes left in this quarterfinal and the number two seed in trouble proor on horn filipowski out to guard horn that opens up Burns at the foul line shot clock to four back to the big fella got to get a shot in the air and thatll roll off thats time the rim did not help the Mitchell running the floor and draws the foul he wanted so badly to make that lay in but hell be at the foul line with a minute 46 to go love the pass from Jeremy roach keeping his eyes up not even dribbling the basketball seeing a teammate cutting to the basket Mark Mitchell with a nice run of course he would love to have finished that had the an one but still opportunity to cut into the lead at the free throw line 65 foul shooter hes got two shots Applause coming and time running down here in this quarterfinal and a miss and coming up tonight 1130 Eastern the nothing but Ned crew will have the complete breakdown of todays ACC tournament quarterfinal games this is the third game of the day another one to come at 930 thats Virginia and surprising Boston College oh there is a squad in this building today you talk about Andrea Carter at the point guard Joel Barry off the ball Luke Hancock Jay Williams and Carlos BL that team can win some games youre in that lineup n no not with these hips well I didnt mean now 127 to play Burns wants the paint swooping in and L it home oh and even worse Kowski limping out of that scrum yeah slow to get across mid Court little gimpy 7164 proor great defense while conell getting over that screen T to shoot filipowski dribbling away six to get off a shot roach has it knocked away and that was with 36 on the shot clock and 544 left in the game and a timeout for Duke NC State closing in 7 head coach John sh was asking for a review on that deflection yes John Shire had a conversation with Clarence Armstrong about that last possession he wanted to make sure that that basketball went to the Blue Devils and of course under two minutes you can go back and review any play as you see Jeremy roach attacking the basket and that basketball looks as though it stays off of Road Casey Morel absolutely got a hand in but he does not touch it on the way out he did not and I believe the call on the floor was NC States basketball and I believe its going to stay that way because Jeremy roachs left hand seems to be the last to touch Applause that it definitely didnt touch it as far as we can tell there with that right Applause hand so the ruling is NC State ball with 544 seconds to go Ron Grover Bill cumington and Clarence Armstrong to crew here for game number one and we take their time to get this absolutely right and we are here in its going to remain NC State ball and that thats the right call it did touch Jeremy roachs left hand last now there was some contact on it so again if they could have gone back and called the foul I believe they would have seen that but there was contact absolutely on that but you cant go back and change that theyll explain that to John sh I dont know was they Dukes basketball can see can Applause see it will be dup D it will be Duke with the basketball must have been called Dukes basketball on the floor so he gave it back over to Duke here thats a tough shot cant get that one to go diara went up for the rebound and another whistle with 50 Applause point7 and Roach slow to rise but that was a rush shot from Proctor he never got Square never got settled on that one and had more time than I believe he thought he did coming off that the execution was perfect just never got his shoulders Square to the basket trying to take that Applause three one and one so diaro with a one and one roach with his third foul and front rims it D catch the hustle proor to the paint tipped up and in by filipowski great Touch by flip there as Proctor now runs away with the gingerly hes going to keep fighting out there but waren gets it up ahead he got to finish it and MD do not get H on the rim also he hung on the rim missing the dunk wide open as open as you can be now as the officials confer are they going to look at this as a technical foul now Bill Covingtons coming Applause over it couldnt go any worse for the wolf pack on that possession what should have been a easy twoo ends up being a technical foul as you see Ben Middlebrooks hanging on the riml so that will send the Blue Devils to the free throw line wow for two shots and The Possession back in what is a fivepoint game forgive me will just be a one Applause shot a one shot tacnical foul for hanging on a rim after blowing the slam and had a chance to really pretty much ice this thing that is a huge play now you give the Blue Devils Applause opportunity to put a point on the board and I was y you got yelling you got to finish this but this is a disaster for the wol pack you give the Blue Devils an opportunity to score without the clock running which is not their friend right Applause now with 303 on the clock surprising that Jared McCain is stepping to the line in comparison to Jeremy roach in this Applause spot both of them in the high 80s McCain 87 and gets that one thats the one with 303 so 7167 NC so it will be NC States ball however because there was no possession after the play so it will be NC States ball because of the possession AR the possession arrow so NC State will take it after this time out and what a wild conclusion here here a fourpoint Music game M Brooks has to shake that one off he absolutely does I am shocked those are the type of plays that can really destroy your confidence with 303 remaining in this game to be able to go out and finish this game Im sure the basketball will be in the hands of DJ horn Michael oconnell the guards but it was a great opportunity for Ben Middlebrooks to seal this thing for the most part for the wack unable to take advantage of it allowing the Blue Devils to put a point on the board but they still have to get a stop defensively we go back to the beginning of the broadcast youre talking about what it would take for NC State to upend the Duke Blue Devils here tonight the ingredients that would go into it and those ingredients have come into play DJ horn but also Casey Morel Michael oconnell going to work Kyle Philip paly got in trouble in the first half now playing with those four fouls the turnover battle tied at nine to n but crashing the offensive glass has been the key 18 second CH points for the wolf pack Mohamed Di has been a Difference Maker and of course the wolf pack cant be scared and they were not coming into this opportunity against the Rival Blue Music Devil so 7167 our last quarterfinal coming way tonight at 930 scheduled at 930 itll run a little bit late Virginia and Boston College BC the number 11 seed Virginia the number three well see if we have an upset in this quarterfinal in the last half minute of Music play and filipowski on the bench yeah with those four fouls on the defensive possession you dont want to have him in the game especially knowing that you may have to foul well down four you absolutely have to foul if you dont get a turnover here 20 seconds on the shot clock you cannot allow the wolf pack to run down this time Applause so itll be oconnell to put it in for the Baseline Stewart right in his face at Music 69 and looking for a cutter he does bounce for diarra and a whistle as he made his way to the Applause basket 29 nine on the Applause clock and thatll go against Proctor thats number four on tyres Proctor to put diara to the line and again 65 hes looked better than that two out of three tonight but huge shots here and too strong with the first one theres different which 299 remaining and youre nursing a fourpoint lead as Kowski checks back into the game still a twopossession game but a big free throw here theyve missed five of their last six free throws NC State and he missed the pair Proctor filipowski turnning going in strong and hes got two more 7169 17 seconds di win it porn will draw the foul from behind filipowski filipowski just fouled out he did indeed but filipowski felt as though he got all ball on that Applause possession Kyle filipowski has fouled out 15 seconds to play DJ horn was fou there hard to see if he got the arm or any contact on that one well filipowski played a great game 28 points 14 rebounds but he is done number TJ headed to love the decision by the Blue Devils on the last possession to attack the basket for a number of reasons one The Wack have missed a lot of free throws as of late so theyre not going to be as confident at the line however this guy right here DJ horn has ice running through his Zs its the big first one 7269 they still a one possession gain and right now this is the important free throw to try to make it a two possession Applause game number two for DJ indeed up by Ford and another timeout it would not Shock me at this point OB to see Kevin Keats have some full court pressure up one you dont want to allow the Blue Devils to be able to race the ball down the floor with a lot of time and get a good look at the basket so if theres some type of pressure in the back court Im sure that wont be a trap however you want to be able to slow the Blue Devils down not allow him to easily get the basketball inbounds and Advance it so look at a reset the eyes of Kyle filipowski as the free throws went in as he has fouled out of this quarterfinal valy and effort on his part and we rewind back to the foul he got on the sideline against DJ burn that had nothing to do with the play and again its small things but those small things add up when youre the best player on the floor and your team needs you in those final 30 seconds remember it was Kyle filipowski who just got the basket to give the Blue Devil 69 before committing his fifth Music foul so 15 seconds Applause left heres Proctor hard drive the reverse wont go diara cradling it Mitchel fouls him with 7 seconds left and the NC State faithful begin to sense Music it 7369 and diara back to the line the 610 junor to shoot two tonight two for five at at the foul line and that one off the Applause 10 so he made a couple early now hes missed a number two for six and his second will go to make it 7469 Obie the game plan has been executed perfectly by the wolf pack throughout this game power from the corner no proor gets it back that wont drop and NC State wins it over Duke here in the quarterfinals they knock off the number two seed they eliminate the Duke Blue Devils 74 69 give Kevin Keats and his staff a tremendous amount of credit the game plan more importantly the execution and the Buy in from his players this is a team that came into the ACC tournament having lost four consecutive games and now theyve won three in a row here in DC and will find themselves in the semifinals tomorrow well the first double digit seed to reach the ACC semifinal since NC State and Miami did it in 20
