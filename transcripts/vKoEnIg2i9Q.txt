shoot around in practice Hes good to go fully today Yeah music that was muted to my ear Doug You got Hes back when he comes in the game No minute restrictions I expect him to be a little winded be back on the floor but hes back Carter Welling gets the start at center for Clemson again this afternoon He wins the tip has the basketball now And the Tigers riding a threegame winning streak with the basketball first Dylan Hunter into the lane Back outside to Welling Clemson in their regalia uniforms I like that color Welling inside off the jump hook No And the big rebound for William Kyle III who has been Syracuses best and most consistent player this year Nathan George draws the foul Hes really been on the uptick the last couple of games Yeah I was happy to hear Coach Arby talk about he sat down and talked today and said Hey we brought you in here for a reason Be aggressive Be that guy why we brought you here To your point lately last couple games hes being more aggressive And I tell you what the 22 points each of the last two games Dennis for Nate is a really big deal but thats not the most important thing for a point guard No hes a real table setter Thats why honorable mention all ACC last year he got all those Georgia Tech guys involved Now with Freeman back Sadique and the rest of these guys I think things will get more exciting because he really wants to share the ball Well his scoring average now is up to 104 per game His assists per game compared to last year at Georgia Tech when he led the ACC at six and a half a game is down just a touch under five but hes still finding his way Yes I thought those first couple games he was too busy thinking about basketball versus going out and having fun When youre coming to a new situation you want to fit in I think coach Archie said it best Go out there and play your game We brought you here for a reason And you saw firsthand and worked with Nate George in his early days at Georgia Tech Yeah hes a hard worker Id be in the gym late at night getting shots up a lot of the guys and Nate George is there every night middle of the night working on his shot Theres the starting five for Brad Brown Allen His 16th year as head coach Nice lefty move to the bucket by Jake Wallen The Utah transfer Hes got Clemson on top That was smooth Crowd here at the dome continues to stand as has been the custom throw for four decades until the home team scores its first field goal Sadique White Jr goes to the right hand and allows the folks to take a seat Yeah good patience by Sadique that time Not forcing it to his baby right hand hook Well Sadi is from Charlotte North Carolina A true Southerner He tells us Dennis what he misses most up here He doesnt worry about the snow as much Hes like Where are the Waffle Houses laughter Thats southern cuisine Theres RJ Godfrey who we highlighted off the top 67 240 His dad was a big time football player He looks like a football player as well Hes built like a tank Thats why thats why he stays in the paint Heres George defended by Dylan Hunter cheering A whistle and a foul against the Orange And theres a look at Brad Brownell a former division three basketball player at Depal University in Indiana where he is from now 57 years old and seemingly in the blink of an eye he is the senior member of the ACC coaches Things have changed quickly hadnt he partner My goodness But hes done a marvelous job building up and maintaining at Clemson Consistently good to great teams the last several years Well fights over Kyle one of the best shot blockers in the nation And hell have a chance for three I like how he went up Doug Watch how he goes up on his play doesnt extend the right arm to be a offensive foul Under control pivot now go up with the left Not pushing off Get the foul Big time move down low Boy if Clemson could get him into foul trouble that would be huge Again he is averaging over three block shots per game And Welling was not deterred at all Not at all Wasnt afraid Went right at him 73 Tigers on top We love the fact that he made the free throw for all you big guys at home You work so hard that you miss the free throw and give it back Heres JJ Stling the captain of this Syracuse team to George White left alone along the baseline Kings got a hand on the rebound but is comes in with a basketball and their senior point guard from Atlanta Dylan Hunter brings it up Wallen lost the dribble attacked by White Itll stay with Clemson as White in a nice show of sportsmanship helps Jake Wallen back to his feet Loses it gets it back and Sadique kind of gives him a little push Well there is a defensive intensity that you feel in shoots and in practices and certainly in games when you watch the young freshman from Charlotte Yes indeed Very intense Can guard two three and fours and some fives depending on the size cheering Welling again working on Kyle second defender Stling pokes it away Hey George on the attack Got caught under the basket Clemson has it Welling is fouled inside Remember yesterdays practice Doug Coach Archie talked about fire because Clemson likes to get a different guy in the post as much as possible That was a perfect play You heard the bench yelling fire fire get down there and help out Whats the timing like that When does JJ Stling know to come from the wing to get down there and double team Well it depends on the matchup If its a big or a small you go right away when the balls in the air Porter off the nice up fake Got rid of Stling and buried the shot Yes perfect pump fake to create space Knocked down the big three Remember Justin Porter during his days at Middle Tennessee State once put 41 points on UTEP He can heat up in a hurry Yes he can White along the baseline again takes the contact from Godfrey Shot clock under 10 George inside Kyle draws a crowd cheering and he is fouled Shot clock was under four And so now the Syracuse center will head to the free throw line Thats a tough play for Clemson to play great defense Those last two seconds were foul cheering Kyle under control right here But Doug you see the crowds getting a little excited And it wasnt about William Kyle going to the free throw line Whats happening Whats happening Doug It was about Donnie Freeman getting off the bench And for the first time that guy is back people since November number one in white is on the floor applause And you and I were wondering you know New Years Eve the snow the sun comes out Donnie Freemans back Thats why this build is electric Waiting to see what he brings to the table today Its got some energy for the young man who coming out of high school was the number six player in the country But as you talked about 3D the folks here have not seen a lot of Donnie Freeman in his two years thanks to the foot injury Not enough Just kind of been teasing him a little bit Godfrey air ball and thats a rare three Gods only taken what three or four threes all season long and he is now 0 for four on the year And heres Donnie Freemans first touch trying to impose his will Left it short Now how much should we read into what we see from him today considering the rust that he must have Hes going to have a lot of rust How does he get up and down the floor and play through the physicality like play like right there Good time block at the rim Oh God said not enough Mhm Thats a big time finish Back the other way Kyle with a rim run and he is fouled A little shove to push him out of bounds by Carter Welling Well were so glad youre with us here on New Years Eve Happy New Opening Day here at the dome for Syracuse and Clemson with Dennis Scott Im Dun Whyd you take it off Uh that wasnt comfortable laughter Later in a few hours youll have it back on And I put my real glasses back on so I can see laughter Syracuse off to a slow start offensively Just the onemade field goal with the basketball down to Clemson 123 Akir Suare has come into the game for the first time for the Orange Tyler Betsy as well And also Brad Brownell going to his bench for the first time Chase Thompson a freshman from Glenwood Minnesota is out there as well as Ace Buckner And with Clemson playing without Zack Foster theyre very promising 64 freshman out for the season with an ACL injury A couple of other Clemson guys are going to get bigger opportunities Correct One thing Syracuse has figured out now from nonconference play Clemson plays physical basketball Betsy lets fire and rattles it in That is the one thing he does very very well If they can knock down shots early that takes the pressure off everyone else from the half court offense The Cincinnati transfer sophomore from Windsor Connecticut makes it 12 to six Ace Buckner off the back iron and Betsy grabs the defensive rebound George feeds the post to Donnie Freeman got a big mismatch Goes right to work Everything but the finish for Freeman who pulls his hair in frustration as he walks back to mid court Yeah little frustrated Perfect move Didnt let the defense off the hook Just rolled in and rolled out doesnt he Nice hand for JJ Stling as he leaves the ball game And Cayenne Anthony hello Mellows in the building Son of that man on the floor for the first time this afternoon Dallas Thomas Nick Davidson also into the game for Clemson This is Thomas off the shot fake into the corner Four to shoot Three to shoot Buckner leans in the paint Puts it up cheering a little too strong and Freemans going to dribble up himself George lost it on the spin Here comes Clemson with numbers Butter Johnson with the dish and the layup is good by Dallas Thomas Excellent job by Butter Johnson in the transition Nice little drop off pass for the finish Well Dennis what were the keys both ways for Clemson and Syracuse to try and win this ball game today Well first is half court defense and right now you see Clemson getting the better of that and getting off to get the easy ball because thats why the score is what it is so far Freeman Bad pass right into the hands of Butter Johnson And Clemson gives it right back Pass into the corner Great close out it looked like but the whistle comes and a fouls going to be called on Dallas Thomas as Tyler Betsy was shooting the three number Great extra pass by Cayenne And yes gets him on the elbow You never want to foul the jump shoot especially shooting a three But then that brings up whats been one of the biggest issues for Syracuse this year The worst free throw shooting team in the country And Betsy is one of those guys who you scratch your head Hes a really good shooter threepoint shooter and yet hes only 58 on the year And you and I spoke about it yesterday at practice I think most of these guys just get something in their head They miss a couple shots and like Wait a minute You earned the right to get the free throws knock them down Well they got the first Betsy has been instant offense a number of times coming off the bench for Syracuse in key games Had 16 against Houston 16 against St Josephs Hes got five quick points here this afternoon When you get Betsy knocking down threes you get Kings knocking down threes This team has a lot of firepower once they figure it out 221 press right here Handled nicely Johnson makes cheering the pass to Thomas on the way Freeman had it cheering and gathers it back Now with George out Starling runs the point and cheering gets his own First two points for the senior from nearby Baker High School in Baldwinsville You notice he took his time got to his spot didnt settle for the jump shot got a little physical to get the nice little soft runner Hes best when he gets downhill and there are indicators often times early in a game whether hes going to be effective scoring the basketball or not No great point Great point partner cheering Five to shoot Johnson has to put it up and again a little too strong One and done as Betsy cheering grabs the miss Stling lost it Out of bounds Coach Archer didnt like that one Those are the one that drive coaches crazy Like he had to look away on that one laughter Well Red was a great point guard in his days here in Syracuse for four years He knows Tolington High School baby He knows cheering Buckner inside Davidson got the defenders in the air and then banked it in Excellent execution by Clemson in half court offense The ball went from one side of the floor back to the other Back door cut pump fake Two guys go for it finished the play And what a weapon Nick Davidson is The red shirt senior Nevada transfer now coming off the bench averaging about eight points and four rebounds a night Look at the physicality Look how far Syracuse offense is being ran Anthony draws the foul and hell head to the line to shoot two when we come back Clemson with a fivepoint lead on the Orange think hes going to have a good game So what I tell guys like JJ and all the young kids watching get out your head play the game You love it Anonys another one of the guys who has not shot free throws nearly as well as you know hes capable of Gets the roll on the first Hes been good on the first a lot of times Missed the second and is what youre talking about D Focus Focus Locked in Shoot the ball like you know how to the freshman out of both Christ the King High School and Long Island Lutheran Spent a couple of years on the varsity at each of those Calls Brooklyn home There you go Perfect swish on number two And Syracuse back within three cheering Dylan Hunter as Clemson runs out of the Horns offense Hunter gets it back Great pass fake Another open look Clemson just couldnt cash it in off the miss by Welling Donnie Freeman back in the game for the first time in more than 40 days Coming off a foot injury still looking for his first points Anthony off the hesitation lost it on the way up And here comes a run out for the Tigers and Justin Porter Stealing a field goal Justin Porter as far got caught lack of days stepping on the lane Cayenne drives the ball to the basket Stripped and Porter shows his speed to beat Freeman down the court Young man from Houston Texas averaging 10 and a half points per game Hes got five already this afternoon And among his best games so far in a Clemson uniform the 2025 Charleston Classic Championship He put 18 on Georgia and won the MVP of that event Here he goes again Porter added block William Kyle back into the game with the rejection And here comes Starlet Freeman gets a clean look Too strong Still working some of that rust off that Thats a rust shot right there cuz he shot it over the rim A little excited but I still like the fact hes being aggressive One thing youve talked about Dennis that you like about Donnie Freemans game is that hes not hunting threepoint shots Hes not hunting Hes just playing the game the right way Wallen over the left shoulder under control for two We call that great defense by Bessie Better offense by Way The junior from Provo Utah now with four points The lead back to seven for Clemson Both these teams come into the game riding threeame winning streak in their nonconference Anthony off the window for two He is a shot maker Hes not afraid of the opponent Hes not afraid of the opportunity as we look at dad cheering on Great move using the glass nicely What similarities in their offensive games do you see father and son right now Just being in attack mode understanding they can score in all different levels Welling drive and dish and the foul Great pass by Welling Man hes 610 able to initiate offense like that Well the way he uses his ball fake to create space to attack the defense SEC league play begins Saturday and we have the first matchup of the day Learon Phylon and 14th ranked Alabama host Ortega Ooway and Kentucky who are finally music healthy and playing with their full roster Our coverage begins at noon Eastern from Coleman Coliseum on ESPN and the music ESPN app cheering as Donnie Freeman goes to the bench I thought the effort was there but going 03 hes definitely rusty But I didnt think he took any of the shots that he missed that were bad shots He just missed them a little rust George working on Hunter a natural lefthander went to his right hand and couldnt finish You and I spoke before the game partner One thing about coach Brad his team plays tough on the defensive end and very physical Im very impressed now watching up close Well you talk about how teams and programs take on the identity of their head coach That is exactly what we see year after year out of Clemson Correct Anthony hangs in the air Theyre going to count the basket as Godfrey got it on the way down That was close Great job Nate George Point guards at home Throw the ball ahead to get easy offense Whoa that was close cheering You played with a pretty good point guard at Georgia Tech who got it up the floor Unbelievable for Kenny Anderson He made life so much easier for Brian Alberai Mhm So he has a clean block shot Take those two points off the board from Ken Anthony Its 2115 Clemson and they have adjusted the clock to 821 They were trying to get the shot clock right Was it 25 or 29 on the clock but they got eight now 825 Now its 825 What we showed earlier was more 822 with 25 on the clock Although really at this point of the first half does it really matter Couple seconds Lets get back Lets get back to hoops Here we go Fullourt pressure by Syracuse Oh well seemed like maybe an extra step No call as Davidson gives it to Hunter And he got away with that Yes he did walks it up just across the timeline in time Godfrey sets the screen rolls to the bucket THE LINE AND THE FINISH That is two seniors who have played a lot of ball together over the years Just a great play out of the timeout or should I say stopping action Great execution Hey Kings yet to score this afternoon Puts up the three Right on Got it The red shirt senior from Salem Oregon makes it 2318 Clemson again Godfrey sets a good screen Syracuse defensively handles it better Davidson a lot of contact with he and Suare It goes out of bounds and itll be Syations like that you figure it out now because when you get deeper into league play youre trying to make the tournament you have to have that stuff figured out Yeah that BYU loss is tough to swallow Its going to hurt in a couple of months Its going to hurt over the summer Nate George gets the screen from his former high school teammate his former college teammate at Georgia Tech and then sets him up Suare with a rare made bucket and hell head to the line for a chance for three Suare is the energy off the bench Great screen set like we talked about earlier Thats what Nate likes to do best Set the table Good finish And Whoa look at the energy Hes okay Well they were together at Canyon International Academy in Arizona Been together the last couple of years at Georgia Tech And not that they were necessarily a package deal but that man who just finished the threepoint play brings size and athleticism that this program didnt have a year ago An effort every night Thats youre not going to question his effort And I think thats what you need to see from him Now you see the crowd starting to get in this ball game This is as close as its been since the opening moments Clemson with a twopoint lead and the basketball cheering Johnson with the basketball under seven to go in the half cheering Turns down the screen from Godfrey Drives into the lane Puts it up and it appears Suare got a piece And here comes Starling Lightning quick with the basketball in hand He finds George for three Syracuse takes the lead Great job by JJ pushing the pace and once again taking the page out of Nates book advancing the basketball cheering cheering cheering Hunter feeds the post Godfrey with three on the timer Lost it and hes not going to get a shot off Boy theres some energy in this building here this afternoon D big time energy and I can see coach Autry using that possession That was the best defense weve seen in a while The ball went from one side of the floor Syracuse stay down and go for no pump fakes Shot clock violation Well again we had more than 2 ft of snow fall in the city of Syracuse yesterday We woke up this morning Baby lets go to a ball game Lets go The folks are here cheering This may wind up being the biggest crowd of the year to this point Something about you coming to Syracuse Tennessee is the biggest so far Soon soon I walked in the building coach said Oh good luck charms here 3Ds here laughter I said Coach dont put that pressure on me Exactly Cuz when it goes the other way you dont want to have to wear that Exactly So Donnie Freeman comes back in again This is his first game returning off of a foot injury after missing the last nine games Last time we saw him play before today November 18th against Monmouth And now 42 days later hes back being defended by RJ Godfrey George to Suare George loves that spin move Able to get into the lane just couldnt finish Looking for a call Didnt get it from Eric Lewis the near side official cheering Hunter pulls up on the midrange and it rattles home to put the Tigers back on top The midrange game is still alive It is You come off the screen you take what the defense gives you You rise up and shoot them with confidence In college especially D I would much prefer to see an open midrange shot than a contested force three I agree with you partner Freeman The crowd is just hanging on every shot he puts up Yeah theyre waiting for him to get going Welling over Suareeno applause Foul on the reachin as again its another paint touch for Nathan George Second foul on Dylan Hunter Well Dylan Hunter such a big part of what Brad Brownell has done the last four years He suffered a broken hand against SMU in the opener last years ACC tournament Kind of derailed Clemsons hope of having a long run in March You remember he was a key reserve on the Elite 8 team in 2024 and has brought a lot of experience to this team this year He really has Its just amazing partner in the new landscape how coaches are being able to find the right guys to fit into what used to be culture How do you change the culture every year Well thats what hes fighting Thats what Brad Brownell is fighting And he needs players like Dylan Hunter and RJ Godfrey to impose that and impart that to all the new guys And so far so good And similarly with Syracuse it was such a big deal for coach Autry to retain his two best players from a year ago JJ Starling and Donnie Freeman Yes cuz I know the phones were ringing for both of those guys No doubt And coming off of a losing season it could have gone either way but they were dedicated to their coach and to the program Nate George will take a seat Ken Anthony back in for the Orange Fullourt pressure for Syracuse But a Johnson along the baseline gets it in cheering Case Buckner may be the most explosive scorer on this balanced Clemson team with the basketball Was a medical red shirt last year and has had a really good first year playing for Clemson so far Justin Porter got himself an opening Tigers have not been shooting the three well at all here today No theres another big time possession by Syracuse Now one for eight from beyond the arc Stling turns the corner dumps it off Kyles got it Anthony Welling pulls it down cheering Freeman went for the steal and it cost him Botfrey with another slam Once again Clemsons half court offense Whoever they can get in the post most times its Godfrey Thats the fire defense Syracuse working on yesterday Stling able to get down Hill unable to finish though Numbers for Clemson cheering Porter out of bounds Clemson basketball So itll be the Tigers up a point who will have the basketball when we come back in this opener of ACC play The table So right now Syracuse has six different players averaging double figures Thats likely not going to continue right No I dont think so as Butler gets a wide open three because coach Alry once again has to figure out whats my starting lineup but more importantly whats my closing lineup stling at the point heres Nate King back to Stling has a step on the defender went to the reverse and right there to block the shot beautifully was Jake Wall yeah good job by Wallin using his using his length without fouling Big time rip and go with JJ Big time block Play basketball Normally it seems like if you get to the other side the rim will help protect you from that block shot but Wallen was undeterred He was right on Q George triggers into Stling who was the first Orange player out getting up shots pregame today Kings off the mark Save Betsy Hes been a great spark off the bench this afternoon Big time effort Betsy the right place at the right time Finishes the play Eight points to lead the Orange And back in front of Syracuse Good battle inside between Welling and Freeman Pauline trying to get up a shot Cant do it Welling and its another shot by violation forced by this Syracuse defense Look at the bench Look at coach Ary Look at that energy Thats what they preached yesterday in practice Ball pressure when someone front make sure we have the backside help Another lane violation Excuse me Shot clock violation Coach Brownell in our conversation with him pregame knew they were going to be up against it and he knew what the addition of Donnie Freeman and being in this building with a good crowd means for a Clemson Tigers team trying to come off of their own holiday break So far that has been the case Betsy feeling it cheering Godfrey works his way to the basket Cut off by Freeman Still those broad shoulders able to get a shot up applause Isolation Freeman on the turnaround Still looking for his first bucket of the afternoon Once again Im not mad at that shot Hes under control Weve seen him make that shot a million times Just still rusty Missed what 40 days partner Yep More than 40 Well you said during your three years at Georgia Tech and in your 10y year NBA career Dennis you never had to come back in season from an extended injury So do you have a sense of what hes feeling right now Well hes hes pressing a little bit because he wants to play well Hes playing hard Hes playing the right way Hes not forcing anything but you can see the expression on his face A little frustrated because he wants to knock down a few shots Final minute of the first half Buckner got it Oh man Smooth and under control Oh man Play through the contact as well cheering 10 to shoot George pulls the trigger Clemson with a chance to hold for the final shot with a onepoint lead Both teams now have played solid half court defense here in the last two minutes Buckners fouled by Stling as the Orange have fouls to give So thats the 15th foul against Syracuse Yeah so far so good Syracuse still has a foul to give with 77 remaining here in the first half And theres Freeman reaching in So another 11 seconds come off and so Clemson will have plenty of time to still get the ball inbound and get a good shot And Im glad Donnie was smart and waiting for the opponent to be facing the other way so theres no cheap foul maybe shooting the ball Buckner gets it back defended by George splits the defense puts it up and thatll do it for a very entertaining first half of basketball The Tigers head to the locker room with a onepoint lead over the Orange Lets send you back to the studio with Luke Hancock And Tigers led by as many as nine in the first half Syracuse led by one point couple of times nine music lead changes as you see the summary as we commence the second half here inside the dome So Donnie Freeman in his return played solid got five rebounds still looking to score What does Syracuse need to do What does coach Autry need to do to get him his first bucket and open him up Well Im going put a little pressure on Nate George the next time he comes in the game Look for Nate George to try to set him up and get him an easy basket get him going offensively And again Freeman coming off the bench and his return from a 42day absence from a foot injury on their first possession Syracuse looking to get JJ Stling going Yeah off the Iverson cut little brush screen attacks the paint less the glass nicely Just Starlings second bucket of the afternoon Hes got four and its given the Orange a onepoint lead GODFREY OH MY GOD WELL THAT IS A grown man going against a freshman laughter What did I say in the opening opening of the game One thing he loves to do is live in the paint get fouled and get to the free throw line OH MY GOD DID cheering HE SAY DID he say Oh my god Oh my god Free Its me laughter I love it Love it Love it Well Randall Godfrey Jr is every bit of 67 240 pounds from Sani Georgia His dad was an allAmerican linebacker at Georgia where he actually roommed with Dylan Hunters father Bryce And of course Mr Godfrey played 11 years in the NFL And again if hoops doesnt work out I could see RJ playing a little football himself down the road Or take those guns back to the gun factory that hes carrying on his arms laughter four He leads Clemson in scoring and hes got the Tigers back on top Stling pulls up with a long two Jake Wallen finds the open man off a good screen and he drew two defenders and found the open man for the open layup by Carter Welling Yeah didnt waste any time Nice power dribble to get straight to the rim Sadique White got a height advantage here against Dylan Hunter Hunters not going to back down but he is called for the foul Yeah I thought the first bump was pretty good The second bump I thought he reached his hand a little bit like right here First one thats solid Solid And right there that left arm got kind of caught in the cookie jar a little bit And so that is his third personal foul Big news for Clemson their senior point guard out early in the second with foul trouble That hurts Now someone off the bench has to step up RJ coming Buckner takes his place Hes defending on Nate George Pokes it away for the moment George continues to attack Whose ball is it Tigers basketball Nobody wanted to go after it They werent sure who touched it last Exactly But cheering lets give Buckner a lot of credit on that possession He was hawking and ball pressuring Nate George that whole possession without fouling Oh that was close Clemson basketball cheering Godfrey met immediately by White And back to Buckner Ace had it poked away Nate Kings spins gets back to his left hand and lays it in Very nice Nate Kings under control Spin Skeel in the left hand Well you saw his best game so far as an Orange 19 to help in that win over Tennessee And I had to ask Coach Ar yesterdays practice do you have to remind this young man to shoot him cuz his shot looks so good Five points for Nate Kings And this his only year with Syracuse after transferring from Oregon State Foul on Kyle And that is his third personal Thats his third personal Well partner I love this right here Pump fake Show it again Feet work get the defender off bounds So if youre Adrien Autry youre thinking hes looking back at his assistant coaches Do you keep Will Kyle in the game with those three fouls Thats tough 17 minutes left to go in this ball game but youve got the physicality and the size of the older guys for Clemson youve got to deal with cheering for the moment William Kyle stays on and after making the free throw Welling will take a seat Back in is Nick Davidson Another one of those big 610 235 out of modern day high school in Southern California I mean with Wallen Davidson and Welling those are three 610 guys who can play And then oh by the way RJ Godfrey at 67 is a banger And all those guys are very versatile in the post Here is strength against strength Kyle no Nate George able to clean it up No missed the layup Syracuse will keep but a big missed opportunity for the Syracuse point guard Yeah you have to smile that one off You work so hard to get the offensive rebound and you missed the bunny So he will inbound Trying to get it back Kyle has it poked away Nice job Yes And Buckner now with the ball driving on Stling Look at the hustle by Wall You talk about the versatility Unbelievable Im loving what Im seeing right now by Clemsons bigs Good passes under control in the post The Tigers back up by four George pulls up Good job defensively to close out that possession with a rebound by Davidson Buckner bad pass White poked it away Clemson keeps No change of possession So the shot clock continues down to six Porter tough shot William Kyle rips away the rebound Freeman Betsy and Suare will check in at the next stoppage which will take us to our first media timeout of the second half Starling cheering official time Eric Lewis stops play and that will take us to our media timeout as the officials confer Quick start to the second half for the was 37 in of snow Thats true Sorry Coach Beheim That was just too much snow for me laughter Jim Beheim court right in front of us and you said no to the Hall of Fame coach You went to Tech instead Yes I love him to death That was just too much snow Douggee Oh screaming too much snow Thats Gossby with the snowball jam Tell you what not the first time weve seen coach Brownell come out of a timeout and get a slam dunk Great call partner Execution paying attention to detail Good finish See Syracuse in a scoreless drought going on three minutes Godfrey meanwhile with that dunk leads all scorers with a dozen Heres Suare who gave Syracuse good minutes off the bench in the first half Gives it back to Starling Five to shoot George going to have to put it up Excellent defense by Clemson once again Davidson going for the pump fake but not fouling George at the end of the shot clock That was huge Stling will go back out Kaien Anthony back in Good to see Lamar Simpson coming back from the locker room So for the moment hes going to stand at the end of the Syracuse bench and that would give you the idea that hell come back in here in the second half Couple of good chances for Clemson at the rim Just couldnt score it Freeman Rusty And that rust cheering turns into a layup at the other end Clemson up by eight off the layup from Buckner And that will elicit a timeout from Adrien Autry Its going to be fun as we see uh referee Lamar back in action Yeah good to see Lamar Simpson who went out at the 16minute mark got a little treatment Now as a gamer hes out there trying to give it a go Kayen Anthony earns another trip to the free throw line Foul on butter Johnson Well Syracuse shot the free throws in the first half Well 75 nine out of 12 Anthony made his two And so he heads back to the free throw line And uh all season long the Orange have been either at the bottom or near the bottom And you cant win basketball games consistently shooting at 59 No pardon youre not going to win the big ones So you want to try to nip this in the bud now Figure out who can figure out the best free throw routine because now coach Altry if you want to set up your 221 press you showed in the first half now you can set that up after making free throws Well we are sorry to say that Lamar Simpson our third official has again headed back to the locker room So it is a He just sat down the end of the bench there by Syracuse There he is Yep Hes moving slow Just Bill Cington and Eric Lewis officiating here in the second half Good ball movement Give it back to Godfrey Love the patience to find Butter Johnson for three Thats old school basketball when you get the ball in the post Two interior passes then you kick it out for three Big time shot by Butter The senior from Huntsville Alabama the UAB transfer makes it a 10point Clemson lead its largest of the afternoon Yeah once again Pardon We talk about Clemsons bigs Look at the interior passing by Godfrey Back to Godfrey and then you spray it out for a shooter Butter Johnson knocks it down And then Nate George has earned a trip to the free throw line Might he be the next Canadian NBA Orange man You got Chris Joseph Tyler Renis OShea Brassette your guy Leo routin Leo if youre listening I love you brother One of my favorite favorite people let alone Syracuse players the old school Big East Well we are not that far from the Canadian line it makes sense that a young man who played the last two years in Atlanta at your alma mater would want to get a little closer to home And so from Toronto down to Syracuse as long as its not snowing two feet in a day its not a bad drive If I could be transparent to our viewers I was like Nate no dont leave us day Coming closer to home being close to his family makes all the sense in the world Makes it easier for mom and dad and the whole family to come see Exactly Exactly Little pick and roll to Godfrey Couldnt handle the pass Syracuse basketball had a nice setup there Just couldnt execute cheering Get the ball into the hands of Donnie Freeman Hes fouled on the penetration nonshooting foul Second foul on Nick Davidson Fourth on Clemson here in the second half I like the way that possession was starting to go partner To your question earlier how do you get Freeman going I thought that little cross screen to get him a little ice was perfect And then hes going to be called for the foul Just discarding the defender that Davidson baited him perfectly Yes Yeah Davidson baited him in purpose And now were going to get a look to see after the common foul Donnie Freeman stays in the ball game for Syracuse Stling steps out defensively on Buckner Six to shoot Davidson creates a little space Puts up the three No Johnson got up there to keep the rebound alive but weve got a foul called against RJ Godfrey And he pleads his case to no avail Im not sure its a foul or not but I just think that Gar is so physical It looked like a foul laughter He could just look at me and I go flying Hey Betsy Starling Anthony Freeman and Suare The five on the floor No field goals as you see for the Orange in over five and a half minutes Johnson fights over the screen Freeman on the switch down to the block and hes got his first two in his return bowl game for Syracuse A sigh of relief Hes like Finally now let me go back to playing basketball Sophomore from DC makes it a sixpoint ball game Bucket what a finger roll and he is fouled at laughter first the physicality Buckner is doing a heck of a job with the ball pressure on Nate George But on the flip side of that partner its up to coach Archery to remind these guys ball movement The ball moves faster than the opponent So get that ball from one side of the floor to the other Thats how you get open shots Buckner gets one out of two and denies the fans here inside the dome with some free chicken It seems easy from the way you describe it Dennis Ball movement Why does it stick It seems like why not share the basketball Well sometimes this generation gets annoyed with handling over dribbling knowing that passing The call goes Syracuse his way as Donnie Freeman again You can see the frustration on his face and on his manner Yeah right here I thought Godfrey had it going That left foot was still moving as Freeman kind of threw his arms through the contact Three fouls now on Godfrey God said Come on Mr Ref Youre a bad call now Im about the game Yep laughter I love it Well thats the toughest call for the officials on a play like that It really is Freeman thought about it Davidson gave him some room Didnt take the three Heres Ken Anthony Freeman steps through gets to the rim and finishes Here cheering cheering we go Wine sets up his teammate Long rebound Clemsons got it Falling No And what was a 10point Clemson lead has been cut in half Syracuse with the ball Starling lost it Tell you what as a red shirt freshman Buckner is ready to play on both ends of the floor He really is I love it He really is His intensity the ball pressure People dont understand when you have good ball pressure on your point guard it takes the opponents out of their offense And you remember his daddy Greg Buckner ACC Rookie of the Year 31 years ago Tough tough as nails And here is his son Wears the same number 21 that his dad wore for Clemson He draws the foul Did he hear us talking about him partner He must have known He must have known I mean just look how hes under control He baits Nate Just that lean in good contact and finishes it Well this is a young man who was eyeing Indiana State before his recruiting took off Coach Brownell says of Ace Buckner hes the most competitive kid on the team Hard worker He came to Clemson a bit as a kid just a couple of times because of his dad but he was more of an NBA fan But he is so happy to be in that home environment at Clemson University You can see it You can really see it Look at the ball pressure once again by Clemson Good job defensively there by Davidson and Buckner Anthony steps through and lays it in Good job Under control Didnt force it A little bit like his Nay Smith Hall of Fame father Oh that looked definitely like daddy on that one sitting courtside as usual here at the dome Buckner looking to take over Freeman gets drilled and its the Tiger who is called for the foul but goes down holding his nose Number 22 Willing So its a one and one for Donnie Freeman Born in the Bahamas at the age of six his family moved to Washington DC He started St Johns College High School before going to IMG Academy A top 10 recruit who has made his return to the lineup And as you talked about D this Syracuse fan base has not gotten a chance to really see him in the last two years because of a couple of foot injuries Theyre getting a chance here today And thats whats so exciting about this young man because hes so dynamic so talented and can do so many different things on the floor Now hes seen a couple layups go in Now if he can knock down his second free throw I can see him finishing up the game strong Well he was so good the first four games of the year against big major opponents averaging 18 points Couple of 20 point games against Bingington and Delaware State He has Syracuse back within four cheering Here come that crowd partner Thats good way to quiet the crowd on the pick and roll Davidson right to the rim That was just excellent execution in the half court set for easy dunk Anthony looking to create eight William Kyle still scoreless today Yeah I didnt like that possession by Syracuse Everyone was standing around Freeman and Kai and Anthony couldnt figure out what they were doing Quickly inside Great position by Walling Freeman poked it away Itll be Clemson basketball Theres that action that Clemsons been working on all game long partner Good hands by Freeman JK huh Little physical once again Been a physical game And Freeman was trying to sell that That was off of Clemson but the Tigers keep it Extra pass Buckner missed the reverse Stling lobs and the slam by William Kyle the third A resounding first two points for the senior from Belleview Nebraska Weve got a fourpoint game Clemson meanwhile also has the number 41 patch on their home uniforms cheering to remember their alltime leading score Just under eight minutes remaining second half with former Georgia Tech Yellow Jacket and ACC player of the year Dennis Scott Im Doug Sherman So glad youre with us on this New Years Eve for what has been a highly competitive and entertaining ball game Very competitive game And I think coach Autry is trying to figure out now How do I close out this ball game What is my best lineup Sadique cheering hasnt played a lot tonight So I think thats one of the things you have to figure out with Donnie Freeman back in the mix Freeman currently on the bench Stling with the basketball Makes a bad pass Pucked away by Godfrey like hes a defensive back for Davos Sweeney cheering Welling dribble handoff Porter has had a quiet game Feet inside Godfrey Tyler Betsy And that call goes to Syracuse No foul call Godfrey tried to throw it off of Betsy He did but hes called out of bounds Betsy Im super proud He handled the physicality from Godfrey Godfreyys been doing whatever he wants Look watch this He jumps No Im holding ground and the ball He steps out of bounds Thats big time defense by Betsy Betsys every bit of 68 225 known as a shooter but you see the physical side You needed that right there Thats confidence from your teammates Here he is coming off the screen Back into the hands of the point guard Nate George cheering Drive and dish Stling from the corner Long rebound Kings is going to be called for going over the back of Dylan Hunter That was a perfect possession by Nate George Attack the paint Spray out for shooters Stling just missed a wide open three Number one Kings has done a nice job this year at 65 rebounding the basketball but he gets called for the over the back Thats his third personal Hell stay in the game with under seven minutes to go Seven minutes to go Freemans back in for Betsy We just we just got finished talking about how does coach Ary figure out his closing lineup Welling denied Its another block shot for Kyler runs the other way George in transition to Starling Kyle goes back over his left shoulder Tough shot Nice job to stand tall by Carter Welling Yeah Kyle has to understand thats not what he does best kick straight that back out and get a good shot on the pick and roll Godfreyys got the basketball He and Freeman banging again Its Godfrey who wins that matchup All game long taking his time attacking the paint Remember two years ago he was a key piece on that Elite 8 Clemson team Now we are seeing more today why he is one of the dudes for the Tigers in 2526 Yeah right here in the post under control Footwork step through the double team and finishes But now the next play down partner Syracuse is cutting back door He stuck his shoulder out Four five now hes back on the bench So for Clemson youve got to adjust as you lose your leading score on the day for at least the next couple of minutes I would assume until the under four He has to be smarter than that Youre the key piece to closing out this ball game You cannot have a silly foul like that late in the game Oh one of our microphones picked up someone yelling at the official Im assuming it was one of the players although Im not sure Yeah Im not sure either Kyle with that unorthodox motion able to get the first And you see the frustration on RJ Godfreyys face catching his breath He will be back in and have a key role in who wins this ball game Two for two William Kyle the third cheering and applause cheering Justin Porter draws a crowd out to Hunter for three Good job Porter Not losing his balance He almost traveled Kicks out to the shooter He just drew three defenders and found the open man Yes And Hunter the senior from Atlanta is ready for his moment Back to a sevenpoint lead Freeman for three The rest is off partner That was a catch and shoot three Ive been there before All nine of his points have come since the break 97 rebounds for Freeman cheering Three to shoot Another cheering killer shot from Dylan Hunter Thats a back breaker Thats a big back breaker The defense was solid Just better offense Well when Dylan Hunter plays for Clemson they are a different team Hes dealt with injuries but Clemson has won 18 of its last 20 games that he has played And in their last 42 Dennis as Clemson has the takeaway with Dylan Hutter in the lineup Clemson is 34 and eight We call that impacting winning Hes a winner cheering Do you go back to number two Here he is with the basketball He feeds the post cheering again The shot clock down to three Got a good look but the jump hook by Welling was off the mark Good contest by Kyle without fouling Nathan George off the back iron One and done for Syracuse I dont like that I dont like that at all Nate we know youre better than that Put some pressure on that defense and tack and draw and kick like you did earlier for a wide open shot Timeout called by the Tigers music and we will take a break Well sometimes you share the ball you find the right hot hand Freeman Ive been there before Step into it I like the way hes walking Im a little nervous Just back from a foot injury is Freeman Number one in white playing defense inside He has been extremely physical this afternoon Another layup or dunk after a timeout Dylan Turner Dylan Hunter the recipient this time And Clemson has made a living coming out of timeouts thanks to coach Brownell Unbelievable Freeman tried to shape up on the block Davidson going to be called for the foul Well look at the spacing right here partner Back cut miscommunication Donnie doesnt call it out Porter gets a wide open layup Yep You got to communicate on defense Great defensive teams are loud You can hear one another Bad defensive team you cannot hear one another And is it just me or do college players nowadays not talk as much as they used to on defense You hit it right on the head partner Today this generation is trying to be too cool If you want to be cool let the other team let the fans hear you scream out the plays back door cut help scream help the helper All those defensive sayings you have to say loud and clear Freeman makes a pair of free throws to draw the Orange back within seven cheering How does Clemson handle the fullourt pressure Got five to get it across and they do Godfrey back in the game playing with those four personal fouls You heard Coach Monero same play Run it again cheering Out of the horn set Ball gets back to Hunter He had it poked away No he just lost it on his own So its an over and back violation to give it back to the Orange By that time Syracuse matched the physicality in that half court set to get the turnover Carter Welling checks back in replacing Nick Davidson cheering cheering And itll be JJ Stling to inbound over by the Syracuse bench cheering Good defensive pressure by Buddy Johnson Freeman tries again Got it again cheering What a second half for the sophomore Its safe to say partner the rust is off now Took 20 minutes but there is no rust anymore on Donnie Freeman cheering Porter goes right to the basket and lays it in Well thats how you break a press More passes less dribble and get a layup And I thought it was subtle but did he did he look the defender off Yes Here goes Freeman again And he is fouled again The 10th team foul against the Tigers Fourth foul on Dylan Hunter So your two seniors your leaders Dylan Hunter RJ Godfrey both with four Now how do you play disciplined basketball now this minute 53 left here in the ball game at the line for two shots Donnie Freeman Well theres the story for Donnie Freeman Came in averaging 18 points per game from having played the first four games of the regular season Now back off with a foot injury Has come to life in the second half That also helps Syracuses free throw difficulties Hes one of their better free throw shooters and he wants to go to the line Correct Thats the different part wanting to get fouled to get to the line and shoot the ball with confidence Now 20 of 24 for a team that has shot 59 coming in 57 Clemson cant shake Syracuse cheering Stling and Hutter came together and its Hutter holding his face Lets take another look Gerrick Lewis the official saw it cheering Yep Porter again and again able to finish over the big man Oh for all you little guys out there thats how you go attack the shot blocker The person is going away from the shot blocker They say Porter 61 Not so sure Hey he has some bounce in that one He sure does Nate George from the midrange Back to a fourpoint game A minute 27 to go cheering 5sec violation applause cheering Butter Johnson is pleading his case and cannot believe that the official said he was holding the ball for 5 seconds Yeah thats a tough call right there cheering cheering Crowds into it partner cheering Im not sure coach Brownell was sold on the explanation Clemson gets it right back Gets it right back Paul dont lie Hey Rashid Wallace is smiling somewhere laughter cheering So now the Tigers in no hurry with just over a minute left in regulation cheering Johnson gives it up Three to shoot Clemsons cheering got to go Hunter recognizes Did he beat the buzzer He did not Its another turnover forced by the Orange cheering And again we are playing this second half with only two officials as Lamar Simpson left with what appeared to be some sort of leg injury So Bill Cington and Eric Lewis doing it like in the old days just the two of them So theyre checking a potential clock issue Yeah So if youre Syracuse here Dennis where do you go offensively To Donnie That simple Where Right in the mid post He thats where he works best at the threes that hes made Its been out of the flow of the offense pick and pop threes So youre not chasing that Get him the ball in that mid post and let him go to work Fourpoint ball game And youre okay with him on a pick and pop You wouldnt rather have him pick and roll Well if hes rolling its in that mid area cuz I Donnie wants to catch the ball and then attack versus a lot of big guys want to catch it and finish at the rim Donnys the other way So it looks like Freeman will be the inbound man Theyve got the clock set at 51 seconds Freeman into George Here we go Freeman to the basket off the assist from George Syracuse wants a timeout as well So we have a one one two one press or are they being a little koi matchup No one on the ball Johnson gets it in cheering and here comes Justin Porter cheering Kings defensively on Dylan Hunter cheering cheering Hunter going to work down the lane to the right hand and slaughtered out of the air by William Kyle 43 remaining on the shot clock Get that shot Bound man will be Dylan Hunter cheering He cannot run the baseline Hes got to stay put to get the ball in cheering and applause cheering Hunter gets it in Blocked shot by Freeman but the whistle says a foul against Syracuse Bodies were flying on the inbound and the Tigers will get a couple of free throws Right on Q point I knew a back screen was coming Cal got hit with that back screen He falls to the ground And for a second I thought Donnie had all ball but I think he might have got a little wrist And on the replay it looked to me like he got some arm there And so Carter Welling a 65 free throw shooter will shoot two cheering cheering He is now three for four today And a big one here Could make it a twop possession game Wallen returns for Clemson and out goes Godfrey cheering Go go go cheering 17 Welling left it short Syracuse can tie it with a three George to Freeman Hes had the hot hand Long rebound George tries to save and does but its Tigers basketball and CLEMSON CAN RUN IT OUT A whistle at the buzzer The foul is called so the games not over yet But it certainly appears that Clemson will get out of snowy Syracuse with a victory Yes if it is a foul it might be what 01 maybe 2 left Not a lot of time if they call it but it or it might be over Lets see before that Good hustle by Nate George and point Yeah it certainly looks like theyre going to put a fraction of a second back on Well when we get done here we will send you to North music Texas and Memphis but we have two ten of a second to go You see on Adrien Audreys face what might have been Jake Wallen the junior from Provo Utah at the free throw line cheering and applause and theres your ball game What a fun way to start the ACC regular season Clemson comes to Syracuse and survives Big time offense down the stretch for Clemson Execution the back
