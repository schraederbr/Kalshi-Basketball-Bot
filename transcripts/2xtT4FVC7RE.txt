certainly this is the start of a new season of ACC basketball and its great to have you with us here on the CW Bill Covington Jr flips it up nor Chad omir wins the tip Nigel Pat begins this first possession for Music Miami this is wga popper he has ascended considerably in his role in his production sh clock under 10 and omir travels good defensive possession there for Notre Dame Kevin being disciplined understanding omir especially from 15 out will try that rip through and try and attack the rim moved well laterally I think omir believed he had beat him but the consistency defensively with position generates the turnover fair to say these two teams have different ideas in terms of the pace they want to play today yeah right now just different skill sets more Talent on Miami side Miami likes to play fast they want to track me booking out Opera in the half court meanwhile Irish want to dictate Tempo limited and their margin for error incredibly slim to clock under five as Burton fires and its in and out but on the offensive glass Davis Keeps The Possession alive thats where it say Davis could really have an impact for this group as a slasher Defender and generating Second Chance opportunities as the shot slowly starts to come to the corner kesn Music Applause connects three nothing Irish courtesy of Jr kesn on the way by Bensley Joseph took a shot to the face no whistle nor Chad oir expanding his game thats his fifth three of the season and and that was by Design in the offseason coach L said I want you hunting that three when it presents itself Kevin has to have an awareness of guarding out there cuz clearly omir proving it dangerous six career career threes for omir before this season thats his fifth of the short campaign as the Irish turn it over on their second possession but back on the first possession they got a couple chances and the South bed native delivered and kesn a beautiful story in talk with Coach Shrewsberry before the game he said Jr said to me coach I just appreciate you believing in me and the belief leads to moments like that uh here dont want to see two moments like that if youre an Irish fan Marcus Burton kind of forcing the issue on the Baseline going airborne with that one heres wuga midrange money it is the best midrange jump shot to heck with anybody who says cornets go a hyperbole hyperbole this early hes got the best pullup Jumper in all college basketball its a its so much fun to watch the repetition pay off for an incredible Talent like WAP and Lena Compares him to rip Hamilton and you can see that when you watch him play just so steady so consistent again the shot clock under 10 good ball movement Davis straight away rebound deflected to Kevin jaai and kevs putback wont go third chance Davis scores what the Irish will do for 40 minutes under coach Micah Shrewsberry they will compete they are winning the 5050s early on giving their offense one that get stuck in third gear a chance here early good quick hands ji knocks it away Julian rooper the second gets it back to Burton and now kesn J Lena was frustrated on Tuesday that on the Kentucky Wildcats first possession of the game multiple offensive rebounds led to a second chance three kind of a similar story so far today Lenas had to watch right in front of him again the shot clock winding down Burt creates to the corner kesn again Burton a cool customer with the shot clock winding down a couple probing dribbles suck that defense like a vacuum kick out to kesn who was feeling it here in South Florida the early recipe for an upset get some stops hit some threes and get some confidence all those things lead to that early on a belief you belong against one of the nations top teams no good for Nigel pack kesn feeling it rebounded by pack Nigel scored only two points on Tuesday sets up omir again short this time Davis another rebound K Davis Coast to Coast Up and Under draws the foul and thatll take us to our first timeout four minutes in strong start for Notre Dame Ill tell you Evan its always a pretty scene when youre in South Florida pretty people sun shining but sometimes its the grit that prevails Irish working on the backboard Davis plus two earning it ear now the head coach at Temple its a its a tight connection between these two coaching staffs and a great deal of respect between the two uh the sentiment echoed by both here pregame uh youd love to see that also coach Shrewsberry looking pretty good in the soup maybe we try to add that back to the sideline no hes comfortable and cool in the pullover like most coaches nowadays uh kind of relaxed outfits no true to the rumor that CW stands for casual wear but feeling good in our CW Sports polos here Courtside Im Im comfortable man are you kidding me a noon tip early start with some basketball to collared shirt next to you Evan life is good count the blessings and a good start for the Irish in the opening four minutes they lead 105 theyve got off to a good start in Columbia on Tuesday as well L eight nothing against the game Cox Lamont pariss team was the tougher team down the stretch just made plays offensively with the Irish couple turnovers couple misls but defensively right now the Irish have been properly placed defensively and its frustrating this Miami team Miami wants to gain more of a rhythm speed this game up a little bit Irish in firm control dictating temp what do you make of these Miami miscues they taking four field goal attempts theyve turned it over three times a no tip Evan it is Paramount that you come out ready to compete right away I do not see that from Miami in the first five minutes Roper tough move cant finish loose ball find benley Joseph sets up Nigel pack res not falling early that pack EV that happened right in front of us Nigel pack kind of struggled to collect the basketball before offering up the D3 and I think that inability to get his hands on it led to the Applause Music Applause Miss wait from the ball Bill Covington Jr has the foul against Burton its his first big emphasis from the Irish is their ability to screen a body to give their teammates an opportunity on a catch to make a play Burton a little bit overzealous trying to carve out that real estate and set that screen right call from an elite officiating crew yep just the second foul call of the game popper picked up the first right before the time out head to the Davis free throws Nigel trying to create off the dribble Poler back outside to shoot Miami two for five early not new Clevelands first look its good cerebral move from Cleveland on the catch off the drive from pack gets the defense in rotations Cleveland able to attack a close out one of the 11 intra conference conference transfers from the ACC last year to this year strange Dynamic not see him in sein Old colors nice move by Tate Davis going Baseline hes got six thats what Davis is at his best being a cutter or attacking the rim playing downhill playing to your strengths for an Irish team that is not as talented as Miami you neutralize the game if everybody plays their role and stays within what they do popper puts it in for three and steel Joseph to the slashing Cleveland and a foul on noted ases Julian rooper unforced errors from the Irish cant have that against this talented Miami team but take a look pack draws three Defenders gets the Irish in rotation Burton on the close out easy money for Matthew Cleveland Cleveland rocks here on the other side wga popper popular popular for a reason because the Dude doesnt miss efficient from Beyond The Arc cuz he takes good ones shoot better than 50 feel like he had an off night on Tuesday and he finished seven for 13 you know for him it was there were moments in that game where he was playing so fast so amped up to be in rup Arena on that stage versus Kentucky and it really showed and talking with Coach L about the free throws typically hes automatic there as well missed some because he was so sped up running off Applause adrenaline new free throws for Cleveland were tied at 12 and another unforced turnover Burtons giveaway leads to the Cleveland stuff Irish have controled the first seven minutes of this game two unforgivable turnovers and Miami has made them pay theyve got some juice theyve got some life and theyve got those run outs seven straight points for the canes to take the lead kzne goes off the bounce this time missed the layup and a late whistle from Ted Valentine going to go against Matt Cleveland Marcus Burton here thats just an unforced error and Matthew Cleveland there to take it away and punctuate with the twohand jelly on the other end Davis did a good job of just laying up you dont want to foul there and compound the mistake thats what Cleveland does hes long hes athletic and he can take that thing in charge on his own let me ask you this at one point in your life you were a freshman playing Big Time college basketball I dont believe you had the responsibility on your shoulders that Marcus Burton does just say I was talented you can that way to EV its accurate I mean I wasnt nearly as good so yes I didnt have that responsibility but I did have those type of mistakes which are careless ones you got to be better with the basketball because heres the deal the Irish are not as good as Miami said that several times here early on which means their margin for error is so very slim moments like that cant happen our Miami will take control and Miami will run away with this moment would you talk to yourself after a mistake try to pump yourself up how would that work Id be sitting there on the bench and Coach Bray saying your times done here for a little bit sit and think about it maybe well put you back in the game well coach cruy doesnt have that that dep Bensley Joseph with a rainbow Music triple Miami is now three for five from Deep kanes have made their last four field goal attempts Logan hes into the game raen strwberry as well coaches old his son Burton back to work Marcus Burton to the corner couple teammates there kesn takes charge comes up short Miami starting to speed up and play fast and this is what they want all the way to the basket Christian Watson doesnt get it to go though and here comes burn the other way rise in fire not there I talk about being sped up you were seeing it it is right in front of you with Marcus Pon he is playing entirely too fast to his detriment nice attack cant find the range hes over for three do have a pair of assists though Irish want to pull back the rign control Tempo a little bit more for them to control that they have to score the ball so this Miami team cant take it off the glass or turn you over and run hesitation move truberry kicks it extra pass for Imes and a good block out from omir the foul going against kevi the Hurricanes loaded with Talent so much offensive Weaponry Bley Joseph Sublime from run in the games first 8 minutes this afternoon Miami fans glad to see their cans back home after the stumble in Lexington Kentucky on Tuesday we were talking about it with Jim Lena and you said apley it was a really competitive first half man Miami made a run put a scare into coach Cs team in the second half Kentucky just got real hot yeah like all great coaches one they are quick to correct the for former player and Coach El said I didnt even really like the first half I thought there was things that were uncharacteristic of what we did yes it was competitive but we werent physical enough there are some fouls that took us out of what we do and we could have been better theyre starting to gain that Rhythm here a little bit later than coach would desire but starting to look like the Kan again in this last stretch Michael noo his first shot right off the bench does not convert hes will run the offense here for Notre Dame booth on the floor for the first time 6 10 big man from Colorado inside rebound deflected and it will be Miami ball Marcus Burton so far today 0 for two does have two assists one turnover he he struggled with those slow starts plagued him in game for South Carolina as well look his usage is as high as any in the ACC so hes everything to the Irish we going look to get him activated theyre going to need his productivity offensively its this High powerered unit that the canes provide Joseph Cross Lane B noo cant connect PNE did a good job of Walling off staying vertical on the offering from noo shuberry contested three goes Nobody is in the gym and works harder than Braden Shrewsberry no surprise he is the son of Molly and Micah Shrewsberry this guy shots going to come and as it does the Irish will become more Dynamic not sure how that one didnt go in but shuberry comes up with a loose ball rebound four four for 24 out of the gates to start the season hes becoming more confident is BR Shrewsberry look he wants it gets it right back not bashful now one for three rebound Cleveland those are shots you want from one of your Sharpshooters Cleveland spots up Miami doesnt want to think about the shot clock before Brad Shrewsberry was in the game Notre Dame was consistently taking it under 10 and theyll get back to that I mean this is a group that is deliberate in what they do in the half court setting the Irish run a lot of sets challenge the patience and the discipline of the opposition defensively tough shot Booth with a hand in his face Irish get clean looks from three its been a theme All Season just seem to convert them consistently but the offense is proven coach rusy is drawing up the stuff to give him the looks got a puncture two teams have gone cold Miami turns it over theyre drought nearly four minutes now Iris just won for their last eight at the offensive Applause end Cru Berry through the booth screen kzne to IMS Applause Roper to the basket tested well by Joseph can you remove the lids Evan on both sides good looks nothing going youre the 68 guy thats your job J another turnover from the Hurricanes CLA doesnt let his emotions get the better of him but you can see him stewing on the hurricane bench a little bit some uncharacteristic mistakes and I tell you what I I sense this coming noon games for 18 and 22 year olds you never know what youre going to get well teams were hot early they have gone cold nearly 5 minutes since Miamis last points and great defense kesn swats George from behind Sean George talented freshman from Switzerland and theres the first bucket in a while courtesy of Christian Watson whos coming off his best scoring game of his Miami career on Tuesday at Kentucky tell The Confident offering there Shrewsberry in good position Elite job of Watson to create some separation to offer up the jump shot from the midrange George sharing Down Eyes defensively Balls got to move for the Irish to have a chance not a lot of guys who can break it down off the Applause bouns boo sets up strwberry pretty good look and puts it Applause in Shrewsberry injecting some life offensively for this group hunting his coming in understanding hes a Hired Gun for distance hes taking his shots six points in six minutes two threes Off the Bench for Applause Braden George crosscourt Joseph from the corner and a foul in pursuit of the long rebound its going against against Logan Imes and its stay with Miami we get ourselves episode of pen and Teller foola starring pen Gillette teller and new host Brook Fridays 87 Central only on the CW I think we should do the pen and Teller move and start dressing head to toe like each other same size differential sounds like youre just trying to get me to shut up I mean I do talk to Lot K doesnt yes yes you dont have to pay off the joke everyone knows those guys are awesome awesome legends staying power and entertainment difficult speaking of Legends 730 wins 82 win Seasons here in Miami backto back Elite eight the final four Banner hanging prominently here at the watsco center in a top 10 ranking for this Miami team they theyve actually set a School record for consecutive weeks in the AP Top 25 this is the 18th straight week at the Advantage ja fell and he didnt offer that thing up to the rip better look Kean George knocks it down Kean George a true diamond in the rough recruit from a staff that works their tail off at Miami a top 200 guy hes got prole skills an incredibly high ceiling cerebral with his approach and can score from all three levels coach called him a young cap whos still figuring out his body but is incredibly talented hes grown a few inches since he got to camp they saying sh clock winding down Burton tries to create sets up drewberry rebound finds wga offler a couple buckets early two field goal attempts though P looking for some offense and he finds him from the corner all starts by George pushing it with the burst Marcus Burton disinterested in getting it a stance and so the blow by from George creates the breakdown in the defense collapses in the painted area kick out to pack from Baseline who dials it in for the threepiece number largest lead so far for Miami under six minutes to play here in the first half BT to the corner ke chai way off from the wing Here Comes pack in his career game against his old school and he sets up a slashing nadir for the loud two hand finish such a connected Miami group offensively they can make you pay and make you pay quickly they score in bunches everybody talented playing well off each other how about the cutting ability from omir to get it going now check it out here George Burton not down in The Stance of guard so then he draws three Defenders now its too late for Shrewsberry to have any chance to get out there and Nigel pack deadly from distance makes them pay if you get this Miami team an opportunity give them however ever an ability to run out for early offense you cant keep up 80 run in the last 84 seconds this was the fourth assist of the game so far for pack yeah the cutting nadir ball gets driven Baseline and he plays off it seamlessly pack delivers it in the finishing ability from omir pretty impressive stuff all five starters average double figur so there is nobody who doesnt know what theyre doing with the ball we dont talk enough about the good hair on this team I mean they they got some lettuce up there thats pretty sharp I appreciate good hair its been a its been a uh a Reawakening of sorts for me I used to have the Baldi growing the hair find a lot of power in it so I get why this Miami team is dangerous I was clamoring for a one shot there we didnt have it we got to get through game its okay yeah maybe later no heres not in a good spot M Dame at an early fivepoint lead now trailing by seven J lost his balance lost possession TR too focus on the contact that was never coming needs to worry about just offering it up to the rim defense just kind of let him hurt himself pralis by analysis po trying to create ends up turning it over and then he nearly steals it back and it will be Miami ball these are the unforce errors that will drive coach shuberry crazy Imes gathers the ball possess it get it to your guy and go no dont try and be a hero turn over in the back court those were devastating as I it coach rubbery not happy with that sequence understandably Applause so under five minutes now in this first half ACC opener Ted Valentine wants everybody to calm down heard say thats on you zero he also said Teddy V Mr Valen time one of the best officials in the game longevity proves it said no wrestling in the post hes trying to police that earling y who trying to defend a much more muscular older omir who has the advantage on that low block you dont often see a coach piss Punk the lead official who just caught a foul on his team thats just what happened with mik crry and Ted Valentine I I see you teddy good call keep it clean neither of these teams love their debt so both would want to play with their top units as much as possible andne trapped in the corner needs help throws it away ball stuck for too long put him in a bad spot AJ Casey all the way business decision made there by Burton defensively again understanding the margin Fair are so slim for the Irish you cannot turn the ball over let alone pick sixes dribble that thing into a bad spot kesn put that upon himself 10 nothing run for Miami who will answer for Notre Dame offensively Carri boo tries cant do it popler the rebound here come the kanes popler to the basket like a gazelle so long so smooth we celebrated the midrange early on but make no mistake three score comfortable putting it on the deck and finishing amongst the trees in traffic because of that length of athleticism HTH inside this time hangs in the air through the contact and has a chance for the threepoint play man did Notre Dame need that big time move from booth and they needed it but here kesn dribbles into no mans land and on the other end and easy two for a run out for the canes and AJ Casey but Carri boo creating Financial Security for more than 150 years this Duo has been Dynamic just as we expected yeah Evan we talked about a pregame paying it off seamlessly here Cleveland with the gift and he turns it into two the other way and wga popper has not missed on the court yet however brayon Shrewsberry injecting some life into this Irish offense hunting his threepoint shot hes knocked down a pair of timely triples what was your first reaction when you learned that Matthew Cleveland was going to transfer to Miami uh that the rich are getting richer uh so much talent already returning for Miami but I also couch that by saying they lost two huge pieces Jordan Miller as fun to watch as anybody in college basketball because he checked so many boxes that Isaiah Wong was so gifted with the ball you needed some more productivity insert a guy from Florida who by the way in a game I did last year 24 Point comeback for Florida State Matthew Cleveland hits a big time shot in a game winner now here he is a Kan popper with the miss his first Miss of the game made his first three theres a balance between Mich crusy letting his team play freely and keeping them in control and running their stuff Marcus Burton would love to get going carry boo sets up Burton again off the offensive board I mean Burton is getting good looks from three all season long hes a 40 threepoint shooter in high school like its going to come consistently just hasnt yet yet today either Davis too strong ohir pulls it down second board for nor Chad deep three popper cant connect it was halfway down though when you take shots like that I always look over to the coach no reaction from coach l means in the confines of what they do as talented as popler is its an okay shot got the green light canne way off he made two early oxygen lost the range hurricanes by nine pack kicks it omir puts his head down and kicks it back out for Casey omir versus booth give me that too easy before the catch carved out that reel State loitering on the low block NORAD omir in Easy Deuce hes a really fun guy to watch play basketball his size his strength his bullant personality no good for Burton again offensive board will keep it with Notre Dame coming up on the Subaru halftime report you will hear from the all long time Syracuse leader Jim beheim hell chat with Tom wormy about the state of ACC basketball and how hes fairing post 47 years on the sideline leading his Al I was back during the Big East a but I still have nightmares from his National Championship 2003 team with GMAC melow and those guys we had some battles they won the majority of them underrated though is coach beon sense of humor and I look forward to him joining the media never thought it would happen in this world but here we are I mean hes got a meticulous basketball mind half a century on the sidelines the memories the knowledge the stories its going to be interesting if you dont get smarter listening to him talk about the game you have no hope of learning basketball there was a time when Jima took a Bowling Green Team to play Jim beheim Syracuse team Lenas suit was left on the bus he had his assistant call one of the Syracuse staffers to to get one of Jim beheim clothes cuz theyre about the same size he needed to get something to wear on the sidelines during the days that they were suits Burtons first bucket much needed for Notre Dame this game in a lot of ways mirrors Burtons first half start in South Carolina couldnt really get going from the field and the Irish sorely sorely need his productivity offense Shrewsberry wants an offensive foul and hes going to get it number one number two no its number one on benley excuse me thats playing chess Marcus Burn only a freshman but really thinking and high IQ guy understanding Joseph a little bit more Burley at the position was going to bang around lowers the boom and fantastic defensive anticipation offering his body up to the basketball guys CH clock off Michel shuberry looking for one shot here to finish the half Irish have shot just 27 are within nine 7 Applause Seconds chai will stay with Notre Dame 1 second to go what Baseline out of bounds have they been practicing to run with a second left I mean you have an opportunity for a catch and shooter has to be a quick trigger but you also have something at The Rim maybe a screen the screener here but I imagine they try to get Shrewsberry a look for three Burton throws it high Davis lays it in at the buzzer what a finish for the Irish credit coach Micah shrewbury for two points 20 minutes back on the clock second half is underway Notre Dame trailing 3326 on the road here at the watsco center Miami trying to bounce back after a stumble in Lexington Kentucky on Music Tuesday Jordan you had a chance to catch up with one of the Irish assistants what was the message uh keep fighting keep competing like you are defensively dont change the thing keep fighting on the back back forward offensively couple of tweaks in terms of moving the basketball shots will start to fall but they feel pretty good about the spot theyre currently in at the break and a loose ball foul on Poler going to wave off the main three right after the whistle number two on wga shot clock back to 24 Notre Dame Irish will inevitably look to get more touches down low to Kei when things get sped up everybody in game understands just slow it down by playing through the post ja as he starts to gain his rhythm get his conditioning back coming off that wrist injury hoping to see some of those shots fall if youre an Irish fan no question EV Joseph just cancels Marcus Burtons pass tended for the Post Notre Dame has a winning record all time here in Miami theyve won their last two trips down to South Florida last win a fourpoint win exactly 22 months ago on 2222 February 2nd 2022 exactly 22 months ago some would call it lucky if youre on the Notre D side on the Miami side they may say something a little different the clock winding down ji needs to fire omir pulls down the rebound the J from these last few games has been right Point BL range the ball just refuses to go in for the big fell hes fighting for that position hes battling cannot seem to punctu over for seven on Tuesday at South Carolina iss over for four tonight Nigel pack with the midrange very easy ton of space you cant give it to such a skilled offensive performer like pack whos able to comfortably step into the Music pullup five points for Pat lead back up to nine Irish blitzing the handle ONN Burton which means theres Advantage at the swing it they do good recovery from the canes defensive again the clock winding down Davis with three gets to the cut scores Davis on the catch knew exactly what he wanted to do rip through burst to the rim and finish gathered played off two impressive move but thinking it before the catch gave him the advantage Tay Davis in double figures for just the Third time this season second straight game though he had 15 against South Carolina pack for omir Up and Under well done thats just beautiful twoman basketball operating off the screen and roll in that sequence the PR pack probing dribbles waits for the defense to commit what it does delivers to his big man who gathers and finishes those two guys arriving Lenas program at the same time markas state State respectively hanging in the air and baking it in Julian rooper the second with his first two of the day Roper allowing physicality to Prevail didnt force it once the defense bounc bounced off collected and then went at The Rim in attack mode the Irish not backing down from Miami most certainly in those rugged painted area positions in place pack puts his defender on the popcorn popper and switches the three kanes apply so much pressure offensively because theyre so dag on talented with the basketball you got to guard these guys oneonone they can overwhelm you pack starting to do that here in the second Stan agile two for three from Deep Bert explodes to the rim past omir and lays it in Little Euro little flavor little sauce on that thing Marcus Burt giving you a taste of the talent more CH was ready to is swatted but couldnt get there in time pack weve seen him get hot when he does look out his pass deflected by Davis stolen by KES taking it himself got omir in the air passed up the layup can rooper hit the three no but Davis keeps it alive and omir how is that not a whistle ton of contact down low when Davis gathers a ton now what what I do believe is AJ I thought he traveled before he laid it in where there was contact I think the checks and balances checked out in AJs mind thats only my guess because it did look like Davis traveled before he was found you fell on top of him too benley Joseph comes up short and were going to get ourselves a timeout just over four minutes gone here in the second half and the Irish continue to hang around Miami 40 Notre Dame 34 here on an AC Courtside Saturday cring its next Wednesday December 13th only on the CW you can catch up before the finale

entertaining as the kiss cam here Coral Gables if so enjoy Music America phomen 2023 he hat tip to the crew here the job they do a lot of work goes into these Lena has talked about how the atmosphere in this building has changed Through The Years through the success that this program has had you know the ACC has won 21 games in the NCAA tournament over the past two years as a conference a third of those NCAA tournament wins from Jimmy Ls Music hurricanes yeah they chams went a long way in changing The Narrative of what this conference was with their postseason run last season taking them all the way to the final four hes done just remarkable things here his 13 Seasons Aaron pass stolen by Cleveland outlet for wga look out wga popper Straight No Chaser coach El calls him the most athletic guy hes ever coached think about that illustrious career then think about the extra step on that mans ladder in the open floor oh baby defant grab it different than anybody else I forgotten about the kiss Camp Davis the miss poppler the board kanes by eight looking to extend the lead they say the dunkers only worth two points thats blasphemous it creates a juice and an energy for your team that is infectious and gets them going especially this Miami team bookmark that play and see what it projects to for these guys moving forward deflected out of bounds heres your second look wga elevating off the turnover theres turnovers and theres pick sixes they could be devastating wga popper Ill take that thing all the way to the bank and Ill deposit two and back to live action Nigel pack for three KES by Applause 11 tell you those those those dunks at that level and that execution gets the people going Miami shooting 58 from three two for two since halftime B in the air wont get the shot to fall Cleveland the other way FSU transfer creates contact and will earn a pair for Miami and the Leer what is he doing up here what is he doing hes an alien def find gravity indeed something about the air maybe out here in South Florida but its done wonders the Philly guy in popper Up Up and Away are you saying that if you played your college ball down here you would have flown like that I go back in I revise history all the time so yeah that that checks out that tracks Kean George another young athletic dude Switzerland he enjoying life down here in Coral Gables check checked the weather in Monte Switzerland last night it was mid30s and snowing a little bit different here might be flying back to that in Connecticut have to go all the way to Switzerland to find that see you live in a Carolina so you you only have to worry about that ever so often but whats like to think about that here in South Flor its been cold this past week but compared to South Bend has been bombing BT is Shaka his hometown Indiana kid chai lost the handle on the way up but the whistle well get him a couple free throws the foul is on nor Chad omir but is just the first for nor Chad today Tuesday coming up on inside the NFL guys will take a look back at the Battle for NFC Supremacy what a game this is going to be the 49ers and the Eagles this weekend plus can the Broncos stay hot against the Texans sneaky good game between Denver and Houston Inside the NFL theyll recap it all Tuesday 87 Central on the CW playing through Kevin J down low its needed for the Irish especially when the game has those moments and sequences where they feel a little turbulent you get a touch to your guy and have him go earn a few at the free throw line and also Peg a foul on nor Shadow oir those things matter for an Irish team looking to call back from a double figure deficit how do you think Michael Shrewsberry is feeling about his team right now down 10 13 and 1 half to play he likes it theyre still within Striking Distance and what I hes told me about his team time and time again he loves to fight the resiliency of this group they continue oh what a shot Matthew Cleveland acrobatic finish good action good cutting action allowing for an easy lay in this group plays so well and so connected together thats what makes them so Fierce offense Notre Dame needs to score they need to answer kzn doubled finds the open man jaai slams it home Applause chais done a good job of being that receiver in the painted area hes been aggressive in adamant about catching and attacking thats exactly what he needed too after a stretch where he missed what 10 11 12 consecutive shots see if that opens the door for ji to get going up shot I dont like that one from from popper just because of how awkward the catch was you didnt catch in good enough for to go ahead and take the shot swing that thing and pursue a better one he had made it would you supp said you didnt like it yeah but he didnt make it everybody nobody cares what youre doing unless youre doing what youre not supposed to be doing that makes sense Roper into the crowd too strong good contest from The Freshman George all the way Cleveland draws more contact I andan its a different color jersey from Matthew Cleveland but similar game for the slippery athlete from Atlanta 670s is so long now here again pack draws a couple Defenders and and the true skill to cutting is once you catch helps side look Shrewsberry looking at the ball not watching his man dont watch me watch TV easy laying with the off hand actually Cleveland to double figures for the sixth time in seven Music games these scoring wols have plagued the Irish in their losses when youre going against a team that is unrelenting in their ability to light up a scoreboard like Miami if you start chasing points on the scoreboard with them youll find yourself left in the dust and quickly one and two at the line for Applause Cleveland again we ask the question who will answer for not today Davis has been the hot hand most of the day Shrewsberry for three not this time rebound Watson P six assist so far today most since the season opener when he had nine omir draws Defenders kicks it Watson comes up way off shuberry leads the break all the way good quick hand slapped it away packed with the defense and well get ourselves of the ACC and look in October when the media votes no one knows about Marcus Burton or t Davis or what raen Shrewsberry is going to be in college how about this 98 of the scoring for the Irish gone 97 of the assists gone 983 of the scoring that was gone but you were just rounding it of the rebounding gone 100 of the starts gone you expect to be at the bottom but its the journey and growing and theyve got the right man of Coach Michael Shrewsberry as for Miami they return a lot of key pieces to that run from a year ago so those two aely placed I will say this watch out for Clemson big win on the road at Alabama have a carry Booth of fak it and a take it and a big slam into the bucket for the Freshman from Englewood Colorado gets it from his daddy Calvin nobody has a higher ceiling in terms of their ability than carry booth bad pass by omir Shrewsberry going one on two smacked out of bounds last Touch by Joseph were a long way away from a potential Denver Boston NBA Finals long ways away but itll be interesting in the Notre Dame locker room at that time with the son of the Nuggets GM going against the former Celtics assistant whos his head coach thats a lot of ability right there he can shoot the three so they have to respect him from distance which enables him to head fake with his length and athletic is the burst then punctuated the rim M has talked about how well theres the steal hang on Cleveland all the way Telegraph the pass booth telegraphing so much everyone in the gymnasium including most especially Cleveland who Rosetta Stone that thing translate some defense into some easy offense the other way those pick sixes punish him I like that from the biling Jordan cornette I to speak English man Irish struggling from the outside over four since halftime and Watson will get to the line telegraphic and deliberate and so Matthew Cleveland just inserts himself into the passing Lane and the one hand jelly going the other way you cant give easy ones to the superior Talent on the other side in Miami and in Matthew Cleveland in the open floor just another area another vertical in which he excels excels interesting Dynamic of the Miami bench this year you know last year they had some veteran experience Off the Bench Anthony Walker harlon Beverly you know Bley Joseph G some good minutes theyre much younger Off the Bench this year theyre talented though and you talked about Christian Watson and Kean George Michael noelo is a big guy they got some size they got some skill the question is can they find that polish fast enough yeah and theyre just koreen I mean look we just entered December so the true growth will come as weve entered conference play over these winter months uh by the time you get to to we always say by the time you enter February especially midFebruary freshman or sophomores what do those freshman look like as air quoted sophomores at that point will Define the path and trajectory of the Kings here in 2023 24 into the fourth quarter of this basketball game and the errant pass out of bounds last Touch by Notre Applause Music Applause Dame Ean George passes to the wide open Cleveland comes up short from the wing Marcus Burton two for seven four points does have five assists though hes made plays for his teammates good look like that everything but the Pucket for Chi thats whats been so frustrating for G coming off that injury still getting comfortable here in his second start and third game hes the Buddies have been bears for the big F inexperience on display there for George kind of lost his balance on a looked like a wide open rim run that was a clear dislodging of the offensive player by the post Defender Michael noo to Js credit despite the fact he has not been able to consistently finish around the rim and that will come he continues to fight with all get out trying to establish that low post position to give his offense a better opportunity under nine to play has to find a way to acate needs to hit a couple shots and the whole team could rally around him trying to force it inside turning it over again I wonder if thats you know remnants of the wrist for Js in ability to connect collect nice pass and Better Block inside noo Applause squatted BT set thats up kesm this one stays down but it looked like the rims would be unkind yet again that early offense the thrust in the open floor from Marcus Burton beat the defense down the floor before it congeals and forces you to operate in a half cour setting where the Irish struggle thats a third three for kesn tough shot Watson puts it in talk about the bench reinforcements young guys getting their footing I mean Watson bilon knock down shots like that makes you so much more dynamic as a unit Disney off the bounce back outside Burt oh exploding to the rim its hard to do against Bley Joseph one of the best defenders in the conference Burton finally starting to force the issue a little bit I think hes going to need to do that if the Irish have a chance here in the final seven and a hook heres the talent that we talked about in the open can he find that momentum Applause Marcus Burton aggressive in nature for those who know Bo with the Layin yellow jackets that knocked off a rank Mississippi State team earlier this week CW Courtside Saturday continues with Duke of Georgia Tech next these are the preseason Award winners filipowski the preseason Player of the Year talented point guard Elliot Kad made his first career start and shined against the volunteers on Wednesday night inside the D Dome if you could do the vote again your mind Shi it all in terms of those preseason recognitions no I mean look I never likeed preseason anything because Ive always believed she got to go out there and earn it its its all cute and its all sweet now show me lets see the results how an actions goty what do you think about what Miamis done so far today I I think Miamis done a really good job of being disciplined defens I ly against an Irish team that makes you work in a half court setting great hustle from nor Chad on the glass these arent the the sexy games for Miami team because Notre Dame and part of their game plan is take away the fast pace the free flowing so possessions are Amplified you got to max out on each possession and you really got to get in and guard and Miamis done a good job of remaining locked in penne on the glass can he get it off no lost it on the way up Davis collects and then Roper dribbled it off his foot trying to create contact with Bensley Applause Joseph and well get ourselves another timeout we got 643 to go Michael shrewsburys first ACC game on the road against the top 10 Miami team back inside the watsco center with less than 7 minutes to go here in the second half eighth ranked Miami trying to bounce back from the loss 9573 on Tuesday against Kentucky it was interesting after the game Jordan Jim Lena said how he thought the hype of the game and the crowd and the atmosphere his guys all wanted to play well individually and he said as a result you cant win individually yeah he felt like it just wasnt a they werent in character of who Miami has consistently been which has propelled them to Such Great Heights but another wise thing a myriad of wise things coach El share with this pregame is every opponent presents something different so yes you can learn from Kentucky and take things but you got to put all your focus in on the next opponent and Notre is very much more delivering uh they make you work more in possessions theyre not out in the open floor like Kentucky so we learned from Kentucky but we regain Focus for Notre Dame which is the next one and big one because its the next Irish get a stop J lost by popper but the foul will send Kev to the Line Credit Miami for what seemed like it was going to be a ja easy catch and dump finish but making him earn everything and that is important because Jai has had to work for everything since hes returned hes had one easy dump finish year and outside of that in these last two games thats been about it in terms of ease at the rim for the big fella so keeping him uncomfortable is very important for Miamis Applause defense dont forget coming up next Kyle filipowski the accs preseason Player of the Year leading the Blue Devils with just about 20 points a game taking the show on the road Tom wormy and Mike jinsky who begins his 30th year broadcasting basketball here today on the CW Gman bled Applause you one of two at the line for Kevin Jai Notre Dame down 10 but it feels like a bucket stop and another bucket and theyre right Music there Nel pack tough to stay in front of finds his space and puts it Applause Music in R crry just KCK back in Off the Bench hes two for seven from three today just this Miami team blitzing Burton with the ball theyve done a phenomenal job of getting it out of the head of the snakes hands making other guys beat the kanes lot of space for kesn and hes got four threes in the game as Notre Dames back to single digits the Irish become increasingly more Dynamic when the ball doesnt stick when its moving it gets the defense Shifty into rotations and guys who arent capable of beating you off the bounds get pristine looks too high off the glass in fact for pack this time Nigel pack just a tactician with how he carves it up offensively had the had the shot going from the midrange the last possession forced it a little bit in that sequence saw the bucket saw the stop could not didnt get one more bucket here and change the dynamic and complexion of the last five Music minutes B post entry got to work to post enter exactly what coach Shrewsberry is showing son is that more on the passer or the the poster its on a passer yeah Kevin is doing his job on a low block its the angle you create as the post entrance of the basketball Shrewsberry has got to work a little bit more to provide that angle benley Joseph shadowing Burton Marcus tries to shake him sets up truberry wide open rebound popper its great offense Burton did his job got in the painted area created a pristine look for his threepoint shooter got to finish it those are the looks that the offense provides got to punctuate Joseph fouled on the pass by Burton number two on Marcus Burton thats what Burtons supposed to do create for others make them better around him generated that look did his job Duke Georgia Tech follows us this is the first of 14 ACC mens basketball double headers coming up the next 15 Saturdays here in the CW Joseph squatted away great blocked by J Davis an awkward drive and the layup wont go its a really bad decision for Davis had nothing didnt present really a basketball move and just hammered it into the defense and its still almost went in almost doesnt count omir second effort truberry wanted to travel and a belated call but its the right one and itll be Notre Dame ball as we take our final media break 354 to go in a ninepoint game you know I love a good shot block ke a give me that the Florida state transfer Matt Cleveland looking sharp in his new home here in Miami a prototypical wing uh hes gotten in passing Lanes to create some early offense beautiful Outlet there to his compadre wga popler for the dunk hes attacked a couple Closeouts for pullup jump shots he plays at a at a aesthetically pleasing Pace I mean he is a he has a a very attractive game on the floor hes smooth very pretty good defensively too seny thats thats a word Id use to describe cev a sinui you just raised your level English matri that was spectacular the highlight of the show losing his footing ji Dives on top tie up Arrow will keep it with the Irish seven on the shot Applause clock theyre going to give ji the Timeout on the diving on the on the Music floor so ninepoint game coach Shrewsberry drawing something up how about what Miles Kelly did against Mississippi State for Damon stoutamire earlier this week its a Georgia Tech team thats had its ups and downs in the nonconference but theyre under new leadership Damon STM is on a mission to bring this team back to prominence Miles Kelly another one of those big guards length is King on the perimeter weve made a reference a few times to the Boston Celtics with the ties obviously of the Lara Bloodlines and coach shrewbury and you know how Bostons done it how theyve remained relevant year after year you know as a Celtics fan a native from up that way link on the perimeter that wins in the game professionally certainly wins in the game at this level as well all right lets see what Micah Drew up out of the timeout Cruz Berry to Burton with five hell take it loose ball tracked by Burton press shot clock Applause this a huge possession right here for the Fighting Irish it will determine the tone in tener of the last three minutes of this game HT cant deliver diving from a thrown position and the tie up will give it back to Miami that was insane hustle from the freshman Marcus Burton yeah I mean to gather for one to create a second chance the first go round win a 5050 then to drive it here good defense excellent defense from Joseph but from the floor to gather hes on his way up and he said no just stay down here yeah no time out to call there so the the 5050 tie up goes in possession arrows way the Kings pack finds his space again fouls going on Kevin ji on the defensive glass thats the challenge that no Chad oir presents its trying to dislodge a an immovable object pretty much when hes down there the best offensive rebounders in the country and he had the advantage poppler triggers the inbounds pack for omir takes it makes it very UNC comfortable at that elbow ji worried about the drive doesnt respect the jump shot midrange Amir makes a pay shuberry not there theyre right there they Great Looks Shrewsberry is coming not quite there yet with some of these really good looks now two for nine from Beyond The Ark The Freshman BR Applause cruy Miami content to bleed some clock up 11 pack to benley back to Nigel Applause pack and Notre Dame not out of the woods yet but they got to speed it up Evan they cant play at the deliberate Pace that they like to operate at they got to be uncomfortable here and pursue quick offense and turnovers continue to hurt them Cleveland might have just finished off the Irish today its not just the turnovers from the Irish its theyve created open floor easy ones going the other way for Miami its been a theme throughout the game largest lead of the day for the Hurricanes as coach Ellen company up 13 fast break points 16 Miamis way Joseph finds Cleveland beautiful footwork to catch through traffic composure good body control to finish at The Rim seamlessly Joseph ever the distributor eyes on his teammates finds a cutter and cleave linen its an easy game seventh ranked Duke and Georgia Tech coming up from the C Pavilion in Atlanta with Tom wormy and Mike jinsky and as soon as we finish things here at the watsco center and look this Miami team they know their theyre not that big they know that they dont have much experience with their depth how do you envision teams trying to exploit those two things as we get into the meat of the conference season attacking Nord Shadow Mir has been a thing that opposition have continually tried you get him in early foul trouble like in Kentucky and a few other guys like in Kentucky it can take them out of sorts a little bit and its Advantage the opposition and thats the start trying to run them off the threepoint line trying to turn them over for run outs if you have the ability to do that that was the formula to success in lexingon Kentucky for Coach Cs wildcard 26 assists for Kentucky as well on Tuesday night they shared the ball beautifully Reed Shepard talented young freshman coming off the bench just a beautiful basketball player plays off two makes the right reads high IQ Sharpshooter when you have a mother and father who are as talented as they were and and are bleeds onto their son that team pool has been good to them no good for popper its had a quiet day only nine points roud dunk but it would be the first time that wug kept out of double figures this season he doesnt score again Miami doesnt need to score again Joseph lays it off gives it away stolen by rooper ahead truberry fires missed it short behind the play Kevin ja was slow to get up for Notre Dame hes still hanging out under the other bucket hope hes okay hes moving gingerly grabbing at his ankle struggling to walk on his own Applause here now look this resume wise wont look like a win of note for Miami but its a conference win never get bored with winning is what any great teammate player coach will say ask Matt payer how he feels about it right now and Northwest a tournament team make no mistake but but with this one here its how they had to win the game is whats impressive from Miami this game it was a rhythmless game wasnt as many possessions as Miami is comfortable with had to be more disciplined in the half court setting guarding guarding through Perpetual action which coach Shrewsberry offense always present so you had to lock in in a different way and also respond after a flat second half in Lexington and you got to give the Hat tip to the canes for that for Chad oir just ripped down his 13th rebound of the Applause day there are some people out there who are still interested as to whether there will be another bucket doesnt look like theres going to be this is going to go the other way if thats what you care about Joseph throws it up no good people hanging on their breath in the edge of their seat right there on that shot rer airball from the corner 8 seconds back to Roper to strong and it looks like 13s going to be the final margin Miami back on track in their ACC home opener as Jim Lena earns his 731 career Victory with a 6249
