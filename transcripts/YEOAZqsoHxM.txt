because a lot of smiles I appreciate it good luck thank you very much I hope we get a win Ill be smiling if we can keep on winning and making threes and making threes yes sir oh my goodness the native of Kingwood Texas has won 276 games 109 of them have happened in his seven years in Atlanta Smith Justin Porterfield and Remy Steins on the whistle and here is the fifth seed Panthers winning the tap and Nelly Cummings one of the impact guys on Jeff capels roster in his first year with Pat he absolutely has been that and I got to make sure that Josh Pastor knows I agree I would have loved to have played for him because he would have let me ride Burton at 18 feet gets us started and thats a layup for tomorrow in Clark youre talking about a firstteam allacc performer going under the screen thats in the mistake defensively you cant give him easy ones like that to start the game Kyle Sturdivant and Atlanta player will help engineer the offense and of course the lineups are brought to you by CDW Sturtevant with Terry Franklin Kelly and Debo Coleman starting here today for pastner and there is Kyle Sturdivant answering the Burton field goal with one of his own and the pit starting lineup offered for you by CDW Burton is the only returning from a year ago in the starting five Cummings Elliott Henson and Federico all offseason additions for Jeff Capel and thats Henson and the rebound and stick back for Federico hes not one of the best names in the game it was so nice you have to say it twice about a RICO Federico I love it were going to be talking about he and Javon Franklins match up the entire game and Raymond Stines is stopping the clock here I believe because the shot clock did not roll off the 30 and there is the accs coach of the year and that is Jeff Capel III now in his Fifth Season at Pittsburgh 14th as a head coach with 234 victories and he is excited about bringing his team here to Greensboro of course a native of the state of North Carolina in getting an opportunity to coach here in Greensboro once again in the ACC Tournament of course a tournament that he played in as he starred for the Duke Blue Devils and theres theres his brother Jason of course this royal family of basketball in the state if you will their dad Jeff of course we got to get it we definitely got to get a camera on Mama cake though I know shes serious she is right behind the scorers table three rows off the floor behind her two boys who are coaching today There You Go Mama Kate and thats Jasons wife Ashley and that is the matriarch as a basketball family and she knows her Hoops shes focused on the game and let me tell you one one group that she will not be easy on it will be the officials 42 and they have reset the shot clock little game management required to figure out the math on this so they got that done and now Georgia Tech will put it in play with Coleman and Kyle Sturtevant this is Jayvon Franklin who was the hero yesterday at the free throw line in the final second to beat Florida State start of it with four on the shot clock Coleman deep three from the front Coleman 32 percent threepoint shooter had three of them yesterday against the nose well this is the perfect game for you if your name is Debo you got to make sure that you assert yourself in this ones Blake Henson lines up a three unable to knock it down but the offensive rebound for Burton finally scooped up by Georgia Tech heres Lance Terry through traffic Coleman again on the hard dribble Sturdivant sets front rim missed the Federico grabs and always interesting now this is the second game of the day the second game of the tournament for Georgia Tech its always interesting to see how it is the teams who have played before come in against teams that have not played a great one defensive stance from Pittsburgh however Debo Coleman up to the task at the end of the shot clock Jacob will knock down Georgia Tech was against Lance Terry itll be his first and here is the sophomore transfer from Helsinki Finland who went to Northern Oklahoma College Federico Federico 63 free throw shooter knocks the first one Corey he might be the most improved player in the ACC from January 1 to March 1 absolutely and when you this is probably one of the most improved teams in the country from November 20 to now the Panthers won 20 games after getting off start one and three on the year they went on a tear starting off ACC play at 40 and Jeff capels group continues to get better as the season goes along early 65 lead we get a Justin Porterfield foul Applause and ticketed on Henson and a look at the one possession ACC capes for Pitt the important part of that is look at all the Ws when you know that your team can win close games and you think about the one they lost at Miami right you know thats a tough place to win and that was the regular season ACC Championship on the line heres Terry squaring over Federico boy Lance Terry now knocking down threes his 47th of the year and Lance Terry played 40 minutes yesterday for Georgia Tech so going to be interesting to see how the how the leads hold up well the yellow jackets throughout this game Henson Parr dribble into traffic and got Stripped Away last Touch by Pitt will go to the jackets who lead by two early here we have to mention that the jacket started off yesterday making their first two threepoint attempts and then they went on a long drought so can they maintain those legs and keep shooting it from Beyond The Arc Josh passler wants his team to take those threes Franklin Federico looming defensively for Pitt now heres Sturdivant against Cummings and a double team forced by the Panthers knocked away last Touch by Pitt s interesting Nelly Cummings is an excellent second Defender but when its one on one it looks like some opponents want to steer it at coming sometimes when they have the ball offensive thats a size matchup because most of guys hes playing against have the size Advantage overcomings so therefore hes what he uses quickness off the ball to be able to come up with steals Etc as we see Javon Franklin whos also undersized there but it doesnt phase him at all no so Franklin came up with a second chance jackets couldnt convert heres Elliott squaring and Greg Elliott welcome to the ACC tournament elliotta 41 threepoint shooter one of two pit Panthers who have made over 73 pointers on the season yep Elliott and Henson those two guys and now all of a sudden Pitts taking the lead for the first time on the triple by the Marquette transfer inside Franklin left corner and thats Miles Kelly and it spins out for Kelly heres Burton ahead of the pack hes got Federico with it Applause jamarius foul line again it bounds away and Sturtevant finally collects Kelly squares thats behind the line considerably and were going to get a whistle and a foul on Franklin inside for Georgia Tech second on the jackets first ones Jayvon Franklin not a pit ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by New York Life over 12 000 agents there to help guide you through lifes happiness and most difficult times opportunity to see Miles Kelly in the corner its a game of inches maybe not even an inch beyond the threepoint line however when he lets go the three it looks great Everything feels great about it but just one inch to the right makes it swirl around multiple times and go right off one inch to the left thats good for three and of course we know how important three points is in a game thats tightly contested as this will be and Georgia Tech like you mentioned earlier start at three or four theyve missed their last four so three of their first eight now the jackets two of those are threes and yet Pitt still has the onepoint lead Rob inside Federico the catch it great action out of the timeout by Jeff Cape won the execution by his team on the floor that was almost a blind pass by Henson he knew that his teammate Federico would take care of it Blake Henson who was off the 30 football scholarships out of Deltona Florida including all powerful I had 30 power foul football scholarship officers let me guess tight end uh yes well you know there are a whole lot of tight ends college basketball so again football may not be over for Henson but as a all ACC performer this year hes enjoying himself on the court and should be hes had a terrific year after a circuitous start to his college career from a basketball perspective wait a minute Ima need you to break that word down for me later a bounce out of a jump shot by Burton Ill let Dre help you out there can help you with circuitous heres the start of it long three back rim Miss Federico clears hit by three here is Burke just a terrific allaround player for Capo and you remember a year ago where Jamari Clark pretty much relied on the threepointer for his success offensively yeah hes not even the guy from Beyond 30 anymore he does the majority of his damage finding his teammates and attacking the rim yep and really I think its that productivity in other areas that got him a lot of Player of the Year consideration for it a whole lot of and you see one of those areas is the fact that hes guarding Miles Kelly so hes the top Defender on the perimeter for the Panthers yep heres Kelly flashing by Henson Leia fell out Franklin a quick jump rebound and the stick back for Jayvon Franklin thing Im certain Jeff Cape will talk to his team about because they had to keep the body on Javon Franklin he is spectacular for him 19 rebounds to go along with his 10 points in their win yesterday and you see him once again well Above the Rim taking it off the rim and then the quick second jump to finish it an opportunity for the ammo free throw by Franklin to complete the threepoint trip is no good I had an interesting conversation with one of Georgia Techs great players BJ Elder who was on that National Finals team in 2004 remember him well yeah and he played with in my mind one of the best leapers Ive ever seen in the ACC in Ishmael Muhammad agree okay Henson on the drive theres the scoop and a foul on the jackets and BJ Elder who now does Player Development theres the great jacket from Madison Georgia who told me he said Wes I think Jayvon Franklin is a quicker leaper than Ishmael Muhammad thats High Praise that is high praise and it comes with credibility because of course BJ has been there to see both these guys so Ill take his word for it but I know that very few that can get off the floor as quickly as Franklin yeah free throw by Henson is good Blake Henson number one player in Kansas when he came out at Sunrise Christian Academy did not play at Iowa State average 105 at Ole Miss in 2020 he is a guy who has got one year left at 23 years of age he can come back and play next year after the success hes had at Pittsburgh Im sure Jeff cater would love to have him back here communication breakdown for the Panthers on that one but unfortunately unable to finish it Sixth Man of the Year in the accs Nike sabandi he dumps it to Federico fetty looking for help but here is sabandi Burton with 11 on the shot clock hell tee one up on Franklin just his 58 threepoint attempt of the Year by the way recognizing exactly where his team what teammate was to drop it off in the easy dunk four points for Franklin Georgia Tech to within two jackets kind of played out of me but what is it one three one Corey most of the time I guess theyre going to switch it up but when youve got a guy in the middle of the Zone Mike Burton that can only score it they can also distribute the basketball it makes it difficult to play zone against the panther yeah youll hear a lot of coaches in the ACC say you can use some of your offensive sets that you use against Syracuse against Georgia Tech but not all of them no but with a problem with when you play against the Zone against Georgia Tech Josh pastor and his team disguised it so well oftentimes you dont know if theyre in the zone right with the man for which zones right they have multiple that they throw at yep Applause deep three thats Cummings in the 63 of the year for Cummings whos been double figures in six straight games but better than that hes been plus five assists to turn over during that construction as well for Coach cable yeah Pittsburgh has two guys averaging over four assists per game when you think about Nelly Cummings as well as jamaris Burton so theyve got a lot of special offensive talent but speaking of offensive Talent my guy Kyle third of it his Godfather is Damon Stoudemire he learned a couple of things from the 1996 NBA Rookie of the Year one of those things is to use his eyes to look The Defenders off and drop the dime again Kyle Sturdivant showing off a little bit here at the ACC turn live right now on the ESPN app terrific way to watch the game Music it absolutely is that I was fearful for that cam on Monday and practices though of course every team does their half four shots couple guys got a little too close to the camera one the camera to at least be able to make it into the tournament substitutions both ways during the timeout Georges Tech wont go very deep if they took Franklin off of Franklin stays on the floor weve yet to see Jalen Moore who is typically the sixth guard playoff passing his bench and that is it heres Cummings theyve decided he wanted to shoot her to rob it to Federico I dont think Sturtevant made the saves in the corner for Miles Kelly you mentioned that Franklin played all 40 minutes he and Lance Kelly did not come out of the game yesterday it could be interesting to see how much legs they have especially as we get into the second half of this one Terry worked around the Franklin screen of it and the rebound on the back side and that is Jorge Diaz Graham one of the twins from Tenerife and the Canary Islands who plays for Jeff capon two talented twins who have a great future seems to be Federal Federico fouled at The Rim born in Egypt grew up in Finland hes playing with a guy from the Canary Islands right and both of them towering over everyone in the Georgia Tech roster right now we talked about Josh pastor and Josh packman told us their rebuild started with them playing small Javon Franklin at the five position whos 67 he is clearly undersized compared to the front line for the fans Federico was six in the first half Quick Check of our bracket Wake Forest has already advanced 7774 with the Davion Williamson triple at the horn and after the game Corey legendary orange head coach Jim behind maybe with some breaking news if youve earned the right to let me go out you know whatever that is I guess no one really knows I dont know why Russells feathers just because I said I want a coach University and say no youve done a great job here we think its time to go so Mike Waters who covers Syracuse for syracusecom says behind quoted in the post game here in Greensboro saying he gave his retirement speech on the court last Saturday so nobody picked up on it so there is strong consideration that Jim Boeheim quite frankly just said he might have retired huh I will say that in my conversations with Jim behan I was under the impression that he would do one more year the last time we had any conversation regarding that it was in early February right if things have changed and Coach baham is retiring then we are losing a true legend in the game but I would hope that we get to see Jim behan at least one more season at Syracuse yeah and uh its been picked up on the media as you might imagine not only Mike waters for an ax of course whos a familiar media member in central New York to MOST Syracuse fans Applause he concurs with Mike Waters in that it felt like Jim Beam was announcing his retirement today confirming that Saturday was his retirement speech I guess more to come obviously on the score but that is one that is developing at least here in Greensboro after the Wake Forest win against the arms and by the way this is a topic that everybody who covers this event from a media perspective knew was going to happen the minute Syracuse lost we all felt like there would be more to come from Jim behind especially after as you mentioned last Saturdays events honoring the 2003 National Championship team won again rightfully so youre talking about it and of course the man with the second most wins in NCAA basketball history over a thousand wins for coach behan Applause so well find out more about that perhaps if our studio Folks at halftime hit by six here as were into the last nine minutes of change of this first half and the Panthers so far doing a great job defensively one leading scorer Miles Kelly for Georgia Tech hes been unable to really get anything going Elliott Jorge Diaz Graham a background missed the three Guillermo cant keep it alive and heres Georgia Tech the other way Terry had it batted away theres Jalen Moore with the recovery and Coleman drops the three people Coleman you mentioned only shooting 32 on the season from Beyond The Arc the shooting the basketball very well here to start today nine points for him yesterday off to a much better start this afternoon hes not only hes only had three double figure games in his last nine they need him to pick up some scoring if they want to try and pull another upset sabandi went Baseline and a block will be called Applause and thats going to be on Debo Coleman thats his second second team foul five on Josh pastners team you mentioned Nike sbandi who the accs Sixth Man of the Year also had a strong performance here in Greensburg seasons ago 25 points for him coming in in his first ACC Tournament game trying to match a performance similar to that coming off the bench here this afternoon sobandy on the board averaged nearly 10 against the leader the Diaz Grahams twins leave Hinson and Federico are back Nike sebandi went to Crispus attics in Indianapolis Corey start at Miami of Ohio before transferring to Pitt you know what legendary college player Pro Player Hall of Famer winter Christmas addicts in Indianapolis Im gonna take a flyer at it I would say the big Oscar Robinson I would love to tell you that I knew the answer to that but my man Kim Belton always got my back I figured somebody helped you hit the fastball huh all right nice more rookie orientation this is your first time Kims right now we do this you know once a week so uh you know its your first time but hey that was a great trivia question thank you and I would have had zero idea if it wasnt for my super producer well you still work on Securities oh yeah Drake Drake got to come up with that is that right lean and Andrea heres Debo Coleman the sophomore from Memphis who actually played his final year of high school ball and Callahan Florida he was Floridas Mr basketball and with the white Pastor has tightened up the bench a little bit Coleman is now kind of back to his minutes per game from a season to go he played 20 or more a year ago in his freshman year in ACC play 18 times and hes kind of moved back that route now here at the latter part of the season but what hes also play is a lot more point guard this season you know what at one point during the season Josh Pastor did not start at three point guard Debo Coleman was the guy that took over those ball handling responsibilities theres Federico and then Franklin knocked it off the rim goaltending on Franklin basket for the Panthers fivepoint lead for the 50 Fox brought to you by principal Corey Javon Franklin 10 points 19 rebounds three block shots and more importantly the pressure that he put on Florida State yesterday to try to keep him off the boards even though they were unable to do it was spectacular and youre talking about a young man who comes out undersized each and every game but able to play 40 minutes and not foul out of the game and stay aggressive on the floor for Josh Pastor the entire time well Jayvon Franklin Andy Demetra who does Georgia Tech games on the radio said he has now four ACC games with 15 or more rebounds the Georgia Tech record for ACC games with 15 or more rebounds is Malcolm Mackey who has seven took Malcolm Mackey four years to do it Jayvon Franklin has done it in eight games Malcolm Mackey in the in the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets actually knocked me out of my first ever ACC tournament and theres an inside basket for Jalen Morris sophomore from Birmingham and hell draw the Elliott fouls along the way first on Greg Elliott fifth on Fifth you see Franklin some more more the only player that will come off the bench for Josh Pastor was able to finish through the mismatch points for him in the game yesterday opportunity to outdo that here at the free throw line unable to do it nope free throw Miss threepoint game so the fact that Malcolm Mackey knocked you out of the tournament is he persona non Grotto the rest of the way well being that I went five for 20 in that game Malcolm Mikey might have got 15 rebounds a mile under shots in that one as a freshman Music Pittsburgh by three heres Burton with the shot clock running down the running onehander jamarius Burton he is really just matured as a basketball player you can see how hes grown under towards of Jeff Capel in Pittsburgh First Team all ACC performer and as you mentioned many people had him as the ACC Player of the Year Debo Coleman a spin and shot and then Moore saved it by bouncing it out of bounds off of Greg Elliott but how about the running onehander here there you go way to say it the right way you see the follow through thats not a floater people that is a running onehander thats a teardrop but when you follow through it is not a floater respect my man WD for calling it the right way there we go tend to shoot here for the jackets who Trail by five and deflected Burton I think got a hand in I take Corey when you watch pit play you appreciate the connectivity of the team at both ends of the floor and Jeff Capel talked about everybody said well what about the four new guys they looked at these guys based on the ability to connect with Burton and guys like Savannah that are already there shot clock violation defensive stopper of the Panthers and in my opinion that is the reason why Jeff Caper was ACC coach of the year is not only because Pittsburghs won 14 ACC games right but its also the implementing New pieces into your system and more importantly having them play together you talk about you know we talk about Burton isnt all AC performer hes not even the leading scorer for his team each and every one of these guys has been willing to sacrifice for the greater good and that has been winning basketball game yeah I mean he even talked about like every guy coming in with their conversations with Burton and sabandi and the coaching staff and then you add a Federico the Diaz Graham twins kids like that and yeah it took 10 games to kind of figure out the chemistry thats todays college basketball thats it youre not going to be as good in November as youre going to be in March and right now in March the pit Panthers are a not just a good team they have a chance to be a great team they can do some damage in the tournament Burton almost lost it on the dribble dead threw it away Outlet here is Terry Moore the catch and score second field goal for Jalen Moore great hustle defensively by Franklin to be able to save the basketball and then Terry with the kick ahead and Terry deflected Moore got it and then he tried to fire it ahead to Terry didnt get enough on it its in a deep three Applause Music the turn of events almost turnover turns into a threepointer as a game of inches will think about how many times players were inches away from a baseline from a sideline and from turning it over to only turn into two points for Jayla Moore three different players tiptoeing the sideline of Baseline ends up being a bucket for Georgia Tech and a pit lead of eight now under five we go Terry a catch and shoot on a three and the rebound for Cummings hes watching Lance Terry a couple of his threes have hit the front of the rim thats a sign of fatigue but great interior passing from Frederico inside to his hence made their last five in a row from the floor they pushed it to double figures for the first time Music before you mentioned the energy the narrow bench here only six guys really playing for passengers team theres an unforced error turned over by Franklin and a 10point game and quick check here the Phillips 66 Big 12 Championship youll see for his first round action tonight with West Virginia and Texas Tech Sooners and cowboys they always get along very swimmingly at 9 30 Championship Saturday I believe my man Dickey V is going to be on the call in the big 12 how about that heres Elliott three ball from the right Applause when they lost the games to Michigan and VCU in in the inseason tournament it seems as though Greg Elliott at that time was trying to find his way he was a little over aggressive offensively now you see everyone playing their role and its beautiful to watch the way that Pittsburgh has zeld as a group as The Seasons gone along patience is impressive isnt it especially at both ends of the floor four to shoot here Sturtevant Kyle hes got four now in his second field goal and the lead is 11 Applause for Caples Panthers Cummings bounce inside theres Federico for the easy gone thats another example early in the year we would have seen Nelly companies come off their screen and roll fire or three all right he recognized the mismatch goes inside to Federico who has an easy bucket and once again its the greater good doing whats best for the team Franklin hard to the basket and it will roll in for Jayvon that time the jackets get the friendly spin Jayvon Franklin facing up Cerny Federal against Federico able to finish through the contact opportunity for Anne wolf ESPNs exclusive presentation at college basketball is brought to you by principle when you take care of your team they take care of business Corey Alexander conference you know what I agree oh yeah yeah well done Seth look forward to you guys at the break were going to play you Jim behans comments from his presser here in just a moment Diaz Graham inside will draw the foul so Jim behind in the post game media session here in the coliseum in Greensboro after they lose to Wake Forest on the Williamson three at the horn goes in on his timeline did he retire last Saturday heres the coach I always have the choice of retirement but its their decision as to whether I coach or not always has been I think you missed it I gave my retirement speech on the court last Saturday and I gave it in the press conference afterwards and nobody except William Payne figured it out now that youre you youre going to retire this is up to the university you want to come back I didnt say that so what are you saying youre not saying youre retiring but youre not just said it I dont know so you dont know okay I said this is up to the university and youre not sure whether youre when will you when will how will you make a determination about when you will come back youre talking to the wrong guy all right there you go Corey give me a thought well my thought is is basically hes saying that when you when youre talking to the wrong guy he will not be the person who determines whether he comes back to coach or not he says its up to the university so with that being the case and we know Jim behind for 47 years hes done things on his own terms so right now it seems to me and again this is just only my interpretation of listening to the sound that hes moving it up to University to determine whether or not they want him to come back and coach or not a couple of things here to put it in context that would be Athletics director John wild hat and the chancellor at Syracuse Dr Kent several who he is referring to the second part about this from a context perspective is Jim Bay Huntsman quartered a couple different times here in the last seven or eight weeks saying there is a plan a secession plan I know what the plan is they know what the plan is and hes comfortable with it so now is he putting the ball back in the court so to speak of not his decision but their decision if theres a secession plan in place hes simply saying to the university if you want that to take place now then you make that determination or if you want me to come back and Coach he would be willing to do so thats what I gather for me I could be completely wrong but thats what I gather from it more coming up at the half with bonds and Coach Greenberg and Michael Reeves theres a travel by Henson so this story is starting to filter through not just the Coliseum here in Greensboro but most of college basketball and of course were talking about you know 47 years as head coach a thousand wins 35 tournaments and of course the anniversary celebrated last weekend of the National Championship one at the Superdome in New Orleans against Kansas in 2003 theres a knockaways Cummings in there and now were going to get a foul on Sturdivant as he and cummings came away from the loose ball and were jocking for position and Sturtevants gonna be whistled for his second oftentimes when you consider Pittsburgh and the fact that theyre second in the ACC a threepoint field goals made per game and what they do on the offensive end of the floor with four players that averaged in double figures is Lost in Translation how good they are defensively weve seen them out hedging ball screens being able to get back theyre turning Georgia Tech over and the energy that Jeff capels team plays on the defensive end of the floor is the reason why theyre one of the best teams in ACC one and one here for Cummings Applause first appearance of the day for Nelly 89 percent and the free throw good Trey what can you add for us here and I got word for Williams and how their situations were handled so I dont have exact details but he mentioned some of those guys in his press conference as well all right one one of the things that I would like to mention to Dres point is Mike braze departure from Notre Dame was more so a mutual agreement right but it had a lot to do with the Universitys decision yep so I can kind of see what coach behind was saying now when he says its up to the university especially if he puts himself in that same category Cummings a three rebound for Savannah back to Iraq will Score first field goal for the senior and the lead is 13 speaking of sacrifice Knighton said hes been a start of the majority of his career but now talking about a young man who has you know taken on the role of the Sixth Man of course done it better than anyone in ACC Sixth Man of the Year at this year but continues to give Jeff cable everything that he can and every possession hes on the floor down low heres Franklin look at the quick double team and Jayvon Franklin traveled Applause so itll go back over to the Panthers just more than a minute to go here in this first half more Caples got to feel pretty good about the way his teams handled this opening 20 of the tournament very true but you know important possessions here at the end of this first half to finish the first half on the right way they built this 13point lead you dont want to try to give Georgia Tech any room to field inspired going into that halftime lock room this is where you really want to keep your foot on the pedal spot up at the Circle for Burton hes got 10 I wont take Corey feels like four of them are foul line jump shots well again hes taking shots that hes comfortable with and hes getting easy looks but thats because he put so much pressure on defensive by attacking the rim final half minute of the opening frame this is day two in game two here at the New York Life ACC tournament Terry fights through traffic and scores Lance Terry had an early three now its got five lead still 13 for the Panthers and the user to lose it time out here for Jeff Capel Music with 143 well step aside jackets trail 4431 to the Panthers well we welcomed me back closing seconds here this first half break to be with Corey Alexander West Durham in this bayheim story retirement or not is going to take us all the way to Saturday night I feel because its not just an ACC thing its a college basketball it absolutely is youre talking about you know second in wins and division one history youre talking about 47 years on the sideline not to even mention the times that he was at Syracuse as an assistant coach as well as a player so more to come Michael ease with Seth and Fonz coming up in a moment here is Cummings a little another running onehander and Diaz Grahams tip he somehow didnt fall in he missed it thatll take us to the half Pittsburgh the five seed who had a terrific regular season looking very comfortable in their first 20 minutes here in Greensboro but important for the Panthers to regroup and come out and make sure they take care of business story of the uh first half is about Georgia Tech had four guys play all 20 minutes and Pitt is as youd like to say sharing the sugar they are sharing their sugar 10 assists on those 16 made field goals brought To Us by Boost Mobile these first half stats has been able to Pittsburghs been able to build and lead by sharing the basketball great offensive possessions Lance Terry tries to start Georgia Tech with a three and Henson the rebound there winner of this meets the four seed Duke tomorrow in the second quarterfinal both these schools played the Blue Devils just once during the regular season Applause that ball got deflected off Hensons pass by Coleman who also collects the turnovers and Debo cant finish in transition smart defensive play there Bob Henson just continuing to back up not allowing Coleman to make that contact the backtoback turnovers for the Panthers theres Miles Kelly a quiet first half hell get a layup for his first field goal of the ball game and first points Georgia Techs leading scorer nearly 15 a game in conference play but thats his first marker of the afternoon but a little fatigue three straight turnovers look out now be no layup for this one no actually thought there might be a little more theatrics today oh youre down if youre not down you may have a little more at theatrics if youve got a lead on that one but you know down double figures the best thing for Franklin to do is exactly what he did make sure he got the short two points heres Federico on the Block against Franklin fetty a little Up and Under did he travel no got fouled Jayvon Franklin commits his second Andrea Carter thanks Russell I caught up with coach passner of Georgia Tech coming out of halftime and he said defensively they usually switch everything to stay out of rotations on the ball screens he said instead theyre taking advantage of it we are going to start to hedge so look for them to continue to hedge we saw it earlier it led to a turnover it led to some run out opportunities defensively switching their coverage and then offensively he said were not cutting hard enough youve got to cut to the basket like youre getting a layup and then out like youre going to get a three he said were stumbling through our half court offense so look for harder Cuts as well Dre of course youre very close to the Pittsburgh bench have you seen much reaction from coach Capel and his staff after three straight turnovers to start the second half a lot of looking at each other like what are we doing you know you know coaching staff they just make eye contact with each other like what is going on or how teammates do when I look at West when he says something crazy like what are you talking about similar to that right or or like circuitous oh yeah you looked at him when he said that word thank you nice thank you Dre in an eightpoint game right now youve got to give Georgia Tech a passing grade coming out of the locker room we talked about Josh pastner talking to his team seeing if they had more in the tank for 20 more minutes but here here comes the other part about Georgia Tech four straight wins six of the last seven and a lot of it is second half momentum Corey and were seeing pastors team maybe built a little bit here right now still trailing eight another defensive stop getting Kelly a good look he knocks that down now youre talking about a fivepoint game still got a great look at it but if Jeff Capel right now I may have a little concern about my team we may need the time out to reset and you and Dave saw yesterday Florida State looked like they had a three possession game comfortably right until about the what last six minutes and Im sure thats something that Jeff talked to his team about at halftime this team can come back you know they have that in them to be able to do theyve seen it here already in the ACC tournament start of it leaves it for Colemans three Debo with a dozen and theres the timeout you knew thats coming and Jeff cable doesnt have much choice but to call that time out his team needs a reset here quickly run for Georgia Tech to cut what was a 13point deficit down to five lets check in with Drake yeah guys just listening to the pit huddle and Coach Capel really challenged his team to be stronger in every aspect on offense he talked about them getting pushed off their lines whether theyre cutting whether theyre passing whether theyre attacking so look for them to play A Little Bit Stronger but you all talked earlier about all the close games that Pitt has been in he ended with we have been here before lets be mature lets stick together and lets execute like that right there well Dre one of the reasons Pittsburgh is so great with their execution especially after timeouts is because theyve got a guard that can post up and of course oftentimes as part of their rotation Jeff Capel will put jamars Burton in ISO situations and if he cant get by his Defender just turn and back him down Federico continues to build his resume in the ball game now and Jayvon Franklin adds to his play hes got 13 now on his fifth field goal back to a fivepoint game Applause given the climate of the two regular season games Corey this ones kind of following a similar script theres Burton again tell you what hes doing exactly what he did All Conference season long but thats the thing you see him go and if he cant beat his Defender off the bounce hes strong enough just to turn and back them down get to a sweet spot if you double he drops it off and if you dont he finishes over the top Coleman a three room Miss got his own rebound right back for the hoop to 14 for Coleman who had 10 yesterday against the Knolls and Georgia Tech has some energy now Wes yeah they do again you know Pittsburgh had an opportunity to bury them at the end of the first half and coming out into the second half but they allowed him to get some energy and we see Franklin continuing to show off his energy WD the game is much closer now so we might as well go ahead and dunk it backwards on the break jayvons got 15 two dunks and a follow here in the second half threepoint game Burton trying to find room on Terry wheels in the lane and it falls off the back three ball of tie start of it Applause into the corner Terry Baseline lost it feeds Franklin theres the dunk Federicos hurt Franklins got 17 its a onepoint game Franklin is having a tremendous impact on this game attacking a tall Defender using his body to finish over the top of Federico Federico and then with the great defense its time to shine WD you want to sizzle Franklins got it for you 774 the Deeks were excited how about Nikes abandoning William Jeffress excited in the tunnel for Pitt yeah the Panthers were excited for Wake Forest but right now theyve got to get a little more excited for what theyve got on their hands against Georgia Tech the ram the wreck picking things up defensively four second half turnovers for the Panthers already in five and a half minutes of play so bandy for Burton in the lineup during the break heres Henson and the rebound from Miles Kelly Kelly has only got five second half points to his credit hes Georgia Techs leading scorer Pastor who worked magic a couple of years ago here in Greensboro trying to do it again as you see Josh Pastor running that Princeton offense keeping Jayvon Franklin at that freethrow line where hes been dangerous and of course has the ability to find his shooters Coleman for the lead it was an air ball hit the glass rebounded by Federico Elliott he lost it and last Touch by Pitt another turnover by the Panthers yeah great play defensively by Cal Sturdivant though one dribble too many by Elliott getting into that painted area started been knocking it off of his leg they only had four in the first half Corey theyve got five here in the second half still holding to the onepoint lead lob for Franklin catch against Federico now Coleman from the right Applause see what Nelly Cummings does remember Burton over there on the bench with sabandi into that lineup Henson Applause started at lead Franklin almost traveled Kelly will give Georgia Tech the lead and just great passing Music because weve got a couple words being exchanged by these two teams but a simple face cut by Miles Kelly getting behind the defense and then allowing Frederico to know to find his big boys you did and here is Miles Kelly who went for a 21 yesterday in the win against Florida State seven all in the second half Georgia Techs first leads its early in the first half eight for Kelly all in the second half gets by two and Federico locks it right back up nice fine by Nelly Cummings putting it into fourth gear getting downhill passes Defender and then dropping it off to his big fellow allowing them to finish Federico now hes got 19 hes seven for seven from the floor Sturdivant attacks couldnt finish around the sophomore from Finland Cummings right back at the jackets and it fell off the front the Cummings didnt go to the basket to finish that one WD he went to try to draw contact and get a foul he had an easy layup just took away his concentration Coleman Sturdivant heres Kelly fall away two nope I dont think Kelly was on point to you I dont believe so right now if Im Burton Im not sure this is the time to push theres Cummings he went Baseline stripped of it by Kelly theyre going to be free throws awarded on the whistle from Justin Porterfield and its on Kelly his second at the New York Life ACC tournament post game interviews a look ahead to tomorrows quarters and always a surprise guest could drop out you never know that the ACC tournament calcium booze and Joel and Luke Hancock I can tell you exactly what Luke and Joel and whos gonna be talking about whats happening theyre gonna be talking about Jayvon Franklin who has 17 points 11 rebounds five of those offensive and six steals to go along with his four assists in this game he is stuffing the stat sheet for Georgia Tech Valley Cummings is three of three at the line well it would fall right into some tournament headlines I mean we have had already close fits you had the ball game yesterday with Dave with Georgia Tech and Florida State one possession game last night Virginia Tech another game Corey luceski had a look at a three that would have tied it Mike Grays final game of course and now this afternoon we gotta we think potential retirement of Jim behind and I will quote my guy Mike gray when he says its some juice in the building and right now there is some juice in the building for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets as theyre able to operate very well in the offensive end of the floor his defense was stingy in the first half but Georgia Techs balance of Rhythm here as the lake 54 all on the Terry jumper heres Cummings Burton thought about it Terry poked it away theyll roll to the deck possession gonna stay at the Panthers into the floor well we said going to break Josh pastors only got six guys hes really playing here in the tournament Bobby kremens Shining Moment was the 85 ACC title Corey you know what the Omni and crimens leaned on John Salley Scott pettway Yvonne Joseph Bruce towel Ripple and Mark Price with Antoine Ford Jack Manziel Off the Bench Applause John Salley thats enough what about Bruce Dalrymple Dal Ripple was good but wait a minute we talking about Mark Price one of the best ever to play in the ACC at the point guard position and John Salley was special up front yep and we got a foul off the ball yep and Georgia Techs played six guys today Jalen Morris come off the bench but of those six guys yeah four have played the entire game the only start of this checked out at all is Kyle sturdivin thats when Jaylen Moore came in outside that the other four starters have played the entire game yeah Ill give you an example Lance Terry never comes off the floor he does not I mean you just dont see that today no no you dont but Josh Pastor has found something that has worked and is working to Perfection to get him back into this game in this second half twopoint game coming up on the Midway point sabandi hes been quiet not now its a bucket hes got five second field goal for 9 but this is the area of concern right now for the Panthers can they get stops Georgia Tech is operating very well in another great look Miles Kelly able to knock down the three 11 all in the second half George so Georgia Tech bidding to advance into tomorrows quarterfinals here in Greensboro you see that Wake Forest is there theyll play Miami at noon Duke awaiting the winner here of the Panthers and jackets Carolina BC tonight NC State Virginia Tech tonight of note Corey those four teams only played each other one time during the course of the regular season but these two teams have played each other twice in the regular season now this third time and you always hear is difficult to beat a team three times and Georgia Tech showing you why that is so in this game right now Jeff Capel of course concerned about his group a very important game right for Pittsburgh a loss could be detrimental to them but right now Josh Pastor having no concern about Pittsburghs NCAA tournament holds hes just trying to keep his team season alive well and heres the other piece too Georgia Tech 55 from the floor in the second half and no turnovers that is huge Cummings fights through heres sabandi pull up on the Baseline missed everything and Diaz Graham thats Guillermo with the following thats the foul on the sturdivance his third thats the one area for Georgia Tech that you want to say you have to short up but difficult to do when youre playing so undersized on the interior youre talking about a seven footer with a six foot one guard trying to check him out Guillermo is the older of the twins and of course he wears 25 which comes before 31 and thats what Jorge wears and Guillermo also with the G Jorge with a J so you keep them straight that way by the way just in case they would have never so so it comes in the alphabetical order G and J Guillermos the oldest okay hes the G okay J is Jorge he was the second one oh see thats why I hang out with you you break down all the details I need to know Applause still hadnt told me about security Im waiting on Kim Belton attempting well its Ray one or two of them Terry the shot Franklin the rebound and we got a pit foul on Federico third on fetty and thatll be the third on hit oh its the fourth I beg your Cardinal Federico that is the third on Fifth see thats a big foul right there and of course the Im a numbers guy so of course if you start throwing big words at me like security then I have zero idea what that means but of course Ive got back up so I know it means pretty much in a roundabout way but you know me Ive always been about numbers thats my thing I know yeah like five of 22 4 of 19 I was I was four of 19 we corrected that Brian stiff was 4 22 yeah here is Franklin and the dump Javon Franklin 10 and a half now 19 in the ball game WD you know how they say men a lot women a lot of numbers dont but numbers dont always tell the whole story that two points yeah for Franklin means a whole lot more than just two points when you start dunking on people the way that he is in the painted area that puts fear in the hearts of these young fellas hes got them to go up against right now got his own rebound on the Miss right back and draws another foul remember he had a Georgia Tech ACC tournament record yesterday with what 19 rebounds and he may go above that today he was speaking of going above he goes well Above the Rim it doesnt matter who steps up which twin is his the older or the younger he makes sure he passes out his fear equally to both twins Franklin by the way three of four at the line now dracy gets two here exactly what his head coach told him to Tuttle coach patner passenger looked right at him and said hey hey close to the basket go score with Frederico on the bench you have to imagine hes thinking score every time Jayvon to the stripe three of four and misses that hes got 19 points 13 rebounds four assists and corio told you about the half dozen steals and hes putting so much pressure on Pittsburgh that as you see Frederico Federico on the bench you have to wonder how long Jeff cable can afford to keep him over there with Franklin having the dominance that hes had Kelly at three nope still a onepoint lead for Pitt under nine we go at the coliseum in Greensboro Georgia Techs had a number of good looks from three where they could have blown this thing open a little bit just unable to knock them down Harris Burton kick into the corner for Elliott big three ball for Greg Elliott the response thats where youre talking about a good team when you can respond when teams or things are not going your way teams are making a run you step up against one of the reasons why the Panthers had seven row wins this year they know how to respond Terry slices through and scores Lance Terry tough shot in traffic now with nine its a lot of toughness on this floor for both these teams WD one of the reasons why this conference in my opinion is one of the best simply because youve got teams whove played together play well with different styles from their coach right back at the jackets at 16 its a fourpoint lead for Pitt Panthers whove won 21 games 14 in the ACC Applause kick into the corner for Terry and a bump and a foul on Elliott that will be his third and the fifth on Pitt Tobias Burton attacking downhill finding his teammate Greg Elliott lining up the three ball from the corner pocket on the other end Lance Terry not deterred by the contact his two is good in the 10 Eastern even more coverage of both brackets always streaming live on the ESPN app if its Wednesday it must be Greensboro for Draves thats the way Im going I mean moving I mean moving Corey that thats what she does she stays on the Move wow so so wheres these Greensboro right wheres he got it okay just trying to keep up with YouTube just trying to keep up guys thats it Dre trying to keep you in one spot its probably more difficult than guarding Georgia Techs offense right now its called third into the bucket and gets the easy one and right now the rambling wreck making it a one possession game once again they are operating very well offensively here in the second half this is what weve seen from them during this fourgame winning sure is this is kind of when it starts the last seven you saw it yesterday against Florida State really theyve only had if you go back and look at Georgia Techs win streak here theyre not too many you know as an Old Coach one time called him to meet leg crossers I mean eight point win at Boston College one point yesterday Music they did have the big 20point win at Syracuse they did comfortably beat Louisville seven point win against Virginia Tech twopoint win against Notre Dame on the Lance Terry follow Cory so I mean there they usually Play the full 40 in other words and we also mentioned Pittsburgh of course used to playing close close games winning five of seven games within three points or less so yep theyre theyre in comfortable territory are the Panthers right now three shoot Elliott squares on Franklin how about that the net didnt move till the ball reached the bottom but thats why theyre so comfortable theyve got guys that can step up and make big plays regardless of how much time is left on the shot clock fivepoint lead heres Sturdivant and Diaz Graham Guillermo the foul these are the best ones WD because they dont even make a sound its almost as though the basketball barely even touches the net as it drops through all right now Pitt just sent Georgia Tech to the one and one coin it was 6 45 to go the jackets are seven of 12 at the line and ACC play they shoot 68 percent so well say is not their strength so maybe good fouls for the Panthers as Georgia Tech comes away with the empty possession the only problem there is Frederico Federico with four fouls and you dont want to get guys in foul trouble look along theres Diaz Graham Guillermo the dump hes got Bob but a great play once again Bob Burton you see his value to this team not only is they score but a playmaker as well Sturdivant off the screen trying to drive sabandi to the basket got caught in the air travel called by Randy Steins that is the first turnover of the second half for Georgia Tech Applause Josh basson wants a timeout to talk it over right now he can see Pittsburgh starting to find the Rhythm with some type of well separation right now and Jayvon Franklin has been the star for Georgia Tech here this afternoon Court he absolutely has been that the Steal and heard you talk about no Sizzle on the first dump so make sure he gives you something with the second one then snatching the board off the rim going back finishing through the contact attacking bigger bodies through the contact still able to finish and won opportunities and then just strong with the basketball using his body to finish over tall Defenders Jayvon Franklin has been spectacular especially when he starts throwing it down with two hands big day for Franklin 19 points 13 rebounds four assists half dozen steals look at the work thats been going on well hes putting together an early alltournament resume of course his team will most likely have to play more games to make that happen but his performance I know how you and Kim Belton like to get out the measuring stick on peoples height and theyll see Avons listed at six seven Im not even going to let you throw my man Kim Belton under the bus with that thats all me okay I know real Heights when I see them Elliott on the drive Mr layup Franklin the rebound Kelly spots nice big bucket great play boss third of it to be able to recognize when his teammate their best threepoint shooter their best score and Miles Kelly will be filling the lane but give Frank the credit once again defending at The Rim 14 for Kelly jackets to within four inside Henson the strong move and hoop eight now for Blake Henson Applause nice response that time by the Panthers going inside to the 235 pound Junior yeah not the traditional Post Feed but still Henson able to bring it in showing off those great hands that made him that tied into so many division one schools and at this particular rate you can leave Federico over there if youre just capable yes you can wait till the under four time out as long as you continue to have some type of separation but Diaz doing a great job stepping in for Frederick Henson completes the trip he had two double doubles against the conference this year 11 games though with three or more threes made in a game nacc club Applause the reason he was second Team all ACC on this special year for the Panthers their highest seating since their first year in the league theres a drive and Sturtevant couldnt get the roll the foul will be on Cummings and for Nelly Cummings his second of the half on Pittsburgh and there is 48 year old Jeff Capel native of Fayetteville of course as Corey told you played in this league at Duke theres Miss Jerry Mama Kate yep got to be proud of her son s and Sons absolutely dont want Jason Anthony thats it both those guys free throw good for Sturtevant theres Jason of course who played it Carolina Brown Tim OToole round out that staff terrific building project Corey thats going on in Pittsburgh and it speaks to and I say this a couple different times this year speaks to the understanding of Heather like the athletic director to know what that job was going to be for Jeff Capel and how they had to get it done and more importantly the patience you know the Pittsburgh Athletic program to give Jeff Capel the time should be able to establish what theyve been able to establish this season not easy to come from the depths of where Pitt was when people got that job in March of 2018 hate to shoot here for Burton his team up five the world in the lane and the score with the right hand patience in the painted area Burton just runs back smiling showing off his fancy footwork well he is a talented impactful basketball player in every phase of the game for these Panthers jackets got to find a way here Franklin inside and he stepped on the inline off the catch thatll turn it over just the second one of this half on pastors team in WD we talked about Pittsburgh staff we got to make sure that we mention Milan Brown associate head coach who is bro it was the Bradley Award winner for the ACC this season Milan had a heart attack last spring and of course his recovering perfectly back to fulltime duties Guillermo Diaz Graham missed the three Franklin another rebound Tech on the bounce Kelly whips on Baseline heres Terry blocked out of there by Guillermo thats one you just got to know where you are on the floor Cummings are trying hedge and block out Franklin and score at that time Cummings did the right thing hes concentrate on finishing but he shielded off the shot blocker knowing that he could not score that over top of Franklin inside four to go the lead is nine for the five seed Sturdivant cuts into it this is this young man was benched Midway through the season he wasnt playing at all for Josh Pastor after having major turnovers at the point guard position but stuck with has found his way back into the role as a starting point guard playing close to 40 minutes a game now heres Henson working to the foul line against Kelly and Holman finally comes away with it out of the three Coleman trailing three Music 17 for Coleman now hes got four threes in the game the yellow jackets are not going away Devo Coleman stepping up knocking down the big three and weve seen Kyle started to get out in transition and patiently wait for threepoint Shooters multiple times Cummings a stupid score six in the half 11 in the ball game for the young man from Midland Pennsylvania play to Lincoln Park sixpoint lead again winner gets Duke tomorrow in the second quarterfinal around 2 30 Kelly on the drive thats going to be a block on Guillermo Diaz Graham thatll get us to a break in the action 2 20 to go in Greensboro in our second second round game ESPNs exclusive 79 Georgia Tech 73 great to be with Corey Alexander Andrea Carter West Durham here at the coliseum in Greensboro already into her fifth game three of the four previous decided by one possession two games with less than a second to go we admit farewell to the great Mike gray and we think bayheim is seriously thinking about retirement based on the postgame comments huh is that what were thinking Im not really sure what were thinking look Im gonna tell you now Miles Kelly hit the line that opportunity who came back to see the former ACC Player of the Year Chris carrewell is also a national champion in Emile Jefferson also won a national championship right the Blue Devils in scouting there opponent for tomorrow Applause Alan Diaz Graham Kelly responded to four point game and that got blocked out of bounds thats the other thing that Franklin does one of the accs leading shot blockers yep came in with 51 on the year and weve talked about his athleticism but how about his timing to catch it right at the Apex as soon as it leaves Burtons hands not picking up a foul but look 19 points 15 rebounds six deals and lets just throw a block in there for good measurement just so you can check that category Music 207 to go in a fourpoint game Applause 10 to shoot Applause Henson out of the corner nope and Coleman the rebound if youre Josh Pastor now youve got five team fouls youre going to be double bonus on your next foul by Pitt heres Terry tried to scoop it up and no whistle Tech bench thought they might get one there instead it stays a fourpoint game with 93 seconds to go good no call there that would have been five when Federico Federico but he stayed vertical on that possession Burton winding in on Terry and one Applause its a tough shot and this shows you what he means to his team not only what he means to his team but what he means to this league and when you think about Pittsburgh and their chance is moving forward trying to solidify an NCAA tournament bid their guy who mini felt was the ACC Player of the Year jamarius Burton going to work down the stretch Josh pastner disappointed because he knows theres nothing you can do about that sixpoint lead now burden to try and make it three possessions and guns first free throw of the day Burtons got 21 for a 10 field goals and hes done all of his damage inside the painted area not selling for threes stays in the top load 70 seconds to play thats a two from Sturtevant hes got a dozen on his fifth field goal Applause and Burton and Pitt if Georgia Tech will let him theyll wind this down they absolutely will take as much time as you want but youve got the basketball in the hands of the guy you want taking this shot at the end of the shot clock tend to shoot Burton Henson tees one up that is a Crusher that makes it eight with 40 seconds left now youre talking about a three possession game Applause start of it to the basket and we get a whistle and a foul and the foul is on Henson its his third its the 10th on Pitt so two free throws for Georgia Tech once again jamarius Burton making the right play recognizes the mishap from Georgia Tech both players go with him he knows his God his other all ACC teammate Blake Hensons going to be open finds him right in Rhythm allows him to knock down his second threepoint field goal Monday afternoon Burtons got eight assists and 21 points the start of it hits the free throw this statue is going to look like an NBA statue youve got guys putting up heavy numbers yep throughout this game I mean you got 1916 rebounds from Franklin no dont forget the six steals six steals right and the block right Federico 198 Music now heres Cummings for Federico so they take what might be a lesser freethrow shooter off the floor and bring Cummings back at nearly 90 percent but you want the basketball in the hands of Burton of Cummings they got to feel like Georgia Tech what goes for the steal here if they dont get it foul yes absolutely you want to make sure you give yourself as much time as you possibly can without the Trap oh and they got Cummings Nelly thought he had cleared The Fray and then Terry commits his fourth that is seven on Georgia Tech so one and one here Josh Pastor who two years ago in this building coming out uh with coveted restrictions in place not big crowds of course hes the only wore that face shield in that tournament run this year they beat Florida State here in the championship we lost some games in the tournament there for covert restrictions and regulations back then free throw the oneonone for Cummings rolls out theyve still got that memory of Josh pastner theyre heading down the Nets with advisor still on yep but that was his signature look at the time and must also remember the fact that he had the ACC Player of the Year and Moses right and the ACC Defensive Player of the Year and Jose Alvarado with them and it was a great week for the yellow jackets as Josh passler gets his first ever ACC championships Josh Pastor answered to a trivia question though you asked how many head coaches have ever won a national championship as a player and as Im sorry forgive me a national championship as a player in the ACC tournament Championship as a coach Josh Bachelor would be one of the very few steps who have done that yep was a player in 97 at Arizona right miles Simon was the most outstanding player that year for the Wildcats and he is a native of Kingwood Texas Proud Houston area product yeah he threw in for good measure hes also won a peace Jam Championship with Houston Hoops but he was a teenager coaching yeah well a win by Pitt and we would get the second meeting of the Year between the Panthers and the Blue Devils Duke won 7769 and Cameron on January the 11th in a game four noted for Duke just kidding after pit at the offensive glass it was a lot of that Applause of course played his entire college basketball career right maybe a little different here in Greensboro Coliseum more Panther fans in the building but I can tell you right now when the Blue Devils come into the building theyre always going to have fans whether its a Cameron or in Greensboro Coliseum tell you this the night session in this building will have a little flavor to it because NC State and Carolina both make their ACC tournament absolutely it was my guy Mike gray says as weve been farewell to him its going to be some juice in the bit yep and prior to a five second call a timeout awarded to Pitt looks like Greg Elliott got it Calm before the five second count so a fourpoint lead for Pitt with 22 seconds left to go but already a winner today the Demon Deacons Corey oh wait lets roll some 22 in the house 1995 the flat out best ACC tournament performance of all time My Little Big Brother Randolph Childress stepping up making big shots big plays when his team needed the most and of course Davion Williamson stepping up and making the biggest shot before the Demon Deacons this season here in our first game this afternoon 95 Childers went for 37 in the championship game overtime win off had 30 in the semifinals 40 piece to start it off that is correct well he was 13 of 18 from the floor and eight of 12 from three and a foul by Georgia Tech will reach the front Court Applause number three and uh the reason he was the MVP of the tournament of course was that you were out right I broke my ankle okay yeah if not for that none of that would ever happen I know Dre is fascinated to hear that the only reason one of the Great Moments in ACC tournament history exists is because Corey was not available for injury I mean I asked you to go back and look at what happened in 1993 right who sent him home in 93 I understand that but Dre just so you know one of the greatest performances in ACC history well uh listen it depends on if that was early 93 you guys dont want to know what I was doing I wasnt born yet really happy for you why did we even open her microphone in the first place Kim Belton is a legendary producer he just wanted us to take that shot to the heart I get it yeah thanks Kim no thanks Drake great thank you appreciate it holler shot Sturdivant and Elliott the rebound and a foul by Terry Lance Terry is going to foul out of the ball game with nine and Pitt will go to the line and on their way to their 22nd win Terry fouls out and Josh pastner will have to put Jalen Moore on the floor I believe here for the final only couple seconds three disqualifications the entire season for Georgia Tech yeah which would be a record no if Terrys fouled out this will be the fourth correct but the record is five for a season for Georgia Tech so for Josh pastor at this point hes hoping no one else fouls out yeah and I think theyre checking the clock here among other things which is an amazing stat when you consider the fact that these three guys 40 minutes guys are playing the entire game yet still able to play without fouling out and by the way for the first time in the last three games Georgia Tech has to make a substitution in the second half 87 87 Court Pitt in Duke tomorrow its got to be all you want Jeff Capel John Shire both assistant coaches for Coach K yeah doing the 2015 National Championship team for the Blue Devils and very good friends but they will not act like it tomorrow here in Greensboro nope dont forget Dave OBrien J billis will be here tonight Carolina Boston College followed by NC State and Virginia Tech Virginia and Clemson await the winners of those games in our quarter finals 8981 its a eightpoint victory jamarius Burton when his team needed him most in this second half took the game over not only with his scoring but also with this playmaking getting downhill finding Blake Henson some
