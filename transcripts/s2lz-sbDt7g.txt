but their calling card is making sure they take you out of what you want to do offensively mix in some zones some one three one a little bit of everything to defend the cards here tonight there is a guy who is seven foot five starting at Center who is the tallest player in college basketball and who leads the nation for a second straight year in Block shots per game nearly five there he is number 33 in red jumping Center Jamarion sharp no surprise he wins the tap and its the hilltoppers with the basketball first Music Jarius Hamilton former Boston College Eagle in Maryland Terrapin Emmanuel aycott is somebody we havent talked about he is also a Difference Maker here he is number 13 firing for the first time and he connects and thats one of the things to look forward to watching from the hilltoppers they shoot the three as well as anyone in the country 48 for acot on the season and hes second on the team from Beyond The Arc yeah that would be luke Frampton number 14 who is at 58 and as a team as El Ellis misfires as you mentioned Corey Western Kentucky shoots it at 43 only Utah state is better so far this year and that is impressive when you think about the and they didnt have a great shooting game last time out so those numbers would be even higher if not for the 10day break where Rick Stansberry said they didnt get the practice time necessary to really have the Rhythm that he wanted but they got it in and theyre prepared for this game today and only three of 18 in that win over Wright State which proves to me Corey that they can win in different ways and thats where Davion McKnight comes in you dont need to shoot the three to win when hes doing those things and right now weve got some conversation between acot and Jalen Withers and theres going to be you see these two guys already getting into it and this is a big time matchup if youre Western Kentucky you got the first win last year in the last 10 attempts and they want to be able to repeat that performance and let everyone know it was no clue and they beat the Cardinals by 10 it did Lorena last year shes trying to do it consecutive years offensive foul on Withers as acott stood his ground well Akon Im sorry aycott and Withers having that conversation early and thats going to be the second foul on Withers already the technical foul and then the pushoff gets him his second early and hes got to take a seat this is similar to what happened to Withers in the App State game where he missed the majority of that game in foul trouble and went scoreless Captains fourth year player heading to the bench with two fouls less than a minute in the ball game hes been replaced by 68 freshman Kamari lands acot no off the front rim so much on the plate of number three in white this year L Ellis another one of the tri captains leads this team in scoring 11th in the ACC ENT but one of the big problems for the cards this year the turnovers right on cue he averages five per game God blame you you talked it up you talked my man L into turning that over three turnovers all ready for the cards with only a minute and 20 of game action being played yet to get a field goal attempt well theyre averaging about 17 turnovers a game hard to win games like that Hamilton Off the Mark long rebound track down by Mike James and here is L Ellis and you can see right now backing off for Brandon honey Hatfield hes only one for seven from Beyond the threepoint Arc this year of course 15 knocks one down you cant take it that is the first threepoint field goal he has made since game one this year what do you mean I cant take credit for that all right lets see you do it on this end okay lets see Frampton didnt shoot it well last time Im thinking were going to see my guy get a look Applause Music and of course hes gonna get enough I want to hear you say Sharps gonna shoot a friend 33 early on here at the KFC Yum Center a lot of folks have made the drive from Bowling Green its about two hours south of here and I have a feeling many folks are going to be calling in sick tomorrow with this late tip Curry to the left hand matches dominant hand and he is one of those returning players they need to play better and honestly I believe that is the production they need most youre talking about a guy who was a monster to end the season last year and has not been that this year tell this Louisville team might be 09 but there is no apathy among the fan bands nice cut by McKnight for his first two and a great job by McKnight cutting to the open spot and more importantly the pass to allow him to be able to finish him amongst the trees heres Ellis the senior from Durham North Carolina got all North Carolina battle right there Hamilton are from Charlotte Applause pulls down the rebound Applause McKnight natural left hand are able to get into the lane thats a specialty ball knocked out of bounds and itll stay with the tops but you can see early that the hilltoppers are going to attack the paint they dont fear shot blocking from the card so McKnight will spend a lot of time in the painted area here this evening Mike James with the rebound you are Huntley Hatfields going to be called for the foul as Hamilton wound up on the floor I cant believe youre not giving me credit for the football I mean Ive called him into action to knock down the three hadnt made a three since game one this season and as I talked about he knocks one down and you know what thatd be fresh first The Fat Boys break up and now this if I allowed you to you would take credit for all 50 55made field goals were gonna see today no not that high of a percentage Frank did not get out of bounds Louisville will keep 10 seconds remaining on the shot clock all right you got another prediction no Im Im gonna stop predicting no Im not done Im just for not on this possession all right Im not feeling it right now into Curry give it back to Kamari lands Music Applause lands working hard for his own shot nice job defensively to stick with it Music did he hit him with a boom bit that is a bold bit for sure you saw the good right left and left back to the right to pull up jumper is that why you think hes a throwback because he gets the job done in the midrange No Doubt I dont know body type the way he carries himself never too high never too low Ellis with a sweet pullup and I like the way L Ellis came off of the screen to roll theyre looking to get downhill with settling for the midrange jumper knocking it down not over penetrating and getting the turnover and deflected good defense by Kamari lands that brings us to our first media timeout the Louisville Cardinals is it one basketball coach to have won a national championship as a player a coach and be a firstround NBA draft pick the only one and when you think of Kenny Payne you think of great recruiting you think of energy and passion along the sideline and its going to take some time I mean and you know what I love the fact that were here today and the lower ball is full of fans here still supporting this team which of course is one of the greatest basketball programs from the tradition standpoint in the country well from a television standpoint as you know Corey over the last 20 years since ESPN has tracked these things this is easily the best television market in the country people tune in in drove not just for the Cardinals but for college basketball in general well and again when you consider the fact that you have both Louisville and the University of Kentucky right here along Interstate 64 but you have a lot of other great basketball programs in the state of Kentucky as you start thinking the races of Murray State Western Kentucky with Rick Stansberry basketball is only second to horses in this state in the Bluegrass State drove past Churchill Downs this afternoon we had a little time to kill and Ive been there before have you been have I been where Churchill Down absolutely been out there hung out never been to the derby though I coached the Kentucky Derby Festival back in the summer back in the spring of 2017 and we had an opportunity to go and toward Churchill Downs and that was actually the last year of the Kentucky Derby Festival so I can see I shut it down maybe thats not a good thing with a couple of free throws Western Kentucky scored the last four points since the break to take the fourpoint lead and we see Western Kentucky picking up now a little token 94 foot pressure but with Louisville having the turnover issues that they have Coach Stansberry is going to find his ways to go at them and try to put some pressure on this defense now the hilltoppers in mantoman defense that then looks like it drops back into Zone what have you seen from them defensively so far against Louisville well they want to continue to mix it up but thats what you look forward to seeing is the big fella leading the nations in block shot and coming up with a big one there trying to turn into some offense on the other end for the guy he leans in now for six points and its for homes Western Kentucky to keep sharp near the basket when youve got a guy like him at 75a prolific shot blocker you dont want him coming out probably comes out nicely to pick up another block shot but you dont want him defending on the perimeter throw it up reflected out of bounds and the hilltoppers but you see Sharp backtoback blocks or two possessions and in all honesty its offensive players thinking that they can shoot jump shots over top of them not recognizing how long the wingspan is at seven foot five and hes covers hes able to cover so much ground and affecting shots even the ones he doesnt get to he makes you off now he is the tallest hilltopper ever no surprise the tallest in the country this year is an inch taller than Zach Edie at Purdue and last year was kind of his emergency tied with Indianas Trace Jackson Davis for the third most dunks in college basketball offense is still a work in progress but he can do that Ill give you credit for them I will give you credit for them a nice pass by Jerry Hamilton to find the big fellow when he doesnt have a body attached you got to make sure you give him those looks on the interior and Jamarion told us earlier this afternoon with his family about two and a half hours from here in Hopkinsville he was going to have good representation in the stands friends and family unable to call in that rebound though but he can get up and from anywhere near the rim absolutely and you see without someone really being attached and I love the way he puts the right hand up to allow Hamilton to know hes open theres no one putting a body onto his legs to keep him from jumping is able to go up and finish now he Taps the top of the head meaning that he dunked on someone Im not sure who he dunked on but hey at the end of the day if I could do that now I would absolutely be tapping the top of my head letting the world know I just got a dunk said every time he dunks because hes dunking on everybody 80 Western Kentucky run snapped by Elle Ellis and that is the second three that the cars have hit in this game shooting the basketball better made nine threepoint field goals in the loss to Florida State last time out a season high and maybe starting to find some confidence on the offensive end from Beyond The Arc Jordan Rawls has come into the game as has that man Christian Lander who misses Rawls picks up the long rebound and misfires Come Away with it lands to Ellis tries the Euros death and the defender was waiting there for him offensive foul against Albert Ellis III his first personal Western basketball and thats a great job just getting back choosing exactly where L Ellis is going to go Frampton gets his body into a legal guarding position absorbs the contact Ron grew right on top of that and that is the right call Big Time officiating crew tonight along with groover Roger Ayers leaked the cell and we got the ATeam again on the call now we see the cards mixing it up a bit going to a Zone defensively Applause three ball why didnt you call it Court well because they were in the zone and whenever youre in a Zone youve got to identify where Frampton is he shoots 58 from three we have to make sure you close out to his body not allowing him to have that much space Music Applause on the drive thatll take us to our next timeout Luke Crafton against a Zone his eyes light up it doesnt matter how close he is to the threepoint line maybe we should count it for four Music talked about him second nationally in the country actually wait a minute no he first isnt it hes number two in the country behind stetsons wesa Panza what is he shooting 59 oh okay I was about to say you shoot 58 in your second yep Music back in the game Jalen Withers playing with those two fouls hes got his first two points and Withers basically had to hit reset on this game didnt first minute with the two foul but now in the zone for Kenny Payne hes able to kind of protect him a little bit but theyve got to stay attached to Francis off the turnover Here Comes Ellis facility Music Applause basili has started to find some favor with Kenny Payne getting into the lineup to take over the point guard position to allow Elvis to get off the ball a bit great look on the back cut and the Slam by Tyrone Marshall Jr Applause Ellis playing off the ball with basily into the game and the fouls call against Christian Landers 15 times great ball movement against the zone trainer forgets to drop but thats one of the things when youre playing against a team that has so many threepoint Shooters on the floor you often have to know where the shooters are but understand your responsibilities as well as to be able to take away the basket that time JJ trainer caught between two doesnt take away the basket concerned about the three and gives up a dunk we should also mention that Louisville is playing without Roosevelt wheeler tonight he is in concussion protocol he had had a good game last December against Western Kentucky they could have used him but we dont know how long hes going to be sidelined but some minutes for somebody else yeah last year without Malik Williams in the lineup Roosevelt Willow went four for four at Western Kentucky one of the better games he has a freshman a season to go well that was an energized building diddle Arena home of the hilltoppers and when youve got Louisville coming to town thats one of the programs you measure yourself against they were able to beat them convincingly by 10 and now at the point Davion McKnight he did play in this building here as a freshman but it wasnt full that was at the height of the pandemic and came off the bench played 17 minutes had modest points theres turnover taken away by facility great move to get to the other side and lay it in and but Philly making his impact felt early in this game two buckets in transition both coming off of turnovers and thats a positive sign for Kennys Payne if they could turn defense into offense coming off the bench heres the energy guy basilic just past the midpoint of the first half balance penetrates hangs off the window and the foul Applause Fabio basili getting out into transition coming up with the steal and taking matters into his own hands the nicer burst layout for the Finish to put two on the board for the cards who have now made it a fourpoint game Music at the line L Ellis who was last years ACC Sixth Man of the Year runner up I dont hear his Saturdays college basketball lineup on ESPN2 and the F featuring top 15 teams number 14 Indiana and number eight Kansas start today at noon Eastern at 11 AM Central then my man CA is on the call with number two Virginia and number five Houston no youre just going to be there rooting on the whos Im going to be on the sideline watching I will be there checking out the action as a fan gotcha rocking my Wahoos Western and then Tennessee Arizona The nightcap 10 30 Eastern time all that on ESPN2 a great afternoon and evening of college basketball and he said B youd be there I thought you were working two games every night nah Im taking the day off go hang out watch some great basketball Cardinals with another takeaway and a chance to tie or take the lead Louisville started the game missing seven of ten theyve now hit five in a row and have taken the lead hell Ellis with acorns make it 10 points after draining the three foreign Music Applause once again the cards turning a turnover into a great offensive opportunity L Ellis coming off the screen and roll no help was able to knock down to three and Doug Kenny Payne told his team after shoot around today everything that has happened to this point doesnt matter we are starting over from today and the effort that weve seen from the Cars over this last five minute stretch looks as though theyre Believers and that they can start this thing over hit the reset button and have some success moving forward and you know he has said when we Face adversity we cant revert basically the hero ball otherwise it snowballs and so far tonight for the first 11 minutes Cory theyve taken a couple of punches but theyve just kept coming and seemed to stay together and theyve had a number of players get involved in doing so weve seen Withers get in knock down a bucket basilys got now transition got two buckets and then L Ellis has been able to be effective on the offensive end as well knocking down the big three to give them the lead but I think the change defensively going to the Zone has helped this team since the first possession where Frampton was able to knock down the three ball outside of that Louisvilles done a great job defending at this point well the shot clock had stopped at 22 so they went and retimed it and took six seconds off so the shot clock down to 16 seconds the game clock down to 906 good guy Roger Ayers comes over let us know that he shot the clock stopped at 9 12 and so therefore they go back reset get it all together Western Kentucky Im sure wont need those additional six seconds until Toppers with their starting five back out there McKnight with a rare threepoint try only his 10th of the season Louisville basketball but I love the hustle from Hamilton getting on the floor going after it saving the basketball now in his fifth year of college basketball and Ill tell you you and I covered Jerrys Hamilton his freshman year at Boston College he didnt make those plays then you can see that this a young man whos really grown up as a basketball player and a person had an opportunity to talk with him earlier today has really matured over his time in college yeah he really remembers his freshman year coming into this building with Boston College and losing to a very good Louisville team he had modest numbers three points in 16 minutes as a starter at the other end Jordan Laura lit him up for 32 he wants a better outcome here tonight and nothing modest about McKnight he has let it be known he is going to the basket as we see now the hilltop is going to a Zone defensively as well we knew Stansberry would mix it up Kenny Payne talked to his team about it and shoot around today theyre prepared while McKnight blew up 30 miles east of here and was not recruited by Louisville you know it means some when he comes into this to play the carton absolutely and it means something to Ellis to knock down back to back threes acot no sharp with the offensive rebound and Applause weve got ourselves a timeout 750 remaining in the first half W fresh so we will not come to the build and I asked El Ellis what you got for me well today its been the three ball Music ten years ago we started on tuck it up teams they never let against Florida State and they LED only briefly against Miami and when they took the lead here a couple of minutes ago theyre playing on the plus side maybe that energy continues to build I believe so and the energy has continued to build in this building shout out to the cards faithful but you set me up Dougie Fred hows something because Im thinking that its all Louisville fans but Western Kentucky wears red and black as well correct oh thats right you dont know of course I dont know you should know that I dont know Corey is colorblind occur to me that you didnt understand the fact that well theyre two and a half hours away theyre going to be some hilltopper fans here well I figured there would be hilltopper fans here but I mean again the fact that they wear the same colors you know hilltopper fans are into it I mean again the environment they had for last years Louisville game did Lorena is one of the best home court advantages in Conference USA But youre right the hilltoppers are red and white the Cardinals are red and black tough to tell them apart especially if youre colored runs Ill tell you what you gotta love the energy from the Freshman from Orlando vasilys got six points Off the Bench thats the other way Frampton knows and Basilica does a great job getting back affecting the shot for Frampton not giving him a wide open look going to work and earns another trip to the free throw line and this is what I would expect from Fabio basili because he played for my guy Steve Reese Oak Ridge High School in Orlando and just like Kenny Payne Steve Reeves coaches his guys up coaches them hard holds them accountable and so a good fit for basily coming in Music and doing it very late he was a midaugust commit Court yeah and again you know when you look at him hes able to be able to come off the bench and give L Ellis minutes off the point so L Ellis can go to doing what he does naturally be a scorer and hes done that here this evening so far McKnight now into double figure near turnover in the backcourt Cardinals keep it even near Mid Court Hamilton and McKnight had lands double team but its the second foul on McKnight Kentucky press weve seen something here in this game that you havent seen from the cards all season long we had the graphic up a few seconds ago Louisville has 10 points off of Western Kentucky turnovers the hilltoppers only have three this is not a battle that Louisville has won off season long weve talked about the fact that theyve turned the basketball over so much they have a one to two assisted turnover ratio on the season coming into the game 72 assists as a team 153 turnovers those numbers are astonishing when you think about it its hard I mean you cant win games like that I mean thats one of the main reasons why this team is 09 on the season but yet they are taking care of that battle here so far today reporting their last in the ACC and scoring scoring margin field goal percentage field goal defense assists blocks turnover margin and assistive turnover ratio theyre shooting 37 from the floor 29 from The Arc its really hard to win games like that and as we say in the hood why you bringing up old stuff that was yesterdays business well Kenny Payne said were talking about now LL has had things moving on the offensive end of the floor Curry denied by the big man but he has called for the foul and thats the physicality coach Payne was looking for out of Sydney Curry against the 75 hilltop for Center it absolutely is in the Louisville faithful on their feet applauding the effort of everyone on the floor especially Sydney Curry as he tries to put the 75 sharp through the rim so youre trying to say Kenny Payne was as prophetic at the end to shoot around this morning as you were at the start of the broadcast today yeah hes my guy thats what we do all right yeah yeah he made it clear he made it clear to his team he made it clear to us everything that has happened to this point we cant control death thats over thats in the past lets start new today and they have received that message and it is going well with the first 14 minutes of this first half trampton got it Western Kentucky had missed its last five shots over the last four minutes until the Sharpshooter from cocoa West Virginia stood tall and its a small thing but you have to pay attention to details if youre Ellis you have to step out on that one and Ellis looking for a foul on that three Applause wrongs going downhill and drawing the foul Applause Rawls has been a nice change of pace coming back to Western Kentucky with a three to one assist to turnover ratio hes been a couple of years with the hilltoppers made the old Conference USA all freshman team decided to transfer out went to Georgia State didnt make it through the year decided to come back and Coach Stansberry sure is glad to have him thats thats the second time weve seen that didnt we have someone from West Virginia that did that earlier this year went to UW and then came back to West Virginia yes Ill tell you what look at these coaches being compassionate and considerate Im not sure if you leave me itd be one thing if you let me but if you leave me as the coach go away and then you want to come back Im not sure Id be so forgetful so youre spiteful no no thats not it just not as forgiving when it comes to that well Ive always known Country Coach Huggins was more forgiving than you would know that his name is Huggy Bear he has to be pretend to shoot just over five to go in the first half now Louisvilles got to go there goes Ellis challenging the Big Man Curry keeps it alive but its sharper comes away with it and you can see the sharp effect on the interior challenging that shot silly Curry getting involved in the action in this game and you look at Cindy Curran look at look at the last three games from him last season heading into the ACC tournament he was averaging 23 points per game 70 from the field 107 board and 317 minutes that was the last three games of the regular season a year ago comparing it to the numbers from this season he is six for 15 coming into the day in nine games against Wake Forest last year in that threegame stretch he went 13 for 18 and scored 28 points he had more field goal attempts at one game last year than he has a nine this season he was dominant closing out the season like you say Corey but part of it is that his weight ballooned in the off season and he is still trying to work himself back into that kind of Shame JJ trainer has his first three trainer has provided that shooting punch with knocked down two threes at Florida State he talked about them making a seasonhigh nine threepoint field goals in that game and his shoe touch has carried over acot to the corner jump shot well short the energized Cardinals with a basketball up by five and this is the time right here where L ellisdale has to sell in run the point get other guys involved not take it upon his shoulders to take a hero shot trainer clean look but I love to play from Ellis on that one you get the basketball to the hot guy acot under control you can tell that this is a game that Aycock came in prepared to make sure he was ready for preseason allconference USA picked this year and he started it out setting to tone with Jalen Withers about how this game was going to be played it was going to be physical it was going to be competitive Ellis with a runner he stays hot 15 points now for the senior out of quality education Academy in WinstonSalem foreign Applause taking away another skill for the Cardinals and lands wide open this time he couldnt cash in Applause Music any kind with the basketball played his first two years at Arizona years of voicing his pass to the corner for a wide open look nothing but net for Jarius Hamilton thats what makes Western Kentucky so dangerous youve got four players on the perimeter that can shoot the three ball with the big fell in the middle and they use that threepoint line as a weapon Applause comes up to help tries to recover but cant Ellis able to get the bucket the smart play by LL is going to the opposite side of the rim negating the shot blocker he cant stick his hand through the rim and thats the only reason he didnt come away with the block shot there you see already better than his season average here in the first half again the defensive intensity for the Cardinals is worthy of pointing out Applause timeout here in Louisville without Reese they could wear down Kihei Clark making him have to do too much but I do like the fact that Virginia has debt this year Ryan Dunn Isaac and Billy coming off the bench really give them depth in the backcourt and of course Bennett vandepos as that front Court depth Virginias depth this season is different than it was a year ago and Corey I was going to bring up Ryan Dunns name that you didnt you know how you just take a shine to certain players when you see him he to me is the perfect UVA guy whos going to have a marvelous career there and be so versatile Withers for three Cardinals build the lead to seven this is the most points they have scored in a half this season but I love the way that Withers has responded I was here in game three for the cards when they lost to App State Withers got in foul trouble he never got involved in that game he gets it down trouble early in this game but he comes back and he responds and helps his team here on the floor Applause Music Applause step away as well cards up seven Music why is Aaron Happy Well carvana has tens of thousands of cars under twenty thousand dollars so Aarons folks could help hook him up with a new ride well drive you happy at carvana the first time you connected your website and your store was also the first time you realized we can do anything cheesecake cookies the cookie manage all your sales from one place with a partner that always puts you first GoDaddy tools and support for every small business first Sherman Corey Alexander its one thing to be 09 in the middle of December its another thing to be 09 in the middle of December here at Louisville I mean the expectations and the attention that you get these kids feel it theres no question about it you feel like tonight they are responding in a very positive manner they absolutely have and if your kidney pain you have to be excited with your team has approached this game and weve talked about it this is one of the proudest fan bases that you will ever find in college basketball the only reason theyre not consider the Blue Bloods is because they dont wear blue and their enemy does how do you know because I know the colors I can read the Crayons Big Blue Nation dont they have a game coming up Kentucky are we allowed to talk about the Wildcats while were here in Louisville dont they play Louisville well they do yes yes yes yes thats what Im talking about dont they have a game coming up between the two teams theres your guy from the left corner again well you didnt call that one though well because I was arguing with you over something but the fact that Im here and he knows it knows he means its Honda its time to make shots all six of his points have come from that same Corner timeout called by Rick Stansberry its a seven nothing Louisville run this matches their largest lead of the Season Plus 10 Music Applause I was a fool are on a run to open up a 10 point lead Brandon Huntley Hatfield with the corner three came into the ear only one for seven hes made two so far tonight it might be their night it might be and right now it has been their first half possession right here to take this positive momentum into the locker room for the cards that they can come up with a stop and possibly a score to him and you know Western Kentucky is going to have the ball in the hands of their first team allconference point guard Davion McKnight with a dozen five seconds Ellis runs into the 75 center brings it back out and its a three at the buzzer JJ Trainor the Cardinals with their largest lead of the Season as they head to the locker room and this is the way you take momentum into the half LL is attacking the big man JJ trainer replacing is able to step up knock down because you know what happens Music but if mobile does not win this game its because you said that I was not reading that stat so youre the guy at the end of each quarter in the NBA Music or at the end of the game when youre leading and youre not going to take a shot you would cast to one of your teammates so they get the turnover they call it sabotage Sydney Curry starting his third straight game coming up big in that first half has himself a layup and the lead balloons to 13 points and Sydney Curry much more aggressive in the painted area Kenny Payne talk to us about that he wanted him to challenge Sean and you see what it does for his team on the other end of the floor becomes a more aggressive rebounder with her and right now I like Curry once again and you see if you get the basketball inside the zone and give him an opportunity against the big guy another wide open look from the corner for Louisville Huntley Hatfield though made a couple of them in the first half misfire is here in the second and youre okay with that shot if youre kidding Bane and youre not okay with the fact that the Knight gets to the basket whenever he wants and continues to be fishing around the rim well again this is a Western Kentucky team off to its best start in 16 years 81 coming here to Louisville tonight this is a proud program with great tradition although I was surprised Corey the hilltoppers havent been to the NCAA tournament now in 10 years Applause well part of that is because you have to win the conference tournament Applause Conference USA theyve had great seasons but of course anything can happen anymore McKnight Applause no foul called either way and McKnight is down hurt looks like hes gonna walk it off and that stat line is reminiscent to what we saw in their last game Saturday against Wright State efficient not having to get it done from the threepoint line able to get into the paint and we have seen that so far tonight yeah and he has been in attack mode from the beginning of this game getting downhill getting to the rims core thats the third foul on Mike James who spent much of the first half on the bench he will head back there now being replaced for Louisville by Kamari lands but one of the things Louisville has gotten in this game is great production Off the Bench but silly JJ Trainor Applause come in and stepped it up and now its time for the starters to see if they can build on the lead heres lands for three got it so the team that doesnt usually shoot the three well is doing it tonight and the team that is among the best in the country at shooting threes isnt so far land shooting 15 on the season came in three for 20 The Look Away pass Emma flush Applause another assist for Ellis and the easy tune for Withers well Alice is having himself a great time here and not just to scoring his sixth dimes of the night Music ten years ago turnovers that is more important for his team to be successful tonight than would be him scoring 30 plus points well those six assists personal single game high lets see if he can get to 10 Meanwhile point guard for the hilltoppers Davion McKnight with his 14 points here goes McKnight to work once again able to get back to his dominant left hand mist and goes again and is denied great Hustle to save the ball in bounds hilltoppers have it though and great Hustle by McKnight to not give up on the play with Cindy Curry was a little nonchalant going for the basketball here goes McKnight again a little strong Hamilton puts it back in four opportunities on one possession for Western Kentucky sticking to it and now they lead the second chance Poise battle 70 Louisville Second Chance points in this game Ellis bounces through the light to the big man for a layup a nutmeg assist for a career high number seven L Ellis is having a great time in this game hes celebrating after every big play Applause even through the time out once he was running around on the floor looking for someone to hug goes five hole here between the legs to Huntley Hatfield and showing off those arent even goggles those are binoculars he can see things that others dont see with the naked eye Brandon Huntley Hatfield putting together a nice game the sophomore from Clarksville Tennessee has 11 well again this is completely foreign territory for the Louisville Cardinals this year having a big lead like this their largest lead of the season s Applause Music Withers into the lane offensive foul and thats going to be three on Withers the was kind of caught in no mans land on that possession wasnt aggressively attacked in the basket were passing the basketball but only the sixth turnover for the cards in this game and if youre Kenny Payne you have to be happy with that number Music Applause Louisville been doing you better defend Luke Frampton hes only got the two main threes got the ball now great pass on the cut by Hamilton will the one thing Louisville cant do is because theyre playing well offensively forget about what got them to this point that was they did the job defensively in the first half slowing down the hilltoppers so right now theyve got to get back to defensive attitude even though shots are going the right direction Lee Hadfield thought better of trying to feed the ball to the post now five to shoot for Ellen 1524 to go in regulation timeout here at the KFC Youngstown Music it has you know but the thing for Louisville theyre playing better theyve just played against better competition and at the end of the day right now its starting to manifest itself in a lead and well see if the cards can hang on to this for remaining 1520 to get Kenny Payne his first win as a head coach and college basketball first of all Im Brandon Huntly Hatfield and I should mention before we went to break that foul was on Davion McKnight his third for Western Kentucky Music but Louisville open the season as many of you know by losing three straight onepoint games but since that time against only major conference competition they have lost Everyone by an average 25 per game Aycock did everything but the Finish Ellis with a burst of speed unable to get past sharp who takes it in the mouth lets see if hes all right all right weve got a foul on the rebounding action foul second foul on acot and sharp ran into Sydney Curry on that one and Nova you welcome to series Cindy Curry youre going to lose that battle make sure you got all your teeth Music wait what so theyre the broad shoulders of Sydney Curry senior out of Northrop High School in Fort Wayne Indiana nickname Big Ticket ACC network will have the Louisville game against NC State next Thursday catch an ACC matchup dating all the way back to the 1940s in Raleigh let me talk in South Carolina womens coming up Applause the graphic show that weve got the number one ranked womens basketball team in the nation on ESPN2 and well talk about that coming up we got a picture of my man playing with uh Don Staley and well explain why Corey Alexander and Don Stanley were sharing of course well that was just the one time it was caught in the photos Louisvilles defense holds up by 19 Applause trainer gets it back puts it up raised the iron Curry back out to land 43 Applause Louisville still with no Second Chance points havent been great on the offensive glass in this game but have taken care of the defense defensive glass as McKnight comes up with the offense before and now makes the advantage 90 for the hilltoppers in Second Chance points another wide open Corner three for Louisville and it goes down for Kamari land have to call that the epitome of a home bounce or bounces every part of the rim a little tap off the backboard and this is the largest lead of the night largest lead of the season for Louisville back to an eight feet team point game as McKnight delivers again he will not be denied but the thing about this game really has been about Louisville and theyre shooting Applause steal sharp ahead to Hamilton finds the hustling teammate for the Throwdown and the foul Emmanuel aycott will go to the line for a threepoint play and where the cards have been so good throughout this game handling the basketball and not turning it over allowing the hilltoppers to come up with Second Chance points that has started to go away a bit here as of late Hamilton to a cotton to finish Randy Hatfield just adds insult to injury youre not gonna block that one dont bother getting involved in the mix and giving Akon a free throw love the fact on Sharp not only came up with a steal but he delivered a dime doesnt get the assist for it hed get a hockey assist but very nicely done for the young man who was 75 the tallest in college basketball this year well weve got a number of NBA Scouts in the building had a couple of conversations earlier and Im assuming that he would be the guy theyre here why well that time scored right over him and Mike James is letting the big fella hear it yeah James undeterred by seven foot five goes through the body Manu is the basketball round to be able to finish well they had a pro day at Western Kentucky in the preseason for the pro Scouts to come in and see Jamarion sharp so hes very much on there radon and hes got a big hill to climb he didnt start seriously playing basketball really until he got to junior college basketball was not his thing coming up and Im imagining what this thing was because I dont know when he grew to seven foot five but I would have thought somebody would have been saying hey buddy how much you know play with this round ball a little bit he played a little varsity basketball but not a lot Applause Kamari Lance Lansing figures and the bench loves it and this is not a team that has shot the three well and all this season but right now they are getting it done football Applause Kamari lands comes into the year shooting 15 percent from three he knocked down his third on the evening but although I got Fred Whitfield you see Monty Williams Rodney Rogers so many studs in that picture but Dawn and I sharing the point guard position alongside we have Michael Jordan on our team too so that didnt hurt Im gonna say we won because I dont think Google can find out any stats and again that was Dawn Staley bottom left with CA right next to her and then two over was say that was the worlds greatest pickup game yes foreign thats why you were not funny I actually sent that picture to Dawn the other day and uh talk with her for a little while told her I gotta do a South Carolina game she says come on SO Pat Lowry if you hear me I need a South Carolina womens basketball game at some point to go talk about my big sis Pat Lowry one of her bosses back in Bristol coordinating producer in charge of assigning womens basketball games I would think they could get that done for you well I mean being that I put the pressure on now by saying it on National Television I think we can make it happen its as good as done yeah because you sense it now another turnover for the cars they havent handled the basketball as well here in the second half as we saw in the first half and it ends up there being a three on the other end and right now Kenny Payne does not want to allow his team to get sloppy as youve seen Rick Stansberry extend the 131 pressure and it slowed down the offensive attack of the cars lands his past deflected by sharp Louisville keeps balance puts it up and in first two points here in the second half for Ellis given 19 for the ninth but a needed basket as the fans here everyones starting to get a little Restless simply because the cars have gotten a little sloppy on the offensive end of the floor Christian Lander nice looking move in the paint theres another one of my guys he is a bucket young man reclassed up to go to Indiana didnt work out in Bloomington and has found himself in his Dash alma mater of Western Kentucky yeah that was a hilltoppers football player back in the day all right attacks dishes to the corner Applause here is Lander who pulls it back out 63 Junior from Evansville reads high school out of control down the lane he turns it open Ellis trying to make him pay at the other end another well would have been wide open look but unfortunately for Louisville Kamari lands was on the side theres my guy Keith Lander checking out the action rocking his Western Kentucky gray hat talk with Keith pregame made the couple hour trip down from Evansville you know who his football coach was at Western Kentucky I have absolutely no idea sharp with the flood that would be Jack Harbaugh the two NFL former NFL head coach in current NFL head coach Jim and John thats good stuff always going to rely on you for one great Nug in each game I got that out of the way Applause thats been the difference between these two teams Western Kentucky comes in second nationally from Beyond the threepoint Arc shooting 433 percent but its been the cards who have been dominant from Beyond The Arc here tonight Applause foul along the Baseline Well Ellis has gone over 20 points for the third time this season fifth time in his career doing it in many different ways and if you play the numbers you allow El Ellis to take that shot but not tonight is he has been on fire Music the Cardinals bench loves career high 29 points against Wright State did it again against abstain and in the first three games he scored 72 points combined guess who the only Cardinal is to have scored more than 72 points in the first three games of the Season Im gonna go with Jordan Warren on that one am I correct nope nope think Nate Smith Hall of Famer oh wait wait wait wait wait Naismith Hall of Famer Applause mmhmm hes not in uh Springfield tough shot couldnt get the wrong Sydney curry with the left hand the reemergence of Sydney Curran this is the Sydney Curry that Ive been waiting on and more importantly the Louisville faithful has been waiting on all season long Hamilton lost it foul on the floor and if thats on McKnight thats his fourth indeed it is that is number four on Davion McKnight Sidney Perry a seasoned High 10 points five rebounds comes into the game averaging 17 points per game and 36 rebounds this has been this this is the Sydney Curry weve been expecting all season long this is the guy that finished the year last year as a force on the interior for the calls Music offensive foul well lets get back to the trivia question that Corey you were floundering on yeah I mean who has scored the most points to begin a season in the first three games in Louisville basketball history hes a Nate Smith Hall of Famer and theres your answer my goodness that would be one less how did I miss that one thats all right not okay Music Tristan Lander trying to heat up a little bit knocks down to three its been a struggle from Beyond The Arc for the hilltoppers big bucket for Lando on this last possession again Ellis able to work off the ball with Fabio basilian basily has matched his career high as a freshman with six first half forms here he goes working on econ puts it up and the solo slams JJ trainer foreign Applause Music Applause Music ER will Lander knocking down back to back three but that was not the play of this sequence it was Vasily getting to the rim the soft touch doesnt finish so JJ Trainor takes it down with the Thor Music foreign and you have trainer coming off the bench that gives you a different dynamic as well it absolutely does and you see now West Kentucky going to some full court pressure this is where you can see if Louisville has truly matured as a team handling the basketball against the full court its going to be a turnover back for it five nations LL is just losing the basketball so would you say you just jinxed him on that one for him I would not say that I will you stop saying I would not fight it and that is going to be the fifth turnover for L Ellis hitting his season average on the night the only thing that he has done not to Perfection Tyler Olden Has Come Off the Bench no basket because again weve got a player receiving a pass while standing on the sideline hurry and that has probably become the most common turnover since the NCAA win from 199 to 219 the FIBA line a few years back and you often see players standing in the corner stepping out of bounds Music Rick Stansberry repeatedly told us before and after shoot around today dont be fooled Ellis plus the foul he said this is still an ACC team they still have a lot of talent dont be fooled by the Owen nine records and he also said this is still Louisville basketball is King and Louisville there is Talent on this team as L Ellis makes up for the turnover handles the pressure perfectly doesnt play Passive attacks the basket gets the bucket an opportunity for the N1 a couple of years of Tallahassee Community College cant finish off the threepoint play still with 24 points to lead all scores 640 left in regulation Applause Music Applause Music Hilltop was going with an extended stretch without their 75 Center Jamarion sharp on the floor Applause Lander penetrates to the right hand now hes got that quick burst though he absolutely does Stansberry tossed about his quickness and now hell most likely play a bigger role as this season goes along because you see hes a mixup from McKnight hes more of a threepoint shooter oh coming out of nowhere is Hamilton Applause hes got a doubledouble 17 points 10 rebounds second time this year Hamilton has done that Music Withers with a clean look perfect Applause David wilgers is a young man who was in all rookie team in the ACC as a redshirt freshman and he has had an inconsistent career if they can find consistency with him this season it will help these cars tremendously Applause Applause Applause sets the screen for Ellis Withers into the lane and it knocked away Louisville keeps seconds to shoot right to the hole I love that play by LL is not settling for a long distance three just because the shot clocks going down recognizing he could beat his man off the dribble no one at The Rim to help with shot out of the game Emmanuel aycott yes big answer at the other end timeout Western Kentucky and that is their last time out Corey right now Rick Stansberry trying to find a way to get right back into this one trailing 13 for a 29 remains you can feel confident continent Johnson beneficial 1016 from the floor hes been very good from three four out of six and he has spearheaded a very well balanced effort it really has but the wellbalanced effort has come because he has been Distributing the basketball very well when you look at the other guys making shots a lot of that has been awful passes from L Ellis Applause even though he doesnt come away points he does get the offensive four rim run on the live McKnight to the big fella thats an easy two for the hilltop but if youre Kenny Payne youre not happy about that who is supposed to be in Hell position to get a body boy shot not allowing him to have the free run to the rims well sharp rolls his ankle back in late November he still is in a walking boot throughout the day but he is getting back to himself says it feel good and it certainly has looked good on more than one occasion here tonight Applause Ellis Rises up that would have tied his career high so now what cannot happen at this point they cant allow the zone to make them so passive to where theyre taking shots up against the shot clock right now L Ellis has to continue to try to get into the teeth of that zone and find his teammates Kenny Payne encouraging his guys to keep playing dont just get past them passing the ball around on the offensive on the floor even though they have their season high and made Threes And even though theyre better than 50 percent from distance tonight well at this point in the game you dont want to go early Applause make nice no fight for the ball McKnights got it again and once again a player is on the sideline its Frampton this time another unforced error but time is called by Louisville and I can tell you right now Kenny Payne is going to have a conversation with his team about watching the ball waiting for one of your teammates to go get the defensive Rebound in comparison to getting a body on someone and going to get it on your own ACC network will have the Louisville game against NC State next Thursday catch an ACC matchup dating back to the 1940s in Raleigh as the Wolves of NC State seek to continue their winning record coverage begins at 7 Eastern what do you think of NC State this year Corey I think that NC State is playing the chemical style of basketball I believe theyre doing a great job Distributing the basketball and sharing it and of course youve got to play Beyond Smith who is a knock down threepoint shooter but more than just that he is a scorer as well and we get a look at those two these two teams two guys from the state of North Carolina AKA The Hoop State going at it in that game taquavion and L Ellis vote from the hoop state Music there is Ellis in the midst of a marvelous game his first career DoubleDouble with the Tennessee his previous career highend assists was six and Dougie fresh you know in this job one thing we learned to do is relent very well Kenny Payne in the last time out holds up ten five that is fine he was talking about offensive rebounds by point guard Davion McKnight has five offensive rebounds in this game for the hilltoppers which is unheard of of a point guard going to get Bob offensive rebounds and of course coach Payne not happy about the fact that the cards cannot get the basketball inbound at this point and when you havent won a game this is the time where that pressure starts to melt on you you may plays all season long to costume games at this time now you got to start making plays to win a game and Coach Payne trying to coach his team up to make those plays here over the last 305 well Kenny Payne continues to say were laying the foundation but can you truly lay a solid foundation if you dont win games his players need to see the work pay off into a that would be great for everyone in the environment the players the coaching staffs the fans everyone involved it was great to see their hard work pay off in a win and they want to stop hearing about the worst this and the worst that its the worst start in ACC history the worst start in program history since the early 1940s they can put an end to it tonight if they can hold on to the next 305 Music Ellis guarded by Lander here comes the double team trying to get the ball out of Elliss hands and that is the 17 foul on the hilltoppers now heres another area that has been a struggle Ellis comes into the game shooting 68 from the freethrow line and of course at the end of games when youre going to be the primary ball handler gotta be able to go and take advantage of these opportunities especially oneonones who in many ways has the weight of the world on his shoulders as the lead player on this team and he said in a press conference earlier this week to the general press here in Louisville sometimes I get down on myself Im still learning and I appreciate it the way he handled it because its not easy for these kids who are 18 19 20 years old to have this much attention especially when its so negative understandably when youre 09 its part of the deal but it cant be easy it absolutely is and for Ellis whos in his fourth year of college basketball to say hes still learning hes playing a completely different position hes never been a point guard a primary ball handler so hes learning on the Fly this entire season hes never been asked in his basketball career to do everything that Kenny Paynes asking him to do here goes McKnight able to get to the basket and thats the second time that Brandon Holly Hatfield has added insult to injury at that point hes not going to block the shot so dont give McKnight a free throw to try to make it a 10point game at some points you have to see okay Im not going to be able to defend this opportunity dont foul and make it worse young man out of Collins High School from Shelbyville Kentucky who was Mr basketball in the state of Kentucky three years ago Applause she fell off a marvelous night he told me not long before tipoff tonight he was looking to play better than he did his freshman year here in this building and he has done that but more importantly for him he wants to pull out this win Music Huntley Hatfield secures the ball wasnt really the prettiest press break but it was effective but you can hear how antsy the crowd is just on every pass Applause everything here Layton Im not sure if Louisville recognizes the shot clock going down as Frampton Bells lands out big time I dont think Lance did he was dribbling the wrong way with about six on the shot clock and then the foul came with about three on the shot clock Applause thats number two on Luke Frampton but for everything that Kamari lands where he struggles shooting the basketball this year it has not been at the free throw line 15 for 16 on the season time recruit out of Hillcrest prepped in Arizona hes an Indianapolis kid and having a good game tonight one of five double figure scores for Louisville Applause Music Applause foreign big rebound by Withers and Ellis will work a little clock Applause the media double team again to try and get it out of Elliss hands Applause and now Ellis is going to have to go Applause and you know when you look at his percentages on the year I think a lot of it has to do with that with the shot clock down hes had to take a lot of shots like that this season you know but the one thing that the cards are doing theyre not looking at the baskets David Willis catches the basketball in the corner hes driving to the rim but hes not driving to go scores under 10 seconds on the shot clock be aggressive and go score you cant stop playing basketball just because you havent leave thats what the shot clock does you got to get a shot up try to make it the best shots you possibly can down 12 hilltoppers with it time is up the essence for Western Kentucky nice English with the left hand 23 points now for midnight I tell you McKnight is going to be a problem for opponents this year the way he gets to the basket First Team allconference USA a year ago bodies go flying two tops are down and hurting one of them whos backed up third foul on Luke Frampton has been a valiant effort for number 20 absolutely has offensively he has still found his way to the rim Applause hes a man who last season had a triple double 11 points 10 rebounds Tennessees no turnovers in that game College from Danville Kentucky he stays in the ball game as Mike James shoots a one and one Danny Payne first year at his alma mater as the head coach he and the folks here in the building can taste that first Victory still a minute 12 remaining Guinea Payne is not calm yet with a 12 point lead we have seen crazier things happen and right now Kenny Payne just trying to coach this one to a win and help his team finish the game the right way hilltopper is still alive you have to remember Western Kentucky no timeouts remaining so Rick Stansberry cannot stop action Applause Music Applause James runs the Baseline gets it in and the foul is giving with exactly one minute on the clock and now foul down to the Ball Game well I can tell you right now Davion McKnight got at least one new fan this evening Im a fan of this young man he has been spectacular here today I love the effort that he plays with five offensive rebounds at the point guard position Not Afraid at all of the moment hes one of those guys that I would be making sure to keep an eye out on for the remainder of this year and if one of those guys that could definitely take his team to a running Mark so Corey hes a young man whos still finding his voice as an emerging leader on this hilltoppers team thats gotten its season off invest in 16 years and he wanted to come in here put on a show and get a win well he put on the show but the win may not come by Lance continues to go to the freethrow line and handle his business 15 points for lands at career high Applause long rebound to Hamilton he puts it out Applause Music our temperature lands back in front of Applause it well the folks here in the Ville cannot wait to Exhale their 477 seconds away a little bit of work to be done Cardinals with a basketball up by 12 and the hilltoppers have backed on Happy for Kenny Payne happy for the Louisville faithful getting this first win extremely important Applause Christian Lander and so Ellis will go to the free throw line Music one of the best college basketball fan bases in the country opportunity to celebrate their first win on the season Music win number one for Kenny Payne I honestly believe that there will be many more to come but getting this first one has been a challenge thank you Ill tell you what Reese Gaines 20 years ago was the last Louisville Cardinal against TCU to go for 30 points in Tennessee L Ellis is knocking on that door well Reese is right over here in the building Applause watching Elle Ellis become the next to do that 3010 a careerhigh points careerhigh assist Music for L Ellis in the first win for the cards this season Applause will be that in what has been the longest month and a half in the history of Louisville basketball the Cardinals finally get their first win of the Kenny Payne era Music Applause when you say its not okay to celebrate
