as Middlebrooks and Jaylen Washington get us started Ron Gro Jeff Clark Tim clockery on the whistle and the wolf pack has it first with okell running the offense neither one of these teams relies particularly heavily on the threepoint basket but I think one of the keys today will be guarding your man keeping him in front Marcus Hill had two cracks down low gets it for a third time up strong and its two nothing will foul wow Wes he is maybe as good a guard inside finishing in traffic as there is in this league Drake poell his first Venture into the state Carolina rivalry here today hes from Pittsboro North Carolina RJ Davis has been here before hes got a career average of better than 15 points against the wol pack Ian Jackson from the corner an air ball deflected out of bounds last Touch by Powell in the tarel that was a very interesting screen and roll North Carolina of likes to execute that you pass it to Jaylen Washington that time Washington was a little too far outside they need to get that screen closer to the top of the key you see the Wolfpack lineup you will not see Brandon Huntley Hatfield today he uh injured his shoulder here on Wednesday night against Notre Dame little too sore too tender to go today did come out and go through some preliminary shooting but is not available for Kevin KS middle Brooks for oconnell working against Kau Taylor a three two strong middle Brooks the offensive rebound back strong to the basket couldnt finish Styles the former tarel gives NC State a third chance again Dan on their second possession its hard to win if you cant get a rebound oconnell spun out got slapped out heres Jackson one on Three The Freshman behind the back turned it over oconnell from Middlebrooks Washington to beat he went hard to the basket left it short what great play by Washington to just step Applause away quick look Washington the catch and the flush Carolina on the board with Gary Indiana Jr Jaylen Washington boy Washington just stepped away Middlebrooks lost his balance fell down and that and Washington then did a great job running the other direction okon back from middle Brooks a long three front rim Miss cleans it up at distance then deflected and heres kadoo with the steal hes got RJ Davis the layup good Hubert Daviss head is going to explode unless North Carolina gets a defensive rebound here sometime soon can you already tell huh yeah I mean good Heavens 42 Tar Heels heres middle Brooks kick out from Marcus Hills lefthanded three W pack not a great threepoint Point shooting team averaging about six makes a game from behind the line nice job by North Carolina state to get back you have to play your set defense against North Carolina Washington pick and roll got in the air block Applause Music Styles State one of their first eight and that was the twopointer by Hill youre Jaylen Washington at 610 you got to shoot that ball heres Hill in traffic all away good Marcus Hills got all four Wolfpack points and theyve all been either close to the basket or midrange he can make a three not a very high percentage guy but Hills game is attacking the basket and in the midrange Jackson a catch and shoot back rim Miss knocked out of bounds last touched by NC State and here comes Seth Trimble with vin Allen lubben now Trimble is going to be a very very interesting piece in this game today Dan clearly Carolinas best perimeter Defender might be their best defender as a whole and hes one of their better rebounders but Wes look at this this is North Carolinas small lineup theyre playing those four guards along with lubben yep Davis will put it in Play heres RJ on the drive into traffic ishma dof has come in to replace middle Brooks and Carolina couldnt control it turned over in the half court NC State will get it and the wol pack make a sub subtitution Here Comes Brion pass for Michael oconor thats really good defense bottling up RJ Davis in there and Davis if youre in that situation thats North Carolinas third turnover get the ball up on the board Luben is in position for a rebound hes not going to catch that one pass into the front court with hill now Styles Brion pass has been something shooting the ball from behind the line in particular for Kevin Kei this lineup nor Carolina can switch just about everything Hill into traffic dumps in the jump shot Marcus Hill who averages a dozen of games got half that here early wol pack back in Applause front Luben on the catch layup blocked off the window by Styles score the bucket for venell and Luben and well get a timeout substitutions both ways weve also seen NC State get four offensive rebounds early well and of course that thats a great number for Kevin Keats his guys have only converted those into two second chance points but thats one of the areas where North Carolina has struggled theyre they theyve given up a lot of offensive rebounds and North Carolina state is a team that works best when they generate extra Music possession W pack will have Hill Ishmael Doof is on the floor Junior from Quebec and Canada first year with the Wolfpack program Taylor pass and styles with Marcus hill during time during the timeout the goal tending is confirmed two points for North Carolina thats Ron Gro that during the break there was a review Carolina as Dan told you going to break is gone to the small lineup guards and V Allen Luben and one of the thing that small lineup lets you do it let you pressure to the ball and again one of the keys of this game is can you keep your guy in front of you Hill off to a great start for Kevin Keat has all six Wolfpack points heres pass Taylor Seth Trimble right to Brion pass Five to shoot pass back for Styles and a three and the rebound for ven all and Luben thats great defense Applause kadoo there goes Elliot Kad on the drive leaves it to Luben fell off the rim got it back and draws the foul on Carolinas first offensive chance second one that was a great pass by Elliot kdo and if youre Hubert Davis and his coaching staff they all got to be shaking their heads over there you need your big guy to make this basket now of course Luben did a nice job fighting to get the rebound this is just a great pass and Luben wasnt surprised he just didnt get it up on the board Ben Allen Luben 70 free throw shooter North Carolina 742 thats ninth in the ACC that rattle out Drake Powell replaces Ian Jackson Michael OK Connell back for the wolf pack Jaden Taylor will get a seat and Dennis Parker Chun into the line up oh look at this like a line change from Keith and the Hurricanes played here last night so Taylor Middle Brooks and oconnell come in Im not sure if thats power play or penalty kill Man by the way but well I dont think its is a line change you have the first you had it right the first time second one from Luben bounds away Hill the rebound Hill is three for five the rest of the wolf pack 0 for six on the floor here 5 and A2 in the books in this first half oconnell Parker Jr Baseline Trimble did a good job shutting down the path now heres Middlebrooks and ven all and Luben knocked it away hey Vin Allen lubins been productive Dan here in a free Spin yeah he sure has and that time you I think if youre North Carolina youd like to see Ben Middlebrooks trying to drive the ball from from the corner back for pressure by the W pack and heres kdo against Applause Hill Carolina playing with howwell Luben in three guards here back door cut Davis the catch blocked out of there by Parker terrific play by Dennis Parker Jr heres Hill on the attack again Lefty Fall Away and the rebound last touch Jeff Clark says by the Tar Heels theres better block out by North Carolina but you block out and you go get the ball they couldnt hang on to it boy heel is impressive isnt he in transition yep really attacks with the dribble inbounds pass Parker couldnt handle it heres pow the other way bounce pass Davis goes up and under around middle Brooks for the bucket and thats what you cant do if youre North Carolina State North Carolina gets out to go its hard to guard it tar Hills by basket oconnell Baseline to strong rebound Luben Kad skips for Powell spinning into traffic back for Luben crowd wanted to travel Luben gets a basket second field goal for Ben Allen luin he wasnt expecting that pass Wes hes going to the back board for a rebound nice job to keep his feet and not tra largest early lead here for Carolina its four Hill mcconell eight to shoot from Marcus Hill hes going to square up on RJ Davis launch for three kadoo the rebound heres an outl for Trimble Trimble through traffic tried to scooping up it got blocked by Parker another terrific play by Parker at the glass heres Hill digging in runner with the left hand Middlebrook backat had it blocked by Luben good Heavens Koo on the drive got it to Luben he lost it again he surprised this big guy Luben was going for the rebound you got to shoot that ball hell miss the twopointer still a fourpoint Carolina lead they just throwing punches at both ends now not literally but figuratively and missing Luben turned it over Hubert Davis cant believe it heres Hill to the basket and score all eight wolf pack points belong to Marcus Hill and thats what North Carolina State wants to do take those turnovers convert them into baskets on the other end tremble te up a three bounced Applause out these two teams are nine of 29 from the Music floor Parker launches till gets the rebound of course he does right back inside cant finish it and out of there comes Luben Hill looks like hes about to collapse hes taking a ton of Applause shots Pau heres RJ Davis pull up at the foul line good six for RJ Davis now Dan RJ Davis doing a great job moving without the basketball and again I really think thats a strong part of his game that midrange pullup Carolina lead back to four what a fonetic 9 minutes this is started they have gone up and down ell on the ball screen pass a three Hill another rebound and score Marcus Hill has all 10 NC State points believe it or not a next de ball gives us a timeout three ball from the left is short Parker the rebound off the pow Miss and Hill is telling Kevin keiths coach I got to come out I think Jaden Taylors waiting at the table to replace Hill but got to get a stoppage of play before we can have that pass for oconnell Six to shoot the state oconnell the runner wont go Luben ripped it away hell ball will belong to Carolina but more importantly a break in the action and Ry Marcus Hill has got all 10 NC State points on 12 shots from the floor hes done it in a variety of ways Carolina by two in Ry knocked out but hes still playing West he scored a couple of baskets after that while hes holding his contact lens how in the world do you do that and he goes it went into the locker room he just came back out good Heavens Wes now hes I mean hes scored all 10 of their points heres the here his numbers and imagine once he gets both contacts going again that was a oneeyed Marcus Hill doing that 1210 tar Hills by basket won its a good thing neither one of these teams relies heavily on the three because combined theyre 0 for 11 from Beyond the AR Ian Jackson heard you little attack on the dribble drew the contact from Middlebrooks they go to the deck last Touch by Washington underneath thatll belong to State and now thats middle Brooks West interestingly enough thats his 25th block shot of the year and thats more block shots than he had all last season yep well hes really developed into a nice player then middle Brooks still got to work at it senior from Fort Lauderdale transferred from Clemson Styles a three out front and the rebound jayen Withers on the floor for the first time for Carolina Davis to Withers now to Ian Jackson back out front for RJ Davis hes got six to lead Carolina Davis into traffic lost the handle on it theyll go to the deck Taylor and Washington held on and a hill ball called by Tim clockery and its going to belong to NC State on alternating possession Jaylen Washington actually did a pretty good job coming from behind to tie up that ball I mean if he just jumps on top its a foul kevs thought he did anyway North Carolina has six field goals and six turnovers now in this first half and theyve given up eight offensive rebounds to North Carolina state Applause right so Styles oconnell Taylor Middle Brooks and Bry herd whos not played since last Saturday when he played 2 minutes at Wake Forest is on the floor freshman from Chicago midd Brooks on the catch turns with a right hand and one first basket for anybody not named Marcus Hill belongs to Middle Brooks on the Ian Jackson F now middle Brooks is not really a traditional back to the basket type guy but he does a great job recognizing the mismatch and then moving quickly before the double team can get there you see takes that one dribble and North Carolina collapses on him Washington not quickly enough if youre going to do that double team you have to do it while middle Brooks is dribbling the ball then started today his eighth straight ball game for the Wolfpack hes been double figures in four of the last five including Wednesday nights win against Notre Dame his free throws late proved to be the Applause difference and NC States gone back in front on the threepoint trip North Carolinas back to a more traditional lineup bis had it poked away and theyll roll to the deck Washington recovers 12 to shoot Jackson tries to get by herd heres Withers with five now Davis with three spot up on a deep three two strong and bodies to the deck and heres Herd on the run out with Ian Jackson couldnt finish Styles tried to flush it back and a last Touch by herd Who Came From Out of Bounds and Ron gr says still out of bounds I think when he touched it D yes Wes there has been an awful lot of energy expended in this game not really very efficient at the moment but these teams are really going at one another and you know what Wes a rivalry game like this often times he not pretty yep particularly this rivalry but this one is being played at a high level of Applause intensity Applause Powell Jackson thought about the three herd is there Applause defensively 10 to shoot for Koo double team coming Withers quickly into the corner Powell Baseline around ishma Duke cant finish Washington collects and scores on Carolinas Second Chance four for Jaylen Washington tar Hills back in front of basket good job by Washington to just get to the basket p through all the Defenders Styles now the former Tar Heel who is scoreless so far not anymore thats a they called that a two West but theyre going to review it at the next media time out State back in front on the first basket from Dantes Styles and a foul off the ball I believe has been ticketed to Bryce herd itll be his first its the second on the Wolfpack but Kevin Keats animated as always his team up transfer to NC State where he joins three other players that either started their career at one of the other institutions and finished at the other now the most notable of the other three is Bones mckenny who played in the early 40s in North Carolina then went to World War II to serve his country and came back and of course finished at Carolina heres Powell on the turnaround and NC State the rebound Bobby Mock and Fred schwarzburg have also been researched as guys that either started their career at State finished at Carolina or vice versa and they were in the 40s as well yep Ill tell you what if youre in the same on the same list is Bones mcken thats an accomplished yep because for those of you who dont know bones McKenna started at State went to the war finished to Carolina and later won an ACC Championship at Wake Forest as a head coach Styles has got four it was ruled his first bucket of two and now the wolf pack with their largest lead Powell to TI and does Drake Powells first points in the state Carolina rivalry the importance of keeping Elliot kdo out of the lane cannot be overstated pal have forever to wind up and shoot that three great pass by too Jaden Taylors been quiet early for the wol pack missed the jump shot there Withers ccts Ismael doof the Junior from Canada playing a lot of minutes today because the Huntley Hatfield injury Washington had it stripped up on the on the way up and it will stay with Carolina and Hubert Davis get trembling RJ Davis back into the game to replace Jackson and Withers and doof is out middle Brooks has come back Dan Washington Wes he wasnt able to catch that ball on balance if he can catch that ball and bounce right back up its a dunk but he had to dribble and styles made him pay for it by knocking it away Kau for Davis back to Applause Washington tremble Koo on the drive into traffic up off the glass tried to keep it alive did they Scramble for it and out of there Taylor now Hill working against Powell blocked away and Middlebrooks collects hell put it up and draw the foul no travel Tim cler he say so Ben Middlebrooks fourth turnover for NCC state in this first half in a 17 all first half Wes were going to have some kind of a record in this game for Block shots yeah theyre already six combined Dan I I think thats a low number West I know thats what the stats say but good Evans yep well those are the ones theyve charted lets that way yes how about deflections that number would be huge too I thought this would be a little like this I didnt think itd last this long in the first half right lets keep in mind North Carolina is the leading offensive team in the Atlantic Coast Conference they average over 84 points a game they have 17 look at Kau go to the glass thatll be scored and Tim clockery says they want to look at that right theyre going to review that now you have to call the goal tending before you can review it and you review it at the next TV time out heres pass he comes in shooting 54 from behind the threepoint line the senior from Reedville plays about 16 minutes a game for Coach de Styles the last two Wolfpack field goals that one short washingt the rebound of a shot I think that was Al in the corner tremble thought about it hell sneak Face line and boy got rejected and Washington finally picks up the loose ball that rolled around on the floor the three by Kad no good Middlebrooks a Applause rebound eight rebounds for Ben Middlebrooks in his first half Taylor a step back at the front Washington a rebound and a foul going to be called by Jeff Clark now Jaden Taylor Made 64 threepoint baskets last year SP shot over 36 out there but he has struggled from threepoint range so far this year and really he has struggled today third team foul on the wol pack its the first on Ben Middlebrooks Styles out well Dennis Parker Jr gave him a nice lift when he came in the first time earlier in the half you talked about those block shots he has two of them wol packs missed all nine of their threepoint attempts here in this first half Applause kdo working on Parker all the way to the basket Washington off the Baseline Jaylen Washington with six in the first half he and RJ Davis tied for Carolinas honors fourpoint lead again think if youre State youre okay with that one but again paus ability to get into the Lane North Carolina States defense has been outstanding so far middle Brooks Fall Away over Washington too strong they scramble inside look out of there RJ Davis and North Carolinas defense has been fairly Stout as well Davis tremble now with 20 to shoot Hubert Davis is almost at the midcourt line indicating the offensive said hed like his Club to Applause employ Washington now five to shoot for Davis working on Taylor with three two and Taylor bumped Davis and that got the whistle Dan from Tim clockery so Jaden Taylor gets his second fourth on the wolf pack Tar Heels the ball and a fourpoint lead when we continue from Raleigh they decided it was a goal 10 and I think it was just too close to change the call that you made on the court so heres another look at the drive by kadu this is Brion pass by the way whos listed at 6 feet tall yes I actually think that ball was in the cylinder when pass touched it back door cut Davis to catch pass and Middlebrooks there eight to shoot kadoo back for Ian Jacksons three got it well its only a matter of time with that guy 283 of the year for the Freshman from the Bronx Tar Hill lead is seven with 24 40 to go first half 10 nothing run by Carolina last Touch by the Tar Heels over in front of the Carolina bench and Tim clockery says it stays with the wolf pack and remember Marcus Hill scored those the first 10 points of the game for the wolf back and he hasnt scored since its been about 8 minutes since hes been able to score maybe he needs to take that contact out heres pass now for conell screen by middle Brooks pass thought about the three okell will pull the trigger and hit Michael okell first points of the game snaps the Carolina Run 2420 game thats NC States first three there goes Jackson down the lane with a right hand cant finish it deflected out Washington Kau for Davis catch and shoot rattles out middle Brooks an ins side position gets the rebound and draws the foul from Jaylen Washington thatll be the first for Washington second foul on Carolina and another look at oconnell well oconnell is a guy who shot the three very very well last year this year his threepoint numbers are down in fact this year his percentages look a lot like his first three years at Stanford but as you showed you last year when you give him a little time he could be deadly from out there I think his leadership Dan with this basketball team is really underrated just such a valuable piece for what Kevin Keats ultimately wants this entire team to accomplish he is so dependable he is so reliable he is so even Keel conell would tend to shoot middle Brooks right back to him on the ball screen Runner with a right hand and it falls off tremble runs it down with 90 seconds to go tremble trying to create an advantage and it hit off his leg after it was wiped Away by Middlebrooks North Carolina wants to get out and run Wes and you understand that but that time it was a force that was like a one on five you pull it back out seventh turnover on Carolina well I to tell you Wes if youre going to get the ball to the basket or get a shot you got to work your tail off in this game no matter which team youre on yep pass spot up to Luben the rebound got it for Jackson two on two look at Ian Jackson get to the glass five first half points for Jackson you have to stop him in transition West because once he gets going like that hes unlikely to pass it sixpoint lead oconnell step away to the left now back to Middlebrooks Luben there defensively howwell coming to help boy good ball Movement by the wolf P tend to shoot Sho middle Brooks at three missed everything and last touch Jeff Clarks going to have a foul here I its on Davis and RJ Davis will pick up his first third on the Tar Heels he came from behind and hit kill theyre going to put it on the Baseline and you see the Collision here there it is later today in one of the wild card games that would be a tack but spot throw in and now a use it or lose it timeout I Music think for NC State so breaking the action tar Hills by six under 40 seconds to play first half in Raleigh on acc Music Network well final 39 and change here this first half at Lenovo Center in Raleigh and NC State led by three 1714 and Carolinas been on a 123 run to create this sixpoint cushion you see the threepoint field goals they are combined three of 20 in this ball game NC State only shooting 23 overall West yeah they got to feel really fortunate to be down only by six oconnell from middle Brooks into traffic back for ell and another three that missed everything heill the rebound hell force it back up in traffic Luben the rebound of that Miss here is Jackson one onone had it blocked off the window and they Scramble for and the wol packs got it Styles saved it toell who then theyre playing volleyball with it and now Jackson will take a timeout with 118 to go and Hubert Davis takes the glasses off exhales and goes my heavens and Kevin cheats is like no foul well step aside and Raleigh final possession of the first half next Kevin ke litigating still with Ron gr I think he thought there was going to get there was going to get a whistle there for the wolf pack but Dan the volumes way turned up in this first look at here and Parker comes thats his third block of the game the ball is bouncing around Styles theres no foul there he just trips over Middlebrooks and then oconnell falls down while hes trying to save the ball that thats the first half West encapsule right there each team playing with tremendous intensity 7 Seconds to go heres Kad on the drive okell blocked it Middlebrooks the rebound lead pass is deflected by Davis and theres the horn my goodness by chance where everybody to catch their breath West I mean good Heavens fewest points and a half this year for NC State Carolina got six from Washington six from Davis five from Jackson Hill had the first 10 points for NC State today and at the end of 20 uncle is what were going to say sit tight now Taylor tanon bomb with Joel Barry the second and Carlos Boozer Music next ACCC Network basketball were getting ready for the second half between longtime rival State Carolina Tar Hills with a 2620 lead but Wes when you shoot 22 12 from the field its hard to score a lot of points fewest points and a half for both teams this year as we go to the second 20 minutes and the original lineup for both schools won I think the message from both coaches at halftime was guys just calmed down yep tend to shootting RJ Davis near the midcourt line Kau ski for Jackson three out of the corner is good rattles in for Ian Jackson hes got eight on his second three of the ball game Weston that is a heck of a pass across the court like that to land in Jacksons hands in perfect shooting position Marcus Hill had NC States first 10 points of the ball game Taylor on a hard drive middle Brooks oneoff of tying his career high in rebounds Outlet Styles a three and middle Brooks the 11th rebound which ties his career high oconnell on the reset hell drive the lane scoop with the left hand and score and theres theres two more Second Chance points Wes thats a really good decision by oconnell to pass up the perimeter shot and drive the ball to the basket sevenpoint lead for Carolina heres Powell quick look inside Washington the catch hell draw the foul from d as styles styles first first of the half on Kevin keatss team there you see last seven games field goals Carolina first half 41 second half 58 well Hubert Davis would like to would have wished that they could get to 41 in the first half they didnt they shot 38 but hell be looking for that 58 in the second half for sure jayen Washington at the line and the first one no good his season kind of pivoted last Saturday eight points six rebounds five blocks in the onepoint win at Notre Dame hes averaged Five Points five rebounds and he had nine blocks in the last two games Dan well and had a block today so in these last three games he had more blocks than he did earlier in the season yep we had 18 blocks coming into the game he had had nine in the last two thats the first free throw North Carolina has made yep out of four tries heres middle Brooks a catch and score thats a great pass and a great spin move by Middlebrooks without dribbling the ball five now for Ben Applause Middlebrooks kdo slip the pocket Pass Washington draws the foul again going to the basket its a good delivery of the basketball here the foul is going to be on Marcus Hill its going to be his first second on state thats just a great job by Middlebrooks to get loose from Washington and then when Washington comes over he just does a nice job with that pivot keeps that pivot foot gets around gets the easy basket West weve already had two fouls called in the second half we only had seven overall called in the first half heres kdo standing three in the right corner now the three despite what he did against Notre Dame at the end is has not really been Kido shot this year came in under 30 on the season Taylor okell triple and Washington another rebound for Carolina quick out like Kau tar Hills transition with Powell Drake down the lane off the window and in boy that is some move right there Wes one on two time out for Kevin Kats Drake Powell the young man from Pittsboro North Carolina in his first state Carolina game The Catch and score its an eightpoint Tar Hill lead when we continue from ring well the are Tillery that North Carolina has with that small lineup if you will D when they choose it or just their backourt period is impressive however Tar Heels have got a eightpoint lead and you see the total of those four guys today is just half theyre scoring and I think thats because North Carolina state has done such a great job defensively pressuring the ball yep heres Hill Taylor a three from the front is good Jaden Taylors First points of the game come with about 17 18 to go and I think that was a big basket you have to avoid those North Carolina spurts and knocking down a three is a good way to blunt one cuts it back to a fivepoint Tar Heel lead theres Davis on the cut Jackson out of the right corner knocks home a three Ian Jackson now 11 in the ball game first Carolina player to double figures W hes just ready to shoot any time any place yep Hill back for Taylor Baseline against Washington now Connell with 13 to shoot Taylor will try again and Applause hit these teams are looking at us like I dont know what you boys are talking about with shooting problem 3530 kadoo on the drive blocked out by Styles itll stay with Carolina 18 to shoot and styles comes out Dennis Parker Jr who played nine very strong minutes all keatss bench in the first half checks in heres RJ in the traffic kadoo a three bounds away pal Kevin alive at Jackson back for Drake Powell who sets off the mark Washington and middle Brooks got tangled up Paran crowd at Lenova Center wanted a foul on Washington almost four minutes gone in this second half Taylor offensive foul Applause yes third on Jaden Taylor gets us to the under 16 timeout its a third team foul on the wolf pack well theyre barely letting us catch our breath today here in Ry fivepoint lead for thear Music heel Dan were warming up here Jaden Taylor and Ian Jackson have both hit two threes for their squads here in the second half well it would be hard to get colder than we were these teams shot three for 21 total from three in the first half and theyre four for nine combined in the second half and those two guys are the guys who have knocked them down you see the shooting theyve opened seven of 13 they never came close to that percentage in the first half these schools Kau with Jackson Davis Luben and tremble on the floor for the Tar Heels and Davis has really been held in check so far yep T to shoot RJ against oconnell on the drop Runner with a right hand Luben inside rips it away and a hell ball call all will go to the wolf pack on alternating possession thats the third or fourth held ball in the ball game well weve had 10 block shots total and a held balls imagine how if it was the old days and all these held balls were having jump balls all the time still no points for RJ Davis in the ball Music game 11 and 12 minutes in the first half his last bucket theres Parker the runner good tell you the good play Dennis Parkers giv the wolf Back Off the Bench he deserves a little offensive money absolutely threepoint lead for the Tar Heels and Wes sometimes in a game like this you got to get one of your guys coming off the bench to give your team that big lift Davis hesitates Runner right hand fell off the rim and heres Taylor with the rebound wol pack in transition Parker blocked and foul from behind by Ian Applause Jackson second on Jackson First of the half on Carolina West the last couple of shot attempts by RJ Davis have been floaters and normally hes pretty good with those but hes just off the mark so far in this Applause game so heres Taylor at the line he is 74 on the year and the first one good dont forget our ACC Network triple header continues next from Pavilion in Berkeley Virginia Tech meets Cal Dave Feldman and the former Stanford coach and Tar Hill assistant Jared h on the call for you Taylor now with eight and 1 half a pair of free throws and a 7 nothing run by the wolp so Parker the free throws and a travel by Trimble eight turnover on Carolina W youve talked about the fact that RJ Davis hasnt scored since the 11 minute Mark in the first half well Seth Trimble has yet to score in this game and he didnt score the other night Dan in 26 minutes against s okono for Middle Brooks Parker Luben had it they battle for it Middlebrooks gives the wolock another chance Hill hasnt scored since his early Music flurry shot clock at six and OK Conor Parker Baseline spun out Hill another chance and he scores W Luben has had his hands on about four rebounds and he just hasnt been able to Coral wolf pack back in front a 9 nothing run Jackson working against Parker its been turnovers by nor Carolina and offensive rebounds by NC State thats been the difference Pau on the drive scoop wont go Wolfpack lost it out of bounds Carolina will get it back and heres Jaylen Washington into the lineup Luben Luben just cant grab onto the ball Drake Powell for Elliot kadoo Carolina has gone four minutes and change without a basket or a point w they they have been taking really tough shots and I think you have to credit that to the North Carolina State Defense just nothing easy for the tar here Davis into traffic again along the Baseline stepped out of bounds turnover number nine on Carolina Music Applause okon will come in to the front Court Middlebrooks passes on the jump shot for Taylors three Washington another rebound Davis has three first half field goals Applause Jackson and now RJ Davis tremble Washington the catch foul from behind by middle Brooks well so far in this second half North Carolina has not been able to get out and run one reason is theyve had a tough time getting a defensive rebound and when they have been able to get out and run theyve turned it over so a very frustrating start to this second half for Hubert Davis in the North Carolina coaching staff thats not what they grew up Im sure at halftime Carolina one for four at the free throw line Washington is two for three as he knocks that down Ron pass in for Michael OK conell in the NC State order o conell hasnt scored a lot of points West but hes been solid second from Washington hes got nine now in the ball game Carolina back in front pass working against Music Davis and Washington in a mismatch weeps him there flipped it out of bounds into the NC State patch pretty good play by Washington Pass was trapped against the sideline and Washington used that to his Advantage yep Kevin PS trying to get everybody set now pass 15 to shoot oh and heres tremble open floor with pass and tremble will set it down first points for Seth tremble since he missed three games went scoreless on Tuesday night against SMU thats his first points today well lots of times when youre struggling on offense you turn things around on the defensive end almost eight minutes gone here second half Taylor into traffic fall away at the foul line spins in boy thats a tough shot eight and A2 for Jaden Taylor all of his points here in the second half onepoint game Applause again Washington against Middlebrooks back for Powell takes Middlebrooks to the basket and draws the foul thats going to be three on Middlebrooks and a couple of free throws I think on the back end but first breaking the action and Rolling S trible scoreless gets the pick and the punch Tar Heels by one when we come back close the ball game youll see next Virginia Tech and Cal from Berkeley free throw by Powell bounds away the former Northwood charger just the second player out of Northwood High School to play in the ACC Todd Saunders played at Wake Forest he was also a former charger six now for Drake Powell well Wes this has been sort of what we expected of a rivalry game its been really intense not very pretty ishma doof draws the foul and Jeff Clark I think is going to get Jaylen Washington its his second and its the second foul on Carolina Dan and just their fifth of the ball game and these are the first free throws for the native of Quebec Ishmael Duke you didnt know what his stroke looked like but that was pretty good yep hes playing u in part because of the injury to Brandon Huntley Hatfield who cannot go today for the wolf pack doof played at Laval College a year ago average 10 points and four four assists hes got a couple of free throws in his first state Carolina game ties it up at four North Carolinas got to figure out a way to get RJ Davis reinol with this offense Jackson thought about it ell gathers he will beat him on the dribble and score on the drive Wes let me tell you something about Jackson hes always thinking about it yep he is always thinking thinking how can he get to the basket right tar Hills back in front Jacksons got 8 and 12 13 in the game now getting to the basket shooting the three whatever it takes to shoot the ball heres pass and he turns it over outlet for Davis hes got Pow with him hell leave it for tremble in the layup Seth trimbles two field goals have been in transition that was a great Outlet pass by pow fourpoint lead 10 and 1 half to play long way from the house Music oconnell heres doof winding on Washington scoring with the right hand I think he surprised Washington with that move four for ishma duth now Washington a three back rim Miss twopoint lead wolf pint Tire lead Taylor Scoops wont go Washington the rebound Washington had made a three all year I think NC State fine with him shooting it out there yep now 0 for eight after the miss a moment AG go heres Davis tremble 15 to shoot Baseline on oconnell heres Jackson RJ Davis a three over pass is good that is simply great ball Movement by North Carolina nine for Davis the Tar Hill lead five where Carolina stays in the manto man NC state has done a pretty nice job getting inside the lane against this manto man oconnell on the Bounce Down the Lane doof had it blocked heres trembling Carolina this is Jackson lay up good boy that was some Music pass lead back to seven in a hurry its not a turnover Wes but that block shot that turns into a fast break is just like a turnover wack needs a bucket here Dan defense for the most part has been pretty sharp all day 10 to shoot for State Taylor leans in at the foul line and scores oh what a second half hes had and I dont think RJ Davis could have defended him much better on that play 10 all in the second half for Jaden Taylor fivepoint game and Taylors done an outstanding job defensively against RJ Davis as well look at Davis split the double team put it up on the glass Washington the rebound tried to outl it deflect it away and heres Taylor with Jackson okell going to drift behind the line might have cost Inc state two points there and you take that ball and you drive it to the basket where you had an advantage uhoh d a thir tremble the rebound and a blocking call on oconnell is going to get us to timeout Kevin keatss team Trails five at the under eight 248th meeting between State and Carolina continues in a Music moment well of the 247 previous meetings seven times SP in the AC title of course 1959 ever cases team won the regular season John RoR L pillo on that team theres Phil Ford 1975 first freshman to win the case award 87 at the capital Center always good to see Kelsey wngs in a picture uh Carolina won at 97 in Greensboro 2007 that was the world famous tournament in Tampa and then last March in DC as tremble and live action continues Trimble going to save it to kdo Jackson a three two too strong lubing the rebound and a hell ball will go to Carolina and theres the rund down boner that pretty good huh yep no doubt theres the lob for pal What A Catch Bo he really had to go up and get that one didnt he of course he didnt jump as high as Huber Davis did over there on the bench kadoo off the glass and thats what we havent seen from Pau so far today hes not been able to get close to the basket for those kinds of shots and he does that very very well sevenpoint game OK conell got a great screen from Middlebrooks heres styles by the way contes had a flurry and now gets an and one just his first points in the second half but West again another big spot for North Carolina State and they come through North Carolina starting to seize control of this game but Styles just overpowers pow on the inside 67 at the free throw line is dant Styles he played 45 games at Chapel Hill averaged less than two points and shot about 42 from the floor the free throw rattles out hes got six against some of his old mates today Kau bounce pass for Lubin Ben Allen had two field goals in the first half revers is back against Middlebrooks cant score they scramble inside theres Powell and the stick B Second Chance points for Drake Powell hes got eight well hes hes so active lead seven against for Carolina OK Connell another big offensive possession for the wolf pack yep tend to shoot K working on Van Allen Luben couldnt finish Styles fouled on the foot back and the foul is going to be on Elliot kadoo its going to be his first its four on Carolina so were going to get free throws here for D Styles who missed the an one a moment Applause ago and the first one good dont forget Mark Packer and a mirriad of folks join him weekdays at 400 Eastern right here on acc Network and the ESPN app tack will have plenty of things for Monday show just give him the we weekend of nine games on the mens side full card of womens action tomorrow as well on acc Network one of two for Styles sixpoint game at stays North Carolina State needs to dig in on the defensive end particularly last couple times they have not been able to get a defensive rebound and its cost them Jackson against Marcus hill now eight to shoot for Kad skip back for Jackson three from in front of the bench is good for Ian Jackson again Wes what a fabulous pass to Jackson and he gets that ball off so quickly 13 in the second half for Ian Jackson 18 in the Music game lead nine for the tar Hills Middle Brooks through traffic and a foul on PO for the reach I believe will be the whistle from Ron GR and for Powell thatll be his second five on Carolina Elliot kadoo just sees this one West and you dont have time to get back to Jackson on that play but he catches it hes ready to let it go and its gone Pau comes in third and the ACC just less than six assists the game heres Taylor against the in Applause Jackson left corner o Connell hard dribble foul on Kad will be his second six on Carolina six on ncate now second on the sophomore from West Orange New Jersey Connell just put his head down that time he had a little bit of an opening I Hubert Davis is thinking about he talking to Brad Frederick CU at the bench he had to scout on NC State for the Carolina sta okono to the line and I enjoyed visit with Kevin Keats about Michael oconnell and the management of the basketball team more than anything else today Dan just how oconnell has to deal as a veteran guy last year he had DJ horn this year hes got Marcus Hill two different personalities playing alongside in the back court and just his ability to manage that team last year and do the same this year everybody says coaches always say they want their point guard to be a coach on the floor and thats certainly a role that oconnell has filled very successful Powell in the corner skip for Kau at the wing tried to go back to Washington heres turnover and styles for Hill in the layup Hill 16 from Marcus Hill or 14 for Marcus Hill Washington just let himself be outmuscled by middle Brooks on the inside thats an important response for NC State right there and Carolina scrambling for it heres Washington now Hill away for Taylor on the drive and a foul Music call fivepoint lead with four and a half to go third and the foul on Ian Jackson the Pressman from the Bronx will be his third well and every time you think North Carolina might be pulling away North Carolina state is able to get a turnover and get down and score this is just an excellent job and this is what North Carolina State wants to do they can force a turnover they get out and go two shots for Taylor on the Tar Hill seventh foul the free throw Applause good tremble for kadoo well kadoo North Carolina state has done an excellent defensive job against kdo today he has had very few times where hes been able to get into that lane successfully full house looking on at Lenovo Center has hits them both now backourt pressure applied by the Wolfpack at least momentarily on the inbound now weve already had more points scored in this half during the first half yep Davis Middle Brooks trying to help off the switch RJ for Powell and lost it on the dribble Washington cleans it up with nine to shoot back to RJ Davis all the way through scoop and scope four 11 for Davis on his fifth field goal once he gets past your West its really difficult to stop him thats just thats an outstanding play against really good defense yep lead back to five under four to play middle are OK Connell the pull up two middle Brooks did a terrific job with the screen and rerack Dan boy middle Brooks has done so many things well in this game rebounds the ball block shots that was as you say Wes that was simply a great screen Davis a three bounces out middle Brooks The Rebound bounce pass for Hill all the way through Marcus Hill with 18 now and a timeout with 307 to go a break in the action 59 in the second half the Tar Heels are at 48 tremble Washington Davis Jackson and Powell for Carolina his play continues here in Raleigh and the other thing that Taylor has done in this half has played tremendous defense against RJ Davis back door cut Jackson missed it he was too close yep hell the rebound MC State hasnt LED since 1358 to go at 3635 Jackson was just in too big a hurry Wes and that ball slipped out of his hand oconnell all the way through bounce pass for Hill and you got to keep Hill out there on the perimeter once he gets in the lane forget it pull up two got it 10 lead change of the day wol pack in front two and change to go at Lenovo Center and to place is up for grabs tremble thought about it tend to shoot and RJ Davis at the wheel Washington the catch Jackson a three for the lead got it you know thats a great choice by Washington he was 8 ft away Wes but I think that the better option that time was Jackson from out there Beyond three where hes been deadly today another 20point game for Ian Jackson heres Hill eight to shoot on the drive with a right hand scoop thats what are you supposed to do when he gets in the lane like that 10 in each half for Hill hes got 20 tied at 61 Davis fall away two bounces out pal had a crack at it states got it 70 seconds to go two timeouts for each School Marcus Hills got the wolf packs last six thats a tough match up Jackson trying to contain him oconnell T to shoot tremble there back to Hill into traffic lost the handle on it and hell roll it and middle Brooks cant save it turnover on the wolf pack with 41 to play 11se second differential its number nine in the turnover category for State time out here and Hubert Davis wants a timeout hell take the full here one of his two remaining with 41 seconds left but that time his team going to match up against him Jaden Taylor still going to match up against RJ Davis Elliot kdo is the guy youd like to get into the lane to create something here is kdo Washington right back to kdo all the way into traffic tried to get it to Washington does for the dunk what a pass thats an unbelievably tough play by Elliot Kad and Kevin Keats will take a timeout Michael oconnell runs it into the front court with 203 left and a twopoint Carolina lead Jaylen Washington now has 11 in the ball game today hes got 11 rebounds as well left West so Jaylen Washington with a double double this this is a really good job by oconnell and middle Brooks and they try to come to him and thats a nice job by Washington he steps to a place where kdo can see him if he goes across the lane kads stuck but he comes back to kdo gets the ball and he doesnt dribble it he just catches it and dunks it first career double double for hill oconnell with a bit of a size advantage against Kad styles to put it in play Powell defending the inbounds and he does to Hill o Connell the basketball a two to tie a three to win OK conell off the middle Brook screen with eight heres Taylor with six five he will drive to the basket put it up rejected Washington and recovered and the ball game is over Jaylen Washington the rejection and Carolina wins he get get the game winner at both the offensive and defensive end of the Music floor w we talked about the fact that they were going to look to get something going to the basket and since a goal tending was not called this play is not subject to review but Wes I dont think there was anywhere close to goal tending that ball barely got out of the hands was it Taylor who drove the ball to the basket heres another look oconnell delivers it to Taylor Taylors going to take the ball to the basket and that I mean that ball barely got out of his hands and when you take that long West you give Washington the opportunity to Simply concentrate on the guy with the ball he doesnt have to worry about him passing it anywhere this just a tremendous play Jaylen Washington the rejection and Carolina the win and a pretty good job by Elliot kadu to get Taylor to stop and stand up Music 6361 the final 40 minutes of flurry today wasnt it wow wow that was 40 minutes of the most intense basketball West that youll want to see Carolinas won three straight five of their last seven they go to 4 one
