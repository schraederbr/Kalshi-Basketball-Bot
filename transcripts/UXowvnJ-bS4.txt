William and Mary they have 10 new players and Vanderbilt transfer Gabe Dorsey has been great from the three this season and Dorsey is shooting lights out the one thing the Panthers gonna have to do is is stop penetration because if they cant Dorsey gonna be wide open for open threes thatll be the story of tonight and the Panthers themselves have been shooting a lot of Threes in the early season Julia so this could become a threepoint battle or maybe they bang around downside well I hope we have the advantage being that were at home and you know in the comfort of our own house so if thats the case Anders Nelson gave Dorsey Chris Mullins Noah Collier the former pit panther in the starting lineup tonight first ball out of bounds William married to inbound from underneath fit starters Ben White honorable mention in the preseason in the CAA theres wipe down low working on Nelly Cummings with a size Advantage fights through it and gets the first bucket of the night foreign Applause starting five Cummings Elliott Burton Hinson and John hugley starting from the third time this season hugely out six weeks in the preseason missed the first three games for the Panthers and hes still finding his form first shot no good for Cummings and here come the try both teams running that pick and roll set and that action looking to create space for the shooters or hit the roller and the three ball goes down for Anders Nelson typically a distributor but he steps outside and hits a deep one five nothing try for the tribe have ballots scoring all five guys are familiar with putting the ball in the hole so send answers with a triple of his own he loves Stefan hes knocking that down early its going to be a long game Music hes at his best and hes playing with a lot of confidence interior your pass intended for Collier batted away now Mullins wants a three down to Hinson so already a few triples taking on both sides on low on Huguley he was in foul trouble on Tuesday already with a quick one here heres Dane Fisher hes at the helm walking the sidelines for the William and Mary tribe fourth season 2020 CAA coach of the year had 21 wins in his first season hasnt been as successful since Music youre the tribe working into an offensive set Collier first touchdown low works against Henson batted away and no good couldnt looking to push here with Cummins this is where Cummings another at his best in transition Music Applause bat it away good idea Applause John is in the post calling for a working heart try to get a catch on the Block he had a little mismatch gotta figure out how to get him a touch get a better angle on that pass theres a little bit of a size Advantage going in the Panthers favor here but John hugleys being defended tough in the early going I dont know if theres many Collegiate players that isnt at a disadvantage against Hughley on the Block Applause going the other way Jeff Capel Fifth Season at the helm for the Pitt Panthers next win will be 230 for his career of course went to an elite eight back in 2009 with Oklahoma still trying to find his form Five Seasons here Julius and he talks all the time about all the different challenges hes had to face since he got this job and this team is a new look team for him this year its a process you know you cant just build a winning program overnight he mentioned how the vibe around here you know until he mentioned that West Virginia game and how they lost and it knocked the air out of him and he had to get his team back focused and not you know let that linger in their minds and move on from backtoback traveling violations for the Panthers Music so already with three turnovers the first handful of possessions for Pitt heres Collier working against his former teammate Burton and Collier has it taken away by the Marquette transfer Greg Elliott three on one the other way Burton gets valid hell go to the strike first turnovers on one side leads to easy baskets coach Fisher talked about that taking away its the easy ones make them go to the line and earn it Music you know Noah Colliers got to be getting up for this game number five for William and Mary pit transfer spent two seasons playing in this building for Jeff Capel with a number of these guys on the other side hes starting now for the tribe career has 17 points in the opener against Navy you got to think hes going to be getting up for this one for sure you know hes familiar with this this building some of these players anytime you know you got some of your friends on the other side you always want to have a big game Music Im sure him and hugely used to battle a little bit in practice of course Collier played mostly with the second or third unit when he was here but now starting for William and Marion the CAA Mullins and white working together twoman game white beautiful roll to the Lane Music nice solid screen patient Sylvia guy and roll almost 11 points a game for white this years second on the team CAA honorable mention hes in Poland heres hugely with deep position this time he gets it too Music Jeff cable told us Julius that thats what he thought John hugley did better on Tuesday was finally get himself into deep offensive position on the Block well hes getting his legs under him you know he he was out with that injury and it takes time for you to get in game shape and the only way to get in game shape is to play games so you know little by little a little Up and Under for Jack harasinski going around hugely he was trying to take a charge nice move from karazinski gives William and Mary a 96 lead Music I tell you what if this is its not broke dont fix it Im gonna keep giving it to you glucose or I guess you can settled as Im you know running my mouth over here Nellie told me to be quiet to let me shoot this thing right here he wants three forget that inside stuff heres White Applause hes going to work against hugely isowd little contact head fake Up and Under nice move from White Applause solid defense good position better offense nice Up and Under move remind me of Kevin McHale what you know about Kevin McHale I know a little bit about him theres a triple for Burton even he immediately starts talking hes feeling it Applause its raining threes in the Peterson Event Center Dorsey with his first three well Ill tell you one thing and were gonna get into a ThreePoint Shootout I dont like our chances with dorseys gonna be taking the majority of the shots three for three for three from three ball land and William and Mary two for three Applause itll be pitball coming back 1412 Advantage for William and Mary if were gonna have a ThreePoint Shootout Julius this guys gonna need a few Music foreign Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music we thought it might be a ThreePoint Shootout Julius and William and Mary has already turned it into one a team thats much improved this year shooting 42 Beyond The Arc yeah and it starts with Dorsey Dorsey is a guy that can only light it up hes been shooting 51 I think its the way in the world these days I think overall basketball players are more skilled and have the ability to shoot that three ball its not just William and Mary I think Across the Nation seems to shoot the ball better that 42 clip leads the conference and is good for 11th in division one basketball Music Jeff Capel told us that he was going to have to get his defense in line and theyre gonna have to close out on those triples when they take this Balls going the other way Kylie are able to throw it off of Jorge Diaz Graham newly into the game Nike sabandi also on for Pitt Federico Federico at only a couple of minutes on Tuesday hes out there now and hes guarding Noah Collier has to get back after hedging on the pick he has Graham pressuring back out top for Tyler Rice CAA all rookie team last year minutes are a little down so far this season with new veteran guards on the roster second drive there from milk right too strong out of bounds off Diaz Grand gotta like that shot if Im not great gets here sweet spot that nice little elbow Spike space right there I was watching a game earlier today Julius and somebody on the broadcast said that they did not like the pump fake one dribble inside the arc jump shot no what do you think about that yeah I dont know who said that but you gotta you got to be able to do it on all three phases you cant just shoot the three and go to the basket when you add that midrange element it keeps the defender you know off balance big block by Burt and I ask you that question because youre the guy that did things just like that yeah thats a little bit more early 2000s game not like right now where theyre taking threes all the time well I took my fair share of Threes the last time pit play with Mary I didnt make any but you know you want me to bring up your stat line in that game the triple single yeah bring it up bring it up last time William and Mary and Pitt played was back on January 3rd 2004 my man Julius page was a senior on this pit panther team oh for eight from threepoint range that day what was going on and the coach left in the end well you know what was he thinking talk about Thanksgiving sluggishness its probably New Years sluggishness for you that day I looked at it and didnt think something had to go on Ill play 35 minutes and only scored Four Points its absurd all four from the free throw line so you got to the line its all good yeah but we won the game thats all that mattered exactly one by fifteen thats it thats it thats him Geron Brown was big in that game Carl krauser Chevy Troutman thats right Chris Taft was a youngin played well the one thing I wont let you off the hook for is you did play 35 minutes so you had ample time to get your stuff together you know that jump shot was looking broke out there Federico stuffed inside going back for a second effort and back outside here to Burton one dribble pull up that ones good Music thats his game that midrange he liked to get in there I appreciate it Applause Burton improved from the threepoint line this season as well Panthers wanted to travel on the drive by case now rice in the pick and roll with Collier heres case thought about the three now inside over Federico its tough to get it over his long arms now Cummings in transition lovely move to get the shot off gotta just have to finish it Music off the ACL injury from a season ago reverse to Burton he wants another rattles around theres Collier able to get the loose ball taking it away from sabandi itll stay try basketball Applause were battling down there Music one thing that I thought was really interesting from Jeff Cables comments the other day after the win on Tuesday was he said that he sees Jorge Diaz Graham as a wing gonna have to learn how to bang around inside but right now youre talking about a 611 190 pound forward seeing him as a stretch Wing Kevin again you know its a new day these guys pushing seven feet have the skill set of guards why not you know obviously hes a freshman so he has to put a little weight on but you know if Im if Im him or if Im any young kid six eleven seven feet tall you gotta have that three ball you got to be able to handle it the days of Shaquille ONeal I dont think theyre long gone or not not coming back anytime soon totally agreed you know theres theres things that he can do out there that not many 611 guys can do just like this stepping into a triple is D brand threepoint lead for and what can you do about that at 6 11 are you going to get up there and contest and block that shot absolutely not a problem for a lot of teams obviously coming from the international game an IMG Academy over here in the states played Euro ball with Spains national team and I think his ears were ringing right there Julius hits a three as were talking about him Dorsey answers with one of his own were gonna have to find Dorsey let him get it going early you can be in for a long one teams are combined seven for 11 from three land tonight travel on Diaz Grand daughter tied up at 17 the ThreePoint Shootout continues here in Pittsburgh a big area of emphasis in the off season for Jeff Capel and his staff whos adding threepoint shooting an area they struggled in last season only 28 so far this year but tonight four or five its final looking looking like it could come to fruition here yeah you know surrounding hugely you know with the Personnel that would make it difficult for teams to double team I think was very smart um at the same time I believe his team has just fallen in love with the three I think theyre shooting so many more that youre not really seeing the influence the percentage was that you would want to see I think Jeff Abel has been okay with it for the most part because hes seeing those results in practice is what he said after the game on Tuesday it hasnt materialized in the games yet but this is probably the best theyve shot in terms of a streak of minutes together so far this season yeah I mean Elliott Henson UV can shoot it Nelly Cummings not the personnel Music when theyre not going in is what you should be worried about though when they had that drought what do you lean on right Force feeds your big man do you you know can you get the stops on defense to keep you in the game Music Elliott right on cue taking a three but missing the Marquette transfer was the big addition from Beyond The Arc they thought hed be their best shooter takes a step inside and hits one here maybe thatll get him going a little bit pull up when they closed out a little too hard you gotta be to take that one dribble be smart enough not to go down there with the trees heres Dorsey threepoint shooter in his own right only four of his attempts this year were inside the arc coming into this game Nelson wants his second three and Nails it Music three ball by sabandi its a good ball rotation offensive rebound to Federico Music Elliot stepping inside nice jump stop and a fade little too strong and white down with it Music lets drive and one for Anders Nelson forget the three Im gonna get three the hard way the oldfashioned threepoint plays its just getting downhill on a guy using your body being able to finish through contact knowing that youre gonna get hit Music nice strong move Music Anders Nelson St Thomas transfer into the program spent four years there so hes in his fifth year of college basketball Minnesota native 75 career games in double digits two of them this year normally a very good free throw shooter cant connect on the back end of the triple thank you screener roll action its kind of a slip screen from Huguley as he reposted doubts inside now sabandi will reset guarded by Dorsey back to the pick and roll game mismatch inside for Hughley so Bandy kicks it out takes it three from the top of the key no good Henson bang around down there hell draw a foul trying to look for hugely on that role whether he sets it or slip it theyre trying to get it to him Mullins with his second personal foul Hill head to the bench five point lead for the tribe inside of eight and a half to go in the first half Music sabandi on the drive kicking Elliott quick trigger Hinson offensive rebound cant get them put back to go down Music and itll go the other way yeah hugely whether he said it or he slips it hes a big body forces switch right there they just got to figure out how to reverse it quicker and get it to him faster its too slow you got to keep the ball moving Music Applause you dont want to tell your guards not to be aggressive but if were doing an action where we want to get him the ball just move it and get it to him Applause offensive rebound to William and Mary heres milkwright inside looking for help he finds it see his case kicks it over to Nelson eight on the shot clock Music and a defensive breakdown for Pitt Nelson finds case cutting to the Lane call Elliot Beacon way to move without the basketball Music shoot behind their bench gets a little loud good pass inside to hugely hes hammered and that ball rolls off the rim the tribe are not afraid to step into the Pete here on Thanksgiving weekend a seven point lead for the tribe and what a pass here from Nelson you gotta keep his head on a swivel he caught got caught sleeping gave up the easy layup gotta do better theres never been a better time to get away Huguley and Tuesday was one of his better ones 17 points a season High yeah knocking down to three something he can do he can put it on the floor but this is where hes a beast when hes attacking the basket and hes a load down there on the Block it opens it up so much more for his teammates and can get them involved with guys closing out under out of control so I love the fact that he can do so many different things but let him get it going on that block this is a different Panther team weve had him almost exclusively in the screen enrolled tonight he slipped some hes gotten a decent look like that last play just before the break where they throw it over the top to him he gets to the line here three points tonight now four Applause hes taking one shot attempt hes a load to take care of you know how are you gonna guard that screen in a row youre gonna hedge it youre gonna switch you definitely cant switch it hurt John hugley one of two returners in the ACC to average 14 and a half points per game and seven and a half rebounds per game last season the other guy being Armando bacon we know what he can do so John Huguley a premier big man in the ACC however still working his way back getting his conditioning back missing six weeks in the preseason in the first handful of games for Pitt Music with the upcoming schedule against Power conferences they wont need him to find his legs as quick as possible hugely download defending his former teammate Noah Collier now Nelson going to work a little Steve Nash turn around but short rim on that we call that a die move with a nickel shot its not worth 15 cents inside the Hughley hes doubled immediately somehow finds some space over Collier and gets a deuce thats it right there you can just throw it to him show some patience gonna get doubled down there he has to be able to just pull that ball High look around maybe make a pass out of it or find the way to the rim Nelson with the shot fake caught Henson for a second there now milkwright picks up his dribble Hughley doesnt step out on white tries to take the jumper look at the hustle from case a couple nice plays from him and thats exactly what it is being out hustle being out tough Applause thats one of the things coach cable said that you can control how how hard you play Instant comes in there and literally punches that ball against the backboard gets his own rebound and puts it back in thats a couple big bodies down there for Pitt Blake Henson six seven two thirty five John Hughley 69 265 loose ball on the ground Burton comes up with it you might need to put these boys on the defensive line for a football team Music reversed Hinson wants three gonna be a foul on Collier here Music Applause just being out hustle thats it you gotta find a body to block out look at Henson he just batted that against the backboard like its volleyball well after being out hustled on one and he he felt he couldnt have two possessions where he wasnt given maximum effort so they called a foul here on Collier kind of late on the Henson three ball so three free throws for Blake Henson Mississippi and Iowa State transfer started 58 of 60 career games at Mississippi brings some experience to Pitt a big body and he leads his team in scoring in the early season I think the big thing for pit fans to hang their hat on with Hinson is that hes got one more year eligibility left after this and these days if youre gonna use the transfer portal to your advantage you got to get guys with more eligibility than just one year tie game 28 a piece five minutes to go Music theres that pick and roll action great good Hustle step back three for milk right no good look at that case coming in trying to dunk it on the offensive rebound still battling down low and white gets fouled gotta be tough down there its a lot of pushing a lot of tugging a lot of grabbing hoe and cheating all of it yeah theyre on the boards you got to block out be willing to take a l board too Music and white to the stripe second on the team in scoring this year 75 free throw shooter Music Applause trouble grabbing it was hugely but Pitt eventually comes up with it tight game at the Peterson Event Center ball reversal tried there from Cummings stay Panther ball you have to give the tribe credit theyre doing a good job discouraging the past with active hands you know as bad as I would want them to be able to force feet hugely hes not really a clean look theyre making it difficult to get it to him fall reversal to savandy steps into a rhythm jump shot and Nails it foreign Music heres white nice little slip and a lefty finish white looks very active you got a guy playing as hard as he is its got to be hard for John Hughley to keep up with him right now with his lack of conditioning putting a pressure on him making him play defense as well Were not gonna let you relax thats what hes saying John I understand you you know you will load the handle on offense but Im gonna make you play some defense hence into the cup it did a good job of spelling that 122 run before the last TV timeout they were on a threeminute drought one for their last seven and theyve weathered the storm here to take the lead back 3331 see his case wild shot against the glass another battle and one for white Music its working down there Ben White working hard down low Julius grinding it out for the try Mary in this game on a road floor in the ACC largely thanks to Ben White with 137 already surpassed his season averages and when it comes to effort I think thats the one thing you just got to give him a lot of credit for you know hes out here battling offensively and but defensively on the other hand hes making Henson and hugely work so hard so you got to really be proud of this young man averaging ten and five on the year heck of a first half for Ben White you said it hes just flying to every single loose ball especially on the offensive end just dont want to be outworked thats an attitude Im not gonna quit not gonna watch Im gonna find somebody to block out Im gonna go hard to the glass just gotta make up your mind fails to connect on the back end of the N1 heres some Bandy with a tough Drive rebound down the case Applause well Julius we talked to the top of the show who was going to survive through that Thanksgiving sluggishness that could be happening both these teams look pretty good right now pretty good yeah you disagree no its a game of run at times they both look like you know the alarm clock didnt go off for them yet but you know theyre still competing its a lot of game left its a great that cut from Jack kerosinski The Freshman Applause Music karasinski has four thank you I would like to see him get him in the air force the issue force the issue Mr Cummings Music Applause this is just what I mean by the you know losing your man not seeing balling man you saw Henson jump to the ball and then he jumped to the closeout but there was nobody there anymore great awareness by karasinski that was the extra grave you had last night thats it put that comment away from me youre like absolutely not theres white working down low again draws a foul against Federico well the way the way Whites plan it looked like he had a salad yesterday he definitely had a salad I agree its very light on his feet I cant say the same for myself I dont know about you Im in the same boat with you thats why we just sit here watch them run around Music nice action from William and Mary there Nelson picks up his dribble white with it Applause he wants a screen for case he does case takes a three ball no good Applause comings down with the rebound Applause batted away loose ball theres Dorsey active fans deflections something they keep track of in practice getting hands on balls dont always have to be a still sinsky and a good find from Dorsey you can just see the tribes confidence growing with every single bucket of four point lead for William and Mary Henson watching a dribble come right to him and losing his man every single time gotta keep his head up Music Meet The Man Behind chip 60 run for William and Mary forces it time out Pitt with no points in the last two and a half Music fundamental mistakes losing your man watching the ball triple towards you Applause the Panthers gonna have to get better at before ACC and taking care of the basketball another deflection there karasinski forces the turnover Anders Nelson hes got four assists tonight pulls a triple from Deep rattles out hidden transition under 30 seconds to go in the half theyll take a timeout and try to set something up a couple of teams in three and three Jocelyn for a win here in Pittsburgh Music its still without a point in the last 310 here they take a timeout to set something up what would you go with here Julius Im gonna put Burton in a pick and roll action you know hes a guy that could shoot the three but also get in the lane to make things happen and kind of just have confidence that hell make the right decision Music seven and a half seconds to go in the first half William and Mary have come out swinging in the early going take a four point lead here Music about a one second difference between the shot and game clock for jamarius Burton see the drought up to three and a half minutes now for the Panthers Music a lot of bodies up top Cummings working with it under five to go gets into the lane a lofty shot with a left hand Collier comes down with the rebound and thats how the first half will conclude Music solid defense by the tribe stay in front of the man hedge hard on the screen cant ask for a better defensive possession the Panthers end the first half with a three and a half minute scoring drought William and mayor cooled off since in the latter stages of the first half and another thing that coach Dane Fisher told us is he said he wants to win the ratio between Music excuse me between offensive rebounds and turtles I was looking at the numbers here 10 offensive rebounds for William and Mary in the first half to three turnovers and thats the first time I heard a coach compare those two stats so whos really when he said I was like huh yeah thats definitely how I want to approach the game and it indicates taking care of the ball and working hard down low just like Henson does right there to narrow the deficit to two Music established inside early and often in the second half going the other way Henson draws the offensive foul Music Dwight picks up his first personal Henson looks energetic coming out of the locker room and thats I love when he played Inspire in basketball I think hes at his best when hes doing all the theatrics and hes having fun up there Music bit of a sell job there I think but regardless takes the turnover heres Burton backroom no good and Anders Nelson pushing it Forward four assists in the first half Anders Nelson one of the better point guards in the CAA 43 to 1 assisted turnover ratio leads the conference thats what you call getting it done comes from behind Nelson thatll send him to the charity stripe Nelson also leading the conference and just assists per game with almost six Music Dane Fisher told us hes absolutely loved the addition of Anders Nelson he could talk about him for days a winner great passer sets a good example for the rest of the guys and hes immediately moved into a starting role for this tribe Squad and hes tough getting downhill getting to the basket expecting to get in touch I have to finish through contact Applause solid solid Gotta Have solid Point power point and hes been good running the offense tonight overall now up to 10 points and four assists for Nelson and theres Burton with a three Music Burton now with nine averaging 14 and a half on the season good for second on the team Music Nelson facing off the last two scores Music gotta run Dorsey up that threepoint line Mullins in a while two personal fouls in the first half hes back out there to start the second now Ben White a big dunk on the great Rolling Pass nice look pass over the top thought Dorsey was just a shooter Music he enjoys sharing the basketball as well Cummings download a hugely quick start over the top of white thats going to be a timeout for Jeff capels Squad now a onepoint deficit but he saw something he didnt like Music early timeout for the Panthers William and Mary still with a one point lead Music its the fundamental things the Panthers gonna have to improve on in ACC play not allowing the ball to go side to side hedging keeping active fans and helping the Helper against the more athletic athlete ACC teams theyre gonna have to get a lot better at doing a little things on the defensive end and you think that might have been the reason for the quick timeout from Jeff Capel to kind of regroup on the defensive assignments yeah moving the ball from side to side has to be discouraged ball pressure to not make it so easy to make perfect passes a guy has to hedge or its thinner screen you cant just leave them out there on the island we dont have to help the helper bring somebody from the opposite side cant leave it you gotta you gotta work with your teammates you got to talk communicate with how hard Ben Whites been working tonight I think if youre Dane Fisher in the tribe you want to put John hugely in as many of those pick and roll situations as you can and force him to make a decision and theres the first adjustment right out of the timeout for Huguley jumps on the pick and roll quickly now white with a contested try they score anyway but a good defensive adjustment from Huguley like you said solid defensive pressure right there much better than weve seen in previous possession he just made a decision theres Henson with an and one Applause nice strong move just being the aggressor its inevitable down there with the big guys thats one heck of a pass from Huguley as well Henson now up to 148 averaging 15 points a game this year five games and double figures make it six tonight completes the threepoint play to tie this thing up defensive focus of course and Jeff cable all year has been concerned about and he said their best game was probably Tuesday so far tonight theyre clearly working through some things yeah theyve never been full strength you know theyve had guys battle injuries and its so hard with your rotations hes still trying to put the pieces together and see what rotations work Dorsey short on the jumper Applause offensive rebound offensive rebound number 11 for the tribe white making a strong move underneath the fade away gets it to go Applause another fundamental mistake you have to contest the shots test shots Applause the advantage in the paint for the tribe now up to 16 30 to 14 Music heres off the offensive rebound white going right at Huguley again I think you can make that shot a little tougher but white no he needs a break now you need a little Im working out there coach I need a blow white was 17 minutes tonight 19 points and eight rebounds Hughley is getting frustrated and rightfully so hes work is hes working hard down there Applause doubled from the backside by karasinski gets fouled Music oh yeah seriously down there watch him work Music Applause Music another three from Burton now up to 12 for the game Music battling back and forth here at the beat foreign Music ERS Nelson karasinski nice pump fake to the hole cant finish Burton in transition looking to push nobody inside for Cummings to find so he pulls it back out and resets a pick and roll with Huguley here Music looking down low Huguley the double team comes immediately finding space is hugely a little wild but he does draw the foul Applause Panthers have made their last four shots starting to gain some momentum against the tribe Music theyre all catch teeth thats a good day on Thanksgiving weekend come on Coach youre a Pittsburgh guy now I understand you will love it out of school but you cant be doing this to us man you cant be giving them the inspirational speeches before the game getting them off pumped up to beat the Panthers come on yeah head coach Dane Fisher met coach Tomlin at a golf event and William and Mary back in the spring and when he said hey I think were going to be playing Pitt coach Tomlinson all right reach out come on down to the facility when you come so they made good on that good for those guys heres Dan Fisher Im just messing gotta show you guys some love Ill get it I get it coach cable and Coach Tomlin are good friends and Coach Tomlin said hey you gotta give me something to brag about when I see Jeff for the next time this Balls going the other way and another interesting thing for William and Mary tonight their bench is a little bit short theyre down two assistant coaches tonight assistant coach Mike Allen and his wife Shannon had a baby boy Judson Jack Howland so he wont be with the team tonight theyre back at home their first night at home with the new baby congratulations to them and then Nate Bollinger the best man at his brothers wedding this weekend apparently they didnt get the memo that there was a game you know congratulations to you guys family family come first you know you can always play another basketball game but youre only going to see your baby be born one time now my brother I might have highs game with the highest Im not coming to your way no Im just playing well the brother should know you know if youre gonna get married probably pick a pick a better weekend than Thanksgiving weekend you know yeah he didnt take it easy on the family at all you know a Collier second free throw attempt is good thanks everybody for being with us on Thanksgiving weekend Kevin wheeler and Julius page the former pit great with you tonight Music Julius is holding it down for me as I struggle through this game I appreciate it come on you always carry me are you serious no sir okay this pass from Huguley creative play and sabandi finishes it gonna move without the basketball Applause its going to have to be on this end getting a stop Collier goes into the chest of hugely Hughley will get the foul Collier back to the line Music hugely putting it on the ground and we got dimes come on the no look and then on the other end trying to take a charge just didnt quite get there I was close know what it is its a tough call though so I feel like the blocking charge they did give him the foul really yeah I didnt see the uh the signal by the Riff but theyre gonna send it the other way hugely great backtoback plays for the Panthers double coming from the Baseline passing out of it is Huguley a wide open Cummings drains the three Applause the transfer Porter will do for you you need to surround you best player with more shooting bring Nelly Cummings in Henson in Elliott backtoback assists for John hugley up to four now now guarding White spinning Baseline no good good defense from Hughley a two on one for the Panthers sabandi takes it to the rack gets it to go count the basket in one way to be under control Music run the floor take the hit Strong Finish thats gonna Force head coach Dane Fisher to take a timeout Panthers have hit their last seven shots and 111 run over the last two minutes and 16 seconds it is one of the making sweat a little bit Kevin I mean thats fine I need to sweat out some of the turkey you know get rid of this feeling a little heavy today apparently they did too working through it in the first half but right now whatever was said at halftime they the Panthers look way more energetic here in the second half I think it was just hustling you know they came out a little sluggish allowed them to set the tone and bring the fight to them now theyre showing some poise moving a basketball cutting the game is not difficult you just gotta settle in theyre narrowing the margin too and the points into pain which means theyre getting more aggressive down low at halftime it was 248 now its 30 to 18 so the Panthers with a 10 point advantage in the paint in the second half so far hit some jump shots as well I think the big story here is John hugley dealing with the double team the way he has been in the last few possessions taking your time finding the guy complete the threepoint play Mandy up to seven points now in three of six shooting Music 54 tonight William and Mary 46 Applause little single double action I like it little will trying to get Dorsey open ERS Nelson showed the ball went back Music Nelson crafty point guard for the tribe takes care of the basketball no one to be aggressive want to Dish it right here know hes going to get hit finishes the play Nelson cant complete the back end either hes up to 12 for the game Music 53 from three tonight much improved on their 28 clip for this season eight of 15 from Beyond The Arc Music Cross Court pass from Hinson for sabandi to get up back over to Hinson he wants a three now cant have it and well stay on this end Applause if Im coach cable Im gonna show this possession right here where they have to move the ball so that human can touch it on the inside hes working extremely hard to get a catch youve got to reverse it so we can get a catch Music here with 13 minutes left in the second half front end is good Applause hugely now four of five from the stripe tonight four assists ten points Music Greg Elliott comes on Cummings to the bench Music with an eightpoint lead seven lead changes tonight weve been tied eight different times this is the Panthers largest lead Music that cut from Mullins kicking it out to karasinski too strong way to move the basketball good offense by the truck this line drive sabendi Huguley steps into a rhythm jump shot and he Music can try he will be making a three you in trouble the Panthers smell blood here at home 11 point lead Nelson cant find it white cleans up the mess down low Music white now with a gamehigh 21 points season High Music Burton off the glass and good theres that midrange game gotta love it gotta love it using a window right there this game has opened up significantly good slip there from karasinski and a blocked shot by Hughley turns it away three on two for Pitt Elliott from Deep no good its a good shot though transition after a block one of your best Shooters open for three you want to take it all day that threes no good so Bandy fighting for the rebound he falls out of bounds its gonna be William and Mary basketball Applause John Hughley working his way back into this season 14 points tonight four assists step outside big fella hit a triple for the Panthers foreign and theyre getting it done exactly how we expect it Burton off the dribble doing a midrange game hugely down low and hints in the combination of both getting threepoint shots down there hustle points thats what you expect from these three guys The Big Three had 46 points combined entire game on Tuesday theres 11 and a half minutes left in this one and they already have 43 all three of those guys in double figures the only three Panthers in double figures everybody has no problems Music Pitt has hit nine of their last 11 from the field Music pass underneath for Collier so Bandy active hands takes it away forces turnover number seven its good preparation and so that they knew that out of bounds play was going to look like something we work on during a walk through skip pass to savandy it goes down four Panthers and double fingers now Music youve got slipper to screen I kind of like the look so Bandy with a blocked shot largest lead for the Panthers at 14 Music another skip pass for sebandi can he hit another not this time hugely down with the offensive rebound working on Collier stepping through and he traveled on the way Music to help the helper here for sabandi and on the other end theyre double teaming you guys so you got to be ready to catch and shoot the jumper looks smooth right there hes ready for it Applause four second half turnovers now for William and Mary had only three in the entire first half that one was halfway down and comes back out for karasinski Rebound down to the Panthers foreign looking very energetic in the second half over the last couple of minutes in the house can come to try the other way off the turnover leading it to Collier stepping through and finishing another assist for Anders Nelson thats six for the night gotta recognize that mismatch sooner got Nelson on Huguley down low on the Block foreign Music Applause hit with a five rebound advantage 2924 Henson theyre gonna call the foul on Henson there Jeff cable wanted to travel Christmas hits and picks up his third person its close I thought it was a travel live the foul goes to Henson now Noah Collier to the line one of two tonight Music Applause dollar a 59 free throw shooter now starters coming back in white Dorsey back in Huguley heads to the bench so now to be interesting with white back on and hugely on the bench what happens there William and Mary force a run down low Music Applause Music Federico Federico in with some fresh legs so working in the post quick pull up pretty moved he just looked so confident as soon as he caught that ball you knew he was going to score Music posted up a little bit for the guard I like it see his position on his basketball everywhere big shooting threes guys posting up yep Applause Outlet pass for Elliott cut off by Nelson he picks up a foul Applause yeah youre looking like a young Dwyane Wade right there oh you see the little hook too if you do it quick enough they dont see it yeah chicken wing thats right yes foreign hes got a game that you would appreciate for sure hes a solid allaround player you know even in the pick and roll hes really comfortable running it so to have a guard that can score the basketball in a midrange but can run the pick and roll for you opens up so much three 1000 Point scores in their careers in the backcourt for the Panthers only one of three division one schools that can say that UAB and Notre Dame the others Bert Cummings and sabandi speaking of Nike picks a pocket coming the other way splits the defense and one Music cookies thats what we say when you just take it from a guy like that let me get these let me get these cookies right here and he didnt get caught with it in the jar that time nice aggressive move finish Music thats getting it done right there Nike sbandi torn ACL a year ago missed the whole season his best game of the year came on Sunday with 17 points against Alabama State looking active in the second half now with 13 points tonight 70 Run for the Panthers in the last 40 seconds starting to find some of his old form Bryce stepping into a jumper way short Applause team point lead for Pitt theyve found life in the second half Music six second half turnovers for William and Mary its been the story Burton stepping through Federico fighting for it and Mullins comes away with the ball showing confidence in them in that post area Music white looking to score blocked by Federico Panthers with some numbers Elliott flips to seband he thought about the shot now Burton back in the post once again Elliott steps into a three back iron its a good shot Dorsey wants three no sir Music 18 point lead for the pit Panthers theyve outscored William and Mary 3816 in the second half and in the Julius page Jersey he would destroy you in a dance competition absolutely easy thats light work look at my man in the Julius page Jersey he would destroy you in a dance competition Im easy thats light work for him look at him he loves it love the Jersey hes only hes only one bitter part to this right here and thats that the nil came 20 years too late youre not getting anything off of that nothing nothing the Panthers have been feasting here in the second half 38 points on 50 threepoint shooting producer Jason Earl said in our ear its the second half team yeah I tend to agree I think they know that Im a fan and they just like to make me sweat a little bit maybe thats all that is the old head is here Panthers 510 from three in this half obviously been defending better forcing more turnovers Applause Federico with the tap back Burton wants a three Shooters roll perhaps no but look at some Bandy on a springboard puts it back in effort plays first with Federico getting his hands on it Music so Bondi with the follow teen for Nike underneath there white spinning toward the net Music wide open shot staying active standing to play found the Gap six rebounds now for Nike sabandi as well four assists just filling up the stat sheet 23 minutes of play Ben White now has a new career high 22 points and 11 rebounds a doubledouble for him tonight and earlier he was really everything for William and Mary kept him in the game gave him the lead and playing with energy theres Nike sebandi in the first half in the second Applause rebound to Hughley Music William and Mary no field goals in the last three and a half minutes its almost as if when the Panthers played better on offense they also played better on defense weird concept skip pass nice job by Elliot to keep it in it was batted but right back to him still battling for the rebound its hugely he cant find the put back either Applause Music Applause good pass into white big dunk over Hughley all right strong move take the hit finish Music both ways way to run the floor white but also to contest cant be mad you need your Big Fellas to protect the basket you know it happens to the best of us Music hugely with three personal fouls tonight white with 24 cant make it 25 Music hes now just two of six from free throw line tonight Music what a career high he gonna be hating that he missing he left four at the strike I could have had this 30 something tells me you might be more worried about the scoreboard Applause to his right able to absorb the bump its not much you can do with that Music Huguley five of seven from the field tonight five of six from the freethrow line to Bandy another rebound back cant hit it man the Panthers have woken up second half got rid of all the turkey in the first half got rid of the yawns came back out with some energy theyve outscored the try but 4219 here in the second half gamer runs gotta weathered a storm keep your composure keep fighting Bryce is short on the three once again might be a foul called here Applause its going to be on Noah Collier so free throws coming for Pitt so Collier has just fouled out four points one of five shooting four rebounds in his return to Pittsburgh five thousand four turnovers not the return he was looking for Im sure all due respect he had his hands full Madeleine Henson and hugely down there knows what thats like of course with you Glee battling him in practice for the last two years maybe a teachable moment here for head coach Dane Fisher in his fourth season with his new starting forward Noah Collier Henson to the line first one is good hell figure it out still early in the season new team new system go down for Henson Music short on that jump Music much better defense by the Panthers lovely contest but it contain penetration so Bandy wants another three this one no good two of seven from threepoint land this is the largest lead for the Panthers tonight at 21 hahaha and this is going to be a technical foul here on Blake Henson well talk about it when we come back here time out on the floor Panthers up big Music foul to Blake Henson thats his fifth personal so he has fouled out lets take a listen so what the Reps hurt foreign Applause and then he he acts like he didnt do anything its funny stuff well the referees you know hate to be showed up when they make calls yep but listen well all of the fighting hed been doing down there with white and Collier all game long with them you know battling it just felt like a Ticketek file yeah so you know I cant say that Im you know you wouldnt want to get a technical foul in that situation but hey referees are referees so Henson out of the game now with 16 on five of seven shooting and 11 rebounds a doubledouble for him in 30 minutes showed up to play tonight for sure both free throws go down for milk right Applause yeah you never want to do something like that late in the game Music 20point game you also got to think about that here is the personal foul Music free throws for case now gotta learn to leave the referees alone thats a fight that you just cannot win I had to learn early the hard way hes always enthusiastic and energetic though Blake Henson passionate about the sporty plays you gotta love that absolutely thats the first time weve seen Jorge Diaz Graham into the game for a while came in early in the first havent seen him since his job by Cummings to stay underneath the screen cant hit the shot Applause Music so what do you think Julius second half Panthers have doubled up the tribe what have you seen I think they match the intensity stop settling for so many jump shots and took the fight to the try Music understanding that hugely is a force down on a block it opened up everything for everyone else pick up more active defensively of course before six turnovers here in the second half its a block shot on Huguley foreign Burton showed us he had a little midrange post low post game Music Applause it only has three turnovers in this half take care of the ball Jeff cable talked about that at length on Tuesday the point of emphasis for his Squad Cummings with the step back cant get it now both twins Jorge and Guillermo into the ball game for Pitt 25 and 31 they combine to get this loose ball jump ball arrow pointing toward the pit side at some point hes gonna have to get some quality minutes from between so I think its a good experience to get them out here Music coming into tonight William and Mary a good defensive team third in the conference with only 66 points per game allowed tonight Panthers with 77 Guillermo steps back for three hes a wing karasinski doesnt fall back out to Rice look at that pass karazinski putting it down houses Applause Music nearly in the pick and roll like to see him get going Music get his confidence back Miss jumper Nate Santos into the ball game comes down with the offensive board sabandi once again going amongst the trees and getting a rebound still battling down there finally Charlie Williams whos fresh into the game as well came down with the board see the second half rebounds 2716 in favor a bit we pause for a moment for substitutions Music Applause Julius you talked about it earlier The Heavy Hitters start coming here for the Panthers after this nonconference schedule kind of yes sir is about to get real in a hurry Northwestern NC State and for the Panthers theyre gonna have to learn how to put together you know more than just one good half of basketball gets the better competition no disrespect to the tribe coming in here and giving a tough game but when you got Vandy in NC State its going to be a different Beast William and Mary play NC State in their next matchup one of three ACC teams they play in the now conference schedule theyre picked eighth in the Colonial Athletic League and they put together some good tape in this game that they can watch and learn from and and show that they can come in against anybody for the most part and compete Ben White with a careerhigh 24 points and 11 rebounds tonight Music really the spark plug for the tribe early in the game things kind of slowed down for them obviously here in the second half outscored by 23 points and 80 points is the magic number for Jeff Capo and the Panthers now under Jeff Capel in his fifth season when Pitt scores 80 points they will move after tonight to 151 in the Five Seasons that Jeff Cables been in Pittsburgh thats impressive lets get lets get to it questions there used to be a time when scoring 50 would get it done I think those days are over back in the slow the slow air I played in was it slow slow basketball and baggy shorts you cant slight yourself in the last 15 seconds of the game here unbelievable its all its all good I understand yeah I think the game is evolved so much that I mean I would love to play in this era but I just think I I just love how skilled all the players I want well the last time these teams played Euro for eight from three so maybe it was the right move Music theres your final score 8064 Julias final thoughts from you here on a resurgent pit team in the second half three in a row for the Panthers way to feel good about yourself going into a tougher part of your schedule big one for win for Pitt after Thanksgiving they
