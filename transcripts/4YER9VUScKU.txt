ER Seth Trimble still heavily favored to beat this Campbell team in unccs final game before ACC play really gets going Le Cel throws it with Bert Smith to Bren Hampton filling out our officiating crew it is an instate meeting Campbell from buo Creek about an hour down the road and the first bucket is to uncs Jaylen Washington off the L from Elliot kadoo people have complained that North Carolinas size hasnt been productive but they are way bigger than Campbell so Campbells going to have to do a really good job forcing them out to the perimeter and Campbell gets a step inside thats Caleb zerini who is in there for the injured Taran Frank other side Jackson rims out of three and we can look at the heel starting five Davis kdo with a freshman Jackson and Drake Powell starting together and Jaylen Washington returning to the starting lineup had a big put back late against UCLA and thank you welcome to Chapel Hill North Carolina we are just underway between Campbell and UNC Kevin Brown Dan boner our ACC Network crew Its the final game for the tar Hills before the meet of conference play and the buckets have come from Jaylen Washington and now RJ Davis the third leading scorer in Carolina history both teams have started in the manto man and North Carolinas ability to get it inside early made that drive for Davis possible Campbells a pretty good defensive team as I say theyre very undersized against these tar Hills a whistle at an offensive foul away from the ball will go against Campbell Jason sonani Nolan dorsy cam Gregory the guards Colby Dugan and Caleb zerini are The Bigs as the foul is on kobby Dugan his first again Campbell without Teran Frank 68 starter with Vanderbilt and TCU theyll miss him in the post and as a passer and theyll take the ball over after un giveaway what what do you look for early Dan for Carolina offensively North Carolina has been a little bit uh discombobulated at times offensively because they tend to turn it over and that time that was a turnover was just unforced Davis got too deep in the lane and kog just stood and watched deep three is good this is a Campbell team that shoots a lot from three without a hugely effective percentage but Colby Dugan who shot it well of late gives the fighting camels an early lead 55 of Dugans field goal attempts are from Beyond The Arc so youve got to pay attention to Applause him there RJ Davis who is two threepointers away from the school record Marcus pagee on the bench has it and Davis has just tied him now Davis has not shot the three well so far this year but through his career hes been an effective threepoint shooter and he has also been a very streaky threepoint shooter 36 career just 26 this year but a good start number 299 of his Carolina career heres Gregory good score for Campbell a lefthanded finish the junior transfer and then a takeway zerini denied by Washington who then gold TS the shot of Dugan so backto back buckets at the rim for Campbell well how about that there a blocked shot and zerini pulls the ball down that you say a behind the back pass this is really something North Carolina just not paying attention right there nice play by zerini thats an excellent block chop but nobody there to recover really really aggressive start for the campbel of Campbell four field goals in the first three minutes for Kevin MCs Campbell team two power conference games this year lost to Virginia by nine Ohio State by 44 L shot clock kdo BS it in ellot Kad with his first bucket thats a tough shot kadoo is also a guy who has struggled from for shooting from struggled shooting the three but that time driving the ball to the basket against an undersized Defender Campbell team in its second season in the CAA after a long spell in the Big South travel against Jason sonani who is their leading score and Campbell turns it over for the second time sonani is a big kid 63 195 lbs I I think he felt like he had an opportunity on the inside to get a postup move but he traveled with the ball first subs for each team Eric vanderhyden a senior for nearby Raleigh will replace zerini for Campbell and Vin Allen Luben who started the last four comes off the bench early to replace Washington 68 Jr from Vanderbilt UNC team that has struggled to get production from its bigs this year awfully guard dominated team Jackson slashing lost it recollects finds Davis and theres the record the 300 threepointer of RJ Daviss brilliant North Carolina career he has just surpassed Marcus Pig whos on the bench right now and now in second place as RJ Davis ascends to the top of the Carolina record books Pow with a rejection on the other side and then Kau feeds Davis who started three for three would Palin get off the floor canny he is just one springy freshman as is Jackson and what a tough finish that is Elliot kadogo to the off hand and a great offensive start for the Applause heels Carolina shooting at six for seven right now theyre getting great shots Gregory three theres tow off the floor again with a rebound and theyre really trying to push the ball Jackson Driving in on Gregory no he got both UNC Applause misses thats one thing that this North Carolina team has not done very well so far this year and that is rebound the ball offensively its another block shot thats three for the heels that was from Luben dorsy passes up an open three and the jump are way too strong for sonani heres Jackson in transition TOP take dorsy comes away with a loose ball numbers for Campbell canani from dorsy with a finish and a foul against Kad so pretty good Pace to start this game and some history for unccs RJ Davis graduate student from White Plains New York stands alone on the North Carolina threepoint leaderboard with number 300 Music chicken now fans we are chickens each the first step and chickening a chicken James James is oh oh s congratulations you just ala chcken chicken is our passion as our pleasure Al Music chcken Town Hall burer present show your JS if you are in the Smith Center tonight and you are wearing Air Jordans let us see those shoes show us your day presented by Town Hall Music Applause is giving away tonight is looking for our first Music Applause Music well RJ Daviss name will be all over Carolinas record books when its all said and done hes already there he just passed Marcus pagee one of the great Tar Hill guards in recent vintage with his 300th career threepointer 151st game at Carolina hes the alltime free throw leader he is Clos to passing Rond Bott for second in points and there is Marcus p and a player you got to see 12 to 16 had a great impact on this team but special to watch what RJ Davis has done since wow Davis has really been a outstanding player for North Carolina one of the things that has Davis has been dealing with this year this is really the first time that he has been number one and I mean a big number one before hes been 1A now everything everybody points directly at him and thats an adjustment and you can see the crowd right there just found out it was RJ Daviss is record setting three so a standing ovation from the assembled in Carolina blue Jason sonani must feel like thats the first standing standing see during a free throw yeah and he drilled it so maybe hell ask there ask for history to be set during every free throw completed the threepoint play its a good offensive start Campbells 5 for 10 and Carolina is 6 for9 Kate Tysons on the floor for UNC threepoint shooter they really need to get going Davis has started perfect three for three from the field Powell didnt see Luben inside deep shot clock Davis fouled and he hits another oh why stop at 300s wow you remember we said he was a streaky threepoint shooter well hes feeling it tonight and that is I mean that is a really really tough shot Applause Jason Cady who just completed a threepoint play fouls Davis and he cannot complete the fourpoint play the alltime leading free throw shooter in Carolina history as Tyson is the last to touch it in bounds but what a start for RJ Davis 25 a 12 from threepoint range this season Tyson nearly took it away again on both ends of the court now Tyson has touched the ball while hes been standing out of bounds trying to make a play so really good Hustle by Tyson but just Applause unfortunate a player who was brought in to be a huge threepoint shooter hes only hit a three in three games this season yeah nine of his nine threes have come in three of Carolinas 12 games combined in fact hes scored 43 of his 47 in three games combined hes been scoreless in all their losses see if they can get him some baskets tonight as hes hanging out the corner Jackson from Davis another three now North Carolina only scores 27 of their points from Beyond The Arc but thats because theyve shot the three so poorly so far this year theyve got guys who can make them though last five games just 242 from three heels are four for five tonight sonani swing it around zerini in and out on the three for Campbell that was really good ball movement and those are the kind of shots that are going to have to go down if Campbells going to stay in this game Campbell does a great job moving the ball from side to side now they havent shot any free throws so far tonight and they are among the best free throw shooting teams in the country so the North Carolina defense early has done a nice job keeping them off the line triple sub for Campbell here tsos cook is in the game Colby Dugan braggy Goodmanson gets his first action as well and K has an uncontested layup they it 9 for 12 for the tar Hills and an eight nothing right well Kad is showing you hes got the quickness to get past his Defender out on the perimeter and then hes got the strength to get all the way to the goal and finish Dugan for three that will go a second three for Campbell for the sophomore starter Colby Dugan and thats a very important basket for Campbell North Carolina looked like they were threatening to go on one of those spurts thats going to bury an opponent Campbell allowed a 30 to4 run in the first half of its last game that was against Longwood Dugan stops the 80 run here a pretty good defensive team theyve struggled containing the dribble penetration tonight good do from Luben Tyson hustling again zerini gouss for Campbell theres a deep one from Dugan he drains it and kobby Dugan matching RJ Davis with a three for three start from Deep wow that youre right that one was really deep Dugans feeling it his last seven hes now 16 for 31 from three Colby Dugan CAD feeds Powell this game being played from behind the ark and Tyson goes over the top for a rebounding foul three for six for three for Campbell four for seven for Carolina which leads by four Music Applause Music Carolina Music HRI Subaru of South want to congratulate and TI for winning tonight Subaru seat move of the gson and pgy move for theupper L section 107 for game the seat of the game is Tri by HRI Subaru South subu subu South today it is time dont smile lets see those G faces were serious do not smile Music Applause Music Applause p Applause Applause Music Music thanks for playing Music Applause Applause Music tar Hills leaded by four and youre getting a little bit different look from North Carolina this year offensively watch here as the drive to the basket is made by kadu and right there hes got Van Allen Luben inside his Defender and he can dump it off to Luben possibly for an easy basket but instead kicks it out for the three which the tar heels Miss and theres nothing wrong with the threepoint shot but thats really sort of a different approach the Tar Heels have pounded it inside and not so much this year its a team thats struggled at times in the half court theyre among the nations leaders in Fast Break points no fast break points tonight all 22 and a half court for Carolina which leads by four Dugan another threepoint try and thats tip to Ian Jackson so what do you want to see for North Carolina in the half court what do you want to see see them grow offensively well Id like to see the ball go inside a little bit more this is one way to get it inside Im not talking about just throwing the ball to a big guy with his back to the basket you attack the basket you get it to the goal and I think one of the things youre trying to do when you get it in there youre shouldnt be totally concentrating on kicking it out for a three maybe finishing yourself in inside or finding an open big guy inside me Jackson does what UNC did so well against UCLA get to the line he shot 35 free throws here on the win over UCLA at the Garden hey were good set to ring in the New Year Tuesday New Years Eve double header notame Georgia Tech and then Virginia Tech against Cooper flag and fourth ranked Duke that starts at 230 Eastern the game and Cameron to follow at 430 happy early New Year you will be down the road in camer for that game excited looking forward to team and youve seen Duke a couple of weeks ago as well against George what stands out to you about the blue doules well I think theyre very versatile first of all uh theyre more than just Cooper flag um you know malow watch plays really well defensively inside and then For Heavens Sake you bring Malik Brown Off the Bench lady well short from three there was so much hype about flag and K canip and the scores and Duke has been along with Tennessee maybe one of the two best defensive teams in the country to start as that shot will be go tended on the way down for Powell well the other thing I dont think Tyrese pter gets near enough credit for what Duke is doing I mean hes uh hes controls the game on the offensive end and he really really is a good Defender we asked Hubert Davis where can your team grow so we preach every day its defense and rebounding its defense and rebounding if we do that well be fine well play with anybody in the country and its a seven and5 team he said were legitimately five or six possessions away from being 10 and two they have played an extremely difficult schedule Gregory is bumped by power who picks up the Carolina foul and because its North Carolina and because its such a passionate fan base theres been a lot of wailing and nashing of teeth about the fact that theyre only seven and five but thats against an outstanding schedule Applause three for Eric vanderhyden and he will be vanderhyden after that shot well hes only a 26 threepoint shooter and based on that shot its like an old high school coach I Used to Know kept saying if you have a shot like that get closer I thought you going to say youre open for reason which is what I heard throughout my entire playing career Mission from three get closer Davis has not missed from three in this game hes got 11 four for four from the field three for three from Deep tight Claw on the floor for UNC wearing zero to Big Georgia Tech Davis takes the three leans in try to draw the foul it kicks out to Kad shot clock is not reset Davis kdo has to get it up and draws the iron Gregory with a rebound down the floor is are leaning lead Saks out couldnt finish the reverse that was a great job by North Carolina getting back Davis pull up three nice it in there again scrapping with Claud Carolinas second offensive rebound and if youre Campbell youre coming in here youre thinking maybe upset you cant give up offensive rebounds the do heres Tysons first shot its not even close will try to run again beat Carolina its own game and Cady is fouled driving it in on K Tyson who picks up his second Campbell if you if you look at the analytics their pace of play isnt particularly quick but they are not somebody trying to hold the ball if they get the opportunity off they go and you dont want to let that North Carolina defense get set if you can help it thats just a great job getting down the court were now going to have a stoppage previous play is under review an official review We canell Brent Hampton are at the monitor lets see what theyre looking at well I think sonani is bleeding and that may be why theyre looking at it theres blood on the court you take a look and see what happened now people say thats not a flagrant foul because hes making a play on the ball well the officials even if he is making the play on the ball if the officials decide that that contact is excessive Andor unnecessary they can call that a flagrant foul I I dont think they will but anytime theres blood they go and they look at it he did bring that arm down pretty hard and just cracked him across the face followed through by Tyson who picks up his second theres sonani being attended to bloodied and bruised after the foul with free throws coming well there maybe more than free throws coming the officials are spending a lot of time talking to one another about this Lee Cel BT Smith Bren h Applause official review here in a 2618 game to slowed down some Carolina is just won for its last seven Campbell has not scored the last 245 the officials may be having this discussion just to gives sonani a chance to get back to the game Jason sonani still over to the left of the Court down by the tunnel there Campbells leading score 12 and a half points per game singer at Oak Creek Wisconsin who began his career at Milwaukee sonani is back on the floor and here comes hert Smith to give us an explanation okay okay all right so Dan thats what thats exactly what we were talking about theyve upgraded that from a common foul to a flagrant one foul and the reason they did it was they felt that the contact the hand coming down slapping him across the face in that situation where he was a vulnerable player they felt like that contact was excessive so it doesnt matter that he was making a play on the ball it was excessive contact so now whats going to happen is sonani whos the person who was fouled is going to get two shots and then Campbell is going to get the ball after further review the personal fouls being upgraded to a flagrant one on Carolina number five itll be two shots see last time sonani went to everybody was cheering now everybodys pulling lets see how he handles it here next time the entire Arena will go silent sonani who is the best free throw shooter on the floor 83 for Campbell on a team that shoots over 80 is one of the like the eighth ranked team in the country in free throw percentage they have a player Campbell broggy Goodmanson weve barely seen Off the Bench who is 27 out of 27 from the free throw line this year when sonani still bleeding so hes going to go back over to the bench well the the blood rule basically is that you you cant be out on the court while youre leading that you got to get the blood stopped before you can go back out there and the aention Goodmanson is going to check in for him and now somebody has to clean the blood off the floor by the foul line and going to get CSI in here to follow the blood trick so the forensics officers of Chapel Hill have completed their work sonan thats thats a big if they can make this basket here that is a pretty big turnaround thats four five point trip hanging around this Campbell team its the UNC team that has really struggled in the first halves of games this Applause season Vander Heiden a lot of motion a lot of back cuts for this Campbell offense they call it a modified Princeton offense Gregory headed the shot clock his Miss is rebounded by vanderhyden who goes over Washington and then loses the ball to Kad really good defense by Washington Jackson fouled and he gets it to go Ian Jackson a chance for three particularly in transition you have got to stop Ian Jackson well before he gets into the lane because he really does a nice job not only elevating but look how far he jumps this is like a long jump kind of thing hes a as we said hes very explosive and he can really attack the Applause basket Jacksons got seven coming off of a career high 24 in the comeback went over UCLA the garden rolls out the free throw Campbell has done a nice job hanging around here early in these last 8 and a half minut its really going to be critical for them here in this first half doing it all without Teran Frank they starting five maybe their best passer Dugan against Luben tough shot will go for Kobe Dugan whos got 13 to tie a season High what a game hes having with those pass knocked away Gregory with a steal Gregory his misses followed up and tipped home by dorsy and here come the fighting camels and theres Jaylen Withers in the other end camel just didnt get back defensively and Withers Just into the game for the first time as a bucket well Campbell had all their guys at the basket tipping it in they didnt have enough guys to get back sixpoint lead for Carolina under eight of this first half Dugan H three from out there thats offline and Tracked Down by Applause Kad Elliot kadoo going one on two and still finds the angle he has made a couple of those tonight those are not easy shots but again hes got the kind of athleticism and quickness and strength and when he gets in there he is really a handful he straight makes for Carolina too got eight its been a bit of a scoring slump for him so the one thing this Campbell team cannot do is stand you theres a lot of standing around that time they got to move the ball and move players Withers off the Miss from dorsy on the floor with Jackson kadoo Davis and Applause Applause Luben heres kdo again inside Luben on the roll Elliot Kau played that perfectly he held on to the ball until Luben was all alone and he got it to him before the defender could get back thats really really a nice play six straight for Carolina and a timeout taken by Kevin MC Music the court and all of a sudden everything went silent I thought Dan really wanted to take it to break so he Applause Applause Music up Carol by Blue Carolina blue North car is work young people families have the Mental Health Resources they need to be Healy and th blue North Carina official health insurance harder of Carol tonights game of the game is presented by Harris we have a cut for you tonight iest as William 94 ft stands between William and 500 gift card William has three chances to hold the any any of the attempts that hit the Harris teer side will earn Harris teer fuel points will whatever youre second shot Applause William gets 200 fuel points William this is your last shot of 500 Harris gift card here you go on it way and there go now the Campbell of camell of Campbell are very serious about their mascot that is the twoton bronze Gaylord out in front of the Arena but more interestingly inside they also have a camel this inflatable card is huge its 20 ft tall its 15 ft long and if you can see from the picture up in the upper right hand up the up left hand corner if you walk underneath the camel its 9 12 ft from the floor to the belly of the camel so a regularized human can walk under there heck even Ralph Samson could walk under there and this is the thing it takes them a while to blow it up but they have it at all the games when the team comes on the court they run out underneath Gaylord the camel it is a spectacular item I think you and I need to do a game at Campbell so we can run out under the camel I think I would fit under the camel easily you you can run I I would walk by the way Gaylord Perry one of the great pitchers in Major League history went to Campbell thats Gaylord the camel a three for Gregory is good they could shoot two or three of the first half for Campbell which is within seven well they only shoot 32 from out there coming in on the season but they have made more threes than usual tonight and theyre theyre still theyre hanging around its a sevenpoint game game and now youve hung in the game if youre Campbell you dont want to get a North Carolina hit you with a 120 spurt before the half Jackson three dorsy the rebound for Campbell University in its 48th season of division one basketball one NCAA tournament was in 1992 they lost to Duke in the first round founded all the way back in 1887 as buoy Creek Academy and there is no no official reason for why Campbells named the camels there are some apocryphal stories including one in 1900 when Zachary Taylor K who was an architect tried to console University president ja Campbell after a fire lit up the university and KET said to Campbell why are you in bed times waston I thought Campbells had hump on them as Kido throws it into the C bench that is the legend but the school wasnt known as the Campbell uh the camels for another 34 years they were called the Hornets nobody really knows why but we do know Campbell cam is a wonderful liter name I say theyre going for a literation and they theyve achieved it look good heav and this game needs to be reset somebody unplug this game and plug it back in fourth turnover Campbell Kevin mcgean is displeased one of the the precepts or the principles of the Princeton offense and the modified Princeton offense call what you want you drive into the lane draw the defense and kick it out for threes but your guys have to be ready Davis step back three no good hes missed his last three from out there after hitting his first three but that one was highly contested that was really good defense by dorsy and hes the guy for Camel that usually draws the other teams best player out a screen from Dugan who was open for three instead it is sinani and an offensive rebound for dorsy Dugan a low catch fires away rims out what would have been his fourth of the half and thats a good point if that is a good pass he probably makes that three but he had to scoots bend over to get it Tyson Corner hes 0 for two Withers fighting for the offensive rebound does the split B Smith says itll stay with UNC with 18 Applause shoot battling for the ball I think they felt like dorsy hit it out of bounds Carolina is still looking for its first second chance point of the Applause game again North Carolina historically one of the countrys great offensive rebounding teams but not so far this season Davis Dancing Davis denied two to shoot for Jackson tough one entirely too much dancing the ball has to Applause move the drive sonani takes him back in there with a two fouls and the three for dorsy is short keep Davis tell him to Applause go it been such a sluggish first half team this year winning in this game but only by seven after that brilliant Offensive start too Jackson touches it up for Withers and the scoring drive now about three and a half for UNC Gregory again boy Campbells been good in transition you miss those threes you create long rebounds and that allows a team like Campbell that doesnt mind getting out to go to go a timeout taken by Hubert Davis and the fighting camels are within five at the dean Music doome e e lets CH for the com girls Applause Music Music the Music slow starts have been the unfortunate calling card for North Carolina this season theyve been outscored on average in the first half this year second half difference of plus 94 the field goal percentage goes up by 10 the threepoint percentage up by nine another slow start today Dan what do you make of this season long Trend well its something you really dont want to emphasize if youre a coach because then it gets into your kids head I think if Im Hubert Davis the number that I would be more concerned about is North Carolina in this first half overall is shooting 14 for 28 they are 4 for 16 from three that means theyre 10 for 12 from twoo range so maybe part of the solution is we were joking about is to get closer their last five shots have all been from three the previous four all made were layups or dunks and they missed their last nine threes as a team Tyson inside the withers and here you go Carolina works the ball inside well get free throws out of it a foul the second on Jason sonani well sonani was fine until he went over and ran into Withers if he goes and establishes position between Withers and the basket then hes okay but he just R over right into him and remember sonani twice had checked for blood hes out of the game theres once again a gentleman with a towel wiping up the court you see the right nostril is plugged up for sonani who was fouled hard by Tyson earlier in the half well he was fouled hard by Tyson that time he was the one who committed the hard foul he just went went and ran right into Withers Applause Applause Withers turns toward the basket and sonani just runs into it you if sonani establishes position and allows Withers to turn into him then thats a different story but sonani is the one who initiated that contact so non shooting foul no free throws and theres Powell a twopoint jumper is good for UNC pal is another guy like Jackson who had shown some flashes that was not an easy shot but thats another twopoint basket so now theyre now 11 for 13 from twopoint ring aos cook pack up point guard for Campbell on the floor a switch on Withers will pass out of it boy didnt even turn to look at the basket and it was aone instead of top two rebounded by Withers Applause Powell takes the three and a foul on the drive thatll be the sixth against Campbell in the half andal is a guy hes not a high volume threepoint shooter hes only made 10 on the year and so I dont know that you want to be running out quite so hard at him but if you do hes going to go right by you firstman out of Pittsboro here in North Carolina fwell passes up the three Tyson takes it hes over for three barly thrown away saved inbounds by cook with a minute 30 to go in this first half well Campbell comes in with the reputation as being a pretty good defensive team and weve seen that so far zini driving into Tyson got his own Miss left it short zerini has been able to get it close but hes had a problem finishing Tyson didnt want to shoot that time to the rim and Tyson will take free throws off the foul if somebodys going to come flying at you that is a really good job to fake and drive the ball to the basket rather than shoot the contested three just the ninth and 10th free throw attempts this season for Kade Tyson transfer from Belmont we got a great womans basketball double header for you on Thursday and then the nothing but net crew to follow that breaking down the night in the ACC after Virginia Tech Florida State and Stanford SMU with highlights and Analysis of every womans game andll look ahead at the best matchups on the schedule in this loaded season of womens basketball in the ACC we have you covered all year right here on acc Network in the ESPN app one for two for Tyson Caroline is led by as many as 10 its eight right now campells been a little stagnant on offense the last couple of trips down the cour they need to get the ball moving from side to Applause side Gregory pull up jumper that was not the side to side you may have wanted to see Jackson is foul Campbell just one out of its last eight now and three throw is coming for the Freshman Jackson I think the key to that one for eight has been that theyve been taking tough shots CL and Gregory there is a guy who can score he was the leading scorer at St Francis last year fou was the second on Kobe Dugan so Sani Camps leading score in the year with two fouls Dugan their leading score tonight will stay in with two fouls or will he Kevin MC very late was alerted of that and he gets Israel yaw to the scorers table and ya will replace Dugan well you dont want him to pick up that third foul with 49 seconds left in the half and North Carolina theyve been able to get to the line but theyre only three of seven Jackson splits a pair again eight points for Jackson eight for kdo 11 for Davis for UNC Campbell has not scored about two and A2 minutes final moments of the half cook will pass up at three good defense by Davis Cook drives it into his chest knocked Away by Davis Washington swatted it out of bounds six to shoot for Campbell Applause and one of the reasons that the ball isnt going side to side for Campbell is North Carolina is not allowing them to pass the ball side to side Gregory hell Drive In on Davis miss the shot Carolina can hold for one and has used a timeout Hubert Davis is going to call another hell take a second timeout of this first first half and hell set up the final play were back in 30 to Chapo Hill Music Music Music Applause final 13 seconds and the half a timeout taken by Hubert Davis where do you want the ball to go here for your Carolina well I think again what you want to do is collapse that defense and so I want the ball to go inside you certainly dont mind Elliot kadoo taking it in there you certainly dont mind Kau taking in there and kicking it out today Davis but Id like to see the ball go toward the basket some pressure comes its floated over to RJ Davis got yaw out in the front defensively with his great Lan theau inside blows it up for Washington who puts it in right before the expiration of the half there were some here in the second or Campbell can keep hanging around this lead is the largest for UNC Dugan will take it on the first possession of the half into Washington who rejects him for ses third block that is a very optimistic approach by Dugan to take the ball at Washington whos a pretty good Defender and shot blocker and has five or six inches on Dugan the Goan Jackson each with eight for UNC behind Davis is 11 Washington off the front of the rim hes been struggling offensively of late and look at Jason sonani whose nose is completely plugged after bleeding three times in the first half zerini caught up in the air Dugan will but Washington again this time a one foot Fade Away rattles it in and kobby Dugan one shy of a career high with 15 change of Jack S I did not know we were going to get a jack s reference on tonights Music broadcast gdau inside Washington with a stop hes had the first basket of both halves thats why North Carolina started the game getting the ball inside good screen and roll I just dont think Campbell can guard him in there Washingtons got six and six minutes as Campbell throws it away for its fifth turnover what were talking about with kdo he does this really well delivering the ball at exactly the right time getting it through those two Defenders sometimes a guard in that situation holds on to it just a little bit too long and K hadnt done that tonight Carolina on the year 57 assists per game and he floats it in here calls his own number and hes got 10 W he has made some tough drives to the Applause basket a second double figure scoring game in the last six for Kad who reachs that Mark his first seven of the year zerini has a height advantage on Davis who has stepped off him and the open jumper down to Ian Jackson crowd still waiting to get energized students are not yet back from winter break but its a very good crowd here very good siiz crowd Davis kicks it Jackson hickon we really have to like Jackson I mean when he catches the ball out there he is ready to let it go and their best threepoint shooter on the year 43 coming in nice little slip and Sons got seven you have to have if youre going to run the Princeton s offense you have to have a big guy who can go to the top of the key and make that pass to the guy cut the guard cutting through and Dugan was a big guy there hes got a couple of assists kadoo just worms his way in finishes inside dorsy kados got a dozen and Carolinas offense has awoken here nine points in the first three minutes of the half another nice cut this time sonani was the distributor and zerini the finisher so you want to get out there and you want to deny the ball but theyre really looking to pass to the back door cutter Gau again on the roll for Washington and it remains unguardable well CAU has taken over this second half both with his scoring and his assist North Carolina five for its last five lead is 16 and it will stay that way as great Gregory gets fouled hell try to cut into it at the line kadot to Washington has been a pretty good combination so far tonight no bounce pass that time before he threw it through the two Defenders this time he throws it over top where have you seen Elliot kads Game grow since the start of his freshman year last season I think kadoo is one of those guys who is such a good passer that sometimes hes going to try to squeeze it into places where normal people wouldnt do that and I think his game has grown when he has backed off on that a little bit I think hes doing a better job and hes got still got a ways to go but hes doing a better job you know making the easy play not trying to make the spectacular play but boy he can make the spectacular play from time to time young man on a West Orange New Jersey who reclassified up last season one for two at the line for Gregory the those got a dozen six assists to two turnovers tonight on a season 3 three turnovers per Applause game behind the back here for kadoo the outlet is Powell North Carolina with tight Claude on the floor replacing Washington at the five Davis RJ Davis and Claude got hit in the back foul against Eric vanderhyde and North Carolina is up to it old second half tricks again hot start for the heels Applause it C it Applause Music ass Music Applause Applause it is time for free tshirt want a free tshirt Applause Music Applause Applause got well Elia kados either scored or assisted on all five of North Carolinas baskets to begin this second half and his passing has really been some but so has is driving to the basket weve seen a couple of times that hes been able to get in there take some contact and score anyway but this is just I mean hes spectacular you cant guard him when hes doing this and when he makes these passes like this he has such a great sense of timing Davis is hit hard and fouled K Dos got a dozen six assists only two turnovers and 20 minutes of Play There You Go five buckets in the half for Carolina those hit two assist on three coming off a five assist five turnover game in a win over UCLA 8 days ago heres RJ Davis who scores his first point since the 1401 Mark of the first half so 18 minutes 6 seconds of game time without a bucket for Davis after an early 11 and he hits both got North Carolina off to a great start and the game became a little uneven after that but North Carolina had a lead and theyve never given it Applause up Campbells only LED this game for 51 seconds all early vanderhyden good cut by zerini Davis went flying in for the foul non shooting RJs first when Campbell can get to the point where theyre making those cuts through the lane theyre having some success but North Carolina has done a nice job pressuring the ball for the most part they fou a good match up there with zerini against gdau zerini missed it then went belly flopping on the floor knocked it out of bounds and its not that theyve been easy shots but zerini has missed a number of those at Point Blank Range you got the match up you want you have got to make that basket and zerini is the one who dives for it knocks it out of bounds but hed really like to have that one back you know hes shooting over a 63 guy you got to lay that in or dunk it hell come out of the game right now for ya Dugan back on the floor Campbell team that is just 5 for 12 on layups tonight remember theyre without their usual starting fiveman tan Frank whos a former ESPN 100 player Vanderbilt TCU and Idaho a little shorthanded Frank had hand surgery hell be out they think until early Applause February Davis inside finds Ty claw for his first point thats really good patience and then a pivot and a powerful move to the basket more minutes of late for Claude who actually began the second half against UCLA at the Garden last time out Carolina just trying to find some answers at that five position L is not a great offensive player but hes pretty good Defender and pretty good rebounder UNC without set Trimble tonight Gregory driving throws it up in the rim and scores it theres a double figure night for cam Gregory and then Powell down the floor draws a foul hugan hits the deck after his third kby Dugan appears to be in some pain he landed right on his hip and this is a situation where if youre Campbell youve got to make sure you get back on defense theyve done a nice job for the most part tonight getting back on defense but that time pal I mean he just takes it goes right to the basket and Dugan cant get in position hes not moving well I would say and the referees are going to say maybe he ought to come out of the game Kobe Dugan had a wonderful night he is one shy of a career high now Caleb zini will replace him sopor from Monson Massachusetts double figures now in six of his last seven well you mentioned that Taran Frank is out for Campbell already and so they can ill afford to lose a guy like Dugan if youre the Campbell Campell your only shot at the Applause your team so that you can be playing your best basketball when you get into your conference tournament and thats your ticket to the NCA and if youre going to build your best team you need to have all your guys for as long as possible play together two free throws for Powell whos got six Applause zerini shoves it inside a steal for RJ Applause Davis Jackson of three talking to Kevin MC before the Applause Campbell I I think you have to play that way because obviously if youre going to win the game you got to come behind from 17 but its really difficult for a team like Campbell to play up and down basketball against North Carolina you know if youre playing almost totally in transition that uh neutralizes the disadvantage that people think North Carolina have because they play so many guards youre running up and down thats exactly the kind of atmosphere your guards like we seen Carolina go with a whole lot of for guard lineups this year Jackson 64 pow at 66 off of the three and the four they both started tonight and Jacksons first start in place of the injured Seth Trimble Davis step back miss his last four threes after hitting his first three that is the kind of shot that RJ Davis has to be able to make if North Carolina is going to have the kind of success that theyre hoping to have hes got a mismatch against a bigger guy and that is a shot that he can make that stepback three you know hes made 300 threes in his career and a lot of them have been just like that started three for three now three for seven 17point lead for UNC 6 minutes and change into the second half zerini driving in on Claude way too strong how much of the year for RJ Davis to you is down to shot selection how much of it is down to him simply not hitting the shots hes hit the last few years I think that theres probably some truth to both of those things I think more importantly is I think hes putting a lot of pressure on himself a lot of accolades at the end of the season last year a lot of preseason accolades this year and again he doesnt have an inside post presence like Armando bacot uh to help him out I mean theyre right on him and theyre defending him all the time with their best player the opponents are that is Davis with 13 tonight but its not like hes having a bad year he just had shot the ball particularly well that works thatll do it its for three they get 16 in the game high 20point lead for UNC just know every North Carolina opponent is going to come in going my gosh when is RJ Davis going to have that game when is he going to find the moment where he discovers his shot and never lets up what a pass Tyson in from Powell good finish and Drake Powell with strong distribution well Tyson did a nice job to run the floor but pal really did a nice job to finding North Carolina with 14 assists on 24 made tonight theyve had nine different players in the game all nine have scored nobody would more than this guy career threepointer number 302 in Carolina blue Music Applause Applause Applause Applause lets go car no Music Music Music Applause a Music Applause Music b hey Music Applause Music Applause North Carolina Campbell playing December the 29th our final game for these team 2024 and so its time to end for some New Years resolutions the North Carolina Tar Hills are really talented RJ Davis who youre looking at there just pass Jeff lamp and Mike jinsky to go into 10th place all time in ACC scoring but theyve got to make some baskets and one of the things theyve done pretty well tonight they have to throw the ball to the guys with North Carolina on their shirts they cant be throwing it to the other guys so if they can control their turnovers and shoot the ball then I think that they have a chance in every single game they play tonight theyve done so very well 24 field goals only four turnovers they had 18 turnovers against UCLA last time out that tied a season high but thats not the way the Campbell offense is going to work theyve got to move the ball and move players and guy just takes it as dorsy did right there and drives it to the basket and theres no passing they got no shot Carolina plus 11 in the first half plus 11 in the first 8 minutes of the second Davis again game high 16 hes tied a season high with four made threes hell wriggle around hell feed Tyson who will miss another from Deep shot is not right for Kate Tyson whos 0 for four from three this get back there to defend Dugan back on the floor after a hard fall and a hard foul a few minutes ago Im telling you Dugan isnt the most graceful looking basketball player but he really plays hard back cut intercepted by Kau whos then fouled from behind by Gregory 22point lead for North Carolina resolving to have another strong second half Music Music he Music Music Applause Music Music Applause Music leave the Music go Music Music so its December 29th students are at a session and its Campbell you wouldnt think that would be a recipe for a huge crowd but Dan there is just something special about any basketball day here at Chapel Hill theres no question about it North Carolina obviously has a huge fan base and its hard to get tickets and so now with those kind of student tickets available they can sell the tickets they can have families come in for Christmas presents and they do an interesting thing here you can go up to guest services and you can go up to guest services and you can get a certificate for your first Carolina basketball game now I know this isnt your first Carolina basketball game but its your first one with me so they decided to give you an honorary certificate oh my gosh but thats the kind of thing that they do its really a big time thing for people to come to basketball games here and thats a pretty clever marketing point and here I thought you hadnt got me any for well just 4 days behind or there Washington business or your youre already ahead of your Christmas gift to me for next year okay an early Christmas gift it well this is very its signed by Hubert Davis in Bubba Cunningham there you go and uh first game here it is right there theres the certificate theres Freddy first game at the Dean Smith Center with the legend Freddy Kyer on stats can you write first game at the Dean Smith Center with Dan boner can you sign this for me too I dont know that I should I dont know that I should do that and you have to give it back to now because hes got his hes got his stat card on the back stat card I didnt know it was at the table the whole time Washington off the Miss from kados shoves it home hes got 10 his second game in double figures this year well they have they went to him early in the game early in the second half hes gotten a couple of offensive rebounds Dugan inside making a career high 17 for Dugan who takes the ball off is Noggin at the end Colby Dugan D hell never forget a career high and the dean doll when youre talking about Washington thats part of the issue for Hubert Davis and his staff theres As another one of those youngsters who can really play but one of the issues for Hubert Davis and his staff is which one of their big guys is going to step forward and have a good game in any particular game uh today Washington has scored well but you know will will it be Claude will it be Withers you know who will it be its not going to be the same guy every night and so North Carolina has to figure out who has the hot hand whos playing the best and work it that way gold Dugan meanwhile now with 20 his previous career high came against Southern Virginia Southern Virginia and North Carolina a little bit farther apart in game quality than they are geographically but a m night for Dugan as Campbell will take back over every Thursday womens basketball takes over the ACC Network nice double header this one Virginia Tech and Florida State both projected NCAA tournament teams kick it off at 6 Eastern followed by ACC Newby Stanford and SMU both games on the ACC Network and streaming live on the ESPN app six ranked teams at ACC women basketball right now Florida state is 11 and two Dugan again stuck on 20 hes got 20 of Campbells 45 Jackson a fast break bucket that was gold tended in as well so 13 for Ian Jackson in his first start and thats the other thing that North Carolina has been able to do in this second half theyve really been able to get out and go in transition and historically North Carolina teams have played very well when theyre able to get out in transition theyre playing at the fourth fastest Pace in terms of quickest offensive possessions in all of division one this year use up less than half the shot clock on average nice Jumper by Gregory whos got a doz it and Gregory leading score at St Francis a year ago and again were were talking about a Campbell team that has a different approach to the basketball season than North Carolina does North Carolina they you know theyre worried about the net and theyre worried about strength of schedule and theyre trying to figure out what can we do to get an at llarge bid to the NCA tourn we dont win the conference tournament theres a foul inside withs be going to the line whereas Campbell all they the only thing theyre worried about is to try to put their pieces together so by the end of the season theyre playing their best basketball so they can perform as at their top level of efficiency in the conference tourn because thats the only way theyre getting in now Kevin McGee he obviously wants to win as many games as possible during the course of the Season you dont want to have to get out and win five games in your tournament but this is a its a whole different approach youre trying to go through the season to build your team Withers put in the free throw but Le cell and Bert Smith got together Im not sure that they were ready for play yet it sounded like the horn got off right before Withers was about to take the free throw well that would be okay if it happened to Campbell but you dont want to be doing that at home so lets see leasel I think they call it a go tend I think thats the issue trying to decide how many shots againsts he held up one finger so lets see whats happening here with foul and Gregory he Cel Bert Smith Bren Hampton once again conversing and they will say two shots for Withers so forget you saw the first one that wasnt really the first one this is really the first one and its good okay can we get a certificate for that I dont think so you know people though you could happen well you know Freddy he could make it happen Freddy could make anything happen at Chapel Hill now Claude will check in Withers goes three for three for two points now Jaylen Withers is another guy with an awful lot of talent to it would really help North Carolina if he could make a bigger Applause contribution course you will go to the line for two how do you see the the lineups shaking out for Carolina as the years gone on with their struggles to find consistency at the five and then Withers who was great early and has dropped off a little late well Withers isnt really your your low post guy hes hes not a f and uh they dont really have anybody on the team who meets that definition in the way we we assign uh positions in basketball now so again I think you play your best players and obviously you cant play all five guards you need somebody in there defensively and I think thats going to be the challenge again for Hubert Davis and his staff to try to put your best four offensive players out there and and figure out whos going to help you in the middle meanwhile dorsy missed both free throws and that means free crumble cookies which is one of the alltime great free throw promotions so that may have been the loudest at least the right side of the crowd has been all second half Jacksons layup well give him something else to cheer about as this game continues to crumble away from Campbell well that was a good move by Jackson but probably not as good as those cookies have you had crumble cookies oh my gosh they would be a one seed 15 for Jackson lead is 26 Gregory to the 10 and hes got 14 he and Dugan have been pretty much the whole Campbell offense the chunks of this game I think North Carolina has been pretty good defensively you know they have not really allowed Campbell to sort of run that open court kind of offense theyve not allowed the ball to go from side to side theyve done a nice job Davis crosses over and drains his F three a new season High did somebody say he was struggling shooting threes I think everybody everybody said he was struggling shooting threes sinani cannot answer maybe this is the day where it all clicks from RJ Davis Jackson bumped and fouled hell go to the line for a one and one when we come back it has been an RJ Davis kight moving up the ACC scoring charts moving to top the Carolina threepoint shooting ones Music Music Applause J Applause oh Applause 58 thats car Applause RJ Davis with a season high 53s on route to 19 points for North Carolina make it 303 career made threepointers and hes doing it Dan in some fabulous Footwear well you know when he wears Pink Shoes he scores a lot of points we just told the last time he wore Pink Shoes he scored 42 against Miami but not not only that he has become the number 10 alltime leading score in the history of the ACC and its interesting to note the guys he just passed he pass David Thompson Jeff lamp and Mike jinsky those are three big big names in the history of this conference can you for uh some of our younger viewers elucidate how wonderful Jeff lamp and Mike jinsky were oh Jeff lamp was one of those guys for Virginia he played for Cherry Holland Virginia they went to a final four but at the end of the game you knew everybody in the building knew Jeff lamp was going to get the ball yet time and time again he got the ball and he scored and Mike jinsky was just a great player at Duke your classic low post Applause Guy R Davis putting his name in liks with those two therell be more Players Hell be passing in all likelihood before the seasons over du get a strong Drive continuing a strong evening 22 for the sophomore from Monson Mass well thats a mistake by Withers I know Dugan has made a couple of Threes but you dont want to be running him out there on the perimeter again Colby Dugans career high was 16 points a season ago that was against Southern Virginia University and if youre wondering wait a minute there are about 870000 division one teams I dont remember sou Virginia University thats because theyre division three so his previous career I was against a D3 team now he smashed that against one of the alltime great D1 teams asan Jackson has 19 play Closer to his season High there not going to be a win for Campbell but what a special night it is for kobby Dugan who did not score in double figures in his first six of the year and has now done so six of seven Sani is fouled one of the things that if you look at Campbells numbers they coming in they were not shooting the ball really well theyve been a pretty good defensive team theyve rebounded the ball pretty well but they havent shot it very well so Dugan coming on again this is the kind of thing were talking about your Kevin mcgean is trying to develop his team as the season goes on and this is certainly a difficult test will get back to the line you mentioned it a little earlier its a different Philosophy for Campbell which doesnt have to worry about getting an at large bid how does that sh CHS the way you coach and you teach your team the first few months of the year Well you you what youre trying to do and its what everybody tried to do when North Carolina State won their National Championship in 1974 they intentionally were trying to play their best basketball at the end of the season they basically did very little in preseason practice and they didnt really mind it if they uh you know struggled sometimes early in the season they wanted to make sure in those days you had to win the ACC tournament to go to the NCA tournament and they still had a great year CU they had a great team but that was the philosophy you build your team throughout the year win as many games as possible but make sure youre playing your best by the time you go to your conference tournament and the game is in a different place now of hey come here come here the old criteria of how you do in your last 10 games that is not stated as a part of the criteria for the selection committee which seems a little unusual to me given that now were in the transfer portal world where for 3 months at least it seems like nobody has figured their Team out yet and yet you got to win games in November and December if youre North Carolina or else your at large bid may go up and smoke but they have played well enough that their at llarge bit isnt going up in smoke they have they played a very difficult schedule they played seven games against quad one opposition and thats the quad one is in the net system uh the definition of a net starts with an algorithm and so as soon as the word algorithm gets in there Im out uh but theyve played really good competition and its interesting the only team ranked above them in the net that has played as many as seven games is Auburn now North Carolinas two and five in those seven games good mson hits that and you mentioned before hes a pretty good shooter Auburn is six and one of their game in their games thats why theyre ranked number one in the net but the other interesting thing about North Carolina this will be a quad four game that guy was open but hes in the fourth row uh this will be a quad four game for North Carolina but its only their second quad four game of the year so not only have they played a lot of really good good teams in Quad one but they havent played any bad teams and its only their fifth home game out of the first 12 Dugan another three 27 for Kobe Dugan what a show its more than double his season high he has obliterated his career Applause high Jackson leading his way in 21 for Jackson and backto back 20point efforts for the Applause Freshman zoren for three Campbell suddenly getting hot they fit three in a row from Applause Deep again coming in on the season they only shoot 31 from out there Jackson One More hes got another in 24 and he has just tied a season high backto back 24point games for the Freshman out of the Bronx I Jackson K the amazing thing about Jackson he scores it looks so effortless now its not hes working really hard but I mean he just catches that ball whenever he catches it he is ready to go how great was it what Hubert Davis told us earlier today we asked about Ian Jackson he said every day he texts me coach Davis thats it and then Hubert says Ill respond player Jackson and then Ian will say what can I do to get better today hugan nobody realized it was only a one of1 situation he puts in his own Miss and then he gets fouled again kobby Dugan must feel like hes floating right now well the ball came right back to him nobody blocked him out but that was a great story that Hubert Davis told about Jackson and the reason he was telling us that story was number one I think to show that he could text you know hes bragging about that but the other thing was to indicate that how willing to be coached Jackson is and even though he is an outstanding player and and we seen that hes got tremendous talent that He wants to get better he wants to be coached and thats not always the case in this day and age and this is not for Hubert Davis a very vocal team right now he said Ive had to bring more energy than Ive ever had to bring but its a great group of kids he loves the people on the team just hoping to get a little bit more of their personality out a little bit more communication on the floor but its a group he really adors including the freshman Jackson pal and then theres RJ well thats the shot when hes hot and we said what a streaky shooter he was Dugan cant guard that 23 for Davis I dont know if we could say its got to be the shoes but when he wears them he scores in him Carolina well on the way to a dominant performance looking pretty and pink Music Music Wasington his Music in the bottom and promo promo court that you see on the board back now which is UNC free throw 929 once you enter the code you receive a voucher for a free cookie the vouch is valid all day tomorrow must digal to cookies right here hill2 on Tuesday January 7 as we welcome the Mustangs to the ACC go to the go go Applause w Applause Applause Applause Applause Applause so every game matters for the net as Dan mentioned an algorithm thats used to help Place teams in the tournament this is a quad 4 game for Campbell you want to run up the score in the margins for Carolina which is an interesting team to compare to Arizona because theyre actually ranked below Arizona in the net despite a couple of quad one wins well Arizona has lost five quad One games so is North Carolina but North Carolina is one two Arizona has played four games games against Quad 4 competition only one so far for the tar Hills although as we said this one is and this is a discussion you know its way too early in my opinion talking about the NCA tournament but thats what we do now I mean good Heavens our good friend Joel lardy like the first game of the season hes got his brackets out so would you like to explain to us why North Carolina is seven behind Arizona as you calculated all of the numbers in the net well no because I cant like I say when as soon as you use the term algorithm Im youre out algorithmically removed well the tough thing for you and see is going to be there start as many opportunities in the ACC as there are well thats correct the ACC with the performance overall by the teams but its interesting The Way North Carolinas schedule works out right now based on the net the tar Hills in conference play have six remaining quad one opportunities Applause and theres only two more Quad 4 games for them on the schedule based upon and the quad system is based upon where you play uh you know if you play a team with a net rating of 30 or below 1 through 30 if you play them at home then thats a quad one game if you if you play them on the road then if theyre like 74 its a quad one game but this is what North Carolinas schedule looks like theyve got Duke twice theyve got pit twice and based on the current net those are all four quad One games theyve got Louisville on the road theyve got Clemson on the road and the way the net stands right now those are quad One games but so you see North Carolinas got a pretty good schedule left but and I dont think it means they have to win all those games I think as an Old Coach once said theyve put themselves in a position to be in a position and now they just have to produce would you say the ceiling is the roof for Carolina yes absolutely poell hits a three 92 for the heels you know theyve got some weapons dont they oh my gosh the the talent on this team with Powell and Jackson with the guard the wing positions it is outrageous James Brown is on the floor right now freshman center he fouls Dugan by the way the last Campbell free throws were from braggy Goodmanson whos now 29 for 29 at the line this year and that is the most made free throws without a in division one and Dugan will get back to the line where hes three for five and route to a careerhigh 30 points well hes I mean hes he is in another world tonight that time he got fouled because he flipped the ball up with his back to the basket and flipped it over his head and got fouled Im surprised it didnt go in well his career highight was 16 and now it is 16 plus 16 32 points for kobby Dugan an eight and a half Point per game scorer just an alltime heater of a night a night that will go down as a Campell lost but well go down as an amazing experience for these kids maybe not amazing on that play as the Jackson just dunked all over their dramer and back fre and humps and then Brown hits the deck and its called for a foul no new season for Captain Applause Jack that was an outstanding pass by kdo but its one of those passes where if that is not an absolutely perfect pass that ball gets tipped away and kadoo is going to have a lot of assists because he is a risk taker and theres Jackson he has really performed well kadoo has 11 assists Applause tonight and thats a new career high for Elliott who had 10 assists against Tennessee a year ago hey dont forget about ACC PM every weekday for Eastern right here on acc Network in the ESPN out Mark packer at Taylor tanon bound taking you through everything this league has to offer as conference play really heats up for the mens and womens basketball teams right here on acc Network all week Applause long 9473 RJ Davis still out there with two minutes to go and Davis brecks the three and theres a foul as James Brown was going for the rebound well that shot looked different not just because it didnt go in but he was sort of off balance and stumbling backward I think with Davis its really important that he play Under Control but much like kdo with his passing Davis can make an amazing variety of shots and sometimes he just gets his eyes get a little big and he will get a hand now leaving the game with 23 one of the high fives hes going to get right there will be Marcus pige who threepoint record he broke today 303 in his Carolina career which has of course spanned into a fifth year you cant put an asteris if you want on some of these records 5 years which many players didnt have the luxury of having but either way spectacular career for RJ Davis Cady with a three thats the ninth of the game for Campbell which has now hit its last four threes theyve got hot late in the game and thats a good sign for the Campell you know again as they build toward their their conference season and their conference tournament well they were nearly 30point underdogs in this game they acquitted themselves well good first half hot shooting late in the game Brown from Kad make it a career high 12 assists Foria kadoo and James Brown with his first field goal of the night sinan another Campbell three for sonani and Hubert Davis will have some film study to review all these open threes late in the game Kevin McGee is going to take a timeout with a minute and a second left well coaches always like to have something to talk about in when theyre looking at the tape but kdo has so has done such a nice job with his timing on these pick and rolls and not only that he has known very well when to go over the top with the pass and when to do a bounce pass hes been very impressive and I have to tell you his big guys have caught the ball very well tonight Music Applause Applause Applause 9779 on the patronic score line what do you think UNC will take away from tonight well I you know I think dont think theres a lot of things that you can take away from a game like this youve just come back from an extended break your guys are coming back from Christmas you certainly dont want to play the number one team in the country in a game like this and so yeah theres going to be a couple of rough spots but they got them all straightened out uh and so theyve made some threes tonight that we said they had to make some shots and they did uh you know they havent rebounded the ball particularly well but again this is a Campbell team thats a SC happy bunch of Fighters and sometimes its hard to rebound against guys like that but I think if youre in North Carolina you have to be very satisfied its a very positive step forward as you now prepare for conference play had the one early game Georgia Tech shoved in the middle of night conference then they go to Louisville Wednesday and then Notre Dame on Saturdays for backtoback Road games ker had 12 assists tonight to go with 12 points for Elliot kdo man at the operation right now we get a screen from James Brown Gau Jackson that shot tipped and Jackson did not get it off of the top for a shot CL violation looks good though it did pretty much everything hes done tonight has looked good 26 and five for Ian Jackson hes played 36 minutes in this game with no set Trimble and thats I thats what I was just going to say the other thing you have to consider is they havent had Seth Trimble tonight and he is obviously a key part of their team UNC is going to bring in a couple of WalkOns here for the closing moments Dante Mayo Jr is among them Russell Hawkins as Applause well Carolines also got John Holbrook freshman in the Applause game and Campbell will have it with 16 seconds to go Mayo whos got Carolina blue in his bloodlines on the floor you know I said North Carolina hadnt rebounded the ball necessarily well tonight I meant on the offensive end on the defensive end they basically dominated the defensive boards final basket for goodmanon M do so Campbell puts up 81 and North Carolina puts up 97 so the tar Hills come back from the weekl long break with a great offensive display and a 16point win in the first ever meeting between UNC and Campbell but again its a its a very workmanlike performance by North Carolina
