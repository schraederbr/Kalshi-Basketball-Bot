already with a couple of quad one wins and Clemson in the midst of its best stretch in school history Ron Guber Bert Smith and Clarence Armstrong are officials Clemson wins the tip And the Tigers who are coming off road wins against Syracuse and Pittsburgh start with the ball at home Their ACC home opener A very very balanced Clemson team 12 and three on the year As you mentioned Debbie five straight wins and they have been close Justin Porter misses a three Its rebounded and missed at the rim by Jake Wallen but theyd love to get Wallin going to 610 junior and instead SMU with the ball after an empty trip Miller and Edwards along with the 18 point a game scorer Jiren Pierre Cory Washington a season high 23 last game at Cement Yolu Five double figure scorers in the starting lineup and Miller misses a good look for three Rebounded by Carter Welling for Clemson Poopy Miller is almost a 5040 90 guy He has had an incredible efficiency Im surprised they doubled and left him Welling gets fouled on the drive RJ Godfrey Wallen and Welling the front court Dylan Hunter Justin Porter the back court And a big story early you thought a cheater on Debbie Clemson might try to go at cement yolu early Thats what they do They get a foul on SMUs big man They dont have a lot of depth over there and its inexperienced depth Although tombs can come off the bench and be very successful You know heres the thing with Clemson You know Brad Brownells teams dont beat themselves right They dont turn it over They dont foul a lot Shot selection will be critical for them to be able to manage the pace the way they want to play If they move the ball take good shots theyll be able to set up their defense through that And on the other side I mean SMU wants to run hard and wide keep the floor spaced and try to find some gaps that they can get in the paint and set up their threepoint shooting And SMU one of the best offenses in the country top 15 in offensive efficiency They rarely turn it over They dont turn it over here just because RJ Godfrey was out of bounds after the deflection but SMU scoring it at over 90 points a game and their threegame win streak theyre scoring it at 102 points per game Again beat North Carolina at home Saturday 9783 The Mustangs biggest win in three almost four full years should say Their first ranked win since February 2022 And theyre missed by Miller And heres Wallen the transfer from Utah for an almost entirely remade Clemson team Heres Godfrey denied by Yiglu who had a foul last possession Gets a block here I mean thats 72 protecting the rim And this is going to be a challenge for Clemson is keeping those quick guards and especially that back quarter Boopy Miller and BJ Edwards out of the paint Well Miller and Edwards have started 0 for three Hunter sets up a three for Welling Rebounded by Hunter Back to Welling Missed them both The rebound out of the hands of Igato and a Clemson foul on the action goes against RJ Godfrey You got to deal with some rim protection right here So RJ Godfrey shows the shot fake Egatlo does not take it and sends it back into their transition game And thats the way I like to see shot blockers Kevin dont put it in the fifth row Ignite your transition game up the floor You can get numbers that way How good is SMUs transition game I think its excellent I mean we already mentioned they lead the league in scoring at better than 91 points a game They have five players in double figures This a balanced attack for sub for Cleubson Nick Davidson in for Welling Jiren Pierre gets caught in the year The first SMU turnover Good job by Porter being up the line on that uphill pass Godfrey out of a double team Fe Porter missed it Clemsons 0 for six The balls knocked around and it goes right to Wallin who will not miss from point blank this time So Doug is 233 but finally a field goal and it comes from Jake Wallen Miller averaging 204 points 74 assists per game sets up Edwards Yigola with a touch in between three Tigers and he didnt even have to jump I mean he is 7 foot2 and all of it and with his length and his ability to get to good position Karm down on the weak side Porter bounces it into the paint for Godfrey Theres a reachin foul and Clarence Armstrongs got it against Jiren Pierre I mean watch right here does a good job on the weak side Makes himself available in a little screen roll action in the middle of the floor And hes going to hard roll to the rim every time Hes not a pick and pop guy Hes going to create space by that effort every time And he does a really nice job of reading the angles Hunter Wallen for three Its good Jake Wallen a 58 8 per game scorer has five points in the first three and a half minutes cheering and then Welling back in the game knocks it away from Eigull Second Clemson takeaway again a very good SMU offense off the shot fake Walling bowls over Washington and itll be an offensive foul on Carter Welling his first And Carter Welling gets the possession started with great pressure on the top of the floor Yeah it looks like he got the side of him but I I definitely think thats a charge Theres Washington in legal guarding position And it looks like he was think he was and it was established and you can move obliquely a little bit if you need to and to protect yourself first sub for SMU Theyll bring in the freshman Jaden Tombs for you total 610 230 proud jewel of a very good freshman class Washington two deep on a three offensive rebound by Edwards who sticks it home He averages nearly six rebounds a game Debbie at 63 When you start looking at Boopy Miller and BJ Edwards and the number of games they play together theres not many back courts in the ACC that return their starting back court like SMU does Its a lot of experience there Got three returners in a rotation Those two intuitive all starters Porter with a three The second triple for Clemson A great start for the Tigers Nine to four in the opening minutes as Miller sets up a look for Washington that rims out Wallen a little out of control and he got undercut by Miller So three fouls early on SMU A couple of takeaways for Clemson and the Tigers motivating this great crowd Well Jake Wallen has been aggressive Couple of offensive rebounds 20 24 25 and these are two teams that look like tournament teams as well as in an ACC thats looking like its maybe a seven eight bid league somewhere in that this year really strong nonconference and these two were part of that Justin Porter Dylan Hunter and Clemson moving around quickly Tigers with road wins at Syracuse and Pit first time theyve ever started ACC play 2 and 0 with both wins coming on the road end of the shot clock heres Porter transfer from Middle Tennessee sets up Jake Wallen and his shot is an air ball and a shot clock violation Wallen leads the way early with five for Clemson You know points Boopy Miller Listen Kevin Clemson moved the ball The ball barely hit the ground Everyone got a touch but SMU contested every action They are a really good defensive team as well And getting better Andy Enfield thought they played really well against UNCC Won by 14 Heres Miller allAmerica type start to the year 20 and a half points seven and a half assists a game Snakes it into the freshman Jaden Tombs And SMU starts two out of eight Tombs and SMU ready for that short roll based on the way Brad Brownells team guards some ball screen action PJ Edwards the ACC steals leader shows a lightning quick hands sets up a look for Jiren Pierre And then Edwards cleans it right up Thats his second putback As Swiss Army knife as it gets in the country Edwards averaging 1466 and nearly three steals a game Heres Wally transfer from Utah Dylan Hunter way off the mark from three I think they got to set up their threes by getting a piece of the paint And without RJ Godfrieded out there he they usually like to play through him on the block Hes at the scorers table Jiren Pierre 18 point per game scorer cant connect And theres a foul against SMU on the rebound Well Andy Enfield 11 years at USC one of the most successful coaches in that programs history Year two at SMU Theyve taken a step forward from a team that was not too far away from the tournament last year but never won a quad one game And theyve already got two Debbie this year Hes had a a great start to the season Their only losses are Vanderbilt and Texas AM Vandy still undefeated and one of the top teams in the country Andy Enfield was a D3 AllAmerican player an academic allAmerican at Johns Hopkins His first job was at Anderson Consulting He wasnt sure he was going to be a coach He was going to be on Wall Street Being a coach now is kind of like being on Wall Street You got to be a GM and you got to know finance Thats for sure Godfrey in the paint He scores it right off the bench and right into the action I think RJ Godfrey is so solid Not really an above the rim guy but very successful in the paint with that half hook He can play above the rim but hes hes typically his his footwork below the rim is really good cheering STO back on the floor as Edwards is fouled from behind by the red shirt freshman Ace Buckner Well a little bit of a new type of season for Brad music Brownell who has just one returning rotation player Had six transfers four freshman And yet here is Clemson cheering doing the same old Clemson things again Best threeyear period in school history 74 and 30 in Elite 8 two years ago last year The winningest season in Clemson mens basketball history Kevin Brad Brownells intensity right there on that shot is the same intensity at 715 this morning when we were here for shootound I mean he was getting after it with them He is an excellent teacher So much teaching taking place with all those new pieces And I dont want people to blow by what you said You did not misspeak for this 900 pm tip We were here for a 715 am Clemson shootout on the first day of classes after winter break Godfrey Hunter for three In fact Dylan Hunter the one returning rotation player was the one who said to Brad Barnell Lets keep shoot around at 715 today even with the late start Hes basically the standard bear of the program Hunter having played here in back of his brother Chase the last three years Seven consecutive years with a hunter Edwards whos got an early six misses the three Heres Buckner powering his way coast to coast for two Takes a little hit in the paint Thats why they use those pads in practice so that you can handle the contact and play through really nice job And Buckner picks up a quick second foul Brad Brown wont love that ACC teams and its going to make it a lot of fun for the fans I can tell you that the competition is real You should say 12 teams Stanford just dropped out a couple of spots down to 77 but still its a really impressive deep league after what was a disastrous season last year These two teams look like surefire tournament bets as SMU turns it over on a shot clock violation Jiren Pierre from deep SMUs turned it over three times and Andy Enfield is awfully frustrated Id imagine frustrated Debbie at the tempo of this game Well you drop an atto and you expect execution and you dont get it And you got to give credit to Brad Brownells defense Sometimes we dont talk about ATOs from a defensive lens but that was a really good job by Clemson E from Budda Johnson misses a three Poopy Miller still has yet to score or assist on a basket for SMU I was expecting him to be in ball screen coverage coming off the last timeout Theyre playing through takes Godfrey into the paint Yugato travels Brad Brownell thought he was out of bounds Its a turnover either way Last three games SMU has better than two and a half assist to turnover ratio Tonight its one assist four turnovers Almost midway through the first half Butner inside whips it to Davidson Stumped from behind by Germaine ONeal Jr here the freshman Yes the son of the NBA AllStar You cant catch it any deeper than that But Buckner driving to Strong over Egotto Rebound to Miller Heres ONeal part of this great freshman class one of the best in the country Its a very young bench an extremely experienced starting five Miller from Eigatola swings it Pierre Gotfrey was on him Millers open Miller hits a three and finally gets on the board Good spacing by SMU playing through Ekatulu knowing that the double team was going to come on that possession Clemson mixing up mixing it up when they bring the double Dallas Thomas a red shirt freshman of the game feeds Johnson Thomas high points the rebound then lost the ball against Egulus foot Recovered it Steps out for three No good Shot selection Its a really important key for Brad Reynolds team today Miller crosses over Johnson He gets fouled Now right off it you mentioned bad shot selection leads to free throws after Goopy Miller just got three couple of possessions ago Just a really good job of moving the ball playing through the double team They went three consecutive possessions throwing it on the block and then theyre playing out of the Eglu post up Third year in the league for Boopy Miller It was at Central Michigan for two Wake Forest for one now his second at SMU What have you seen in his development Well first of all hes so fit You know he plays the most minutes of anybody in the ACC Thats the first thing So when you dont have fatigue as an issue as a player that is so important Secondly he can make every shot Theres every way he can beat you He can always make the defense wrong And Andy Enfield told us today it was his change of pace his change of speed change of direction that has allowed him to really improve and put up the numbers hes putting up Said I I love his decision making when the game gets sped up And Millers got about a 3 to1 assist to turnover ratio He scored the last five SMU has tied it for the first time Porter a step back three that will eventually not go ITS THROWN UP AND IN BY WELLING and he is fouled on the play Welling doing a great job on the glass right here He just muscles his way to the weak side Carves out a little space right here and just has a want to a want to rebound was the whack defensive player of the year at Utah Valley last year They wanted him out of the portal before last season He went from UC Irvine to Utah Valley They got him this time around 1613 Clemson off the threepoint play Freshman Tombs trying to back welling down Tombs has trouble doing so BJ Davis Ray another freshman and an offensive foul drawn by Welling So Welling got fouled by Davis Ray on one end and then draws the charge on Davis Ray at the other This is a tremendous job by Carter Welling because he handles the post up and walls up Tombs and then gets off the contact to get in the path and draw the charge That is a clinic textbook defensive stance by Carter Welling He is highly athletic now He is an above the rim guy He rebounds with two hands out of his area He can stretch to the threepoint line One of three players either 610 or 611 Clemson got in the portal Snaked inside by the freshman Chase Thompson Heres Wallen who is one of those players Welling drives it into Tombs Welling junior on freshman left it long SMUs got Miller off the floor for a spell now Jiren Pierre back in the game Pierre has yet to score Edwards Welling comes down for the takeaway Wallens got Thompson to his left Wallen is bumped So is Thompson And theres a foul Both Clemson players took a spill I think the foul was against Wallen when he threw the ball away This is how you get Tigers back up This is how you get minutes right here Carter Wellings coming off a backtoback singledigit offensive games And this is the kind of effort the steal on one end and then the foul on this end Clemson getting an opportunity to run off their defense By the way thats three fouls on BJ Davis Ray whos played a minute Andy Enfield not happy Its a one and one 17 team foul Actually itll be a twoshot foul The call will be that all on ESPN walltowall day of tremendous college basketball Free throw good for Wallin whos eclipsed his season average with six 1713 Clemson playing the game at their pace at their style Miller back on the floor and a foul will go against Porter Thats his first Clemsons sixth A fourpoint lead for the Tigers in search of a 30 start in the ACC Following along every possession is going to matter in this one And Carter Welling certainly thinks so Kevin on the SMU defense Hes having a great start to this one first year at Clemson one of the six transfers Brad Brownell brought in a welldeserved seat on the bench for Welling right now Cory Washington cannot finish for SMU And a big story for SMU Edwards and Miller the starting guards have 11 You get to the other two Jeron Pierre and Washington who average a combined 31 and a half a game have not scored Heres Wallen An early six for the Tigers Godfrey inside FEEDS IT TO THOMPSON who had not taken a shot in the last three games and scores on a dunk here And SMU takes timeout with Andy Enfield furious at you doubling or are you not Because if youre going to commit to double teaming everybody needs to know SMU was terrific playing out of the double team defensively on the block but the backside has to drop down and protect the basket and that didnt happen And thats why the quick timeout by Andy Enfield This SMU team hasnt hit a field goal in about three minutes Trails by six on the road He scored 97 against North Carolina Saturday Right now they have 13 and they turn it over Porter Theyre coming off a North Carolina upset win at home Played so well together scored as you mentioned earlier 97 points and this is Clemson in a mismatch inside too cheering easy Its Gfrey and its eight straight for Clemson I thought SMU had a great practice I thought they had a good work workout work out but theyve been sitting around for a while and they they may not have gotten themselves ready to play They have not been solid at all Their turnovers have led to momentum opportunities for Clemson and theyve been loose with the basketball and Tombs just threw it right to Porter for his third steal then fouled it One of the advantages of having an experienced team is recognizing a mismatch and certainly Dylan Hunter recognizes RJ Godfrieded with a guard on him and a smaller player Clemson is in the one and one Dustin Porter three points three steals another transfer from Middle Tennessee State Sean Dixon one of their assistants knew him and helped get Justin to Clemson applause Justin Porter ruined a really great stat in college basketball this year He had 21 points in the last game Prior to that nobody from Clemson had scored 20 And it was a really good number And it it was really telling about the culture of Brad Brownells system and style You share the ball you move it you go from good shot to a better shot And amazing to have five guys whose season highs are between 16 and 19 Godfrey leads him at 117 per game as Miller misses There are different ways to win 117 would be fifth on SMUs roster Yeah Yeah And on the other side SMUs had five different guys that have had 20 or more ON THE DRIVE PORTER LOBS IT AND WELLING BACK ON THE FLOOR DEMOLISHES IT A 12 nothing Clemson surge cheering Edwards Where can they get a good look Its Washington Missed it IU on THE OFFENSIVE GLASS HE MISSES it as well Knocked out of the hands of Welling to Washington SMU still has it And Miller leans in to draw the foul Itll be a one and one for Boopy Miller cheering at the end of a chaotic sequence Clemson does a really good job of clearing out going naked twoman game here on the single side and does a great job Does Carter willing and putting it away Thats the above the rim play that Im talking about cheering Miller best free throw shooter in the ACC hits the front end Heres how he got to the line And just great hustle right here by SMU to keep the possession alive Got to do a better job on a close out on Boopy Miller Its tough to match up on that I like a loose ball offensive rebound Miller is 89 for 97 at the line He came into the game at 92 Its pretty good Maybe not as good as his head coach who shot 925 an NCAA record for his career at Johns Hopkins Andy Edfield What a find Thompson from Welling Two more for Chase Thompson off the bench and Clemson responds in kind Its now a 142 Tiger run Pierre no good And that balls last touch by Butter Johnson What a run here by Clemson at the end of this first half Excuse me Kevin Chase it Chase Thompson getting extra minutes here Hes only played eight minutes in the last two games but he second time he gets behind the SMU defense to score Nice job of playing out of the dunker spot Former Minnesota Mr Basketball who came in as a 19 point per game scorer Miller Porter had a great job on him And Porter blocks his shot Miller gets it back and pushes it home Boopys got nine Boopy is a confident player He is going to continue battling This is long from over right here They just cant get into the tempo that they like to play because Clemson has done a really good job of taking care of the ball and MOVING IT THOMPSON FOR THREE HES TIED A SEASON HIGH WITH SEVEN Those seven by the way came against AlabamaM SMU not quite in the same class as AlabamaM as Sam Walters off the bench goes to the corner hits what is called a long two The transfer from Michigan is the fourth Mustang to score Clemson has hit its last five shots Theyve mostly been from right at the rim Hunter Little twoman game with Welling for three Snaps the streak Hes missed three from that spot on the floor He is a He is a really good threepoint threat Edwards knives in Edwards Little contact BJ Edwards on the board with eight now He and Miller have 17 of the 21 Id look for something back door or behind the defense here Yeah Timeout by Bradell You can sense SMUs defense is picking up Theyre getting more aggressive on that end of the floor Is outscoring SMU 1610 in the paint They have done a great job of getting multiple sides in the quarter court Their acceleration through their action has been great Theyve got the SMU defense all spread out And SMUs got to pick it up on the offensive end after shooting 60 in Chapel Hill and 52 from three They are 32 and 17 in the second half in that game against UNCC SMU shot 71 20 out of 28 Completely different story today on the road at Clemson Hunter three Its good screaming Dylan Hunter with a net ripper for his first points I thought that was a really good timeout by Brad Brownell because you could sense SMU was picking up their level on the defensive end You want to make sure you get the shot that you want And then Walter stepped out of bounds Ninth SMU turnover This is what Im talking about All spaced out Good screening Get a piece of the gap and hit it to the slot Hunter again same spot different result Clemson and youve been right on this Debbie has been so much better out of timeouts Apparently SMU has had a lack of focus a music couple of times after timeouts Those little special teams plays have added up for this 12point lead I toldu his third shot of the game It comes after a masterful spin I I would throw it to him on the block every time and play through him in this matchup with Clemson He has so much size Does a great job of getting deep position and and really quality catches in the paint Balls out of bounds thrown away by Godfrey Clemsons fourth turnover Carter Welling will check back in replace Godfrey Wells had a great first half Six points four rebounds two assists and two steals Final two minutes of this first half Clemson has never trailed Illu again wants a touch Backing down Welling The help comes from Buddy Johnson Rips the ball away Eiglu on the floor It ends up in the hands of Edwards Only six to shoot here And Ron Groover just blew his whistle to stop play I think he thought I think theyre going to call a change of possession and uh reset the shot clock Did they consider that a change of possession They did Shot clocks now at 26 So that would be a change of position An SMU turnover followed by a Clemson turnover But watch the double team right here Its a really good job But as soon as Iu turns his back Clemson brings the double And where does Clemson have possession of the basketball Not sure they did I Im not sure That looks like a little break for SMU which would have had seven to shoot Instead gets to reset and inbound at 26 You can just sense coach Enfield cant wait to get his team in the locker room right I mean just get to the locker room and regroup That is tense stiff over on that sideline I mean this is a top scoring offense in the ACC at better than 91 points a game Held on 23 here so far in the first half Miller breaks down Thompson and then ONeal is fouled So Germaine ONeal Jr will shoot two of the minute Eight to go in the half And thats the second foul against Carter Welling Tough one to pick up for Brad Brownell The final 68 seconds of the half cheering And the freshman ONeal Jun son of the 18year NBA star Germaine ONeal Jr hits both free throws his first points Eightpoint game minute to play first half Porter has been a defensive pest in this game Davidsons on the floor Welling checks out with the two fouls Late clock Hunter Porter and Davidson was fouled Who is this on Bert Smiths going to give the signal Its not against Egan Thats the good news The bad news its Poopy Millers second foul And so Miller will check out the final 394 Actually Millers going to stay in the game He was at the bench ONeal will check out instead Theyll keep Miller in for the final offensive possession Yeah Im wondering if coach Brownell was considering a defensive change here Carter Willing only has one foul You dont want him to pick up another one Hes going to be able to be more aggressive in the second half We have not seen any 131 out of SMU either I would expect to see potentially some possessions of that in the second half for them Davidson one for two First point for Nick Davidson off the bench Miller Boopy leads the way with nine Just two for six from the field Pull up jumper He buries it It wont count Theres a foul against Yiglu under the basket So Yiglu picks up his second right after Miller got his second in the dying moments of the half They might have to look at this to see if the foul and the whistleblower did score the basket Does it count or not I think its going to count the previous plays under review Well right now its the fourth turnover against Yatulu 11th against SMU But obviously if the fouls after the shot wouldnt be a turnover it be a change of possession After review the coming foul on 24 is upheld Theres no basket allowed He punches ball on the baseline So theyre going to say they saw it they blew it and the foul happened before he shot it And that would be true from that angle Rock 23 35 in the half today They were 14 of 27 from three on Saturday Theyre 1 for six tonight Shot clock is off Clemson can hold for the halfs final heave Thompson unexpected star with seven throws it right into the hands of Washington who drives puts up a layup No the tips not there either Andy Enfield said We want this game in the 90s Clemson wants it in the 60s One of them for the guy leading the ACC Boopy Miller Well and the first adjustment right away is getting Boopy Miller off the ball for this first possession They go to a horn set which they did not run in the first half I think SMU is going to show us something in the first couple of minutes here I do think so Miller into Yigutolo Its a good place to catch it And Yiglou finishes So six points for Cement Yigu And that could be the first assist for Boopin Miller depending on how its scored Well I think thats an assist And that is literally a drop in the bucket for Illu Dylan Hunter passes up the foul line jumper into Carter Welling out to Hunter Thats good His second three a 44 threepoint marksman has hit two Dylan Hunter is going to give you everything he has He is the leader of this team the emotional leader and the IQ leader of this team Back up by 10 Miller did not get an assist by the way on that play so hes still at zero See if he gets one here Yigu basket Backto back buckets for the big one dribble move in the post Qusons got some size They dont have 72 270 size Nobody does True Not many Justin Porter a great first half defensively A careerhigh four steals already He almost had it stolen Lemson led by Hunter with six Wallen with six Welling with six And then off the bench Chase Thompson has seven RJ Godfrey is fouled Theyve spread the love as they tend to do here in Clemson Late on the rotation RJ Godfrey with a nice roll down the lane line trying to play through the chest of Washington Draws a foul First against Cory Washington Godfrey 117 point per game score So I like the fullcourt pressure by SMU They have to speed up the game They need to get the tempo where they like to play it And Clemson has dictated and dominated tempo from the jump And infields teams they love to play fast From Florida GF Coast to USC to SMU Top 30 tempo in the country in terms of their fastest average offensive possession One for two for Godfrey is 71 free throw shooter Lead back to nine Miller sets up Deron Pierre who did not score in the first half and scores here on his first attempt of the second Clemson had much better resistance in the first half defensively And now you see a big basket if youre SMU when youve struggled to score and you didnt shoot it well in the first half 33 as a team coming off a performance in Chapel Hill where you shot at 60 And to Godfrey he stunks it SMU scored in its first three possessions of the half Clemson has scored in its first three possessions of the half Porter trying to pick up his fifth steel and he will create another turnover Justin Porter has been everywhere coming off that 21point performance in a win over Pit The fifth straight win for Clemson Clemson is really not a team that creates a lot of turnovers It created 12 tonight They have been locked in Hunter Theres Welling against Washington Isolation Welling now into Eagle Kicks for Porter Theres a battle on the boards Itll be an SMU foul as Godfrey tried to seal Washington Thats two quick ones on Cory Washington Well after making only one three in the first half or Dylan Hunter made one three he makes a second one here and then just one three in the first half for SMU Godfrey swings it Thatll be a turnover Or will it Hunter was not out of bounds He was fouled Thats on Cory Washington And that would be three fouls in less than three minutes in this second half And it is Hes going to check out I think Andy Enfield might have just gotten a warning from Ron Groover Andy called Ron Groover back over here for an explanation I think he got a coachs box warning and he was pulled back by one of his assistant coaches beyond the line Jaden Tombs is in two bigs right now for SMU And Porter drives right past him Look at that stop and go Brad Brownell said he told Justin Were not running plays for you like Middle Tennessee did You got to do a better job of manufacturing looks finding shots Exactly what he did there Yugato grabs the miss from Edwards feeds the other big in tombs and the freshman leaves it short You want Yutolo to go back up with that or you like the decision No I want him to to stuff it Edwards driving off the steel is fouled Edwards got entangled with Carter Welling Thats the third foul on Welling So a little bit of trouble for Clemson Just a good take right here Not a bad foul by Willing He needs to stay aggressive here Thats just his second Oh Im sorry Its his third Yeah So Brad Brownell is going to take him out McDavidson will come in cheering BJ Edwards Pretty amazing career of development for BJ Edwards 12 two points per game as a freshman at Tennessee 37 as a sophomore This said he was reluctant to shoot last year up to 99 points a game This year 136 and hes done it all while keeping his identity as a a doit all player Last year was on the ACC defensive team So he has added to the offensive side of his skill set You mentioned Poopy Miller leads the league in minutes played BJ Edwards is right behind him second both at 344 minutes per game Indispensable for an SMU team playing as a ranked team for the first time in nine years Porter driving easy for Yigatu to clean that up Heres Poopy Miller SMU with a rare opportunity to run and Clemson gets back Pierre for three his second of the half and SMU is within five Its hard to keep a good scorer down And Giron Pierre Jr last years Conference USA player of the year averaged 21 points a game at Jacksonville State He can fill it up in a hurry Fourth leading scoreer in the nation last year Godfrey stumbles found Wallen Shot clocks at five Davidson with a sense of urgency spins and puts it home applause Doesnt make it look easy but he finishes It from Mission Viejo California fouryear player at Nevada Its a tough assignment on this end of the floor too for Davidson or for anybody any of the bids for Clemson Pierre missed a three and Porter took a look at Wallin decided to slow it down and play Clemson ball Tigers the third slowest team in the ACC Get the game back at their pace Get a foul against Hoons SMU is making music a little push here Theyre still arms length away And Brad Brownell over the last four years 17 wins 23 247 to your point about a school record Yeah this team is 12 and three Theyre receiving votes in the AP poll Theyve won five in a row trying to knock out their first ranked team of the year Theyre they got two ranked losses on the season End of the shot clock but a Johnson screaming Thats a big three I mean the the ATO execution by Clemson has been fantastic all game First basket for the UAB transfer Clemson has had nine different scores Pierre inside Pierre got nothing Heres Wallin Johnson again BUTTER cheering and screaming A LITTLE LATE NIGHT SNACK cheering Andy Enfield has seen enough hands thanks to the heroics of Budda Johnson in the second half I mean late clock he gets a little separation time and score awareness and then in transition the deep corner Thats why you run to the corner You make the defense flatten out Nice pass by Wallen right to the shooting pocket Clemson has seven players with either six or seven points to lead the way 13point Tiger advantage SMUs gone deep into the bench Mitchell Holmes is on the floor and Pierre whos trying to get unglued is fouled Well the Clemson bench to your point has outscored SMU 184 and Pierre has gotten it going here in the second half Third foul on Ace Butner off that bench Pierre a 76 foul shooter for two Watching the SMU bench the coaching staff has been more animated and more energetic than any player has been on the floor Im waiting for SMU right here Look for fullcourt pressure They have to speed the game up They got to do something to change the rhythm of the game Pierre misses it applause Theyre going to keep Miller on the ball but its token pressure only Obviously harder to do off a miss Good job by BJ Edwards stuffing the flare screen and then staying with Buddy Johnson after he hits two triples And Millers all over Hunter and he forces a turnover a travel Now Brad Brenells wondering wouldnt that ball bobbled Wouldnt it knock out of his hand There was a tip and deflection from behind It did look like he traveled Eight Clemson turnover Tombs is fouled So couple of whistles go SMUs way here Jaden Tombs will shoot two That foul is the second on Buddy Johnson Tombs with a dozen off the bench against North Carolina 76 per game score Actually this is Mitchell Holmes I beg you part Holmes rattles in the first Tomorrow the College Football Playoff semifinals kickoff in the Verbbo Fiesta Bowl Miami and Miss a matchup that everybody saw coming 730 Eastern 630 Central Spot in the National Title on the line Then Oregon Indiana and the ChickfilA Peach Bowl That game also 730 Eastern 630 Central on Friday National title game is in 12 days Miami the last team in the field is two wins away from a national championship in this insane year of college football Well I can tell you BJ Edwards and Boopy Miller have picked up their level on the defensive end The ACC steals leader Edwards has two today Had a deflection there Groupy Miller second on that list Top two in steals minutes Thats a silly foul by Holmes out top his second Thats five and a half on SMU So Clemson is nearing the bonus already You talk about decision making Kevin And and Dylan Hunter has been fantastic Still no turnovers in this game Seven turnovers in the first nine games of the season Hes had 11 in the last six but he has zero tonight so far Godfrey for three Its good RJ Godfrey hits his first three in the last two seasons This is a confident Clemson team if youre willing to take that shot Godfrey had been 0 for 15 the last two years Its his seventh career Edwards cannot answer Yiku refeeds him Edwards into Igatou now who is fouled He wants the bucket He thought that ball was deflected on the way down and that is not a reviewable play because there was no whistle for goalending Thats not challengeable Itll be a twoshot foul Check this out You know youre confident and youre playing well when youre willing to take that if he develops that part of his game cheering Simpson four for five from three in the second half Heres what Yugat told arguing about I think its on the way up Unless hes arguing it was off the rim Godfreyys last made three March 28th 2024 sweet 16 against Arizona So he went an entire season at Georgia without hitting a three He was 0 for four this year Im going to guess that was a late clock Im going to guess you are right Godfrey feeds Davidson whos fouled by Holmes Three fouls on the red shirt freshman An unexpected threepoint marksman has put Clemson up 11 SMU better than 91 and a half points a game to lead the ACC Five players in double figures on the average but only one only two tonight Nikku and Edwards Im waiting for Boopy Miller I still think hes going to have a run in them Off the inbounds Davidson Clemson so good out of timeouts today Gets two more from Nick Davidson to match its largest lead When youre managing tempo situational offense is so important You have to execute on those plays and they have Miller hot puts it into the paint and theres a foul Thatll be the third on RJ Godfrey So youre putting the one of the best free throw shooters in division one on the line This is what I mean about Boopy I I do think that hes going to have an impact on the game right here Looks like a little elbow contact Lo cheering is 8 for 10 in the second half SMU 4 for nine Miller even when he misses he makes Godfrey out of the game with three fouls Chase Thompson who had seven first half points is in Whoopy Miller second best free throw percentage in SMU career history This is the best single season mark and hes four for four today Now here comes the pressure Puts a little pressure on the game with Edwards You know we have not seen any of that 131 I thought maybe they would sprinkle some of that in Oh looks like theyre in it right now I was waiting for the 131 Edwards out top Davidson quarter off the shot fake no good and Yugatollu got his right hand on that and pulled back So a lot of times you say why why would you go zone when youre down but you have to constantly change the rhythm of the game and because I know Andy Enfield likes that defense and weve seen it quite a bit We saw some against North Carolina I did expect to see it I just didnt know they were going to do it on that possession but I was anticipating a change Johnson Oh Davidson wasnt ready An unforced Clemson error Theres Miller for three Rebound Thompson applause 11 to play 11 the lead Johnson for Porter Clemson is so good at managing a game with the lead Veteran guards Hunter a senior Porter a grad student Hunter threepointer grabbed by Washington Washington has not scored in the game and hes coming off a game where he was five for seven from the threepoint line against North Carolina So careerhigh five threes and a season high 23 points Porter with another deflection How many of those has he had tonight Well youre right You said it earlier and Brad Brownell told us this morning at shoot around you know Porter has to find other ways inside the system to score not just on the offensive end Were pretty close to Brad Brownell told us yesterday at Shootaround Were in the witching hour here and these fans have not lost their life at 1043 here on the East Coast Pierre Johnsons just smothering him Has to put it up off the iron Clemson looked like he just fell asleep going for the rebound and then Davidson collects the second rebound opportunity of the possession gets fouled Thats the seventh on SMU So Nick Davidson will shoot a one and one And thats Washingtons fourth He picked up three fouls in three minutes to start the half He just came back in the game less than two minutes ago and he is out with a bagel on the score sheet and four fouls to Yiglou Yeah Yiglus got three now So that will keep Washington at three fouls Itll give a third to Yigo So good job by Mia Koffman and the staff identifying that Davidson got the front end of the one and one 71 foul shooter gets every end of the rim here Both staffs utilizing the technology thats available with the iPads Its excellent teaching tool in game and obviously helped with that correction Lee back to 13 Miller back on the floor Rebound whos got a double double Puts it on the ground a couple of times Oh and he goes up He is tough to beat That was all the way down before spilling back out I think hes got to make his decision with the basketball quicker though Hes been able to be trapped because hes hesitated and hes only got you know 20 assists on the season Davidson missed a three only hit eight of those this year But hey RJ Godfries at one so its open season Pierre another airball Hard to believe Geron Pierre who had a 35point game againstm this year has as many air balls as makes Buckner Johnson three No Mitchell Holmes returns for Sam Walters SMUs 1 for12 in the half Debbie since the three for three start what can they do to manufacture looks I mean I keep asking for them to change the rhythm speed the game up They just have not been able to shake free of Clemsons D Theyve been in the gap Theyve been communicating Theyve been good on their switches I think they got to run more ball screen coverage and try to bring two to the ball and then make a play out of that MILLER FOULED AS HE BURIES a fadeaway What an impressive turn and finish for Boopy Miller I still think its on Boopy Miller here for SMU He just creates he just keeps his dribble alive until he gets to his spot and then elevates and scores Porter with a foul his second Boopys only three for nine in the field but hes six for six at the line 13 points Hes got three assists all since the break Hes played 30 minutes in the game Hes now scored 14 points in every game this season one of six players in the country with 14 or more in every game this season By the way three of those in the ACC Cameron Boozer of Duke and then Malik Reo of Miami I mean thats the consistency that you want Andy Enfield knows every day what hes going to get from Boopy Miller in practice and in game And heres another look at a zone possession by SMU Now this was the second thing that Brad Brownell worked on in shoot today Passing was first the zone offense and then their press offense Well they listen Godfreyys got a dozen That is the lead SMU has never been able to put a run on the game in the second half Theres a step up screen for Boopy Good defense Good job That was off of Holmes The officials are going to change the call Ron Groover says its Glemson ball put him in a stepup screen and let him make some decisions with the basketball 13 turnovers This is a tough place to come and play and Im sure SMU coming off the North Carolina game You sit around all day 900s a tough start time Not making excuses for him I mean Clemson has played really well and SMU just doesnt seem to have gotten into that extra gear yet Hows hows Brad done it this year without the typical Clemson continuity Well first and foremost hes a teacher and he holds his guys accountable So if youre going to teach and youre going to show them what you want and how to go about doing things the Clemson way then you got to have the discipline and the accountability that comes with it Ive always thought Brad Brownell has seen a bigger vision wider vision than just the 40 minutes or the season or what he does with his young men Ive been impressed with the way Clemson has moved the ball and have only dribbled with a purpose They have not dribbled the air out of the B basketball Their spacing has been good Their ball movement has been good and it results in RJ Godfrey getting to play through the dunker spot And it goes to show you how special this place is that RJ Godfrey was here for two years left to go to Georgia and boomerang back to Clemson Great piece in the Charleston Post and Courier about RJs return Brad Brenell said RJ was in his office crying He said he told me he loved me and it was part of a business deal which is the reality right now He went to Georgia didnt have a great year there Came back to Clemson and RJ said Brad Brenells philosophies have helped me in life Its something I took for granted my first two years here Hes not taking it for granted in his final goound here Clumps a foul out top Thats the sixth Thats the seventh against the Tigers So thatll be a one and one for SMU Its Johnson with his third Heres that RJ Special circumstances right Special situations SMU Meanwhile Pierre missed just the second Mustangs free throw tonight Theyre 18 for 20 and he has missed both Clemson has never trailed HUNTER GOOD DRIVE THATS GOALENDING Eight for Hunter And this is the danger of the Clemson offense the way they spread the floor I wouldnt make them dribble the way they have passed the basketball and moved and spaced it as you see Dylan Hunter doing a really good job of taking advantage there Mens and womens teams are each going to have their own practice gyms expanded headquarters so this wonderful facility is going to get even nicer and the basketball arrow is pointing ever upward here at Clemson Tigers have never trailed one tie in the game They have dominated a really good SMU team Kick out three will go Germaine ONeal Jr brings the Mustangs within 12 Yeah this games long for from over I mean if if SMU can get a couple of stops in a row in a couple of scores it puts some game pressure on Clemson Clemson is shooting 60 here in the second half Clemson has had some notable runs for and against this year Think of the BYU game where they went on a 2110 run to end the half and then blew a 22point lead Eagle with a dunk and Clarence Armstrong stops the proceedings to talk to RJ Godfrey Like the post dunk activity wants to know why there wasnt a foul on that Godfrey is going to check out now for Carter Welling whos not been a big part of the second half had early foul trouble Well Yigu has 12 and 11 now Four turnovers but a productive game otherwise Well while hes protecting the rim I would continue to get up in Clemson Make them dribble Dont let them just pass and space the floor Hes gotten really quiet in here with six to play The lead down to 10 Davidson has an open look Welling misses the put back Got it back Got denied A block shot for Washington And then Boopy Miller the last guy in the universe you want to send to the line is fouled And thats Welling with his fourth Butter Johnson ought to be uh raising his hands right there and saying uh that fouls on me not on Carter Willing They both were involved in that exchange Yeah you can sense a little life for SMU Theyve just keep chipping away with their defense getting a couple of stops in a row and getting Poopy Miller to the free throw line So Welling had been out of the game for 10 minutes and 12 seconds He plays 32 seconds gets his fourth foul and leaves Godfrey returns Miller hits the front end of the one and one The only reason that SMU has a stale aroma is lingering in this game Theyre 19 for 21 at the line They were just average at the free throw line This game would be long in the bat Millers nine for nine That is the fourth time this year hes gone nine for9 or better at the line in a game And its a seven nothing SMU run Godfrey looking inside to Davidson Got a little push there And now Cory Washington picks up his fourth foul So a one and one coming Actually maybe not a bad foul right there only because that would have been a dunk Make Nick Davidson earn it at the line Hes three for four there today 71 Hes coming off a 14point game in the pit win This is a one and one And Davidson hits the first applause Most points on Saturday since his second game of the year when he had 18 for Clemson against Gardenner Webb Well with Davidson Welling and RJ Godfrey youve got a variety of looks there to change it up on Nikku and they have done that tonight Brad Brownells asking the grit after dark crew to come alive Right at the stroke of 1100 they respond Yigu one dribble power move and scores and count the basket A foul and continuation A threepoint opportunity for Yigu Didnt hear the whistle in here but it was called against Davidson And the Clemson crowd cant believe it Illeu is more effective Two feet in the paint front of the rim When he catches it on the block teams have and Clemson has at times brought the double He doesnt have to make a decision when he catches it in front of the rim Kevin he can just score it Where was when he catches it on the block hes got to he takes long in his decision making Couldnt complete the threepoint play Now Miller bumping with Hunter Edwards on Porter now I cant solve everything for Hunter These two guards are so quick for SMU Theyve got to put pressure on the game which they did to UNCC for 40 minutes Hunter double team Got to get rid of it Hunter whips it to Davidson Amazing find but Davidson couldnt finish What a great escape that would have been Declaring now for Boopy Miller pull up bangs it home and we have a two possession game in Little John This is the game pressure we were talking about Crowd Brownell needs a timeout Poopy Miller is controlling the game right now Off the bounce 6458 That did serve as the 4minute immediate timeout 422 to go Clemsons got two timeouts in the arrow SMU with one timeout Where will Clemson go for an offensive answer Porter out there with Hunter Johnson Godfrey and Davidson Godfrey Count the basket RJ Godfrey with a threepoint opportunity And again Clemson scores out of a timeout Really good execution So IU ended up staying too long on the Justin Porter matchup That leaves a mismatch inside for RJ Godfrieded And they recognized it right away Again the IQ and the the ability to recognize Kevin cheering Second foul Germaine ONeal Jr Threepoint play completed for Godfrey Hes got 16 three off a season high lead to nine for Clemson Miller three GOT IT WHAT AN ANSWER FOR Boopy who has come out of a slumber to put up 21 Put him in a ball screen Let him make a choice The reigning ACC player of the week makes this a twopossession game again Godfrey looking inside Drives it and theres a foul RJ Gunfys taking over for Clemson Foul is Cory Washingtons fifth and he is done A scoreless night for Washington immediately after a 23point game against North Carolina Watch the show the pump fake and then Godfrey does a good job of drawing the contact to get to the line Washington was trying to draw a charge You could see his left foot was in the restricted area I mean that is the second or third game Godfrey 71 foul shooter Three for five tonight gets the first He was short on the second one last time You got to be ready to rebound Double figures in 12 out of 16 Shot 60 or better from the field in 12 out of 16 And while Ive been asking SMU to put the ball in Boopy Millers hands I I feel the same way for Clemson about Dylan Hunter Hes a tremendous decision maker in a late game situation Godfrey hits one Sevenpoint lead 330 Miller guarded by Porter who chases him Miller hoist a three Left it short Rebound to Hunter And Hunter picks up his dribble here SMU with a quick double team He throws it to Porter and Clemson resets Got to stay aggressive while youre trying to take time Youll take the best shot you can get Godfrey comes up now Yatto with a switch Hunter for Porter A blow into the lane Couldnt finish Got may have altered that Edwards driving and fouled on the drive by Hunter Its the 10th foul So two shots the rest of the way as Hunter picks up his second it Yes he disrupts the path of the ball handler That is a foul by Rule The offensive player of the ball is entitled to that straight line drive Coner threw him off it Edwards five for five from the line today You know the press is coming You got Clemson has done a really good job ball faking all game cheering You know SMU is going to try to trap or try something try to get get it some extra possessions Johnson got to got to get it over They do a little bit of time to spare Hunter will get it back out for Johnson 6863 closest SMU has been in the second half Brad Brownell like a point guard over there on the sideline Porter no for three Davidson got there after the tip Johnson corner Yes Third three of the second half for Bunn here big time scores had a quiet night Bullies his way in draws a foul against Godfrey who picks up his fourth creating a lot of contact Oh man he did such a good job keeping Pierre on the perimeter and Pierre sees that he can get a step on him on the baseline Look at the job that Godfrey does He puts his hands on him there cheering whos holding his hand straight up but he reached in here Two for four at the line Two for nine from the field but hes made some big big late clock shots this year Gamewinning layup against Butler with 42 to go Game tying layup against Texas AM Sent that game to overtime and an eventual win He can be a closer and he hits both here Back to six SMU substitution Itll be Mitchell Holmes in and Pierre out SMU is going to put Holmes right around midcourt on the press Hell fall back as Hunter takes it across the timeline Two to play at Little John Coliseum Clemson has never trailed SMU plus three in the second half is within six Flatten it out I toldu comes to double Hunter Davidson driving floating missing Miller gets the rebound Thats the pass that SMU allows is that crosscourt pass Davidsons got to finish that cheering Sixpoint game Miller Hesitation by Edwards cheering Miller leans in left it short got his own miss He draws yet another foul Hes incredible Amazing Hes one of the smallest players in division one with an incredible competitive spirit Its hard to measure it but youre seeing it play out right here in the second half Theres no way Boopy Miller is going to let his team not show up and they have shown up here in the second half behind the play of their first team all ACC candidate Best free throw shooter in the league is 10 for 10 I Im not sure how many of these 10 have switched Hes at every part of the rim in the game 97 for 105 on the year 13 in the second half for Miller Add another SMU is within four for the first time since the first half 80 seconds to play Clemson with a couple of timeouts Theyve rolled with this lineup much of the second half Porter in the three guard set I like Porter I like Porter here Kevin Hes over in the corner right now Hunter Davidson He doesnt take the three again Its going to be Porter Its Johnson Its Hunter Gets way long And heres Boopy Miller in the final minute Miller tries to slow down and draw a foul against Davidson SMU is going to take its last time out here Interesting With a live ball situation and 466 to go and Miller They might put two on him They dont for now SMUs last six points have come from the line They cant take all of the time here Miller drives it out of bounds No foul Its going to be SMU ball They go ISO with Miller and clear it out Run a little ghost action on the wing try to get the defense confused or switch They see Porter right there Knocks the ball out of bounds Clemson considered a challenge Decided not to go for it 13 to shoot Miller will inbound No timeouts for SMU Hes got to get it in He does Back from the freshman ONeal Eight to shoot here Got the switch he wants Oh they ghosted it and they reswitched MILLER STEPS IN LEFT IT SHORT Rebound Wallen They have to foul SMU That took so much time That possession took just about the full 30 seconds while down four SMU could not afford it And now they have to play the foul game When they ghosted at the top of the floor it allowed Clemson to get rematched up with the right players guarding the right opponent And Porter got switched off and they had an opportunity An opportunity they may well rule has his first point since the first couple of minutes Sam Walters now replaces Eiglu They get a threepoint shooter in the game Two possession game either way But if he makes it the two possessions have to be threes And Wallin misses it Rebound to Pierre SMU must score quickly Pierre lost the ball Gets it back Two They got to get something quick Miller three in and out Rebound Hunter And that should do it 98 8 to go and Dylan Hunter and Clemson are on the verge of sealing a 3 and 0 start to conference play Was a great effort in the second half especially the last 10 minutes by SMU But how about Clemson taking a punch and handling it This will be six wins in a row all by two possessions on the average at the moment Its an average of five points per game The margin of victory in their fivegame win streak its exactly a fivepoint perame right now though Hunter is an 84 foul shooter And that just went up cheering Brad Brownell said We cant walk the ball up every time We got to take a couple of chances But this is going to be a tempo game Thats what he told us sometime around 8 in the morning And here we are somewhere around 15 and a half hours later And Brad Brownell got the tempo game he wanted When you hold SMU to 25 points in the first half then you have controlled the tempo And you did not let SMU steal it back As much as they tried to speed up the game at times Clemson never flinched Edwards hoist a three No good Out of bounds off of Butner 13 to go It will not matter They lost everybody in the rotation except for Dylan Hunter And yet here are the Clemson Tigers on a Pier three at the buzzer winning 7470 Clemson is 3 and 0 in the ACC
