went down to the wire and this is a I mean this is a typical Leonard Hamilton team he likes versatile long athletic guys who run who play defense who rebound and that fits this group to a te and he plays lots of them hes got his first five of the Dozen were probably going to see for the nolles in the alternate Unis tonight here at home at 86 overall post entry for jayen warley and its spun out on him to start booby Miller saves it to Andrew Carr and here comes wake they get 82 points per game as you said an entertaining Style with three transfers in the starting lineup hold over K HRI air balls a three and well hear about it and they they will launch some threes and this is their starting lineup and theyre pretty big too Carr is 611 Reed is 7 feet tall Baba Miller with a drive to the hoop and Andrew Carr with another rebound and heres wake running again play one of the faster tempos so far in Le play early on of all 15 ACC teams onor Salis the Gonzaga transfer is the top scorer fifth in the league in scoring and bopy Miller finding epon Reed underneath and hes got a chance at a threepoint play that was some pass by Miller he gets in the lane and hes the smallest guy on the court at the moment but he was still able to see Reed on the inside Reed does a great job posting up he does great job with getting position and then carries it up through the contact but an excellent pass by Miller who Leonard Hamilton said to us today at shootter around boy said how about their point guard hes very impressed with boy Miller the central Michigan transfer in the red Church sophomore out of Chicago one of the things we saw on the first possession is Miller of course is only 6 feet tall they tried to post him up with Jaylen warley at 67 turnover and stuff for Salis Wake Forest using some of the traditional Florida State full court pressure heres Watkins underneath and the BCU transfer starts the no score one of the dangers with that kind of pressure is a Florida State beats it theyre going to be able to play in transition and thats the way the seminal want to play you said uptempo and entertaining for Wake we really expect that on both sides from both these teams in this game tonight Florida State defensively they will switch everything its important that youre very tough with your drives you get good Cuts HRI no in the left hand and run down by Darren Green you got to find green in transition he is a tremendous threepoint shooter at 41 as Watkins went driving and its off his leg and belongs to wake Music hor and Hunter Salas is an excellent Defender and this I mean theres no defense against that once you give up the ball that close to your own basket Salis is a tremendous athlete and I think Cameron hilis just ran along the Baseline and now normally when youre on the Baseline its after a basket but that time it was a spot throwing youre not allowed to move and with Lee Cassel presiding he whistled hildr and a turnover gives it right back to Florida State the officials always tell a guy under the basket this is his spot throwing Watkins off to Baba Miller coming off one of his most productive allaround games for Florida State Saturday here at home at the tuck in the 7774 win over Mike Youngs hokeys and a strong drive by Watkins and two Applause more and heres now Bubba Miller matched up against Kevin Miller an 11 in difference thats all its like us riding in your rental car today ild off the bounce to the corner for Salis with poopy Miller and Hunter Salis hit a couple of big threes down the stretch for w for in the overtime win against Miami and WI Salem on Saturday by Four Points Andrew Carr with the shot clock winding down had it roll off and Eon ring is the king of that tapped it out got it to Salis and now we get a foul on the rebounding action that goes against the nolles and Baba Applause Miller Florida State they like to get the ball close to the basket and this is a nice job you can see therere trying to post up against Miller but they spread the court little bit of a screen and Watkins he leads this team in scoring and rebounding and assist and steals so we said Leonard Hamilton likes him verstile none more versatile than Watkins hes trying to bounce back after just eight points and two for 13 shooting on Saturday and despite that Florida State won that game that gives you an idea about how deep they can be they had eight guys score five or more points on the weekend leard Hamilton said to us today at shooter around hes still trying to find the offensive Rhythm and flow H off the shot pick moves it to boty Miller and a rebound to Watkins one of those three categories he leads Florida State in you may think youre open but then those big guys come flying at me green knocks it down as promised 41 from three and 337 career made threes for Darren Green and he makes a lot of those go in transition HRI with a floater that is a wedgie a neck ball take your pick on dont know that ball just bounced up there and sort of stopped most of the time when you see that its a shot that wedges in there but I dont know that Ive ever seen one bounce a couple of times on the rim I dont have as venerable a career as you do Ive never seen it either green it we said in in transition green really likes to pull up and shoot the three and I you know the Florida State players are motioning to the referee to come and get the ball Im telling you guys the referees cant get their ball if theres one team in the country get that ball tallest team in the country even though Leonard Hamilton was complaining to us this afternoon that he doesnt have any sevenfooters told us its the last time in your life youll see me without three seven Footers direct quote the great Leonard Hamilton had shoot around today Florida State by two three plus minutes gone by and a Salis turnover forced by jir Watkins in Florida St pressure against Florida State you cannot pick up your dribble until you have some place to throw the ball I mean they get after you they get right up into you they they switch and here Solace picks up his dribble now its I mean thats like throwing meat in the water for the Sharks you know theyre coming right after you saw the frustration from Steve corbes against the Florida State team that turns you over among the most in the ACC warley no read the rebound and its obviously the seals think that they can drive the ball Miller quick trigger hes off Target again from Deep they dont mind shooting the three Deontay green ahead of the pack lays it in and Mike Wake Forest is a very good threepoint shooting team but when you miss the three you create an opportunity for a fast break particular if its a long rebound and that was a great pass a great Applause catch and green is 69 theres no way the sixfoot Miller was going to stop him really good start for Florida State its a 9 run and green trying to stamp a threepoint play for Florida Applause state3 Jaylen gainy enters for the nlls replacing green Parker Frederickson was looking for somewhere to go against this ful length pressure from Florida State who presses 36 of the time thats fifth most among all teams in the country that actually seems very low yeah seems like theyre pressing all the time bopy Miller finds Carr wake OA poor from long range and its missed its last six shots does stay with the

always theyre doing it his way well Leonard Hamilton he always says your five may be better than our five but Ill bet you my 12 is better than your 12 and so you saw they play 11 guys double figure minutes and they forc more turnovers than anybody in the ACC and thats been a key tonight theyve already forced two turnovers by Wake Forest 75 years old 22nd season is the head coach here and he walked in to shoot around today looked at you and said you havent retired yet I told him Id retire when he retired and he said he not not doing that for a while told us hes still got a lot of things he wants to do we asked him whats in the top of his list he didnt go the path you would have thought he didnt say final four he said he wants to build a private school that starts teaching babies infants as young as 18 months and said he wants to create some affordable housing as well and thats the man you get and the soul and heart you get with Leonard Hamilton always well he said as blessed as hes been he feels like he has to give back said felt like it would be a sin not to seven on the shot clock and Andrew Carr found the Loose Change and that is not exactly the way they drew up that play but on the short end of a 10 run they will take it to stop that run and get it down to three Watkins was hounded by car and Salis will be Miller in a passing Lane and this is primo Spears seventh game of the season after the ruling on multitime transfers green off the bouns Baseline cut Miller hand off for gy five to shoot green runs it down hell shoot from anywhere comes up short salace the rebound nice block out by Reed and really good rebound by Sal who accelerates and hes swatted by Watkins Spears in transition he is bouncy goes spinning no looking to Miller and the follow for gy when gainy had 11 points against Virginia Tech and four of his baskets were dunks and he just really did a nice job running the court that time wiped out his season last year and they told us what 80 to 85 and they told us a week ago he couldnt dunk so now all he does is dunk so I guess hes getting better evidence supports it NOS by five car the catch he got blocked by Applause Miller Miller off the bounce into the lane for gainy well duning a good maybe he should dunker poopy Miller with the sharp shooting freshman Frederickson poopy Miller a shot big tries another and knocks it down this time you know you think youre open and then one of those big guys comes after you Leonard Hamilton may not have seven Footers but hes got 611 guys 6 eight guys 69 guys 61 here and Baba Miller Banks into three well now Baba Miller is a guy who can shoot to three even though he thats his 12th three on the season but I dont think he banks many of them in those will take it they struggled shooting from long range this year that was the case Saturday and in a bunch of their losses as well Reed got positioning but its taken away couldnt catch the ball he had an easy dunk Spears turns it over wow that kid is fast transition three Frederickson oh and it spins out and last Touch by Darren Green who disagrees with the call as Ean Reed got his hand in there well we have had a lot of up and down action Reed got Reed did get his hand in there but I thought it went off green I think green thought he was fouled so WS got it down by five Salis leads the ACC in minutes per game Rises up and the rebound to Taylor B Bowen 61 freshman from Vermont wake has not had a lot of uncontested shots and its hard to shoot a high percentage when just about everything you shoot is contested get a foul before the shot from Chandler Jackson first odd Salis who had three in the first half Saturday now you want you want Salis to be aggressive but I dont think he can afford three in the first half in this game heres Spears The Georgetown transfer try to rise up on HRI and the rebound down to car Spears is a guy whos looking to scorey Miller trying to shake B Bowen with a teardrop floater thats pretty wow and again that was not an uncontested shot his quickness got him a just a brief window poy biller coming off the season High 27 in the Wake win against Miami Camp Corin muscle Zack Keller for Applause two theres a little bit of contact there and Keller wasnt able to keep his balance Corin the sophomore from Texas who missed five games with with a broken toe that kept him out a month salz backs it out and Keller turns it over green the pick the stick one of the things youve got to do against Florida state is you have to make short passes green is going to pick up a foul there trying to get the ball from gry Miller but again youre going to take that if youre lenon Hamilton you want that kind of aggressiveness well Florida State doing it with defense they have course wake into four turnovers they have blocked a couple of shots as well and theyve got the eightpoint lead here at home against the Demon Music Applause Music Deacons out of owners insures your car because sometimes something

the game the seminal have ridden their defense to this 12point lead this is a team that forces turnovers they forced four and when you can get Darren Green down there for a transition three hes already made two threes today but look at Florida State number two in the ACC in steals per game number one in forcing turnovers and those are just numbers Mike unless you convert them and the seminal have converted them today I mean if you watch the game on Saturday the Florida state played against Virginia Tech you saw it in the second half and really the defense for the NES bailed out a lot of their offensive sloppiness they really did struggle they shot very poorly from three they missed a lot of free throws but their ability to force turnovers they force 16 and their ability to rebound the ball offensively they had 11 that helped turn that game and what did longtime assistant coach Stan Jones say to us as well at the end of shooter around we want to wear them down with our 11 or 12 guys against maybe the six or seven that wake typically plays and what has happened so far is Wake Forest again theyre shooting cont tested shots now Corin he got he was trying to set a screen and he screened by four different guys but he was moving the whole time Wake Forest has been able to get the ball past the initial defense but when they get into the Lane Florida state is covering them up wake wants to try to kick it out to get a jump shot but theyre only one for six from three so nothing going the way the des planer against Florida state whos already used 11 players 8 and 12 minutes into this game as usual Salis backs it out hrth moves it corner for boy Miller one of four from long range and thats perfect offensively except the ball didnt go in the basket if youre going to get shots like that against Florida State you have to make a high percentage oh everything but the jump shot to drop for Primo Applause Spears nice job to get back by the center Salis for HRI much improved shooting in his junior year and again those are the kind of shots it looks like they can get if theyre aggressive and theyre going to have to knock them down thats only the second three the deakes have made and you said theyre an excellent threepoint shooting team they really are 38 as a team is a pretty good number second best in the ACC Josh nickelberry cans a Music three and nickelberry is the guy they brought him in here as a threepoint shooter and he started his career du Kane then went to Lal and then came to Florida State and he can shoot the three and that W hor does not want to see him get going nickelberry hadnt made a three since before Christmas hes got the NES up by eight Midway through the first half Salis with the shot clock winding down to get stripped by Corin B Bowen leads the break with a chump stop at 61 and it stays in Florida State we talked about Wake Forest threepoint shooting but Florida state has some guys who can knock down the three and this is dribble penetration the ball moves and nickelberry with a wide open Music look thats his 11th threepoint basket made for the year and this is what Leonard Hamilton does guys are in and out and if youre going to play for Florida State you know youre going to play really hard for a short stretch and then youre coming out well its a good sign if Florida state is shooting it well from three theyre four or five from Deep so far 4 five say in their wins they shoot 35 well four five is a little better than that Watkins on the Baseline out of bounds and the lead is 10 Applause W forus its six made buckets against five turnovers just trying to find a flow at this end of the floor against all the length and all the switching of the seal and its a sixth turnover Darren Green the run out and he lays it in Steve Forbes has seen Applause Music enough as a small business owner you learn to wear a lot of hats Auto Owners takes care of your business insurance so you can take care of everything else thats simple human sense ask your independent agent if Auto Owners make sense for you its bow time get fired up tonight because Bojangles has your dinner covered southbound scratch made not one of these but one of these thats more home cooking for your your money or as we like to say cha ching its bo back in Tallahassee the lead is 12 for Florida State who has for six wake Force turnovers and scored nine points as a result and if youre playing against Florida State you have to be very tough with the basketball when they go into traffic you got to hang on their time Reed just doesnt catch it and here again you drive in and the ball gets knocked away and the result is an easy one down on the other end for Florida State W for is trying to settle into this game 11 minutes into it on the road in Tallahassee early on in conference Play Good cut and Frederickson drives a foul well that was a good cut and Frederickson catches the ball inside and what does he see he SE some big guy flying at him so that was a good fake so puts Parker frericks in the from Bixby Oklahoma 42 threepoint shooter does most of his work from Beyond The Arc at the line hey Saturday a basketball triple header on the mens side starts with number 21 Clemson against Boston College in Little John thats at three Eastern then Duke up to 11th in the country survived in South Bend on Saturday they host Georgia Tech in Cameron and then Miami Virginia Tech in blackburg all here on accn and all those games are really important games you know Clemson thats the home game they really have to have that and Virginia Tech theyve theyre struggling a little bit and doesnt help your struggles when you got to play against Miami after Virginia Tech just came in here and after Miami went to Winston Salem and went down to the wire in overtime against the Applause deeps shot clock winding down on jayen warley and he lost the handle and he turns it over thats pretty good defense by white forest because warley is not a guy who is going to pull up and shoot to three hes only made one three all year he wants to drive it to the basket hes got the unenviable task being on boy Miller and now jir watk switches on to him its Miller Carr Reed hildr and Frederickson the five on the floor for Steve Forbes well they dont care whos guarding who they just switch everything o baba Miller in the lane on boopy Miller starts backing down shot clock at three Frederickson around the corner got to get it up and did not get it off in time its a shot clock violation well that time Florida State didnt allow wake Force to get in the lane and again with all that switching heres Reed hes got the ball hes got to let it go and whats he facing hes facing 61 Baba Miller again not to overstate it but Jaylen Worley is your point guard bringing it up and hes 6 s Watton squares up line drive three no Long offensive rebound green Miller on the Block in tight and jump ball will keep it at this end of

metrics from kenpom but you see today they have struggled theyve got more turnovers than made buckets weve been talking about the turnovers and the blocked shots and yes thats part of Defense but the other part of defense is just making your opponent uncomfortable in contesting shots and you saw there wake shoots almost 50 and theyre down to by 30 today and thats because of the Florida State defensive pressure Music Hunter Sal is back on the floor for Wake down by 10 wake for his team at 11 and three we told you one of three undefeated teams early in ACC play with NC State and North Carolina and that whistle goes against Jaylen warley coming in after his inbounds pass he didnt get all the way in you know he can throw it in and step in and get it if somebody else touches it but in that particular case he never got in o good catch by cam hildr on that inbound look at that defensive pressure it makes a really difficult inbounds Applause play Salis kicked that one away turnover number eight for the deakes Salis averages 18 points a game in so in this year so far this year and tonight he has two Watkins rebound car Salis with two held with three Carr with two those are all guys at 14 points per game are better Salis lost the handle gets bailed out by Deontay green BR Salis has been so good he just seems a little bit discombobulated here tonight and you have to say maybe its the pressure that Florida state has been able to apply I think the digs have to get Fon Reed involved with a post up and its hard because theres so much pressure on the ball but Reeds got to get himself in position particularly against mismatches and theyve got to get him the ball just two point Saturday three points so far today hes got it but its an offensive foul and thats his first personal and thats exactly the kind of mismatch youre looking for but youre looking for that down on the Block not 8 ft away and Reeds got to recognize that hes not going to drive by Green so another turnover Wake Forest has not scored a basket in three minutes now but theyve turned the ball over four Applause times Baba Miller turns the corner the sophomore Spaniard gave it up to Primo Spears drives on Salis hes a tough shot maker but that rolled off and Spears is still scoreless HR Frederickson hits boy that was in much needed basket and they were able to create something in transition how fun to watch has Parker Frederickson been he doesnt strike you as a Applause freshman Spears for green summons Watkins and uses Spears around the screen and an illegal screen set by Jaylen gainy Wake Forest has have problems getting open shots but when you move the ball particularly in transition you can get open shots Leonard Hamilton demonstrably needed a timeout we take it as well then

could see is he said I want the ball moving move it he was upset that there was an illegal screen but not with the illegal screen really but with the fact that theres too much dribbling going on he wants the ball to move and he wants him to move via the pass his team up by seven with six plus to go in the first half at 8 six overall 21 in the ACC and winners of four of their last five since they had that four game losing streak that included against Georgia Carolina USF and SMU but back on track recently especially here in the ACC against Georgia techa Virginia Tech Frederickson shot clock at five its hildr he hits and a couple of big threes for the deeps and a really good job by hildr to find an open spot on the Applause penetration second triple for cam hildr at 16 plus per game Watkins to the Elbow contested shot and he got fouled by Salis and you know if youre Salis you just have to understand you already have a foul youre not a shot blocker youve just got to let that one go second on Salis and Watkins to the line where he hits 7 7 wait for us within four Salis has really struggled hes turned the ball over three times hes only got two points and hes now got those two fouls hes going to come out of the game so this is a very important last 5 minutes and 22 seconds for Wake fourth theyre going to have to play it without Hunter Salis and Miller who has come in the game for him also has one foul so hes got to be aggressive but hes also and its easy to be a little bit calmer on defense but you dont want to get yourself a charge here Steve Forbes is typically among the most lenient coaches in the country when you get two fouls in the first half yeah but I think he sees that Salah simply is not playing well tonight every time white forest has tried to bring the ball up the court they face the pressure poopy Miller drives to the rim wow how did he get through there got a lot of Tyrie applebe in him and hes been a joy to watch Spears for Bol Bowen he knocks it down second Collegiate three for Taylor B Bowen D comes in shooting 09 9 Frederickson answers he shoots a little higher than 9 thats a big answer by Wake Applause Music Forest the kid from Bixby Oklahomas

on the networks of ESPN curly fire my CH got feelingson Music top all right okay I did it my H Salis so far this year has been one of the best players and one of the top scorers in the ACC but quiet in the first half tonight yet Dam honter despite that and despite nine turnovers from Wake Forest theyre within four W they really are and Wake Forest I mean they have played fairly poorly but theyve shot the ball well here in the last couple of minutes Florida state only won for their last five and you would think if you werent looking at the scoreboard after just watching this first half that Florida state would have a bigger lead Fon Reed is good on the first wake start at 0 for four from three now Steve Forbes team more like it from Long Range Five of its last seven and a lot of that from Parker Frederickson The Freshman hes got a team High eight and a couple of Music triples Reeds got him with in two and Reed is a resource that they really havent used very much today I mean hes been able to get open in the post when they have tried to post about Five Points four rebounds one field goal attempt Spears again a misfire on a tough shot and hes 0 for four and still scoreless theres Frederickson who had been ready to go to Notre Dame before the coaching change there Steve Forbes told us today they werent really involved the first time around with Parker Frederickson poy Miller on a Baseline Drive draws a foul met there by Taylor bu Applause Bowen and amazingly enough Mike Miller is going to the line with a chance to tie the game with the one and one for boy Music Miller leads been as large as a dozen for the seminal and now Miller at the strike first half in which hes got seven points couple rebounds couple of assists coming off the big game Saturday that went against Miami where we told he had a season High 27 10 of 19 shooting from the floor we told you how much praise he generated when we chatted with Leonard Hamilton Steve Forbes said to us today boopy Miller is the guy thats the most improved on our entire roster since we got him back in the spring but youre coming in from a smaller mid major and the level of play is just different its going to take a while to get adjusted that right there would appear to be a guy who has adjusted wake has as well in this game theyve tied it at 32 just outside of 3 minutes to go in the first half from the Tucker Music Center Watkins got bumped by hildr who gets tagged for his first foul well hrth did a pretty nice job until Watkins left the floor and then hildr moved into it hildr is an extremely aggressive player on both ends of the court I think hes a little underrated as a Defender but his effort is just outstanding there are a few guys in not just the ACCC but in the country who play as hard as consistently as Cam hildr and he plays a lot of minutes too sure does and you know I hildr he hasnt scored a lot tonight but Frederickson has really picked up the slack there he has been very valuable for Wake Forest off the bench and a lot of run in this first half with his eight Watkins good on both the lead is two for Florida State Wake get three and0 in the league Florida State at two and one in ACC action early on post touch for Fon Reed it be better if it was a post touch now he dribbles it into the post and scores hes listening now that time he was matched up against Corin so its a big guy and thats a little bit easier for him to drive it into the post area Corin didnt get any help B Bowen lost it on the way up and saved by Carr hildr splits to the rack he is just unbelievable aggessive and Wake Forest has the lead always ambitious never deterred Cam hildr and Wake Forest indeed has come back from a dozen down Green cant tie it wake is running with all the momentum car gets stripped well you got to get rid of that ball if youre Applause car Watkins thought about it green left alone Corin hesitated and missed it when you have 611 car and 7ft Tall Fon Reed standing there looking at you thats reason for hesitation coming up on the final 90 seconds before halftime boy Miller is hounded by Spears and it does stay with weight course 15 left on the shot clock talked about Florida State being able to force the turnovers but this time Wake Forest gets it and nobody stops hildra he just splits two Defenders and theres nobody at the Music basket wake hadnt LED since it was 54 in the early going Miller oh he just in the air doesnt he know Isaac Newtons Theory how can he stay up there hes got 11 Spears is calling for it now Corin bangs with Carr who stayed down but its a chance at three for cam Applause Corin thats an important basket for Florida State you know you have to answer this he just how did he stay up there that long and Corin does a great job maintaining his pivot foot one and Carr in not a lot of contact there but corins got it down to one poopy Miller took that right out of the Chris likes handbook well I dont know whose handbook he took it out of but he stayed up there a long time final minute first half Frederickson wants it another came up short Reed to Applause Green Baba Miller in Rhythm knocks it Applause down nice little spurt by the semal at the end of the half 6 and 12 second Difference game game and shot clock boy Miller is blocked by Baba Miller see right there Reed was matched up against Primo Spears he needs to Sprint down to the block because when he gets on the low post he can catch the pass instead Miller tries to drive the ball and thats what happens hed rather have Reed against Spears than Miller against Miller HRI floater no and a foul with 13 15 seconds to go until Applause Music halftime hildr is one of the top free throw shooters in the ACC and in a game like this all everything is important and I think here now that Florida State seems to be getting a little momentum back these two free throws before the half are very very important its been well documented that Wake Forest is a team is one of the best free throw shooting squads in the country 80 fourth best in the nation and eight of eight tonight Keller for Reed 13 seconds to go until halftime just trying to keep Reed out of foul trouble a split and then a foul goes against Wake Forest on the rebounding action that was Music K theyre going to get Carr for his second Carr okay so an entertaining first half as promise with the up and down action plenty of scoring very slow start for Wake Forest and they battled their way back in and now were going to change free throw shooters here this is interesting theyre going to go look and see who should be shooting the free throw yeah Ron gr smelled something fishy as Deontay green was getting ready to shoot and Greens a 71 free throw shooter gr insists that it should be Baba Miller and thats because hes a 41 free throw shooter that maybe Florida state would want to manage that and it looks like it will be Miller who will have to step in and shoot it for the nolles well I mean that is a really nice try by green and even when he steps off the line he looked innocent so who does Carr commit the foul on well the guy who went down was green now you could say the initial push was on 11 Miller if if if the foul is on car that Millers the shooter if the foul is on Keller then green is the shooter but the foul is called on Carr and Miller says I dont care well you know you make a couple of Threes you start to feel a little bit more confident with your ability to put the ball in the Applause basket the highly regarded rookie newcomer last year sophomore this here makes Applause both final few seconds hildr playing off two feet with a tear drop Applause wow 11 for cam HR and hes got wig within one headed to half first half huh led the way with 10 in that first half I think Wake Forest would really like to get Reed more involved down on the post and they would like to get Hunter Salis involved in any way possible 7 points five rebounds for Ethan Reed in the first half and for Hunter Salis two points and three turnovers K tough turnaround Applause no Florida state two and one in the ACC winners of four of its last five games and a turnover from jir Applause Watkins hildr stayed patient a shot faked and a foul its on Applause warley well again hild is a guy whos going to attack he stops and thats just a play that you got to let go if youre warly he reaches in and you know everybodys mad that looked to me like he slapped him across the arm you and Leonard Hamilton through the years have had many conversations about officiating well you know generally the officials are not going to let you just slap it out of somebodys hand if theyre dribbling theyll let you tip it away and maybe even with some contact but if somebodys going to knock it out of your hands particularly if their arm is coming down generally thats going to be a foul even if its not a foul but that one was clearly a two shot foul and H converts wake back in front by one he saw the note that Florida State LED for about 75 of that first half Watkins off the green screen he dropped hildr still trying to rise to his feet and Watkins is still open now he drives down the lane and he got fouled by Fon Reed and Deontay green slow to get up for the NES well hildr just got off balance and fell down and I dont think Watkins realized it hris falls down and then Greens going to trip over him knock him down again and by the time hins got the ball hed been open for about 5 seconds and drives it to the basket turned into bowling pins absolutely well I mean its one thing you get you fall down youre trying to get up and some 69ine guy knocks you down again fun Watkins to the stripe for two after the second on Reed Watkins one of the transfers on this years Florida State team and when we chatted with Leonard Hamilton earlier today said to us were getting there theyve dealt with injury this year and he made the point to us like he has it other times this year that theres only one guy of the Dozen in the rotation whos been at Florida State more than two years a lot of new pieces now as we get toward the middle of January maybe finding their stride well hes got hes got his full compliment of players except for cam Fletcher but hes got 11 guys that he he uses double double figure minutes hes getting to feel more comfortable with them understand what they can do in what situation poopy Miller lost it Darren Green in Applause Music transition hes had a good game on both ends well he sure has and wake Force theyve really struggled turning the ball over Sal K it away another turnover that is at least twice in this game Salis has kicked it off his own Applause foot you know Miller I think was trying to pass that ball and green you know you got to worry about the fact that hes going to pull up and shoot the three but hes got the ability to put it down and go right by you hes got 10 points hes made two threes and hes got two steals as well hes got the NES up by three first couple of minutes out of halftime on a Applause flare if your Wake Forest spent the second half of the first half battling back you dont want to get behind again Watkins missed the long two and Reed gets poofy Miller running throws it away you want to run but you want to be under control and that time Miller you know I think he wanted hildr to go further to the corner but there were too many guys over there thats twoo you make the Easy Pass when youre playing against a team like Florida State youve got to make short easy passes and you said wake had kind of corrected the turnovers toward the end of the first half but theyve already given it away three times D green makes a pay and here they are down by five points again now they were down by as many as 14 in the first half but you dont want to spend this entire second half battling back in the game nearly a fourth straight possession with a turnover and it Applause is Steve Forbes needs a timeout that

is just spectacular thats our move womens college hoops on ESPN and ABC its been a wellrounded game from Florida States Darren Green Jr well hes done it on both ends of the Court you see a steal here that misses two in this game that hes stolen the ball and taken it all the way down and scored hes made a couple of Threes hes knocked down midrange jumpers hes run ahead on the break and hes playing very well he averages about 12 points a game he already has 12 you can see averages about a little more than one steal a game he already has three and he has barely been out of this game this is Leonard Hamilton likes to substitute but hes only been out for a few seconds hes played the most minutes of anyone on their team a fifth year senior with more than 1500 points in his career and he has said it coming into the season hes trying to get to the NCAA tournament for the first time in that 5year career and hes trying to hand wake what would be its first loss in the ACC long way to go from the tuck in tallah has with the NS up by five on the deakes Miller on a post up of Carr wasnt even looking and hes got a chance at three we saw in one of those timeouts in the first half of lard Hamilton was telling his guys to move the ball well theyve been doing that in this half really nice job moving with the ball moving without the ball and hes just got great position he doesnt even need to see the bask getting 6 11 he knows its right over his shoulder you know its determined basketball to score with your back to the basket thats as literal as it gets Marcus Marion checks in wait for his freshman from Denmark spells Andrew Carr 3 minutes out of halftime and a lot of discussion about Millers free throw shooting 41 hes made all three tonight and here Florida state is back to an eightpoint lead Wake Forest I think they almost have to score this time Hunter Salis comes up to get it two points four turnovers for one of the top guys in production in the ACC so far Reed has got to get on the low post on the side of the ball I mean dysfunction offensively for Wake hildr was calling for a screen and nobody came W and Reed is standing on the other side of the court telling somebody to move and he needs to come to the ball on the Block wake has been forced out of sorts by this Florida State Defense in length you see H hes got his hand up hes saying hey come on somebody do something 15 seconds in finally a touch for bopy Miller now a reed post up and promptly got Stripped by warley and Reed commits a foul and that is one thing weve seen from Wake Forest throughout this game theyre simply not tough enough with the basketball you know Reed turns and the ball he just you got to hang on to the ball Fon Reed was just barking at his teammates as he came up the floor after wake has turned it over 15 times Reed shouldnt be barking at anybody well theyve turned it over 15 times but five times here we havent even played four minutes in the second half Ive only taken two shots from the floor because of all the turnovers Marion fouls Miller so thats already 14 fouls against Wake Forest this is a very small lineup for the deakes Carr at 611 is sitting on the bench and read at 7 ft is sitting on the bench Keller the biggest guy out there for Wake Forest heres Baba Miller slicing to The Cup warley draws a foul no Florida State can overwhelm you with its length defensively they can do it on the glass as well warley draws the foul NOS by eight okay one dad just got into the house one mom three kids one pack of Bens original jasmine rice one pinch of chaos

Miller the 611 sophomore from Spains been fun to watch tonight well hes known for his versatility and here blocking shots first against the 611 guy then against the sixfooter hes not noted for his threepoint shooting but he can shoot it particularly banking him in and then he does a nice job getting position down low again noted for that versatility weve seen it on the offensive end tonight but weve also seen it on the defensive end when he has been matched up Reg regly against 6 tall Kevin Miller for Wake four Miller Baba Miller that is coming off Virginia Tech Saturday eight points 10 rebounds five assists three steals he did all of that in 26 minutes before he actually fouled out of that game and then more of the same tonight and maybe Baba Miller is starting to turn into the guy that everyone around this program has thought for a couple of years now that he can be hes done a nice job tonight playing within their system he hasnt tried to force anything you know the guy who has had a sneaky good game is jir Watkins you know hes got 12 points and that leads the seminal hes got three rebounds hes got six assists and hes got a steal so again its been very quiet but he has been a very important piece here speaking of Versatility Florida State been 11 for 11 at the free throw line Jaylen Worley splits lead at nine for the seals 4 minutes out of halftime and they are just hounding Parker Frederickson turnover number 16 warley Off to the Races who wanted a hammer on HRI you can just see the Panic as frericks was dribbling the ball up the court being chased by three guys green on the receiving end Music HR transition three to strong everything coming up Florida State out of halftime its the defensive pressure that has set the tone Wake Forest just cant get anything down on the offensive end they can barely get a Applause shot 122 is the scoring margin for Florida State in this second half Deontay green bangs with tell shot clock winding down nearly a turnover Watkins got to get it up cant hit offensive rebound warle but he stepped out of Applause Music bounds it has been very difficult for w for to get the ball across half court and then when they do theyre so theyre not in any position to run any offense at all they are back on their heels completely and again theyre playing a very small lineup right at the moment with hildr Keller boy Miller Frederickson and Salis the five for Steve corbes down by 11 120 run boy Miller shot B cant get around 6 s jayen warley blocked by gainy and and thats just a force draw the defense you have to find the open man and I I mean theres just uh no chance I mean Kellers coming in he doesnt see him hildr is leaking to the corner he doesnt see him this is an extremely tough shot theyre very lucky to get that ball back booby Miller needs a timeout inbounding on the Baseline I mean that thats a perfect example that its hard to even get the ball in bounds hey every Thursday well have a womens basketball double header for you right here on acc Network and the ESPN this week Kiki Jefferson at number 15 Louisville in Pittsburgh to start things off then at 800 Elizabeth kentley and 11th ranked Virginia Tech is at home in blackburg hosting Miami so in the second half Wake Forest in 5 and A2 minutes hasnt made a field goal and thats against six turnovers for one of the best offensive teams not just in the ACC but in the country W theyve barely taken a shot you know you got to shoot the ball to make a shot and when youre throwing it to the guys on the other team its hard for you to get your own shots he talked about feeling the fear bringing it up Court a couple of trips ago for Wake Forest thats how its been for anyone squaring off with Florida State the last few games HRI a miss warley the rebound the lead is 11 in the nlls habit so thats the kind of shot wake Force wants you draw the defense kick it out for a three now keep in mind that Wake Forest came back from a deficit like this in the first half and if youre the DS you got to keep fighting it was 12 in the first half its now 13 after that from Chandler and the largest lead for Florida State and warley he keeps grabbing the ball but and once again hes out bound nice Jackson is a guy who doesnt play a lot of minutes he was hurt a little bit last year but he seems to be coming on as well they put him in the game and he does not turn it over hild boy he just feathers a pass barely got through to Hunter Salis Salis off the bounce he gets stripped got it back tough shot he hits wow thats the first made field goal of the first half and its the first score by Salis in a long time thats only a second basket of the game six plus minutes out of halftime gainy couldnt finish but he got fouled by Keller wait that was some pass gy I mean he caught that even though I think was a little surprised that was a bullet J so jayen gainy to the strike sixth year senior in his 10th game of the season remember he missed the first three weeks after last years torn ACL that forced him to miss the entire season he said in the first half that Leonard Hamilton estimated to us pregame its probably about 80 to 85 still has a really big brace on the right leg you see out with the knee injury after hes transfer to Florida State and that Leonard Hamilton talked about him all year last year that this was a guy Dynamic Defender a guy they thought could score for him in the low post and suddenly they didnt have it Miss Bol Salis got a switch from Miller Salis nearly turned it over another time boy Miller on the pitch back youre so worried about the defense coming at you you dont catch it cleanly Frederickson hits now that was that was a tough offensive possession by the deeps and even though that wasnt a great pass to frericks now he gets a steal and Frederickson lays it in how good is this kid he was a big factor in the first half and suddenly here were talking about Florida State and how theyre just forcing wake into all kinds of turnovers and suddenly now its a sixpoint game again five quick ones in a hurry from Parker Frederickson Jackson got it swatted away by poopy Applause Miller sixpoint margin 12 and a half to go here at the Tucker Center tipping off our accn double header had some good conference games getting back into the league play Bowen works on Salis off the glass boy he really was smooth I mean what how many teams are able to bring a guy like that off the deep B boy Miller cant connect and Keller draws a foul in between three noes fighting for a rebound and gainy gy is limping a little bit and hes grimacing and cam corins going to come get him sure hope hes all right long road back for Jaylen gainy from last year with the preseason torn ACL how many times is that weve SE wait for us unable to get the ball in bounds 610 Taylor Bowen who forced it that time well you got to realize the 610 guys got pretty long arms Spears thats tough to handle for Corin boopy Miller ahead for hildr muscles

absolutely Stan told us that they want to take one of the three Wake Forest guards out of of the game and they have certainly accomplished that so far with Hunter Salis he has really struggled hes struggled shooting the ball he struggled handling the ball its just been a very frustrating night for him but with all that being said its still just a sixpoint game cam HRI caps off a threepoint play and now its down to five side at 12 to go it was a typically hildr threepoint play he goes against two guys gets fouled and makes the basket anyway Shan fake off two feet classic cam HRI Josh nickelberry draws a Applause foul and again nickelberry a transfer in from Lal after playing at Louisville for a while and this a guy who can put points on the board and hes a little quicker than Frederickson and takes him right to the goal get on the first gymnastics on acc Network Friday and Saturday night at 9 Eastern its all part of three quad Meats first one Friday with North Carolina

into the midrange you dont get a lot of scoring from Jackson but he has looked really good with that pull up in the midrange Miller had to adjust saw nickelberry flying at him kick out Frederickson off Applause Target that was some pass by BL Miller a wide open Parker Frederickson Spears short sitting on just two points tonight got a back tap of Applause Miller hwi just forces his way in there as you say creates some space with his physical play Then Jackson as I say hes looked really good with that pullup jump shot cam Hilder having a career year hes taking another step forward after last years one of the most improved players in the ACC for hildr this year career highs in points per game and all the shooting efficiencies as well Ruby Miller Walks With It turnover number 18 for the Demon Deacons and Miller had a lane to the basket and Spears did a great job not fouling him letting him make a mistake if you lip red Steve Forbes though he said he fouled him with maybe one other word thrown in the middle Midway through the second half an adjective yes could call it that strip from Frederickson Salis spots up connects and you know if hes going to get going thats really going to help Wade forest and he is a big shot maker who has been very quiet tonight maybe some semblances for him of Saturday where he got going late had a big shot late thats a big shot for Chandler Jackson again in the midrange hes got six points now averages five a game had a career high 14 last Wednesday in the win against Georgia Tech Applause Miller circling spinning scoring my Heavens Steve corbes is really upset he thought there was more than one foul there but I mean Bing Miller what a great Applause job first points of the second half for boopy Miller Baba Millers got a new career high with 13 wow theyll take your Miller and raise your one boy and Baba going back and forth offense is heating up hildr shot big glass two more wa and hildr is he is really fired up trying to get his teammates fired up he just puts his head down and Applause goes inside of eight and a half to go and Tallahasse Florida four guys from Florida State waiting to come in when they left their lead was 11 nickelberry cant add to the fivepoint margin Applause now DS can make it a one possession game and a foul on the perimeter is called on Josh nickelberry and now the reinforcements for Florida State Watkins Deontay green Darren Green Jaylen warley all coming back to join Baba Miller it was these five who built the lead as large as 13 in this second half for Florida State everybodys got their starters back in the game now because Andrew Carr has come in and Frederickson whos been so valuable Off the Bench taking a Music breather he sits with 13 points Carrs been quiet just two and theres a mismatch inside against Green they have to find it reeds in there against Darren Green but instead its another turnover Wake Forest is I rate Ron gr comes in to support Lee Cassell and says it was deflected and should stay with Wake Forest when we come back Steve Forbes and Wake Forest within five against Florida State on the Music road Music its bow time get fired up tonight because

night every Wednesday in January the Leagues biggest teams the games brightest stars NBA Wednesday on ABC Home of Wake Forest 47th in todays net rankings and yeah its January 9th but this is a really significant game on both sides you know it really is Florida State again theyre trying to adjust theyre at 119 but both of these teams are looking to go to the NCA tournament and for for Wake Forest this would be a big game for them to come in here and win its all about you know youre just you sort of get in conference play and youre sort of Al Davis Just Wind DAV Jack clock at five out of the timeout and Reed right down the Applause lane you know thats about the best movement without the ball that weve seen from W forest all night Music long now can they get a stop done a nice job battling back in the game mainly because theyve stopped turning the ball over Watkins back out Miller too strong that was deep way too long you know he may be a pretty good threepoint shooter with his toes on the line HRI nearly CED it upy Miller backs it out Miller turns around and well go to the free throw line for two this just really a nice job somehow they lose Fon Reed and hes 7 ft tall I dont know how you can lose him but Florida state does an awful lot of switching and they switch that time and somebody just forgot to guard Reed and thats a big basket for Wake Miller to the stripe 80 with read up to nine points to go along with eight rebounds you know were talking about the net as well and wig Forest obviously theyve dug into this over the last couple of years missed out two years ago despite 25 wins conference players the year and we were talking with their staff today and they said this is the first year that they have talked to their players about each game what number quad game it is so it might be a lot to throw at you in terms of the numbers and the Nets and quad one through Quad 4 theyre talking about it within their team this year because thats how important it is everybody wants to make the NCA tournament and thats the formity you get as many quad one and quad two wins as you can and you avoid quad three and quad four losses Florida States lead down to one Darren Green hangs had it roll out Reed and hild both ripping down the same rebound well hild is giving it to anybody Miller L Carr Applause fou now that time we have seen many times tonight Mike where wake is running the ball up the cour and they just havent been very tough with it and have turned it over that time it was tough from the rebound all the way down Miller recovers gets it to Carr and hes able to control it despite the foul he keep pretty close to making that me you mentioned that it its a 94 ft fight just to get the ball to the other end against Florida State what what did lonard Hamilton tell us today was the definition of an ACC blowout three points three points he takes great pleasure in that line as well its one of his favorite lines after a weekend in the ACC in which five of the seven games on Saturday were decided by 10 points or fewer including the games that both these teams played car splits we tied at 67 with 640 to go in Tallahassee so Wake Forest they got behind by 13 and now they battled back its like a repeat of the first half now it becomes a 6 and 1 half minute game Watkins for Corin cant stroke it rebound boy Miller hes running with Salis Miller all the way to the r thats a nice job by Miller to hang on to that ball and not pass it hes got 17 and seven Watkins bumped by hildr his Applause second Miller takes that rebound off and he just goes and he looked at Hunter Salis and distracted green I think green thought he was going to pass the ball and Miller has accomplished that under intense pressure every time hes gotten anywhere near the ball its had to work four turnovers of the 18 that wake has as a team jir Watkins at the line 77 this year 74 for his career and hes good on the front end of a one and one with wake at 18 fouls when again he has been quietly very very good made all seven of his free throws at the moment coming off one of his lowest scoring games of the Season against the Hokey Saturday ties this up at 69 Applause Reed the catch on the perimeter Midway through the shot clock hand off Miller post entry Reed is blocked by Miller but thats what they wanted to do they wanted to get it to breed inside but Miller with just a tremendous defensive good play Baseline cut oh and the scoop for chamir Applause Watkins we have seen a couple gravity defying plays tonight and this is one of them nice back door cut he goes underneath three how did he get that up there this a great jump stop and then he just flips it up with the spin hes fully on the other side of the hoop the left side of the hoop he definitely get an H for that cuz theres no way no way the guy iss playing is able to make that shot you and I are toast against that Im toast against most things but certainly that by the way it was the fourth foul on Fon Reed so he sits with 531 to go threepoint play for Watkins qu nice response by the seiners you know Wake Forest has run off a couple of points taking the lead and now the DS have to battle back again Frederickson getting key minutes tonight and he draws a foul on jir Watkins they will send him to the line for the one and one before that foul I thought jayen Worley made a great play inside Andrew Carr was fighting hard for position hes got four Ines and a number of pounds on warley but warley just would not be denied fought his way around in front and Frederickson couldnt see the pass it in there Frederickson for the one and one its only his fourth free throw attempt of the year and wake had backed out everyone and so the rebound easily down to Florida Applause State hes a threepoint shooter dont get foul punch but that is a big Miss hes only taken four twopoint shots this year as well Miller hes fouled over the top of hildr who gets saddled with his third foul well thats a situation where Miller goes up and hildr just needs to go put his hands straight up but he moved his body underneath so it puts Baba Miller at the line told you 41 for the season but three of three tonight part of 80 free throw shooting for the nolles in this Applause game gets the roll hey Thursday night 10 Eastern after our womens basketball double header the nothing but net crew breaks down the night in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every womens game and then theyll look ahead to the next week as well coverage right here here on accn and the ESPN app with Kelsey and the Gang a split for Miller boy a lot of contact there from Miller on hildr hes left alone cant hit offensive rebound from Andrew Carr thats a big Applause rebound Sal driving on warley hangs oh and its swirled out thats the kind of shot that weve seen Hunter Salis make all year now wake needs a stop warley is fouled on the drive and Florida state is making it impossible for the Geeks to get a stop because they are Relentless driving the ball of the baskets have been forced into one foul after another four on car car was actually screened off by Corin that time and as he was struggling to get around he ran into Music Applause war Jaylen Worley a 65 free throw shooter one of two tonight so you got Reed he said already with four fouls hes been out since the 531 Mark now Andrew cars Scott for as well well at this point you leave Carr in and if he fouls out then you bring Reed back Applause in orley makes p and for a team in Florida state that has struggled at the free throw line this year below 70 theyve been nailed so far tonight HRI streaks to the basket and got blocked but a go Tad call on cam Court well you know hildr I mean his intensity has been amazing all night long he is trying to put his teammates on his back with that intensity and carry them I mean hes just going straight to the goal and once the ball hits the backboard above the basket it is an automatic goal T and the officials R of conell just told us that they were going to look at it but theyre going to decide that was a goal T I appreciate the fans behind us though they said to Bri you can look at that after he told us were going to look at that and thats the new rule this year if you make the call the next TV time out you can look at it and see if it really was Darren Green Strokes the three thats a huge Music Applause Music basket nos lead at seven HRI got it to boy Miller hes got Baba Miller out of it its hard to shoot over Baba Miller 11in difference risky pass found Frederickson shot clock winding down booby Miller off the bounce for HRI a three cant hit again that pressure that pressure it makes you go faster than you want to and now on the offensive then they continue to exsert the pressure by attacking the basket Watkins lost it boopy Miller poked it away he runs with Salis slashing Salis for Carr off the pigs and he is fouled its on jir Applause Watkins its been a one or two possession game these last few minutes but Darren Green rising up with a big three to push the lead the seven for Florida State with 308 to go in Tallahassee Music PGA Tour live

its been a very interesting game theyve gone back and forth of one another Florida States defense has been a big key but Wake Forest has responded Parker Frederickson in particular came off the bench knocked down a couple of Threes very one of the very few times that the defense broke down there for Florida State here a spectacular play that may be a big b moment in and of itself been plenty of them like you said tonight with 308 to go hes Dan B Im Mike Monaco our entire crew behind the scenes led by producer Luke brri and director Kirby kander in a game that is not disappointed between wake poris winners of nine straight games hottest team in the ACC with the fifth longest active winning streak in the country 30 in the league and Florida State at 21 in the ACC Andrew Carr good on the first quick programming note youre looking for Notre Dame George DET Tech set to tip 3 minutes from now at 910 eastern time if were still playing we likely will be you can watch that on the ESPN app until were done here in Tallahassee his car splits deficit at six for wake and that is a 79 free throw shooter as has missed two free throws here down the stretch Wake Forest needs stops Jaylen warley Baseline cut from Watkins Corin that Relentless attack by Florida State breaks down the defense 80 to 72 2 and A2 to go at the tuck Music cam hildren has a ball screen from Fon Reed off the rejection hildr underneath turns it over darrk Greens Off to the Races exclamation boopy Miller passed up the long three Hill children Rises connects down to seven 156 to go and Steve Forbes takes the time Applause out but Fon Reed does not step to the ball hild thinks he will and as a result Darren Green gets it and how many times have we seen green do this tonight at least three or four where he gets a turnover and goes down and converts but Im Im telling you the key to this whole thing has been the intensity with which Florida state has played on both ends of the floor and Leonard Hamilton thats why he plays so many guys you know hes had tonight that I think see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 guys and the everybodys played at least 9 minutes talk about the intensity on both ends of the floor weve talked a lot about Florida States defensive pressure and all the turnovers wakes at tonight but again go back to what Leonard Hamilton said to us in shoot around today were not in syn yet offensively the intensity at that end theyve looked to be in a better flow offensively than they have been for a lot of this season and thats true and theyre still putting things together remember that timeout we saw in the first half where lenon Ham Hamilton was upset and told him to move the ball well theyve done a much better job moving the ball to make a pass or two and then they attack off the dribble and wake Force they just simply havent been able to handle it and think about this with Florida State as well two games in a row now theyve ramped up defensive pressure on two really sound and very efficient offensive basketball teams with offensive coaches in Mike young and Steve Music fors sevenpoint lead for the seals trying to get to 3 and one in the ACC and snap wake forests niname winning streak 156 to go and Jaylen warley uses one of three remaining timeouts for Florida State and Leonard Hamilton another reminder if youre tuning in looking for Notre Dame Georgia Tech from the flats in Atlanta right now you can watch it on acc Network extra and on your ESPN app and then when were done here in Tallahassee we will send you off to Midtown you know Georgia Tech is another team they had a really tough loss on Saturday and so did Notre Dame you know Notre Dame has everybody says well you know in Micah shrewsburys first year theyre not going to be very good but they have you know they had that big win against Virginia and they have battled in every other game that they played in the coner like Leonard Hamilton says blow out is three points hes done the research on it over the last few years large percentage of League games are within lets say Five Points all right worle to put it in again Florida State up by seven Buck 56 left orley did get it into Darren Green and now Florida State theyve been attacking the entire game and I think they have to continue to attack you dont want to take the foot off the gas pedal too early its okay to run some clock but you dont want to lose your aggressiveness well theyve used 20 seconds and finally get inside the arc with warley on a Euro rolled out hildr hes had one speed in this second half Miller attacks kicks Salis hits fourpoint Applause game couple of Threes here late for Salis see but again got a attack I think 8278 Florida state with 103 to go on a ticking second half clock Watkins this is a good match up for Florida state drives on Carr and lost his footing and its a traveling call with 542 to go and weit getting the basketball down 8278 that is a very nice job by Wake Forest Fon Reed came over to help and that forced Watkins to stop and he wasnt able to get a stop his Fleet Feet slid out from under him see run grer telling hild its a spot throwing hildr violated that in the first half follow the rules on this one 48 seconds to go wake for is down by four kick to the quarter Salis again again and its a foul on poopy Miller who cleared out Jaylen warley and he gets saddled with a foul off Applause ball boy Salis had an open Applause look Miller runs into him thats I mean thats clearly a blocking foul the ball didnt go in anyway so 8278 Florida State up by four with the basketball two timeouts left if they need him I think you got to think about fouling and this is the guy right here you fou a guy in jayen Worley who for the season we told you 65 and for his career is at 67 tonight hes three of four at the free throw line but you really dont have a lot to choose from out there with this lineup in the game thats why he took Baba Miller out of the game warley the Junior from Philly and of course what you have have to do if youre wake Force if he misses you have to block out he misses the first so its still 8278 395 seconds to go in the second half from the T little hitch in that free throw something hes had for a few years here at Florida State Leonard Hamilton has told us he spent a lot of time working on his shooting Applause for he makes the second splits and now the lead is five 8378 with 40 seconds to go and here comes Baba Miller this is a defensive Applause substitution wake for is down by five boy Miller off the bouns goes spinning tough shot goes and its down to three 8380 319 left couple of timeouts for the noes Baba Millers the guy to foul they dont foul him they do get warley and Andrew Carr has fouled out and will send Jaylen warley right back to the free throw line 8380 is the Florida state league and this is what weve seen from Wake Forest all night they havent been efficient theyve turned the ball over sometimes but they have never stopped battling and here they were down by seven and you figure okay the game over not so much Reed and Carr both had four Carr fouls out with 278 seconds left and Steve Forbes Demon Deacons on a niname winning streak is the hottest team in the ACC one of the hottest teams in the country trailing 8380 the officials are trying to get everybody out to the free throw line its not a timeout no its not a timeout but a game thats been played at in Up Tempo old teams understandably treating it as such a reminder we will get you to Atlanta for Notre Dame Georgia TKA game thats underway on the ESN app its 8380 Florida State in front a wake two free throws for jayen warley four of six there tonight good on the first hes poured a lot of time into this and now in big spots down down the stretch hit the strike for the junior only guy whos been on this team and in the rotation for three straight years for Leonard Hamilton makes both at its 8580 Florida State 28 seconds to go in the second half W with it down five got to score very quickly Miller shoves for Frederickson too much time boy Miller off the crossover blocked by warley but a foul is called they get Baba Miller for the foul with 145 seconds to go and Wake Forest down 8580 and they may be looking here to see if that was a goal T I dont think they call goal tting so they cant be looking to see with the goal Music T I think theyre looking to see who committed the foul Le cel just went to have a quick look wanted to make sure so you have to call go tending to review it no matter when you call it so but D he went over to look to see who committed the foul called on Baba Miller his second 155 seconds left in the second half Florida States up 85 to 80 on Wake Forest boopy Millers good on the first 8581 wake down by four with another coming for Applause Miller hes got 20 points seven rebounds and five assists tonight against all the pressure from Florida State makes bolt and its a threepoint margin now Florida stay up 8582 with 155 to go and Janka the sophomore from Italy the UCLA transfer comes in with fouls to bear 155 left green whips it in Watkins a good free throw shooter and bopy Miller has to foul him three on Miller Watkins to the line where hes perfect tonight 9 for n and 77 this season and they put in zanka did the decks so he could commit a foul and the guy he wanted to foul was Baba Miller but Baba Miller took him down to the other end where he didnt have an opportunity to foul Jame manip on both sides with 135 seconds remaining in the second half at the tuck and Tallahassee 8582 is the Florida state lead when hes got two shots everyone getting a line with Fon Reed ready to return for Wig Forest if youre Florida State you didnt need to take that much time to get warley down there you dont really need him on the first shot 135 left and Watkins makes the first so its 8682 reads back Florida State leads by four and Florida States defensive pressure has just been hard for Wake to score quickly and thats what wake needs to do Watkins makes B hes 11 for 11 at the free throw line tonight Florida stay up five 8782 boopy Miller with 8 seconds to go frericks in for three cant hit battle on the boards 3 seconds left Reed Hoy and that will do it Florida State takes down Wake Forest and is three and one in the ACC and snaps the dees nine game winning streak
