Malu watch will chip it off against yigu I wouldnt recommend you saying that five times very quickly and Duke controls a tip thats a guy you were just talking about Khan kiple out of Wisconsin this is a young Team Six freshman they have four grad students only two seniors and only two jors and just one sophomore everybody else in their first year at Duke flag lost his footing was tripped good recognition by kiple that last time a little pick and roll action SMU opted to try to flare out on that you get Cooper flag diving to the basket youre going to have to try to take some things away from duke you got to make sure that you limit their first and second options make them play into the shot clock and get some stops I mean flag has been as advertised theres no debate about it he leads the team in scoring rebounding assist Steals and Blocks hes only the sixth player all time a Duke in their first 13 games to have 200 or more points 100 or more rebounds and what youre going to see during this game is that theyre going to give him a lot of different options theyre going to put him in the post theyre going to have him drift out by the line give him some oneonone opportunities as well the flag drops some both full court pressure for Duke and booy Miller is a guy that can handle the pressure remember now last year at Wake Forest lopy Miller led the Demon Deacons to a win over Duke thats when all the fans storm the court remember all that shot clock at Music 10 cross from downtown Bingo hes a good player and hes a guy that got we talk about having some dog in you he will not shy away from contact can give you in and out and for SMU you have to be able to to execute your offense to be able to have a shot today cross averages 11 points and eight rebounds former all Atlantic 10 player at UMass but he is a good good player Proctor to the rack and lays it in and thats one of the things that Proctor does does a wonderful job of being able to probe that lane malawat came up and gave him an opportunity to get right to the rim this Duke team long average height of Applause 66 cion James is defending the point how about the body on that guy lopy Miller probably a little quicker heres cross again too strong and the rebound for Duke racing the other way what a move by Proctor finds the open man kiple Bang from the corner and time we talk about how good Duke is defensively they want to get out and Pace as well any chance they get theyre going to spread you out touch the paint you said it last time being able to get the ball over to can nipple to knock down that corner three Applause two minutes have gone by cross into the lane kicks it back out to Miller with 10 on the shot clock defended by James now they switch and lopy Miller trying to go right by kiple but hes long and is able to block it again we talk about this Duke team when they get out of in transition do a good job watch Proctor be able to get in there Force the help canle is able to get his shot again thats a good side for him for a guy thats been trying to get his three to fall again theyre going to hit the paint and put a lot of pressure on smus defense triy to bounce it in Cross and it looked like Proctor knocked it away so 34 on the shot clock or what a player Carell was he earned his stripes hes 47 years young out of St Louis Missouri hes one of two players along with Nate James to win an Atlanta Coast Conference regular season Championship each of his four years at D and this is a guy that when he played was Fearless could give you a little bit of everything with hard nose a defensive guy great opportunity for him again to be able to have the opportunity to coach a Duke can have this one today they better to put it up shot clock at one Im not sure that Trey Ori who is a junior transfer from UC Santa Barbara realized the time on the shot clock Applause piple again from three not there hes a 34 shooter from threepoint range and traveling violation after getting the rebound on Johan tayori youll see them run canle off a lot of staggers and then again you have to you see it last play by tayori out of bounds you have to be able to close out those possessions and in the corner its Proctor he has five early on and Proctor along with kipple and well see Isaiah Evans those are the main snipers for Duke you cannot give those guys opportunities to get uncontested threes Duke on a seven nothing run cross thought about it goes to the rack and hell go to the line thatll be a foul against malat a 72 freshman grew up in the South Sudan in Africa part of the NBA Academy in Africa you played overseas NBAs everywhere overseas everywhere and then going back to the play where Matt cross we saw him knock down that three but hes a guy thats hard knows that will put his head down and will get to the rim that theyre going to need that today last three games for cross he was injured the very first play the very first game of the year dislocated his tailbone Andy Enfield had never heard of that injury and so he missed three weeks hes just getting his feet underneath him now and hes been one of their best players you saw the last three games averaging over 18 points a game theyre going to need him you see penetration and the kick out over the Proctor again and knock down that three boy has he been hot in this one eight points already in a 13 to four Blue Devils Applause lead oh boy little ankle breaker there but you got to finish that right swatted away 15 on the shot clock well he is a presence in there isnt he these two big guys are freshman theyre going to be around for a long time and some good battles and you see e Tulu come up with that and then Mal watch is like no suit for you today my friend get that up out of here and again you understand for SMU youre going to have to execute your offense because again were talking about one of the best halfcourt defensive teams in the country Duke does a good job with their length and being able to limit what they want the first second options over in the corner and a three too strong but Edwards able to get the rebound and hell dribble out of the corner great pass underneath and SW it away again good pass by Edwards getting that offensive rebound you see jori get there malow watch is one of those guys that anywhere around the rim hes not going to drift too far away from the rim got to be able to get that ball up there quick I think they got kiple with the foul they did he reached in on the arm and got a piece of trior who is a 69 free throw Applause shooter SMU seems a little sped up again a game of this magnitude here sometimes the adrenaline can be flowing you got to calm yourself make sure you allow this game to come to you you know youve got to be able to get some stops you cannot allow Duke to be able to get whatever first half so far Duke has been able to get whatever they want touching the paint you see right now SMU extending their defense to try to slow them down a little Music bit well Carell looks like a guy who hadnt put on a single pound since he walked out of dke he looks like he can give you about 15 minutes and probably get you 10 10 to 12 points heres flag little fade away and nothing but net he has four as you that last time showing a little bit of a Zone best way to beat his zone is have a guy right there in the middle Duke had flag hovering right there in the middle for that midrange shot Edwards to the bucket and thats go tending it went in anyway so BJ Edwards who averages 10 a game gets his first basket so 157 Tyrese Proctor the native of Sydney Australia from downtown Music we talked about this team and the fact that hes a guy at at 66 that can get to the basket and oh yeah by the way he shoots it about 40 from behind the arc du du has done a great job in this first half of being able to space out SMU Proctor has come out and it has been lightning on fire a perfect three three field goals and perfect from behind the ark Isaiah Evans along with Malik Brown check into the game Brown considered to be the very best defender in the ACC heres flag to the rack and he got fouled thatll be against tayori and if youre tayori you cannot allow Cooper flag to be able to get momentum to get to the bucket we talk about how well he scores that last time you see the Gamble and and treor a little late over there on the Music hill wag just turned 18 years old three weeks ago so very young coming out of high school youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State youre in good hands flag hit them both four of four from the stri he at six in the game Duke has already extended their lead to 10 for SMU you got to be able to get into your sets working get to your second and third option as you know duas theyre long theyre lengthy theyre going to chase you off the three but you got to move that ball to continue to shift them and touch to paint wouldnt be surprised if we see Kio Endo in here sometime soon hes instant offense off that bench and right now SMU needs offense cross just got into the air and nobody throw it to Applause blocker again he getu with the rebound and here come the Mustangs boy this defense is so good and theyre so big long and athletic heres Miller and he needed out his team needed out and thats the guy they need to get going because hes ahead of the snake of that offense he talked about the fact not so easy to touch the paint that last time Hoy Miller saw he had Cooper flag got a little extension and drained that three Miller a couple of years at Central Michigan one season had a great season last year at wake and now in his first year at SMU as their leading score flag and its an illegal screen you saw James P the pin down call for that moving on that screen tayori trying to be physical with flag because again you dont want to allow him to get to the ball where he wants it watch the pin down by James tayori trying to fight through it and again if youre SMU you have to force Duke out of their sets this is a ball Club thats going to get their sets theyre going to make sure they do a lot of pin down action touch the paint hopefully now they can get on a little bit of run that last time you saw boy Miller knock down a shot you got to continue to move that ball and try to touch that paint easier said than done well as we suspected we do indeed see Kio okendo he wears number eight I mean this guy can fill it up theres a big man with a stick back and thats huge that last time you saw yig Tulu realized he had a smaller Gillis there was able to hit the glass for that putback SMU five offensive rebounds thats a strength for both of these teams very dominant rebounding teams Off the Mark by Evans whos been so red hot from three and now theyre going to go down low I like this match up for SMU here this guy is good around the basket has it tripped away got it back and hell go to the line a talented player and thats a matchup that they they can win Tom because yulu is very good and solid down low you got a smaller Brown guarding him they need to give him touches and put pressure on that Duke defense Malik Brown whistled for the foul we talked about what a great defender he is but hes giving away some height there to yulo Applause 72 oh next weeks CW Courtside Saturday rolls on to double dip once more Syracuse going to BC and and Brian you and I will be down in Miami Wake Forest starting to play really well CW Courtside Saturday 300 pm Eastern noon Pacific only on the CW you got a Full Slate this week NBA and college missed them both boy they give you a chance you cant do that fivepoint game 13 minutes closing in to play here in the first half Applause Music bumped and going to the line will be Isaiah Evans a freshman out of fville North Carolina he is coming on strong carel told us yesterday ever since that game he came in against Auburn when he hit six threepointers in the first half he is the second best threepoint shooter in the country hey you got to pick Isaiah Evans up when he gets off the bus this a guy that basically shoots 52 from the Hane Arc 19 for 32 in his last six games and naturally thises a freeo Applause right and The Scouting Report tells you that 93 of his points are coming from behind the arc so I think that guy prefers the shooting from the threepoint line lke is not scored in 2 minutes and 21 ticks 181 12 Duke in Applause Music Applause front cross lays it in and hell go to the free throw line and Tom thats what we talked about with Matt cross hes going to be able to be physical youve got to look at and see what matchups you can win that last time hes got some pounds on Evans at last time he rips put the ball down and its a race between him and malawat to get to the cup absorbs that contact gives him opportunity to go to the to the line to get a three the oldfashioned way and theyre right back in this game now and its been the level of aggression theyve gotten some stops and then now theyve been able to get some things and some matchups to work in their favor Applause that is a fifth Miss from the free throw line in this game by SMU and heres the thing if you want to knock off a top five team you cannot give points away and normally SMU a very good free throw shooting team 75 on the year the extra pass into the corner and no good still only one point of free throw in the last three minutes for the dookies Miller behind the back and got it and thats where I knew was going to throw you get the stop you see Bley Miller pushing the pace was able to get a little redirection and knock down that shot now you got this crowd involved in the game to nipple too strong and now SMU with a chance to tie or even take the lead oh they thought about going up top to culbert there and in the corner thats quendo cross a rebound and hes fouled this cross is a gamer man he is and weve got a game on our hand you see berer Miller right there with a little bit of a crossover and say you know what take that for you were filling it SMU within two tennis player as well again SMU has been able to get back in this game theyve mixed up their defense a little bit and been more aggressive being able to touch the pain yet you see that that turnover by booby Miller great anticipation there by flag and Harris bumps flag 14 foul against the Mustangs see Duke has not made a field goal in over four minutes started out red high and Tom what youve seen is that SMU has mixed up their coverages from man to Zone theyre flaring out being a little bit more physical a little bit more help that last time you see Cooper flag thats one of the things we talked about him in the open a threelevel type of score gets a lot of attention by being athletic but thats a nice pull up for a just with a controllable jumper eight of duks 20 belong to flag Mason Gillis number 18 is checked in for the Blue Devils he spent the last four years at Purdue boy he played in some big games there was he Big 10 Sixth Man of the Year poopy AE fake lost a handle dumps it off in the corner and batted Away by Applause flag in and out Duke Paul crowd didnt like it watch the skills set in this last play by Cooper flag comes off that and you Defender pops he gets him a nice little pump fake two dribble Rises up and great control again you talk about a lot of things that goes with it but hes an allaround player love his skill set and he allows the game to come to him where are you going to see him force the issue and get out of the team concept off the screen flag may have been bumped no call and proor with a rebound heres James and theres flag wide open man is a strug and the thing is that James set that up obviously the offensive rebound gives you another possession James does a good job of being able to force the defense converge flag is going to hunt that shot knocks down that second one two4 dollar that is 11 now for coer flag he averages 17 but hes had his best games in the big game Applause heres Endo got to put it up and he does and lays it in and nice nice move by quindo look at that last time boy Miller got down I thought he had a layup but you got to your third option put the ball on the floor and then not having malok on the floor gives you an opportunity to get to the cup flag head fake and rejected that was jel Colbert transferred from Kansas State and after that block hell go to the bench Cobra did a good job of being able to stay right in the jersey of Cooper flag watching being able to stay there doesnt bite on the first pump fake flag comes up goes vertical times it perfectly Applause 20 on the shot Applause clock Duke with the basketball closing in on 9 minutes to go beautiful cut to the basket flag follows slamming it down and penetration by James Cooper flag you got to put a body on him because anything around the rim hes youre most likely going to be part of a Applause poster you were never posterized were you no but I I created some got some down hanging in there yes you do oh and one The Bump by Proctor and that will send Keon Ambrose Hilton whos just checked into the game to the line again watch this last play you see the back door cut and no one puts a body on Cooper flag he comes in he say yulu you know what Ill sign this for you afterwards but watch the yulu basically is there and it finish it but then again on the other end smus done a good job of being able to break down you see the back down cut and Ambrose Hut Hilton able to go for the line you to make this a threepoint play thats on Cooper flag the foul his first of the game very quiet from the line really struggling are the Mustangs from the stripe two of seven and still struggling Music flag pulls up and that was knocked out of bounds by the Mustang they missed Opportunity by Duke there you get a Cooper flag wide open jump shot if youre SMU you cant allow him to be able to roll free like that that little stagger action has got to be better communication between the bigs flag is averaging over 31 minutes a game Duke right now where theyre playing nine guys well see if that changes as the year goes on be hard to believe it would and a follow underneath malat will go to the free throw line thats where the length of the malow watch is basically around the rim you see a lot of times penetration especially at Last Time by Proctor hes right there for the tip end mother watch pretty good free throw shooter 24 of 30 hes got a nice touch on the ball nice release for a big guy just watching him shoot before the game and too strong there Caleb Foster comes into the game this Tuesday celebrating new years evil with NXT catch the first NXT of the Year from La Tuesday January 7th at Eastern 7 Central here on the CW did you just hit malawat with the announcer chins I did I did and I got him twice Ill never do it again Im sorry coach Applause shy cross back in for The Bu STS and heres okendo pitching it to Miller pretty nifty move there but a little Applause short Foster yes sir Caleb Foster and good and good ball movement good crosscourt pass by James to get Foster wide open thats what again the Duke Blue Devils do a good job of being able to get in transition and take advantage of breaking you down and see when they can forer a guy still finding his way he was a starter once a team got going last year and then he had the terrible injury against Wake Forest he started the year in the lineup and now coming off the bench Cooper flag flying high in this one an eight Point Duke lead Music youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by Hidden Valley Ranch only serious about Flavor scho team is Darren Harris who you see there next to him on that graphic its not a bad class he when you look at man number number one recru class three five stars four three four stars the amount of talent that John Shire has been able to recruit and bring it in his program he is definitely putting Duke in a position every year where theyre able to compete and contend for a national championship yeah theyve had two number one recruiting classes and a number two recruiting class but look Andy Enfield will tell you hey right now we have the sixth best recruiting class coming into SMU next year and they have a pile of would be prospects coming into the game thats double dribble yeah a little hesitation by eulu when that last time Id like to see him just go you know you make the contact and then go hes a guy that can score around the bucket put a lot of pressure on malow because you know hes going to try to block everything that you throw up there 71 to go here in the opening half and Duke an eightpoint lead flag goes right by yulu and miss the layup weve seen SMU be able to have some success when they can continue to move the ball around and touch the paint Duke does a good job of being able to limit you and keep you outside that threepoint line interested to see if they can try to get some type of misdirection and then hit the Applause paint Ry Miller and the alop and tried to do it with one hand and then losing the handle and Duke with the basketball one of those situation yulu Id love to see him catch that ball with two hands B of control and at the other end a beautiful pass by Proctor leads to the lay in first bucket by malat and now a 10point lead again SMU had gotten to within two and now its back up to 10 just cant finish that was a good look theyve got five on four numbers here somebodys open and they waited too long to get off a good shot F away how about that from tayori and good face up by tror was able to get a little bit of Separation realized that malow watch was just coming back and I love that face up and knocking down that little shot tayori had 20 points on seven of 10 field goals and 11 rebounds against Longwood their most recent game by far his best game this Applause year Evans spots up and missed it rare misses for Evans from out there good job by cross chasing him up that threepoint Applause line a little talking going on there now look like Tyrese Proctor and Chuck Harris exchanging work and a little chippiness right we talked about this is a highprofile game for both teams coming to this game seven in a row by each team both teams undefeated in ACC Evans will leave killis comes back in and now brown will replace malat tomag to the bench for the first every time malow watch comes out you see that SMU is able to get more things at The Rim because Brown is a good Defender but hes not the shot rim protector that malow watches Malle Brown getting his second foul and on Q Mowat comes right back into the game they got to get brown to the bench with two fouls Applause stay tuned for todays halftime show presented by Subaru love its what makes Subaru Subaru over into to you here see Cobra knock down those free throws if youre SMU you knocked down a few more free throws were talking about this game is a lot closer than what it is now is three out of nine from the Applause strike beautiful Strong finish by Caleb Foster he has five Off the Bench and great hesitation coming off that pick and roll to to freeze the defender athletic and being able to finish beyond that Applause contact punch fler gun round and he realizes a lot of times when you go against shot blockers he gets right into the body of Cobra to be able to absorb the contact with acob acrobatic finish Foster again we talked about him again that the guy is finding his rhythm has been coming on better as of late ly Miller leading score for the Mustangs and he gets a gentle roll hes a excellent free throw shooter 83 he has six points in the game he started off red hot then slowed down had a couple of rough games but now the last two games is bounced back nicely course I dont know if you and Anderson and Dennis Scott ever had off nights uh we had a few like I said I was the beneficiary of a great point guard and then also having a guy that can shoot the lights out of it you see SMU turning up the tempo and aggressiveness on the defense bar good move to the basket miss the layup all right trying to get a little little closer TCU were closing in on 4 20 to go in a half Colbert little fade away thats an NBA move there n it was great penetration by trayor realizing he was able to get the ball into malat Fade Away SMU on a little bit of a run people here in Moody Coliseum letting their team hear it yeah first time weve heard much from this crowd so far today and a threepointer a big one by Gillis man good good penetration by James realize hes got Gillis wide open Gillis was able to set his feet and knock it down and quiet this crowd Miller for three nope and Duke with a rebound and quickly the other way comes Proctor Applause Duke maintaining this lead with flag on the bench although hes getting set to check back in and theres another nice move there by Gillis in a Timeout Gillis a big 10 freshman of the year at Purdue and they had some good teams to Purdue and they do and so no Cooper flag no problem Gillis says you know what look curl action to get here and extend this KNE up to nine Music Applause Financial Security for nearly 160 years and earlier on in the game it started out with Tyrese proor getting Duke out the gate eight points three for six but then boopy Miller was able to get into the show already seven points today averaging around 15 points but weve talked about Cooper flag Highlight Reel making his point coming out with 13 points a fish with five rebounds and youve seen Tom both teams going back and forth it seems like Duke is able to try to fight and then extend this lead SMU still finds a way to be able to keep it close all right so 316 to go until halftime and well see SM SMU has one more run in them to try and get it a little closer before the intermission full court pressure by the Blue Devils and theyll just drop back I think its really tough on television to try to see how big this Duke team is I mentioned earlier theyre at average height is 67 and theyre just so long in in guarding and guys can guard multiple players and what you do is that for teams like SMU you keep them delegated outside because they cant really break the paint because they do such a good with their length and they keep you outside where smus had some success is Shifting them and being able to get to the paint and then finish at The Rim weve seen two of those where a player yigu and now cber tried to catch it onehanded but heres the thing though is that when you get that lob even as a big you know youre going to have contact you got to go and secure that ball with both hands youve seen both chance you seen cobt that last time yulu trying to be fancy with it you go get that thing with the bounce that you have and you flush it and be able to capitalize thats four points that you basically have left on the table over believe in favor of yolu Applause each team riding the wave of seven game winning streaks now Dukes schedule has been much tougher theres no debate about that there are very few teams that can say they have the schedule to Duke cast so far this year in the corner and its not there and the rebound to yigu and the Mustangs with two to go down by nine Harris for three okendo the rebound and a fresh shot clock what a pass yigu able to finish and good Gather By yigu that penetration that last time about Miller was able to get the ball over to him and easier said than done the times that theyve been able to break the paint smus been able to come with some good things 3730 130 to go flag the aloop and a beautiful pass catch and lay in and one of the things we dont talk enough about is the playmaking skills of Cooper flag good pass over to malawa should be able to get the right at The Rim U backing in head fak spin move cant finish tried the left hand got it back again and a stick back and good second effort by igulu was able to throw the ball up there had malawat out of position get that offensive glass and be able to finish it under a minute to go flag pitches it in the corner hell get it back and hell draw a contact going to the basket and head to the free throw line how many times have we seen Cooper flag be able to get to the basket he understands that the Defenders are coming but he goes Reckless abandon does not shy away from contact you we showed you a moment ago flag finished up high school down in Florida but he is a kid from Maine Newport Maine and according to everybody who spends time around him hes unbelievably humble uh just doesnt get a big head really good teammate youre looking for a Cable News Network that respects all Americans and you have a new home of news Nation Americas most trusted cable network to find newsnation on your screen go to no newsnation nowcom Tom I think one of the things to go about flag that You heard especially NBA Scouts is that this guys got a tremendous motor hes always is in the gym he plays hard hes a good teammate and youve seen even in todays game he he allows the game to come to him he does not try to take it all by himself and as duke has been able to extend their lead to nine he has been B basically solid and given what they needed flag with 15 points in the game to go along with five rebounds Applause thats a tough shot for Miller and again theres that length I mean hes defended by a guy thats 5 in taller than he is and heres the thing is youve got athletic guys that are longer that can get he cant get by and its forced him have to shoot a difficult Music shot clock down to 10 final possession of the half Applause Miller working on James fires to cross for three knock there tipped up and we have reached half time the number four Duke Blue Devils have coming to play man you were some kind of player I wouldnt have been I mean you were some kind of player that was a fun team to watch Lethal Weapon three was a nickname for those Georgia Tech teams heres cross will jump hook and thats a nice shot and a good way to get it started and Tom I think smus got to get more out of M cross we saw earlier in in the first half where hes able to basically exploit some of those mismatches you see him getting down over can nipple and get the shot that he want in the paint there is kiple he had seven assists in the first half thats a strong move nice move and again kiple you you wouldnt know unless you see 67 was able to navigate the paint little pump fake action to finish right there at the cup largest deficit at halftime this year for the St is six and right now down nine a minute into the second half watch this move by kiple he gets down there realizes jiga Tulu is there punk fakes and then is able to go ahead and use his body and throws that shot up in there love his game because hes a guy that can get it done inside and out as well canibble I mean you dont even have to read where hes from and you can figure out hes a Wisconsin guy oh yeah hes a tough guy tough no doubt about hard know talks loves talking a lot up beat tough shot there and Duke the Applause rebound oh my goodness are you kidding me and it he flexed on him a little bit B and and thats again when you look at his height and how he handles handles like a guard it was able to finish with the other hand around the rim thats just too good 17 now for Cooper flag he averages 17 yigu in traffic had it blocked and Duke comes away with a loose ball and 11point Applause Lead again we talk about Koopa flag and his ability to score watch the little crossover he gets the big man comes through there and is able to absorb that contact and finish with the left and he flexed on him a little bit was like yeah Ive been in the weight room before I got here Tom Im going let you know renman everybody looks like theyre in the Wai room standing next to me are you kidding me heres canle again goes up and draws a foul or is it offensive he shuffled the feet a little bit all right that last time again yulu he will force at 7 foot hell Force you have to gather yourself that last time kiple was able to get there shuffled it did a little Texas twep e well again we understand were having some uh technical difficulties here at SMU and we beg your pardon it is 17 05 to go in the game and a 13point Duke lead Endo pitches it in the corner and a shot is blocked and then they dump it off to Colbert whos foul by malawat and Colbert will go to the free throw line to shoot two yeah malawat man he he takes up some real estate down there hes Edward set last time able to keep his wits about him gets it over cobbert SMU smus got to find some way to cut back into this lead in and out for Colbert he made his only two free throws in the game before that one and thats been a semi story for SMU theyre leaving a lot of points on the table we talk about how they have not been able to capitalize they giving the fouls but you got to be able to knock down those free throws 15 second one goes down and a 12point Duke lead James left hand thats a strong move by a strong man man hes built like a linebacker hes able to basically get downhill I dont even know if the contact even bothered him as he was able to just finish now Duke could have used him in their bowl game the other night against Old Applause Miss over it again working on middle of the lane with the right hand too strong and the flag the other way hounded by Edwards spins out of trouble and hes going to go to the rack dribbled it off his Applause foot and heres flag for three wow what a game hes having and he felt like he was fouled thats a guy again that b you see SMU calls a timeout to expanding that League to 17 and weve talked about in this second half its been a lot of Cooper flag 24 points for flag and again you see Cooper flag knocked down to threepoint play it was like ref I know you saw it but we extended up to Music 17 well John shy the heavyweight fight Texas against the mighty Buckeyes from Ohio State Dare I ask who youre well I cant say that too loudly here in Texas will fade away by cross and you get tulo will go to the line and therell be another timeout thats the under 16 timeout so the big fellow from Turkey going to the line when we come Music back started the second half the way they did the first half scoring six of their first seven possessions see Derek Lively in the house duum playing currently with the Dallas Mavericks yatu going to the free throw line 0 for two in the game now one of three he has nine in the game Tom for MSU uh MSM excuse me SMU they need to find a way to be able to get some stops youve seen as of late its been a lot of Cooper flag and then theyve got to find a way as you see yulu missed that one you got to get back into this game because youre in a dangerous position right now where Duke if they continue to get going they can expand this thing out and blew it up and Miller is called for a foul there was pushing off with his left hand as he tried to take the ball away from Proctor he didnt like the call yeah a lot of scrap by Boy Miller right there got his hand on the ball grabbed a little wrist watch again getting up on Proctor and right about there got a little hand on it but right there got that hand on the right wrist but youre got to find some way if your SMU to be able to get some some stops in the corner bang and recognition by Brown realizing he was swarm you get it out to con nipple wide open and be able to knock down that three thats the one thing about this Duke team they feel like you know as well as they played 11 and two tough schedule as Miller kisses it off the glass that one area where they believe they will get better is their threepoint shooting well and and again youve seen where a lot of guys like kiple he shoots it well but he still is not the guy that theyre expecting he knows that a matter of time hes going to do you got to got in Proctor you see another turnover opportunity for Miller to be able to finish and this is what SMU needs you got to be able to get some easy buckets and then Whittle this lead down 15point lead 1430 to go in Dallas sell out crowd and not much to cheer about so far its been the Cooper flag show and hes looking for more and that its blocked him then he dribbled off his foot good defense by yulu that last time being able to stay in front of flag and again one of the ways you going to get back in this game is be able to come up with some Steals and how about boy Miller coming in with pick poet Ain able to get an easy one on the other Applause end couple of substitutions on their way in for the Blue Devils Gillis to come back along with Caleb Foster and a three here you go and great opportunity a quendo sawed Cooper flag has slipped leaving Matt cross wide open you get it back over now you get this thing cut down to 12 you SM you need a stop 11 now for Matt cross a senior out of Beverly Massachusetts lead is 12 James right back into the corner and no good but a long rebound to flag and heres James hes not going to take that shot but hell make a nice pass to Brown and heres where you have to know the Scouting Report you run right out at James and even though he cant shoot he prefers to put the ball on the floor you got to have some defensive discipline that last time he gets it over to brown right at the easy bucket score nearly a take away by Duke Brown who leads the country in deflection so far this year deflected that ball and flag with a rebound for the Devils under 13 in the corner and no good well coach Young at Virginia Tech made the comment after the Duke win over the hokes 8865 earlier in the week he said this is the best Duke defensive team that he has seen in the last seven years because they wall up the paint did you see that last play Mal Brown come over theres a little bit of a mixup there mat cross had the the position there where he was able to get the ball but back to Duke one of the things that makes them so good is that they will lock down the paint and with their length they make it hard for you to be able to break the paint Duke starting the way it started in the opening Applause half important possession for SMU right here still like the fact that you give Matt cross a touch he shown hes be able to create some things we get into the Applause bucket little fade away after cing to dribble up in the lane by Harris who Duke the rebound thats where the length of malawat is a problem you saw Harris get down there and he tried to alter that shot not a clean look K nippo once more for three and Bingo and you saw Au quendo try to pass under the screen again on kiple you have to Trail him you can not allow him especially the guy thats got a nice little rhythm shooting the three nine threepointers in the game for the Blue Devils 27 of their 62 from downtown K canle says hey if you pass down Im going to make you pay Duke extending that lead up 16 17 behind Khan kiple Music Music Applause Applause Hilton for the state and all you need to know about Cooper flag is this guy does a little bit of everything a little bit of the handle a little bit of the hustle and then if anything he tries to do be a playmaker when all else fails he says you know what give it to me Ill give you a bucket and he basically says hey Im trying to do my best but hey I got to give you this work and you look at today basically seventh game with 20 points the season 24 points efficient 7 for 12 perfect from the arc behind the arc and oh yeah grabbed about nine rebounds while he was at it he is one rebound away from his fifth double double of the season and His Four fourth 20 point double double his season high points in a game came in the loss to Kentucky 26 by the way Kentucky a wild one today over the Florida Gators 106 to 100 thats an NBA score loopy Miller pretty slick move right there and nice run it was able to turn the corner at last time getting the best of the defend and getting downhill need a little bit more of that 15point gain and canle again for three and off the iron and the rebound to the Mustangs with work to Music do whats a good jab move there yeah two in a row by Boy Miller I love the fact that he realized he get a little bit of Separation do him you doing a good job getting some stop to see if that can ignite a run for him Miller now with 15 only flag is scored more than Miller in this Applause game oh boy SMU did not like that call yeah that was unfortunate you saw James probe a little bit igula was there watch jam on his penetration on the back hand yeah you saw otula with his arm caught in the cookie jar third he has nine points and 10 rebounds and James to the free throw line nothing but net seon James out of Sugar Hill Georgia you know who that is Sugar Hill youre a Georgia guy yeah I hang around Atlanta I cant even lie to you tell you I know where Sugar Hill is Im going to guess that maybe its north okay hes a transfer from to Lane moved into the starting lineup against Auburn and then went for a double double against Virginia Tech in their win three nights ago hit them both hell go to the bench our producer Scott Snider tried to get me to say its somewhere near what was that again Sweet low Village sweet Sugar Hill near Sweet and Low Village okay I told he was going to get me killed by my 15y old she heard me announced that one shes playing today right she is O quendo dumps it off shot clock at Applause seven cross is trying to force something and the shot clock will run out oh wow what a bill out oh he no mo ran out and then a foul well yeah cobbert was able to get that ball with4 seconds left to go just throws it up and then malow watch was there watch the defensive possession by Duke that last time Matt cross trying to get one up and then cobber comes over and then malawat right there you just got to stay straight up gave cobbert an opportunity to go to the line for two talk about a bill out cobbert is three of four from the line Applause I think that if if youre Andy inber edfield and you go back and look at this game and Miss opportunities one of the things that youre basically going to be upset is the free throw and the ones that you left the points that you left on the table eight of 17 from the free throw Applause Music line and heres the thing is that you know you got a little bit more than 10 minutes SMU is still very very much in this game paac has picked up a little bit more in their favor theyve been able to get some stops but you got to be able to get some easy stops and limit the easy buck as you see Foster get right down the lane for an easy one well theyd really like to see him get going after missing all that time last year with the ankle injury was in the starting lineup early this year and was not playing as well as they had hoped as he would hope and so they made the lineup change and put in James for for foster heres flag back in the game Proctor man oh man thats tough break the paint by Cooper flag and get it over to the Proctor and again hes had a good afternoon as well shooting the ball 10 threepointers in this game for the fourth ranked D Blue Devils and the lead the largest of the night 19 no John Shire here no problem for Chris Carwell and Company Cooper flag on name when we talk about what he does for this team he leads this team in assist and and watch him be able to get in break the paint Force to help pass it over for a better shot and you see Proctor is able to knock it down thats one of the things about this Duke team is they play very unselfish basketball you see Chris Carell over there animated trying to encourage the D doev excuse me D are D Devils yes to be able to finish well let had rivalry coming out in you the yellow jacket its Music robbery Carell was a grad assistant under coach aevi and wound up going with Steve wowski to Marquette spent six years there as an assistant G lucasi associate head coach a son of John of course John has done so much for those in uh needing to recover from addiction for a long long time and he was one of them man what a player he was at Maryland for Lefty Delle theres a turnover for SMU flag to Gillis oh my what a finish flag over to Gillis 21point lead o quendo short on the three and another rebound for the Blue Devils Applause for under nine minutes to play here in Dallas little fancy there by Proctor looking for the alyu and SMU coming the other way you see Duke get out in transition Cooper flag normally hes on the front end of it and how about Gillis comes up with the finish at the rim and again when theyre out and about then all you can do is pray and try to get back Gillis goes to the upper room to be able to finish that one he say you know what dont jump business decision Gillis was a threeyear starter at Purdue until last year he played in 132 games for the boiler makers and of course they played in a lot of big games with the big fella Zack e you see Gillis in that last finish for Duke they have been able to extend this lead up to 20 theyre shooting 73 from the field in this second half we talked about Zach Edy hes having a a pretty good run with the Memphis Grizzlies hes been um better than a lot of Scouts today have projected him to be I I got to tell you I mean I was stunned by that I dont know if you were Brian I mean you played in the Applause NBA and and I was just stunned at how many people thought this guy couldnt come into the league and be one of those guys whether he started or whether he turned into a star was a totally different game but playing a league forever Tom I I thought the same because again when you look at a guy at his height and with his skill set and how fundamentally sound he was but todays NBA a lot of it is you know the analytics you know and its a four out you know you dont have a lot of guys that are posting up and I think that there were some question about athletic athleticism but hes shown that he has hit the NBA by storm he was such a phenomenal twotime National Player of the Year way out there and no good by endo and the Blue Devils with the ball eight minutes to go Applause Applause flag having a few words over there thought he was tripped let me help you out here Tom you know how you shoot 73 from behind free field go is by shots like that finishing at the Music room save when you bu to Auto home and motorcycle insurance visit progressivecom and all afternoon its been the Cooper flag show talk about him coming into the open how aggressive he is at The Rim he has been had an off afternoon of being able to score inside outside 24 points 7 for 12 perfect from behind the line and Oh yeah double double finishing up with 10 rebounds and Tom he has been amazing to watch talking about phenomenal as he been able to lead this Duke D Blue Devil Team all afternoon long you know he had a few words here he got tangled up a moment ago with Chuck Harris and the two had to be restrained from one another I didnt I didnt think Harris was doing anything to try and trip flag heres kiple and no good 7151 743 to go Applause SMU without a field goal the last three and 1 half minutes and theres some of that length we were talking about you know you got Miller 6 feet being guarded by the 69 flag and his season High we talked about him delivering the goods in the big games these are his four games where he went double double 20 point double doubles his season high in points came in the loss against Kentucky 26 hes two away from that now I think what weve seen is the level of efficiency that hes played with you see igulu with the putback couldnt get it but when you watch a guy thats thats a its a phenomenon as a star that he is love the fact that hes hes gritty hes grimy hes going to hit the floor hes going to do the dirty work as well balanced and now like I said when you look at this Duke team at fourth in the country they have shown you that with their defense they can be a team that can make a run later on in March I mean only what three teams all year long have hit the 70 point mark against Duke and thats Auburn Kansas and Kentucky three pretty good teams and those are teams that you say that in March could possibly be final four teams and I think John shy would say that earlier in the season losses to Kansas and then even Kentucky they werent the defensively sound team that they are right now because when you watch them they do a heck of a job of being able to lock down the paint and we talked about that athle is and the length that they have yigu hits one of two that a nice game 10 points 12 rebounds first time hes been in a big time match up against the top 10 team freshman from turkey and theres the penetration by kipo he realizes he drags two off players and for malawat you just thr it anywhere near the cylinder hes going to be able to catch it and finish it k oh window in your face he talking about he said hey happy New Year whoa got to see that one again my Applause goodness Taya Foster beautiful move to the basket lays it in and gets dropped to the deck hell go to the line hes had a good game watch this last play by kppa pulls eulu and he realized the big man just thr up in the the center but then for SMU aqu quendo was like coming live down your down memory lane for you happy New Year oh my God good finish love that one boster came in only averaging seven points per game he has nine and now trying to make it 10 and compete the threepoint play which he does not 7 54 6 and A2 to go ouu goes to the bench or no he has four hes staying in the game and theyre just firing now and Andy Enfield saying get back Fs coming into the game this afternoon and giving Duke some really valuable minutes in his ability not only to run the show but take advantage of hitting the paint and then finishing at The Rim CER a top three player coming out of the state of California and wound up working himself into the lineup last year but then had the devastating ankle injury missed the rest of the season was back in the line up to start this year but then seven games ago was replaced by James little forearm shiver there on flag and kiple trying to go with the left hand and lays it in hell go to the line and and thats another guy that weve talked about again can nipple in the afternoon that hes having gritty players knocking down to three watch should be able to understand hes got Edwards there hes going to get in there and then be strong finishing with the off hand and plag comes over to celebrate canle again is one of those guys doesnt get the attention of a Cooper flag but definitely one of that part of that number one recruiting class hes had a great afternoon well he averages 12 a game he averages four rebounds a game his assist to turnover ratio is almost 4 to one apparently the clock never stopped and and that might be okay actually for uh coach Enfield right now down 23 reset the clock 541 canle the threepoint play and kiple gives you a guy that can run the point he put him a lot of ball screens you see you can give him the ball too he can put it on the deck and go get you a bucket too canibble as 14 for the Blue Devils I got Applause Endo hes just been off here today with that threepoint shot because normally hes a pretty good shooter from out there and what it is is that Duke is basically running those guys off the line and theyre not allow him to have easy contested shots theyre locking down the pain in there high close outs on the three this is such an extraordinarily talented yes very young but talented Duke team flag and I mean they are without a doubt by far and way the elite team in the Atlanta Coast Conference a lot of years you dont say that all the time theyre one of the top two or three absolutely because you know you look at their offensive and defensive efficiency again one of the things we talked about with not having John shy is that defense taking over my question too you look at just under five minutes if youre Chris Carwell how long do you keep Cooper flag in the game understanding that youre up by 23 W Forest will be ranked sometime soon tried the AL not there and flag leads a charge the other way well that looked clean it was that was clean good defense by bopy Miller being able to get his hand on the ball Tyrese proct Proctor tried to get to the bucket watch this play again see proor gets a little bit of momentum there bopy Miller gets his hand in there ties that ball up got a little forearm action too but Tai ends up being Dukes ball Millers a nice player top playmaker in the ACC so far this year they try to dump it down low look at that wingspan thats 7 5 in on that wingspan and his reachup ability is 98 he can almost dunk flat footed Proctor a three and Proctors had another guy that got Duke going in the first half and his Duke team and theyre loaded because theyve got a lot of different weapons that can give you buckets nice kick out back to mopy Applause Miller Millers competed out here with these guys today and heres the thing is when you look at less than four minutes left to go I mean obviously it looks like Duke is going to go in and go to 4 and0 in the ACC but this SMU team they have shown flashes of being able to hang in there theyre still going to be a formidable team in this ACC as you see another law by can nipple to Mala watch at The Rim come on bat with eight and we are under three and a half to go heres cross short and batted back out of there by gorer looping for three this SMU team is going to compete to the end Applause these two teams will not play again this year if youre wondering 8360 Blue Devils black still sitting on 24 too shy of his career high but hes getting his buddies in on the action now Music he Applause hey off Chris Carwell filling in for Coach John shy not being able to make the trip but then was no problem because the Duke blew Devils it was hot behind the arc knocking down to three 11 for 20 24 from behind the arc and they basically doing the thing and then the guy that basically got it done for them all afternoon Cooper flag 24 points 11 rebounds and again Tom this Duke team is better than what we thought they were on display cant play came in and had commanded this game from beginning to end you know the other thing they do and we talked about it earlier is they they get everybody involved and theyll give it up if a teammate has a better shot they had 20 assists in a game three days ago against Georgia Tech they have 21 assists today and how many times do you watch good teams and you see that they play well and they pass off and and they play for one another this is a team that plays the right way their defense theyve got guys that can score and again you pass up good shot for better shots yeah their last three games theyve gone for 209 and 21 assist 250 away from their eighth straight win and this will end a seven game winning streak for SMU first time weve seen Darren Harris another highly decorated freshman was a Virginia high school player of the year when he led St Paul Catholic to the state championship Applause forer another foreign player for SMU he is from turkey and its out of bounds with 227 left to go Music cross a rebound on the James Miss three Miller has had a nice game today 21 points tries to throw the aloop to Ambrose Hilton and a foul Applause underneath pass some you had a tough afternoon and then after this they play a North Carolina team thats been up and down down as well well its a hard team to figure man North Carolina I mean we had their game a couple weeks ago and you know just for comparing Im not comparing Duke in North Carolina we know the Rivalry just sit in observation right we go to the practice the other day and there you see it will be the Tar Heels next for the Mustangs and then they come back home then a couple of tough road games Virginia had Miami and then back here against the Louisville team Pat Kels done a nice job with that Cardinals team and they have talking about North Carolina you know Louisville gets a win against them and Ive always found it hard is that when Ive got to go on the road to play against a team thats not meeting expectations you see Up and Under finish by by James its hard because for this SMU team to have to go and play Carolina when Carolina understands that thats one that theyre going to need its going to be a tough game for them especially on the road in Chapa Hill theres corer nice touch no but just you know sitting there watching Duke War off warm up as you look at this from James see young Jame come there a little contact there being able to finish acrobatic and again we talk about the weapons that Duke has seon James again is a guy that plays within himself and he can do a lot of different things hes a guy thats going to stuff the stat sheet for you we have the double double against Virginia Tech 10 points and 11 rebounds but when you watch Duke just warm up it seems like 70 of the threepointers are going in we saw North Carolina in practice and then in their pregame warmup uh in their game against St Josephs couple weeks ago and and I bet you 25 of the threepointers just in warmups didnt go in and theyve had a hard time shooting the basketball this year they have and one of the things that I know that you need in order to win in this league and probably any other league you got to have great point guard play and you got to be able to knock down shots and you see the penetration of tayori not being able to finish Applause Applause it pretty nice move right there but it doesnt go down for gunba and then the tap end is good as some of the backups on this Duke team are getting in the action Ambrose Hilton is off the mark on his three and were down to the final 35 seconds Brian I want to thank you here today buddy uh you have done Yans work you didnt come here showing up today to U have a play byplay Li that only do half his job today so I apologize and I thank you and good Lord willing little bit different ball game next weekend thats okay Ill get it back from you next weekend when were in Miami all right thats a deal thats right well I look forward to it and uh really enjoyed being with you our director of course is Lonnie Dale and our producer Scott Snider we thank our entire crew as were under 10 seconds left to go Chris Carell filling in for John shy and Im sure the first phone call that Carell will get after this game will be from coach back and dur and you not talked about that in the open about how much would change and it seemed like they were able to stick to the game plan and when youve got a defensive team one of the things you hang your hat out of the game is the defense and I thought that thats what Duke did earlier on to get going it did help with they were able to knock down some threes and again the feenom that is coper flag it wasnt just him it was a lot of them knocking down the threes 11 for 25 for the afternoon of course Carell no different than everybody else that sits on the bench from all these college basketball teams Brian hed like to be a head coach of his own program one day oh absolutely I mean good for him and thats going to do it the Duke Blue Devils make it eight cons second and wins and still remain unbeaten the seven game win streak comes to an end for SMU
