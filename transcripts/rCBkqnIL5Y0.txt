over Florida State NC State very tough to turnover just 10 per game thats number one in the conference and we are underway as the Wolfpack takes the opening tip and they have already faced a pretty challenging schedule following their stunning March to the final four they faced Purdue Kansas Texas and BYU Cory unfortunately theyve lost every one of those games well and theyre one of the ACC teams that struggled in the not conference one of the many teams that are Str going to accomplish with the ACC and you see on the score immediately youre going to see pressure from the wolf pack right now its manto man pressure now the Virginia starting lineup without right now a couple of key guys up top heres McNeely roie will swing it heres Ames on the wing hes brand new DayDay Ames a 61 sophomore getting it underneath Kofi the big fell will lay up out and the night find the high low action going inside to Kofi who when you think about this NC State team playing without Ben Middlebrooks here in the first half of this one illness we may not see him in this game but definitely out for the first half of this one was struggling early today lets put it this way he did not keep breakfast down see only you can put it so eloquently Styles who got the first basket handing off to Michael oconnell their star in the ACC tournament last year the jumper offt Target by Jaden Taylor NC state does not shoot the three well Virginias had a lot more success theyre at 38 NC State in the low 30s and that allows Virginia to stay in the packline defensively not having to extend as much pressure on the outside when you have a team that doesnt shoot as well nice job by am to keep that put down to get the basket but more importantly for ases to be able to get into the painted area and make a play for himself as he did on that one or also to be able to kick out to one of his teammates who Virginia a very good shooting team when they get those opportunities games at 48 Beyond a 3o line so hes really deadly the pass almost mishandled comes right to Marcus Hill hes their top scorer at 13 a game they really balance out the scoring unlike a year ago and they made that incredible run to the final four shot clock is down to four Hill off the fake gets the jumper in the air and sticks it right at the buzzer of the shot clock the hill doesnt really want to shoot the three is capable of making them but much prefers to get into the pained area a desperation bucket there able to go down the tie it up at four now one difference youre seeing here with Virginia is a little more urgency to score after they break the Press thats absolutely going to be the case and thats one of the things that Ron Sanchez says that theyve really worked on since that Memphis loss is when they do break pressure attacking not settling forcing teams to have to come out of the pressure because they score against it Isaac mcne A Little Fall Away averaging 12 points a game 64 Junior going to be a key man today especially be that threepoint line where he can really shoot it but showing that he can do more than shoot the three going off the bouns and making plays will help mcneel and also free up his teammates theres Hill free to Taylor and Taylor drops it in from threepoint L now if theres one guy that they can depend upon to knock down a three it is Jaye Taylor he had hot during that stretch last year we watched NC State find their way into the final four he was one of their outside threats these noon games you never know how teams are going to come out and shoot the basketball gratefully theyre shooting it well early NC State 3 for four Virginia to this point Wass three for three good look for roie though shooting over 44 from the threepoint Arc himself doesnt get any easy ones like thatle Hatfield into the game starting for Middle Brooks and drops in two sweet shot by the 610 senior and Brandon H Hatfield of course no stranger to playing against Virginia spent the last two seasons at Louisville and a young man that stepping in started the first five games of the season for NC State in the post and now back in the lineup with middle Brooks out B pack having trouble on the glass hes their top rebounder at five a game just five Kofi trying to step to his left goes to the other side of the iron Pon The Freshman is absolutely skilled going to the opposite hand and using the rim as a deterrent so Hunley Hatfield cant get a hand up the second bucket in this at 610 and the guy can pass the ball too the swing into the corner and the jumper wont fall by styles on the Run Saunders yes but you see the pace thats the difference thats what Ron Sanchez is trying to get Virginia to be able to do when you kick ahead you have an opportunity take advantage of it dont pull it back out and try to run offense take advantage when you have opportunity at the ri Virginia eight paint points already to four for the wolf pack heres Hill working on roie to pull up pop and a little bit short rebound tapped to the corner and it will stay on this end 1455 to go here in the first half pretty good Pace early on Virginia up by one Music ACC tournament where of course they won five games in five days before the pack got to March they had lost 14 games but it was against Virginia down five with 70 seconds to go in the ACC tournament semifinals that Michael oconnell hit that bank three to force overtime NC State would win it they would win the tournament in Washington they won five games in five days they went on to be Texas Tech Oakland and overtime time Marquette in the sweet 16 and Duke in the elite eights that magical run finally ending in that final four loss to Purdue and you think about just the run in itself of course you got to think about the characters involved you start with DJ Burns of course everyone loved DJ burns his ability to play out of the middle of the floor pass the basketball extremely well but was Unstoppable on the Block but then DJ horn all the different players and now you have so many new characters for this NC State team year however a number of holdovers from that team who especially Michael okell who made two shots not just the one but two shots last season against Virginia to send the game into overtime yeah thats right they played three times last year two of them went OT Virginia won one of them here 5952 mcney up top here for the Cavaliers NC State by a point early mcney trying to back into that paint little follow hes tried that once already he hit the first one and a whistle Tony chower with a whistle here with 1424 to go in the first half Ted Valentine and Clarence Armstrong the other two officials Dennis Parker Jr with his first personal but thats an area where Virginia can absolutely exploit against NC State Elijah Sanders and Blake Buchanan both with over 23 offensive rebounds on the season they can crash the glass on the offensive end of the floor mcdy holding on to it too long hes tied up on the play possession errow will keep it here for Virgin Applause Virginia and Ron Sanchez the interim head coach named late on October 18th following the great Tony Bennetts retirement hes been a head coach before at Charlotte so nothing new there hes been on Tonys staff for 10 years before taking over on an inim basis and a great person as we see saers with the turnaround jumper using his sides hes really come on as of late scoring in double figures his last three games out averaging over 15 points per game becoming much more of an offensive force for Virginia of course does the job defensively on the glass as well unley Hatfield with a Miss inside last season Virginia going on to the NCAA tournament would you say that that was the most controversial selection theyve ever had I I believe it was one of the most controversial selections of all time when you consider Oklahoma didnt get in and virgin did I believe what added the insulted injury was the performance by Virginia in that first four game it was a struggle for them to be able to score the basketball but I personally felt as though Virginia deserved to be in and again the fact that the ACC got five teams in and it was a struggle to get five in to me was a discredit to the last year however this year has been different for the ACC so you know Im sure well talk more about that later but we will be fortunate to be able to get five teams in this year yeah its a fascinating topic as Buchanan misses the first one and Huntley Hatfield goes to the bench because the ACC has gone so deep in the NCAA tournament going back to 2014 that ones going to find a lot of Rim but roll in for Buchanan and OB you know Ive said forever that this conference prepares his teams for March better than any conference in the country but a lot of that also had to do with the coaches and the styles of play that allowed everyone to get a just a taste of everything so you dont youre not surprised by anything when you get into March well we dont necessarily have all those same coaches anymore and I think thats whats affected the conference throughout this nonconference season and you could feel half a wing of the Hall of Fame with the ACC coaches who have left over the last few years okono with a long one and itll go down a threepointer and thats something that hasnt been the strong suit of the Wolfpack throughout this season but you see every score youre going to find full core pressure Virginia donees a pretty good job thus far handling the pressure NC State had not hit a field goal for 3 minutes weve already had six lead changes in this one so thats the early narrative here in Charlottesville this afternoon Im not sure anyone would have had scoring at 1413 in the first seven minutes of this one I think youre exactly right now coming up Wake Forest in Syracuse at 200 and then Arizona State and BYU to follow at 4 on on ESPN 2 and we start the day here with NC State and Virginia in the oconnell into the corner pass will lift and he cant hit and Murray taking away the rebound that is tane Murray a 65 senior from New Zealand his parents are here today theyre absolutely here theyve came to spend about a month both his parents are Educators so they get the break off but its actually summer break in New Zealand right now OB the weather is a little different over there youre always teaching me something now youre the one that teaches me my guy you know how that goes get another stop for mes got to find a way to New Zealand on the spin Ames will fire it up and leave it short oconnell wants to pressure it here Pass open again from the wing and this one nothing but net and Bon pass shooting 571 from Beyond a threepoint Arc missed one on the previous possession but so much more confidence for him in this season with a much bigger role for the wolf back mcy catches fires got a good look but he missed it Ron pass a 61 senior percentage wise NC States best threepoint man once scored 50 in a high school game in North Carolina and thats not even the highest on his team got a teammate Paul mcneel who scored 71 in the high school game but right now the wolf pack making it look easy against Virginias defense out to a sixpoint lead 1116 remaining as they they continue to share the basketball and we return well talk about the state of the AC we get an opportunity to see 2019 winner Tony Bennett in the suite as his son Eli is a member of this Virginia team buur down the lane cant finish the tip is up and good TJ power the 69 sophomore really barreling in and great to see TJ power getting involved in action and coming up with plays especially hustle plays which will help him get his confidence back coming in with major expectations transferring in from Duke Kofi with a bump foul there on midc court youve made this point for many years and its been right on the money come tournament time NCAA tournament time watch the ACC and they go very deep as we just showed you in the tournament now the coaching changes mean the Styles have changed the Styles have absolutely changed no longer do you see the Zone in Syracuse with Jim ban no longer do you look forward to the style of play the two bigs up front at North Carolina with Roy Williams on the sideline Coach K being on the sideline alone is a style in itself yes it is so when you consider what youre used to seeing as we watch three pass knocked down another three what youre used to seeing in the ACC is no longer and this going to take some time to readjust with the five for 27 5 and 27 against top 25 teams weve never seen that before and part of the reason why we would be fortunate to get four teams into the NCAA tournament so the ACC in past years has done a great job prepping their schools for the big tournament will that continue thats the big question as we move into the early days of the ACC schedule this year the swing here for Parker Jr but he cant find the range and a whistle here and thats going to go the other way Ted Valentine jumping in there at 103 to go here in the first half back to that last possession by NC State when a guy comes in shooting 571 you cant close out short on him D Day Ames does get out get a hand up however the way Bon shooting the basketball You got to run him off the threepoint line his last five games 75 9 of 12 from Beyond The Arc off to a great start here today Brien pass also recruited as a college receiver and I mean Tennessee Texas ANF UNC Virginia Tech they all wanted him to play football yeah he he didnt have just you know just D1 offers he had high level D1 offers but Ron Pas now in his fourth season at NC State a guy that stuck around and waited his turn in the program which you rarely see as is the same case with t Murray a fourthe guy here at University of Virginia now in the in the rotation and getting quality minutes helping his team Off the Bench off a nice fake knocked that down he is four and the early going Virginia needs some of that offense after a hot start theyve cooled off a little bit Trey Parker is a freshman Dennis Parker Jr on a nice drive to lay it in of course Denis Parker Jr wants to have a strong performance here John Marshall High School about an hour from here Richmond Virginias Alma moer of Jason willford associate head coach at the University of Virginia so a lot of friends and family in the building Im sure to see a little DP man there have been some great coaches in all sports nice play Here by Andrew roie to weave his way in and lay that one down talk about coaching Talent just in the building today we showed you Tony Bennett and we got another legend in the building coach Bruce Arenas upstairs checking it out you got a chance to talk with him earlier of course I was fortunate to be here at on grounds when his soccer program won five consecutive national championships Bruce can flat coach he could coach anything I think any sports little follow away shot nicely done here by Trey Parker The Freshman who was only four for 19 from three coming into play today yeah struggling in everyone seemed to have struggled shooting the basketball for NC State on the season only 32 from Beyond threepoint Arc but off to a great start here shooting the basketball must be something about the baskets here five of nine for the wolf pack taken away by Taylor Taylor Bump by Murray who ties him up and the foul now the officials are going to talk about this to see if thats a flager foul or not quick conversation nothing flagrant there t Murray does a good job of not committing the flagrant although he does does tie up the basketball now Clarence Armstrong and Tony Chi getting together for a moment on that M saw Teddy Valentine and Clarence Armstrong both going over and Tay Murray does get the arms wrapped around him early but does a great job getting his hands off and up and I love the officiating by this group to not even bother going over to look at it they have the understanding that its not a flagrant so itll be Taylor at the line 73 his second year at NC State he also spent two years at Butler Debbie Ryan also here today Debbie Ryan hanging out Courtside got a chance to talk with her earlier and she makes sure to give Ron Sanchez some love and of course Debbie Debbie Ryan coached in my opinion the greatest point guard University of Virginia one of the greatest point guards in the history of the game and Dawn Staley but also gave Gino ARA his start Debbie sitting alongside my guy Phil wendle over there she got Gino going yeah she did get Gino going royalty right there along the front line there quite a bit of it here at Virginia Obie thats actually where I sit when I come to uh come to UV games as a fan and spectator you do yeah right right where Debbie sits Phil Phil wendle of course one of our biggest supporters here at the University and for you there should be a throne there not a chair a throne far from it my friend Sharma off the fake cant stick it battle for the rebound oh it came free and sers will lay it in Great Hustle by Saunders to be able to go after the basketball we talked about his offensive rebounding prow shows it off on that possession just stronger to the ball 2921 NC State Taylor tried to drive it good defense by McNeely to step in and prevent that Marcus Hill the 64 senior out of Illinois and out of Bowling Green they transferred here to NC State try to shovel the pass inside and out it goes intended for hotley Hatfield the crowd getting involved the students arent here OB however theres still some juice in the building here at Music Applause Music jpj e the paint but down 1 15 from Beyond The Arc NC stay without one of their key guys at least for the first half because Ben Middlebrooks is ill he woke up this morning couldnt keep anything down a 610 senior thats 10 points five rebounds also a guy who got 21 points in one of the NCAA tournament games last March and the leading s Blocker in the ACC at 17 points per game and so a rim protector for the wolf pack as well so big Miss but right now they havent missed him especially on the offensive end a strong performance thus far for the Wolfpack MCD with a bounds for Saunders he tried to roll to the 10 and they pluck it away a theft by NC State thats going to be three turnovers for Virginia that was one of the things that Ron Sanchez talked to us about as you see the first turnover the game for for oconnell who hands away four to zero assist a turnover ratio with 4 to one assist turnover ratio so hes one of the best in the ACC dont see him give it up often NC State turning it over quickly on the other end again just 10 a game for them Saunders with a nice drive using that shoulder and you can see the confidence growing in Saunders putting the ball on the floor getting to the rim showing off that strong frame Virginias going to have to rely on him on both ends of the floor a lot moving forward Elijah sers 68 but 240 out of Arizona so very strong Hill for oconnell was looking inside the swing here for Taylor trying to take that Baseline hell find Hill he denied by sh good defense there oconnell shot clock down the one cant hit it so a stop for the Cavaliers theyve had a couple here in the last few minutes to kind of stem the tide on the wol pack who looked like they may be about to break away little shove here with 512 to go in the first half and well have womens basketball the Red River rivalry game on Thursday on ESPN 2 number 10 Oklahoma hosting number six Texas at the Lloyd Noble Center in Norman coverage beginning at 9 Eastern after the Memphis FAU mens game and the Oklahoma men remaining undefeated as well Debbie absolutely knows about those big time matchups multiple final fours during her tenure the head coach here at University of Virginia is another turnover for Virginia trying to go high low action NC States gone three and a half minutes without a field goal and finally they convert one on the fast break and thats what they do points off of turnovers as well as fast break break I mean fast break points thats what the wolf pack do they lead the ACC at both categories Virginia trying to quickly return on the other end Tapped Out high for oconnell and numbers here decides not to shoot the three Ley Hatfield on Buchanan Connell again back to the big out of the double heres Taylor to line it up and sticks the three but great ball Movement by the wolf pack the double team by Virginia going in trying to get the basketball out of hands of Hunley Hatfield the extra passing on the exterior allows Taylor to get a nice look from three the story here has been NC State shooting the threepointer six out of 11 and they had their largest lead and thats not the Scouting Report you know coming in shooting 32 thats under average when you consider 33 is average for shooting to three so the Scot report had to be the force one to beat you from the outside Sharma CS from threepoint L isan Sharma the Canadian where he start at Fort eie International Academy its one of the topies there it makes the first threepoint field goal of the game for Virginia who theyve struggled from Beyond The Arc early in this one so getting involved in ThreePoint Contest as well yeah they really flipped rolls here because Virginia has been the far better threepoint team and a whistle in the paints and a foul will go on Buchanan and thats going to be his second e Music do Music it there we go Music Applause Music it absolutely has been great for NC State on threepoint line coach and I know you take some pride in that of course your relationship with Coach Kevin Kei those two go back a long time when Seth was the head coach at Virginia Tech coach Keats used to send him had a pipeline when coach Kei was the head coach at hard rate always getting guys down there and they had a lot of success in C palan playing for Coach green foul here with the score 34 26 guys were talking about Leonard Hamilton I want to get your early opinion the ACC is losing outstanding coaches Leonard is being sued by a number of players who say they did not receive their nil payments as promised well see how that all plays out but it seems like one coach after another has reason to leave campus in the ACC these days one one thing for certain and I know nothing about the details of the players under review for a potential flagrant foul I I know none of that as we have a review for a flagrant foul Clarence Armstrong is communicating through our referee microphone but I can tell you this I do know the man I know the man well I know Leonard Hamilton well and I a believer in him as a person now whatever happened I cant speak on because I dont know but I am a believer in coach ham as we get a look at to see if this is a flagrant one and will that be a hook and hold the question is you look at the right arm is there a hook and hold there I dont believe theres enough to be a flagrant on that possession from the angle that we saw from Huntley halfi I think itll be a common offensive foul going the other direction but we got a great crew here on hand taking an extra look at it just to make sure so taking a look at stands common foul just a common foul and nothing extra a 322 before the break and just to finish the thought on Leonard you and I have covered him many many times over the years hes such a great guy and such a decent human being I dont know what happened with all of that none of us do yet but what is very strange is some of the best coaches in America out of the ACC are not coaching in the ACC anymore well and that thats the thing and again I I hope this is not the end for coach but regardless as to whether or not it is one thing for certain is he has always been about uplifting in the benefit of his players it truly is and so to see this happening I I and again were were at unprecedented times in college athletics you know to to to just hear and fathom that players are suing a coach over money I mean one when you talk nil its not coach Hams money lets start with that but when its all said and done you know were at unprecedent times in college wa are we ever styles with the foul and Sharma up top with Virginia trailing 3426 at the threeminute mark of the first half he almost gave it up shot clock down to seven Murray on the move on the Baseline kicks out for mcney for a three and a great play by Tame Murray keeping his trouble alive along the Baseline and head up delivering a dime to mcneel who was able to knock down the three ball and Virginia getting back within five but respect to tame Murray with little Steve Nash action along the Baseline and mcney 43 his career from the three number one in Virginia all time unle Hai a back down getting inside the lane and a whistle Blake Buchanan trying to stick with him Virginia by the way in a 6 nothing run and watch what T Murray does here instead of pulling it back out and not staying aggressive he stays aggressive gets past dant Styles keeps his head up even though hes under the basket finds McNeely on the outside we talk about guys theres something to being loyal staying in a program T Murray has been now at University of Virginia for 4 years and as he continues to grow in the system he becomes more and more reliable for Ron Sanchez in this program and is finding himself much more so in the rotation as a solid contributor well youre an outlier these days if youre along a campus for this many years Buchanan just picked up his third foul for the Cavaliers hes been battling with Huntley Hatfield in the paint weve seen those guys going at it a number of times but you dont mind that you rather see Blake Buchanan come out be aggressive fighting hard to try to get position on the offensive end and also trying to keep away position for Huntley Applause Hatfield Marie picked up the dribble and he walked with it and a traveling violation thatll be turnover number five for Virginia and thats the pressure one of the things Kevin Kevin ke talked to us about pre game was it wasnt just the full court pressure they wanted to make sure they had that pressure in the half court to find ways to be able to turn Virginia over not allow their players to be comfortable especially getting into threepoint range its a great point its actually been more damaging than the full court Applause pressure now a swing here another whistle with exactly 2 minutes before the break and theyre howling here jpj on a foul against Kofi the 610 freshman but its an obvious foul Kofi actually discussed it with himself after getting the foul holding Huntley half field great angle how about our camera right here you see Kofi holding there not allowing Huntley half to release it go after the basketball forcing the turnover was distraught with itself afterwards as anley Robinson checks in now all the bigs in foul trouble th far for Virginia travel here Le Hatfield will give it back and thats their fourth turnover its significant when either one of these teams turns it over it is both teams handle the basketball very well and so normally two of the top teams in the ACC of not giving the basketball the way as you see more full court pressure and this is the matchup that you want the shot clock never started on that possession yeah Ted Valentine saw that and stop play if but if youre Virginia thats the matchup you want you want to try to find find a way to get Marcus Hill and Brion pass off the ball handler allow that to be Michael okono for as great as okono is on the offensive end hes not the ball pressure guy that you have alongside him in the back court so he you want him to be the one that has to pressure you 94 ft great decision there by mcil just to go set the screen and force okell to be the guy that has to pressure the entire qu Virginia right now 0 and one in the ACC losing to new conference opponent SMU in early December 63 51 were talking about all the dramatic changes around college basketball and none more evident than the ACC and Virginia who saw Tony Bennett retired shortly before the season began and the accs list of icons who have left the programs in the era of nil and the transfer portal its really astonishing how many tremendous Co Coes have stepped aside and really starting with Coach K who probably saw a lot of things developing sooner than most well and you consider Roy actually stepped away a year before coach Kay did so you think about you know between the two of those coaches youre talking about eight national championships then you think about Tony Bennett Thats nine Jim beim thats 10 national championships that you have now seen walk away from the sidelines over the past four seasons in this game Jim LGA two final fours yes you know I mean youre talking about Elite coaches all who most likely will end up in the Hall of Fame when its all said and done Jim Lena by the way in Miami did an amazing job at that school the elite eights the final four the success there and whats always been a bigtime football town and he made college basketball fun in Miami he absolutely did I mean you got to think about the times of course they won the AC championship in 2013 and then the magical run backto back years to the elite eight and then final four and congratulations to coach L on a great career and I hope the Hall of Fame will be calling very Applause soon so 3629 NC State Hill swings up high for Huntley Hatfield Brion pass trying to make a move and another whistle a lot of fouls all of a sudden really at the end of the half and not a turnover six for Virginia and now the fifth turnover for NC State we talked a lot about the fact that neither these teams is guilty of turning the basketball over often as Huntley Hatfield picks up his second now has to go have a Applause seat NC State cooling off to just two field goals in the last seven minutes that has allowed Virginia to stick catch and fire mcney no but I like that shot by McNeely because he didnt wait hes the best shooter on the floor which means that when you get opportunity you have to let it go was very aggressive on that opportunity pass tried to do exactly that and its going to go out of play and back over to Virginia and now six turnovers for NC State coming in only averaging 97 per game six here in the first half was still a minute remaining that of course was long Tony Bennetts game his team just never turned the ball over and suffocated you defensively with that pack line 102 to go before the break and didnt foul and didnt foul that was another thing Virginia always one of the top teams in the country of fewest fouls per game last year Virginia just eight turn overs a game number one in the Applause country Luray will back it away down to nine on a shot clock heres mcney working on oconnell driving past him with a teardrop off the window too strong and a save on a baseline by Marcus Hill Taylor slashing inside tough move and it drops in count that and hell be off to the line and Jaden Taylor slick play for the 64 senior and you honestly at that point are probably thinking to keep it for the last shot but Taylor feeling good about things catches in the corner is able to beat roie off the bounce and then the contact the bucket an opportunity for the and one at the line Robinson a second foul Taylor makes 73 and a threepoint play so back up to 10 for the wol pack and here comes the pressure again its been there all game long Ro Breaking Free across midcourt 20 seconds before halftime Ro averaging about eight points a game he can be deadly beyond that threepoint line Murray with it as they play for the final shot before halftime they want mcney hell kick it out Murray has to heave it up there in and out at the buzzer and thats how the first half ends NC State a little push there late they open up a 10point lead Kevin ke two second 20 minutes here at jpj oconnell denied OK connells name will always be remembered in history at NC State for that shoty hit against Virginia in the tournament semifinals and a back two to hit the second half going similar start to the second half we saw in the first half a drive to the bucket and an easy basket for for dant styles to start off the start off the half he is six points 4129 and Virginia has to be very wary of an early spurt here by the wolf pack particularly beyond that threepoint line shotlock is down to nine Kofi gets a good long look he cant sink it and a shove itll go the other way a foul in the paint will go against Virginia and thatll go against Elijah Saunders the 68 Junior I love how Saunders tried to point at dant Styles and say that he was the one that was pushing when Styles went flying I mean theres theres a mismatch in size it may not be as much in height but you can see s saers is a much more physical specimen than when you see with styles on the Block well pack right now at 8 and four trying to go to 2 and0 in the ACC pass into the corner with 11 on the shot clock Marcus Hill looking to penetrate lot of contact no whistle knocks it down but thats Marcus Hills game the largest lead of the game for the Wolfpack as they go up 14 right here his game is getting into the painted area attacking off the bounds hes their top scorer coming to NC State from Bowling Green where he averaged 21 a game last year that led the mack in scoring downstairs Saunders couple of fakes and one and hell be off to the line and the game within the game the battle between Saunders and styles Saunders is able to win on this possession catching the basketball over the top not a great angle on that pass but effective enough for Sanders to be able to catch the pump they can the Finish through the contact looking for his 11th Point styles with the foul sers good at the line 82 and thatll rattle home he had 21 in their last game against American so he can score he can score the basketball and I think hes becoming more and more comfortable you got to understand with a new player coming in which both these teams have new guys its going to take a while for guys to get into their roles we saw that with no one any anyone than with the wol pack a season ago you think about the guys like o conell Jaden Taylor all the DJ horn the guys were in there for their first year and how they mesed at the end of the year of course making it all the way to the final four what an incredible run for a team that had 14 losses going into the ACC tournament and a foul downstairs in the opening minutes of the second half 4332 NC State nobody predicted that there were signs that they could make some noise in the ACC tournament you and I had them a couple of times before Washington DC when they went on that five wins in five days the miraculous run you could tell that it could happen but nobody was betting on it well you could tell that there was Talent on that team and they struggled to really play with the chemistry last year that you were expecting and what you saw but of course with DJ Burns who was just alone a a problem to deal with in the pained area but they had DJ horn on the outside Michael oconnell Distributing the basketball Jaden Taylor knocking down threes they had so many different guys of course Kara on the offensive glass when they put it all together and played together with the cohesiveness that they did is the reason why we watched them win nine straight games to find their way to the final four Magic Carpet Ride of a run no question about that and Kevin Keats did a great job himself and his staff making sure that those guys were ready to go day after day after day when it mattered the most and how about this over the NC state had this four major programs mens womens basketball football and baseball the team the baseball team went to the College World Series all four of their four major programs finished in the AP Top 25 on the season so a strong year for my guy bu Corgan in the NC State athletic department I would say thats an understatement of course bu Corgan from Charlottesville mom still here 94 years old Ro down for Saunders and a bucket Saunders has in the focal point for Virginia throughout this second half to started off and you can see that theyre looking for him so much that Kevin Keats wants to have a conversation about it going over the top Ron Sanchez making sure that alija Saunders gets his opportunities showing off his strength on the inside ceiling the mismatch against okono the easy layup Virginia within Music seven see game did not go go according to plan only three points for him in that one 0 for six at SMU however he has changed his fortunes here in his first home ACC game aij of the sers now with 15 or more points in four consecutive games and I believe the count is still going here OB we had 19 in the lost to Florida 15 against Memphis so hes played well against Elite Talent he has and again youre talking about a young man who was a part of a national championship runnerup team at San Diego State two seasons ago his fresh year so he knows his way around the basketball court now finding his footing here in Charlesville Happ with a big rebound up top Taylor cant connect from threepoint L the two offensive rebounds this was a concern for Ron Sanchez about keeping the Wolfpack off the glass two offensive rebounds alone in this possession oconnell eight to shoot now Jaden Taylor had a big first half steps back and drains the triple and that time youll go three for a normally I say two for a dollar but three attempts on that same possession Taylors able to make good on it knocking down another three for the wolfback scouting report that said The Wack cant hit threes were tossing that right now yeah I believe that one has to go out the window maybe that was nonconference action that might be it so he can clarify it but they are hitting him in conference play Kofi up high looking for a cutter Saunders gets Another Touch seemingly hes going to get a touch every time down if it aint broke dont fix it and draws the foul dant Styles trying to stick with him and he commits the personal and were going to take a break here with 1559 to go in Charlottesville back up to 10 for the Music pack this is an ES and Sonic Blockbuster W this is star power from the jump a blockbuster double header Saturday on ESPN that should be a Dandy just settle in for the day right and take in those games Arkansas and number one Tennessee look at Arkansas at 51 shooting Boogie flan The Freshman he is the real deal he absolutely is the real deal Arkansas a very good team but when you consider the real deal Tennessee the plus 246 scoring margin first in the SEC second in division one and when youre first in the SEC this year in anything let me tell you how special that is Elite year thus far for the SEC and what theyve been able to accomplish in the nonconference absolutely stacked and Id put Auburn with anybody anybody in the country any night of the week OB I was there for the Maui Invitational to call the Auburn games and when I tell you and they bar barely escaped the first round against Iowa State and outside of that it wasnt even close they were so far above the competition that they played against and they have been outside of the visit to Cameron Indoor All Season thats right unley Hatfield spinning down low to the left hand boy he did everything he wanted to do except make the shot and you see early with Virginias bigs in foul trouble they want to give the inside guys a number of opportunities shocked to see okono trying to guard Elijah Saunders on the Block right here if youre Virginia you want to continue to feed Saunders Murray stops kicks outside MCD and an excellent looking at that great touch he has hes 43 beyond the line for his career but thats always a good option to find iMac on the perimeter his parents of course here watching as well got to see them in practice yesterday and theyre applauding their sons effort along with the crowd here at jpj as but say theyre not alone the building comes to life as Virginia claws with in five and thatll go the other way thats against ccy state now this building starting to sound early similar to what weve seen here for the last 13 or so years the second time Murrays dri driven Baseline and found McNeely at the top of the key these two guys connecting on a number of looks Parker junr with the foul Virginia on a 123 run Murray on the attack to the Lane Scoops it in maybe this theme is about mom and dad being in town both their parents McNeils family Murrays family at practice yesterday so theyre understanding they got to put on for Mom and Dad the crowd swing pass inside finally Hadfield but he missed it again and its off him and out play back over to Virginia momentum is a dangerous thing OB momentum can make you miss Point Blank layups Brandon Hunley haffield got a great look right there as you mentioned off of a beautiful feed and speaking of nice finds the kick to the corner and then tane Murray attacking off the bounds showing his maturity and his strength as Anthony Robinson flexes a little bit on the sideline appreciating his teammate momentum and the love of Mom and Dad yeah there you go that pretty good mix right now for Virginia still down three but surging and state is three for nine shooting it in the second half after a scalding first half and Kofi will draw the foul before the shot 1417 to go here in Charlottesville and Big Time life for the Cavaliers and coming up wake and Syracuse at 200 followed by Arizona State and BYU at 4 this afternoon on ESPN 2 I believe my brother Randolph childr AKA chill is in Syracuse and of course he is absolutely chilling because thats what you do in Syracuse at this time of year you sure do I know that firsthand yes you do chilling or freezing to death mcne looking to make a move on Hill hell fire a long one I love it the mcne being aggressive thats what you want to see from him Obie 44 is way too high for percentage to shoot from three you got to take some bad ones every now and then and see if you can knock him down now for him very few of them are bad pass almost lost his footing and lost the ball but maintained it Hill spinning weaving inside and left it well short rebound comes free they got four on the shot clock heres pass to fire another second effort okano no that barely got B Virginia fortunate to be able to escape that possession NC State scoring three more looks at the rim with the offensive rebounding but right now for Virginia you want to try to find a way to get the basketball in the hands of Saunders or McNeely both those guys got it going right now muray oconnell sticking with him heres roie got it and Virginia coming from 10 down has tight but this is the Virginia team that youre expecting to see when they handle the pressure theyve got Elite Shooters on the perimeter Ro knocking down another hes shooting over 40 on the season last time Virginia LED it was 131 in the first half now locked up at 46 and now the pack needs an answer Parker Jr tried to scoop and lost the out of play but its deflected by Virginia it was with five on the shot clock once again weve seen weve seen tane Murray attacking the basket that time gets it to roie who catches high and releases it high pass yes thatll go well every shot he takes is contested and tough but he makes it but I love the way this young man is grown up again he didnt leave he didnt walk away from it he stuck with it found himself in a situation where he would be a member of the rotation and now playing huge minutes and making big shots for the pack made one there 4846 Murray zipping the pass for Applause roie RO wants the paint up and and it goes this is a different Andrew roie when hes aggressive you talk about a young man who transferred in averaging 17 points per game as a freshman struggled at times last with his confidence but now starting to find it here in his role at Virginia getting it going on the last couple of possessions on the offensive end well this one here jpj has heated up hill leaping into the paint cant converts and coming out of the pack on the bounce and saers couldnt handle it as they turn it over Hill on the run out up against Buchanan and Bs it in missed opportunity for Virginia to take a lead on that possession if saers able to handle that BAS bball and get a shot on the glass Virginia would take a lead for the first time in a very long time hill now is six came in as their top scorer with 13 and a balanced attack for the wolf pack Taylor gets 12 a game Ben Middlebrooks is not played because hes ill mcne will switch that one mcne looking very similar to a young man on Virginias bench I remember watching Kyle got take shots like that back in the day Kyle practicing against Virginia shooting lefthanded OB and I watched him hit one from the spot just like that yesterday with the left hand however iMac does it with the right and this time he gives Virginia a onepoint lead threepoint Arc Isaac mcne Andrew roie everyone getting involved in the action and then roie going to work in the painted area feeling more confident about his game and then mcne entering his K guy right there although hes wearing the ti R number yes hes playing more like the C guy you know for you think about the we call them ghost of Virginia past guys who hung a banner here in 2019 Ty drone by the way balling for the Cleveland Cavaliers yeah one Friendly Ghost by the way very friendly ghost styles jumping inside dead Lane to draw some contact NC State just three for their last 14 shooting Applause in so they have cooled off after a scalding hot first half in which they shot 62 but really coming back to what the scouting report on the wolf pack is they want to beat you with points in the paint its not about shooting the basketball from the threepoint Arc of course when youre making them you want to see them go up but they want to be able to attack the paint dant styles on the post up an opportunity at the line to give the wolf back the lead right back Styles the transfer from George town now if he misses this foul shot that would be two in a row and if that happens everybody in the arena gets free bacon which is why the the volume level has gone way up here everybodys very familiar with bacon heres number two do we have bacon no no bacon for you at least not right now thats why the boob birds are out but there will be more opportunities Im sure throughout this game so tied at Applause 51 and Mur to bring it up as we mentioned his mom and Dad are here from New Zealand for an extended period of time to watch the sun play had a great conversation with them as well as I Mike parents in practice yesterday Isaac mcne and I have a understanding OB he is supposed to go down the lane and dunk on someone his mom says hes been able to do it since he was in the eighth grade sharms threepoint L isan Sharma the freshman and now McNeely cheering on his teammate and sharmas able to get the three to go he made the first three of the game for Virginia and now comes in and knocks down another from the wing so now its Virginias largest lead they were two for eight out of the gate from threepoint land theyve gone four for five since then styles to the paint turns around no way short the defense for the Cavaliers has been exceptional since the break and more importantly Gathering the defensive rebound once you get a stop the A stand is not finish until you get that rebound and going the other direction Saunders got a good look and a lot of iron its tis still a loose ball but controlled by the pack the threepointer away from tying it were in inside 10 minutes and KN the away itll be NC State ball 926 to go right now Kevin Keats wants to focus on the matchup between dant Styles and Elijah Sanders when you consider this Anders has been able to get going offensively thats the best way to go at a a guy that has going on the offensive end make him have to defend interesting to see if they go back into the painted area for this possession open shot by Parker too strong rebound big battle for that once again NC State comes away with it theyve won a lot of those today for those second efforts on the offensive glass NC Sav with seven offensive rebounds in the second half just one in the first half Hill Airborne what a tough shot its in and out thats a great job defensively by Elijah s staying in front of the quicker smaller guard and Hill sliding his feet you see sers doing a great job here staying in front and then more importantly defending without fouling as the shot clock nears its end Ron Sanchez the interim head coach for Virginia gets mcney back in there no reason to take him out the rest of the way with his shooting Talent the swing underneath and a reverses Up and Good by Kofi and Kofi taking advantage of his matchup we talk about young man that stuffs the stat seats in all areas as the crowd here jpj gets on their feet looking for another defensive stand NC state has to find a hot shooter in a hurry theyre three for their last 17 they turn it over again and roie will wait for the rest of the Cavaliers here up by five 8 minutes to go oh defensive breakdown mcne got it you cannot lose that guy time out NC State and you know Kevin kees wants to talk about that one if theres any guy in the building that is allowed to run free its not number 11 in white you cannot give him looks the alltime leading threepoint percentage field goal leader at the University of Virginia getting a wideopen practice look on that profession on that possession defensively you see no one going with McNeely too late to contest an elite shooter as Music such e e e e Music Music Music Applause Applause Kev Isaac mcne has caught fire three for four here in the second half just 2 for seven in the first half Cory but Kevin Keys talked to us earlier about you have to know where he is and look at the defensive miscommunication Jaden Taylor yells out switch Marcus Hill does not recognizing it allowing McNeely to go over and this is a rhythm three for him able to get a solid bounce turning o mly hasnt seen himself that wide open probably since he walked on grounds here at University of Virginia you better guard him outside the building with his range and a fumble and a turnover by Jaden Taylor very rare to see NC State sloppy like that theyre the best as far as turnovers in the conference but fumbled that one away and its been a 19point turn around OB Virginia went into the locker room at halftime down 10 now theyre up forgive me 18point turnaround but up eight now an opportunity to add to it here after a turnover though they need Elijah Saunders whos terrific in the first half to get going again but right now its mcne show and he misfires on that one Virginia on top Applause 5951 and who will be that man for the Wolfpack to start to cook offensively oconnell picks up the dribble pass trying to get it downstairs and a whistle and the foul will go against Virginia and Kofi as he gets set to ring in the New Year tomorrow we have a mens basketball double header on acc Network head starts at 230 Notre Dame in Georgia Tech and a Cooper flag and number four Duke will take on Virginia Tech at Cameron indor as we wish every want a happy New Year better way to bring in New Years in watching hoops no question about it unley Hatfield with the basket the 610 senior knocks it down and thats really where NC States bread is buttered in the painted area so you look see a lot of more of that down the stretch Huntley hfield back on the floor as we see the wol pack now going a Zone defensively more of a 32 look trying to keep Virginia Shooters off the line saers on target again with a triple the most difficult place to cover in a zone is the corners especially when the basketball moves from side to side that time Virginia moving the ball very well getting sers a good look he has 20 no answer for Styles but a whistle with 6 and2 remaining but watch the action as Virginia moves the basketball and give Blake Buchanan a lot of credit getting a body on Brandon Hunley half trying to get out a contest a three from Saunders along the Baseline but giving him more than enough time to knock down the three ball out of the corner Virginia has one of the great threepoint Shooters in the country of course in McNeely but they have really come alive from threepoint distance another one in tight by Huntley Hatfield give him 10 yeah back to back bucket for Huntley Hatfield but the issue for NC State is no longer what they do an offensive Fage can they stop Virginia Ron Sanchez told us that he would like to see his team in the 70s as long as he can keep NC State in maybe the 50s or 60s yes thats the game plan today coming up on 6 minutes to go Saunders got to get a shot in the air down to five on the shot clock heres roie got it way down time for Andrew Roy who makes 45 and again you have Elite shooters for Virginia is simply about can they get to those shots most teams have done a good job especially high level of competition running them off the threepoint line after a two for8 start from three Virginia is seven for their last nine turn around Styles off the front iron and a foul on the play 528 to Applause go its 6555 its Virginia turning to tables dramatically here in the second half down 10 at the break and now up 10 and the foul by Saunders is his third and at the end of the shot clock Andrew roie coming off knowing that he has to get a shot in the air and Obi often times thats the best time to shoot it because theres no question as to whether its a good shot or not you got to get a shot up and Ro playing with tremendous confidence here this afternoon knocks down the three ball as we now find oursel on bacon watch once again and again it Styles at the line as they chant for bacon and Charlottesville he makes 77 for the year and missed the pair rebounded by Virginia and free bacon for everybody in the house Im not sure they would cheer that loud in a shot clock violation of course we know how valuable those are here in Charlottesville so bacon of course always a favorite I hope mine makes it home you know Ive got to connect through Charlotte and I dont know if theyre going to go after it in my suitcase so what but Im taking it home 6555 well see how TSA responds to that just have to be under three ounces thats right thats all I get just a little piece 512 remaining Buchanan moving inside and drops in two to big fella at 611 and if he can start to add some offensive prch to this Virginia lineup look out and again one of the things weve talked about OB teams in this league get better as the season goes along youre giving them an opportunity now to jail and this Virginia team is looking about as good as this looked especially here in this second half the entire season Taylor slamming on the braks did not walk but they do turn it over there a lot of turnovers for a game for NC State but its close quarters right there and thats what brand Hunley haffield is expecting for Jane Taylor to get up on the glass he can go after offensive rebound but now 10 turnovers which is over the season average for the wolf pack still 441 remaining right and biggest lead so far today for Virginia 67 of 55 as we start to really get rocking and rolling in the ACC Kofi back on one and Buchanan who just made a key shot will return to the bench and dead ball allows The Wack to pick up their pressure going to be interesting to see how Kevin Keys decides to play this last 4 and A2 minutes and how theyll come after Virginia the layup wont go MC with a Miss but if hes got to be more 25 ft out right if youre Virginia thats what you want to do when you break the pressure you want to go try to score but Point Blank layups you got to take advantage of oconnell from the corner around it out hell pick the rebound okell gets a second look at this one he drain classic two for a dollar give Marcus Hill a lot of credit getting in that offensive rebound and finding okono in the exact same corner where he missed the first Applause one Hill trying to harass Ro but he gets it across keeps on driving went for scoop and hell draw the foul with four minutes to go and the college football playoff continues with the quarterfinals on ESPN Tonight Penn State at Boise State thats at 730 tomorrow Texas taking on Arizona State at 100 Ohio State Oregon in the Rose Bowl thats at 5 Easter we C the night with Notre Dame in Georgia in the All State Sugar Bowl where is he State still has the blue field correct they do Ill definitely be checking that out tonight want to see what uniform combination Penn State goes with of course you know I mean again you hate to root for anybody but I can root for football we got two of my guys at Penn State on the staff Marcus Hain of course the great Anthony Point de are both assistant coaches at Penn day so I think I might have to go with the NY Lions going ny Lions going ny Lions Im going for Georgia to win the whole thing of course you are in a big up theres no surprise there a lot of tuition dollars have gone to the University of Georgia but to be fair they actually did pay you as well supposed to talk about thaty atfield in the paint short rebound by Hill is up and in for two second possession where Hill was able to come up with the offensive rebound this time he takes business into his own hands and finishes it off but whenever the wol pack score it gives them an opportunity to pick up full court with their pressure mantoman pressure thus far hasnt affected Virginia the Virginia would have this game well in hand if not for the offensive rebounding of the pack here Kofi way down hes 610 cant drain that its anoint game but you want him taking that shot thats a confident shot he got a good look just unable to knock it down but now the problem for Virginia is is finishing defensive possessions even if you get a stop you got to get the board hard drive and a tough scoop by Parker Jun but the shot of the out third straight possession Second Chance points for the wolfbat Le Hatfield with a dozen 6862 under Applause three roie looking for someone to make a move Kofi comes in averaging 86 rebounds he gives it up been a while since mcne has touched one beyond the threepoint line for Virginia the shot clock a factor its down to five it was tipped mcnealy will launch one way downt and he cant hit it with the long three leads to a possible transition opportunity three on three but OK going to take it on his own shoulders and whenever youve got guys on their heels you absolutely want to go after and do the foul on Sharma or okell at the line just 60 there but the grad out of the state of New York drops in number one so they have certainly dramatically reversed roles in the first half NC State was burying three after three theyve cooled in the second half and Virginia has taken on that mantle nailing their threes yeah Virginia seven of 12 from threepoint range here in the second half but NC State getting to the offensive glass thats whats allowed them to make this a fivepoint game and coming up with some timely stops here in the last few possessions going for the Trap and well done not to reach and commit a foul possession arrow will keep it on this end of the floor hey go back to 2009 Virginia is 1701 when they score 70 points or more wow of course you go back to 2009 thats their first season for Tony Bennett who is now the alltime leading wi coach at the University of Virginia mens basketball Mig very patiently getting the pass to Murray hell attack now and the Miss fire oon with a rebound a chance to run up now for the pat although Virginia does a good job getting back defensively un Le Hatfield again and another one in close how many has he missed at that range like right on top of the iron hes missed three or four and lets also add no B Middlebrooks in this game so Hunley Hatfield playing more minutes than hes really accustomed to no one for n State averages over 30 minutes per game Huntley Hatfield normally playing about 20 per game and is well above that at 25 here today Saunders gets an open look off the back of the iron o Virginia has stalled a bit on the offensive end of the floor allowing NC State to stick around coming up on one minute to play though and thatll be a round and up by Parker Jr and Ted Valentine with a whistle theyre going to get tame Murray trying to keep Marcus Hill off the glass and its ready there to see your point guard and your your shooting guard so effective on the offensive glass but Marcus Hills come up with a number of great offensive rebounds here in this second half as NC sts been able to make a run another opportunity here to cut into the lead at the free throw line and theyre nine for 13 at the line so far today Virginia seven out of nine neither team commits a lot of fouls and he will drop in that one hell make 67 coming to NC State from Bowling Green and a 23point game against Florida State in their overtime win so he can explode perfect fit for Kevin Keats not only because of what he can do offensively but also defensively can heat up the basketball also brought a height listing of 64 with him from baling green and Coach Keats has a rule about you cant be shorter than you were your pre School however hes about 6 ft maybe 61 threepoint game under a minute here in charlotesville last year they played three times these two schools two of them went overtime including in the ACC tournament semifinal roie to his right left it short rebound tips and comes away to the pack and theyve got an opportunity to tie this up on a triple 40 seconds to go NC State you dont need the three you take the best possible opportunity you can even if its driving you to the rim to get a two still more than enough time shot clock under 10 okono dribbling away heres Taylor shot clock at four he will drive it slam on the brakes he cant hit it 15 seconds to go and a whistle on the tie up 155 a strong stand defensively by Virginia Taylor got a very very good look as he drives it to the rim and is able to create some separation between he and tame Murray but just unable to get the shot to go but more importantly Elijah Saunders coming up with a defensive rebound and an opportunity at the free throw line to make it a twopossession game now NC State looked very confident at halftime they were up by 10 they were shooting the lights out here in charlotesville very different story in the second half sers has been a big reason why hes at the line here at 82 Virginia played through him to start the second half he got the basketball seemed to be on every trip down the floor as he calmly knocks down the first free throw to give Virginia a fourpoint lead now this one would be huge a fivepoint lead of course takes away the concern of a foul on a three in the latter seconds Andy stay one more timeout remaining Virginia with two Saunders calm at the line and today with 22 points that is a new career high and a timeout NC State were going to go away for 30 its Virginia by five with 15 seconds to go Music Music will pack three out of their last 11 beyond the threepoint line 154 to go so theres the breakdown what we have remaining for has the two timeouts NC State just used their final one and when you consider right now for Virginia youre not in a scenario where you even need to consider fouling you want to make sure you can contest any three but back away do not allow yourself to give up a fourpoint opportunity cuz still more than enough time to be able to if they make the three all you got to do is take care of business at the free throw line by being strong with the basketball well Marcus Hill is a good shooter Michael okono makes 41 s beond the threepoint line and Brion pass is their best threepoint guy hes been well over 50 this season and I would expect to see Brion pass on the floor recognizing his ability to shoot the three youre probably going to see a very small lineup for NC State to be able to space the floor and everyone on the court would be a threat from three no Connell there number 12 in the foreground will be forever remembered for that buzzer beater against Virginia in overtime Force overtime in the ACC tournament semifinals Lorenzo Charles gamewinning dunk in the 83 National Championship is always going to be number one I tell you what those are the times that made you fall in love with basketball OBC and Jimmy B running all over the floor looking for someone to hug undoubtedly Hill will drive it he goes up for two with 109 remaining threepoint game pressure again from the pack and Bars going to call a timeout and theyre down to one now and I like the decision by Kevin Keat to be able to take the easy two and still have time to try to force a turnover still Virginia hanging on to a threepoint lead Music Applause Music Music well again twice last year they went overtime these two and it seems like every time they play it comes right down to the last shot or two Virginia trying to hang on and eek out the win at home they lead by three with 109 seconds Well Ron Sanchez got his whis they got to 70 now the question is can they keep NC State under 70 is the concern and right now roie taking the basketball out of bounds after the timeout understanding whether or not he can run along the Baseline being that it was never inbound he still can run he bounces for Murray Murray tied up in the Trap still trying to wle free down to 5 seconds left with 49 on the clock and I believe thats Huntley Hatfield whose foot was on the sideline as he touched the basketball out of bounds but executed perfectly by the Wolfpack to get the Trap just couldnt get the hands on the basketball to come up to tie the basketball up and get possession Back The Possession arrows in their favor so Virginia inbound here from the sideline and Ro to put it in if he can over the top he does get it in for Saunders hell draw the foul 39 on the clock now this was a great trap by the wolf pack but as Hunley Hai goes to the ground you see his leg out of bound once he touches the basketball its now a dead basketball otherwise if hes in bounds now its a tie possession which The Possession goes back to the wolf pack and gives him an opportunity to try to get a three up and the into regulation so huge shots for Saunders by the way theyve played 50 games in this series decided by five points or less between NC State and Virginia and you go back I mean when you consider that we talked about that 83 run they had to beat Virginia in the ACC tournament to be able to win that so these two teams have had some absolute showdowns missed it Hill with the rebound two seconds long he thats going to be way short and thats the ball game Virginia wins it 7067 they hold off the wol
