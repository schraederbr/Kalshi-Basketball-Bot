and now back live moments away from the opening tip Duke at 20 and two and the Clemson Tigers at 18 and five Clemson wins the opening tip and we are underway already it has been an electrifying evening and were just getting started as this giant crowd packed to the gills welcome back dick byal quick turnover here for the Clemson Tigers well theyre such a great defensive team you know Cory when you look at Duke everybody talks about their offensive efficiency but defensively they are so efficient absolutely coach votal and when you consider you want to be a championship team and win games like this in a hostile environment your defense absolutely has to travel well Tyrese Proctor knocking down the first one as he hits the three a look at the Clemson Tigers and theyre starting five including the hunters and shefin a big body in the middle on the run and up and in by cion James as he got it to go he has been really terrific when you talk about James hes one of the guys came with that transfer portal they brought some outstanding guys Gillis was not playing today but also Brown from Syracuse and James they fit perfectly with the Superstar diaper dandies they brought in Dylan Hunter the 63 junr with the first foul put James at the line and he knocks that down for a threepoint play six nothing Duke not the kind of start if youre Clemson you dont want to fall back 141 to start the crowding a quiet quy you absolutely dont want that especially after coming off a triped overtime loss here on your home floor possibly looking ahead to this Duke game H getting it downstairs to the big thats Victor lockin and a foul hes 61 from Russia and the foul will go against Proctor number one well one of the reasons they lost that triple overtime game was because they lost lockin during the game he got fouled fou that would play 15 minutes out of 55 minutes with the triple overtime they need him on the floor good shot up and in by Dylan Hunter to get Clemson on the board yeah they did lose on Tuesday in triple overtime to Georgia Tech as you look at the Duke starting five including of course Cooper flag the player of the year candidate malat the big at 72 seems like everybody for Duke is Big theyre the tallest team in America I got Sheffer matching up right now on Cooper Proctor with a missfire and a foul here against Duke as Jaden Zachary got knocked to the deck tell you this Cory you and I saw copert in high school and we both were in awe up there in the city of Pals and Fort Myers I couldnt believe what I was watching he does it all he really is well I could simply say one word to describe it wow well I can tell you right now I know Cooper very well and he is just as excited to have you over here calling his game as he is to have an opportunity to play here in this hosle environment shefin with a touch up against Cooper flag backing his way into the paints got the passway nice give there for Locker they need that size in the game they need that side they lost to South Carolina overtime he also will play 15 minutes got to keep him in the game at all costs Proctor jumping in the paint back out for kiple and got it from threepoint L hes been unbelievable came from Wisconsin played at Wisconsin newon there were 30 and0 whole family mother everybody plays basketball he supposed to have really some great brothers too absolutely coach how about the Freshman already responding on the road theyve been tested one of three teams in America that are undefeated in Road play this year yeah along with I believe Texas Tech and Houston yes and with we Im have not lost the G yeah perfect 7 and0 for the Duke Blue Devil shot clock is down to three in the paint lock in and a whistle with 27 on the shot clock and there is Brad Brunell in year number 15 283 wins for Clemson number one in their program history theyre winning his coach and he signed a contract extension through 2029 well I tolded him before again this is dick you have to bring that up I said Gee coach I look at your five losses you lost three in overtime thinking where you would be with a little L he said thanks for reminding Laughter me I thought everyone was delighted you were back Dicky B if anyone else did that wed get kicked out of his office youre the only one that can bring that up thats for sure Zachary Airborne for the jumper and knocks it down maybe to win here tonight Zachary has to have a big game he did not have a big game against Georgia Tech struggle hes very physical he has good ability to score and he can also great defensively canle 37 beyond the three gives it up for Proctor hell call a play malawat took a an amazing passing team and thats going to rattle in by canle I tell you what a year he has had you know we talk about certainly and the we talk about Cooper but what a year this kid kles had close calls thereve been a bunch of them here for the CLS and tigers as they strike underneath four overtimes dick and they have lost three of those what a difference that would make just to pick off a couple of those absolutely unreal they Comm in a 10 and two in the Applause conference proor to make a move and thatll go the other way that thatll go against Duke Blue Devils off to a 128 Mr sh well he was talking us earlier today about the first time he realized he was completely legit High School senior at home at Illinois on the couch watching a college basketball game that you were doing you called him a diaper Dandy he said thats when I knew I was for real he told us that today yeah amazing he was for real so was the guy next to me Cory Alexander hey my story is very similar locking locking in hes got four he looks pretty good in that post yeah he really does and we can see how Clemson wants to attack Duke in the post especially with the young bigs and Cooper flag and common malawat they want to force those guys to have to defend them on the interior fouled off the ball here by the way flag is not even attempted a shot and that foul will be on Wiggins of Clemson chony Wiggins his first hes a little bit under the weather they say he is got a little bit of the flu and but a lot of the teams dick that were covering these days its going around theyve got three four guys who are sick John shy missed a game because he was really sick with the flu earlier this season they miss Gillis right now because he can shoot the ball hes out with the flu thats correct Macy Gillis out sick shot clock down to eight kiple on the drive off the fake and it wont roll in the tip is controlled by shepher and taken right back by Duke flag had Hunter on his hip he gives it up for canle to the Baseline what a nice pass and up and in for two by Malik Brown tell you Cory they do an amazing job sharing the basketball always looking for the open guy they seem to love playing with each other they really do coach and when you consider they average 17 assists per game you got a number of guys who can make plays off the bounce and make plays for their teammates as well Chase Hunter trying to get going coming in averaging 18 and hell hit it and dra the foul thats a big three baby they needed that they could have use one of those against Georgia Tech late in the game he had 28 but didnt come through near the end of the game but he certainly kept him in the game Chase Hunter going to the midrange and probably even more to the light of this little John crra picking up the first foul on Cooper flag defending that but Chase Hunter now in his sixth year here in Clemson looking for a statement win in his are we we we call this a super senior year hey Ill tell you this though the kids a winner he right now rates number one in the history of Clemson basketball as the winningest player hes won over 101 games as a player and as we mentioned his six year he did sit out completely one year so he did not have 32 opportunities that that year kle out of the double trying to get it downstairs intended for brown but it never got there zacher gives it up for Hunter Hunter 28 against jsia Tech earlier this week hes tied up in the play and a possession arrow will take it to the other end so 1404 to go here in the first half and Duke will have the ball up by two tell you one thing people got to remember this they last year lost won a real heartbreaking loss at Duke and they beat him here but he played me two years ago at home so Clemson has been tough against St and Clemsons extremely tough in this building beat Kentucky earlier this year a top five win and theyre looking for another one here tonight kles saw the opening went in strong for the bucket d w querry i watch his ability he can beat you with the three he can beat you on the drive and he plays with such competitive desire he absolutely does coach and when you consider you couple that shooting alongside a playmaker like Cooper flag youve got a dynamic duo of diaper dandies on the outside well let me tell you this Cooper flag is more than a diaper Dandy hes a PTP solid goal baby like you were in Virginia Applause well thank you very much this is the ACC on ESPN were inside Little John Coliseum to see the Clemson Tigers try to snap number two Dukes 16 game winning streak great to have you with us on an ESPN Sonic Blockbuster and none other than dick byal right with us court side Dave OBrien and Cory Alexander I cant tell you how great that feels to say that out loud that Dicky V is back after two years and you sound like you were never away I appreciate that Dave thats why youre one of my favorite baseball guys as well with the Red Sox Hunter with a Miss Chase Hunter averaging 18 a game leading the way for the Tigers its Duke on top 16 to 12 a packed house here now the seat to be had Cooper flag spinning inside for two his first basket shows his versatility thats the first shot hes taking in the game his first score hes so unselfish hes all about winning in the team he to me if he wanted to be selfish he could 30 every night he absolutely would and Dick Fel we talk about how cerebral Cooper flag is he waited until we got on ESPN before he took a shot he didnt want to get a bucket on news he wanted to get over here on the flagship now I know why you went to Virginia youre a smart dude man hes smart this guy our Sonic Blockbuster underway tyres Proctor with a drive for two Applause bouncing it downstairs for sheelin the 68 senior that is a big body hes toughed to move but what weve seen throughout this game Clemsons doing it in the paint with twos Duke is doing it on the perimeter with threes thats the reason why theyve been able to build a sixpoint lead Ill tell you one thing shefley he is a tough hard noosed player he plays with a tremendous amount of energy all the time flag dumping it downstairs knocked away the quick hands of hi breeder and he got in there and knocked it free he can shoot the ball he can shoot the ball if he gets open looks he suddenly can shoot the three yeah hes 46 and knocked away and scooped up by Proctor its going to be five early turnovers here for Clemson and its going to be an add one as Proctor continues to be very active hes really been a goto man early he really has had that week January 7 and Cory you and I had that Sensational dunk he had against pit the very same week where he scored 42 against Notre Dame so he had just recently turned 18 years old and then he just exploded that particular week didnt he he absolutely has and once he turned 18 hes been a completely different player after Christmas got home got in the gym with his father able to get some shots up build that confidence and coming back with the jumper renewed hes been a different guy since turning 18 Del Jones freshman taking the Baseline got that pass free to Zachary with a shot clock starting to wind down hell hit Music it Zachary one of the top ball Hawkers in the ACC you got to have your A game if you dont have your A game against Duke you got no chance no chance because they Excel defensively theyre in every game because their team defense keeps them in the game and when their offense his lights out I think Duke is playing to be the number one team in the country tonight as flag misses in close because Auburn has lost to Florida thats a final and if Duke is able to get a win and move to number one theyre going to have to match the physicality of the Clemson Tigers youve got a veteran group they want to be physical with Cooper flag theyve seen other teams try to do it and take him out of the game early trying to do it but again very few have been successful in limiting his action it has not stopped him at all hes top in four different categories in the ACC would to be scoring rebounding hes in the top 10 in four major games Dylan Hunter got a lot of iron but that shot goes down 2318 as Clemson continues to hang tough getting to the Midway point of the first half Clemson actually playing well Clemson is playing well they really are coach theyre playing great great theyre 9 of 12 from the field the problem is they have five turnovers start the game off with two straight backto back turnovers Proctor tied up and The Possession now will go to the other end 950 to go in the half give you a look at our Sonic Blockbuster comparison were talking about two guys one a 18yearold freshman another 23 24 year old sixe senior when you look at what Chase Hunter and Cooper flag are doing but both most likely First Team all ACC performance coach and no question Ill tell you this you that was Cooper flag he turned he turned 18 December 21st this kid should be in high school can you imagine him playing High School Clemson starting to heat up and it made for great shots hes played well for that Victor has been King Victor tonight hes been King Victor today sevenfooter from Russia who actually wants to be a standup comic maybe when hes done playing basketball Victor lockin he would not give us any of his best material he said were playing Duke today forget about it but maybe one day a foul here with 9917 to go in the Applause half and locket will pick up hes facilitating hes doing on the defensive end of the floor youve seen them all whos similar to Cooper but let me just say this I already told our producer Kim belon knows basketball theres only three players and my 4 5 years that Ive seen in person that match the skills that he has at that such a young age and Im not saying hes going to be one of these three but Im talking about who I seen in person I seen in person Kobe Bry I did one of his games I seen in person LeBron James did his first game hes played and I saw and I lost the battle I saw imic Chon I dont know how many times tried to recruit him but I had no shot the me I say he really but he look at the future holds Im talking about an 18 Evans up top for canle took on top by five kiple really active in this opening half especially dishing the basketball and a whistle as he got it inside to the big malawat you know we havent mentioned his name at all malawat is unbelievable potential hes only played basketball for four years hes a rim Jack dir he has so much enthusiasm when he plays defense I watch him hedge step out its like you cant believe the way he comes out with that unbelievable spirit and energy hes got a great great future at the line to shoot at 77 and coming up at 830 on ESPN third ranked Alabama in ffil squaring off against Arkansas we C the night with number 20 Arizona hosting number 13 Texas Tech in our West Coast Prime Time game at 1030 Texas Tech on the road one of three unbeaten teams in Road games this year alongside our Duke Blue Devils as well as the Houston Cougars led by Coach Kelvin Samson the two best teams Ive seen this year Watching a lot of basketball sitting home defensively are Houston Kelvin Samsons team and Duke I really think theyre the two best defensive teams Ive seen all year Duke by the way with a field goal in about three minutes Zachary played at Boston College first shot wont drop for Reeds hes 72 hes a Duke kid he was had Duke he had seven rebounds the other night limited time doesnt have a lot of minutes James with a kick out another long one knocked down by Proctor who has been out standing in the first half yeah hes been also really good all year he went through a little slide for a while in the middle of the year but he started off the year he was brilliant hes made the rotation and you combo guard of Virginia so you know they feeling last year he was like a point guard now hes playing the two spot hes absolutely playing great basketball so difficult Dave it is the kind of treatment Ive been get from all the people it just tears my heart well youre home man youre home again this is where you belong right here on the drive off the window and a very strong move there by Dell Jones they really like the Freshman they really do and his ability to get downhill attacking the basket but more importantly finishing overlength and size in the painted area that was a nice athletic play by him he really made a strong drive for the basket goodle will fire one up there and that misses no whistle no whistle nope no whistle he should be on the free throw Applause line wow Coach K was on that side That official would hear about it I guarantee I know Coach K his beautiful wife Micks watching he sent me a test text today appreciate your JS coach but I know one thing he wouldnt tolerate that Cory hed be up like you cant believe now believe me in the two years youve been away theyre still calling fouls we have had a couple of nights with been like 80 foul shots taken Dicky V theres word on the street that you lost a recruiting battle to Coach K with your granddaughters is that not thats correct isnt it yep I was trying to recruit my grins to go to Notre name for tennis the twins Conor and Jake and theyre at Duke they went on a visit to Duke and Coach K in a half an hour conversation Ive been surey group the kids some run a for three years blocking with eight flag and a whistle and a travel so Duke turns it over its been kind of a rough first half here for Cooper flag and they turned turned it over five times Duke against Syracuse this week turned it over six times in 40 minutes well sys going through a real struggle right now sure are and Duke was clinical in taking him apart 620 to go in the half here at Clemson poked away and locking with a reach and a foul trying to slow up the fast break there so hell pick up the personal and thats going to be two on Victor Lock and thats one of the things you talked about Coach thats a play that he has to understand just to give up on that play get back and play defense not pick up that second foul because hes too valuable to a team needs to stay on the floor well youre right about that Cory his size is so needed theyre not a big team they need them on the floor the bench really doesnt have the kind of size and ready to play I think event will get some minutes out of Reeves but they feel hes a little limited now offensively Duke with a 16 game winning streak longest in the nation they longest since they ripped off 17 in a row in 056 kiple Brown will swing it for James who can hit that threepointer flag lot of contact round it out the tip wont dropped by James another with a crossover l it what a beautiful drive very very rarely do you see that against do he went to the L nobody rotated over radiation therapies chemotherapies multiple surgeries and did not speak for 8 months I know Lorraine loved that but nobody else did she got finally a worded here Proctor at a big half with 11 flag rolling draws the double kles the open shooter and knocks it down to three he is so good offensively Ill tell you one thing kiple is the real deal man he really came on strong and impressed everybody during the summer when they had their workouts I they knew he was good but they didnt know he was that good looking for an answer and Jones does from threepoint L the first threepoint field goal made for the Clemson Tigers they come in averaging over nine a game and shoot over 38 and now one of three while the Blue Devils are five of seven its been a weapon for Duke in this game tell you one thing theyre not intimidated by Duke they feel they is look at that H look at that Huston thats unbelievable dou sweede should get that guy on the football field FL will pull up and pop and continues to have a frustrating half hes one for four so Ron gr is going to go over and theyre going to talk about toughness I mean unreal look watch this here look at that look at that Hard look at that there hustle scrapping do they want it I will tell you this theyre not intimidated because they know they felt they should have beaten Duke last year at Cameron it was a last second I think proor made two foul shots and beat him by one and they beat him here two years ago so thats a veteran team right now with them look at that Dicky V after the slide for the loose ball watch kiple and does he trip D Zachary this is what theyre going over to review right now Ron gr looking for the replay oh yeah and to see if were going to have a flagrant foul on that possession Ron gr did a great job of allowing The Possession to go on but he knew once the dead ball happened he were going to go over and look at it and he signal that as soon as they got a stop in play yeah there was no common foul called on the play theyre at the monitor I think theyre going to go if I have to say it I got one eye not two like you guys I think its flagrant one I I believe so I think you have to call a flavor one onor one I really do and Ron heading over there to John shy and they are going to call it a flagrant one so two shots in the ball and yeah theyre going to go FL we know hes one of the best in the league when it comes to getting his hand on basketball coming up with Steals and providing that defensive energy to give his team a boost here as you look at the run that Clemson is on right now a 9 to3 run in the Tigers favor then from Boston College excellent foul shooter 86 Im going to put you on a spot here Cory what are your feelings about the transfer Porter and the nil I think that the nil is great and Im indifferent with the transfer portal but the combination of the two at the same time has been detrimental to college basketball I believe we got to find a way to figure out a better balance of being able to have the two a part of our game shot clock at five Hunter got it off shef with a touch shock clock expiring and never did get it off in time so turned over to Applause Duke so a twopoint game start your Super Bowl Sunday with three great womens basketball matchups Stanford Louisville theyre at noon on ESPN 2 and number two South Carolina number four Texas and at 400 Eastern number six LSU hosting number 19 Tennessee coming off a big win that one banked in by James and a big win over Connecticut very rare lately that used to be such a battle Pat Sumit and goo or first time Ive ever entered a building for a shoot around and got booed because the tiger fans are ready to Roar but he said I knew I was legit the moment Dicky B said on TV when I was a high school senior that I am a diaper Dandy he said that he was 8 ft tall by that point he became an absolute Superstar PTP he was tremendous Pro to the National Title another one hes having a heck of a day yeah 13 he really is and its important for him to have games like this especially on the road did the same thing at Boston College OB when we watched them there and a hostile in en Cooper flag coming as close as he can to home and tyres Proctor showed up big time for them on that one as well Old State of Maine was there at Boston College to see Cooper flag the 69 freshman from Newport Maine 322 to go you look at Dukes bench is so deep when they can go to that bench that kids like fora I thought fora was going to be the Super this year cuz he was really good last year but he lost the starting job but hes still on that bench I mean they got guys like him they got guys on the bench I mean the transfer portal guys they dont have Gillis here today but Brown from Syracuse a dynamite defensive player I mean theyre a deep team they really are a deep team and the tallest team in America and the most talented team in America with auburn going down today at home to Florida at 90 to 81 Duke with an opportunity now to be the number one team if theyre able to pull off a win in this hostile environment until today the only team Dicky that had beaten Auburn of course they beat them ceron indor that was their one loss until today and off the back of the iron Reeves with a big board he hits the deck and a whistle Brad Brad was telling me before the game you alluded to concerned about Dukes size one of the biggest teams in college basketball but really what impresses me about Duke Ken pal does a great job with his ratings Duke is the only team in America the only team that is ranked in the top four offensive efficiency and defensive efficiency and I believe what sets them apart is what they do defensively the the size we talk about the length as Caleb Foster enters the game at 65 Caleb Foster is the shortest player that they play in their rotation and when you consider they can switch everything if they force you to throw it inside to a mismatch the worst thing that can happen is if you give up a tough two theyll live with that in comparison to giving up three the only gu he probably can switch would be the big guy Mal malow watch oh he does a great job switching they dont switch much with Patrick gumber but outside of that they will switch with malat as well Mason Gillis out of the line today he of a night proor again oh the veteran player stepping up big man stepping up big he just looks great shooting the ball for the record I got to give you a shout out for pronouncing milawat correctly in game one it took most of us a half season to be able to get that right dicki V please dont tell him that hell be insufferable please 245 to go before the break got a mismatch inside you got to get the ball to sheff got to get the ball to sheff on a short Reeves gathers the rebound hes a big body under there and draws another foul John Sher told me before the game he said that the K re formerly a Duke he said todays climate kids dont want to wait kids dont want to wait they want to play as soon as youre sitting at that Pine it is transfer time to go but one of the things that John Shaw has done a tremendous job of is keeping in constant communication with his players throughout the season its almost a daily thing where they have to talk to each other to keep everyone confident with their opportunities a over on acc Network Wednesdays double header starts with Stanford and Georgia Tech thats at 7 eastern time and then CA flag and the Blue Devils hosting Cal at Cameron indor so Ill be at Cal Wednesday with your good friend and Buddy Jim beheim on the call with us Jimmy Applause B got that Clemson a very good foul shooting team 78 for the year keep that in mind if its right down to the end here 3933 Duke oh they suo over 81 in ACC play so theyve gotten better as The Seasons gone along Clemson forcing the turnover shefin with a dribble down gave up the dribble Hy Breer very dangerous beyond the threepoint line inside re wants the ball Reeves out of the Double Bs it in great job great job by Clemson recognizing that and also re says Hey BR remember me I used to play a d this is for you trying to guard Applause me lets see if flag its heated up right before halftime Proctor has been scalding hot for Duke Cooper has been very passive in this first half hes been very passive Proctor again that one off the front iron tigers with a chance to get a little bit closer Chase Hunter their top scorer with it here got the same mismatch dick youv Caleb Foster trying to guard Christian Reeves on the post Zachary with a dribble ball reefs wants the ball throw it up go shes going to have to clear out to give him space to be able to operate and a whistle that will go the other way with six on the shot clock in a minute 17 okay so now whose fault is that you were coaching way back in the 70s thats the big guys fault or is that the guards fault for leaving too early well Im always going to go with the little guy I like the way you think I I dont like the goliaths all the time I like the little Davids same when they pick these teams you got a team like for example Drake people better take a look at Drake they better be in that field if they dont win their conference Championship they belong in but no the big guys get 10 different chances to get in on the drive he left it short Foster had a couple of cracks at it under a minute here Clemson stolen away by Cooper flag and flag ahead of the field slams it with two hands I got a feel hes going to break out the second half we weve seen that from him often throughout this year the MC State game he only had five first half points and then explod for 23 in the second half so Cooper normally saves his best its the difference in the game right now its really been the difference and when you consider the way the Blue Devils have shot the three 6 for 10 where the Tigers only one of three from Beyond The Arc thats been the separator for the Blue Devils thats been a big difference big difference you dont have to go to Harvard to figure it out when you make a difference in that situation thats five more three points got a good look thats his shot loose ball and Duke Gathering that and theyre going to take a timeout with Applause 208 John Shire really has assistant coach they were really they going to beat the national championship by Connecticut Richard Hamilton other than that you dont remember much about it its amazing your recall his Proctors had a gigantic half doubled up knock free from him hes got to get a shot in the air and its not going to happen thats how the first half ends with Duke on top 4135 great defensive stand by the Crimson T Buster matchup here in Clemson South Carolina sold out not a seat to be had theres only been three teams that out scored Duke in the paint tonight Clemson has done that flag on the attack right away a missfire and a whistle and a foul right on the edge of the lane in the opening seconds here Proctor with 16 kiple with 11 but Clemson among the many things theyve done well theyre shooting 68 in this game 14 of 18 on twopoint attempts 14 of 18 I mean you go to Common elomin you put two in the 14 s two and the 18 you got nine thats one heck of a percentage that goes back you being a math teacher back in the day when you took your first High School coaching job you were coaching the math class as well me and I watch the 30 for 30 great F oh which which by the way I loved everybody loved that absolutely the documentary that was tremendous he really got some really tremendous release on a shot proor he gets great form squares his body well follow through good rotation losing his footing thats Dylan Hunter trying to scoop that on the line itll be back over to the Tigers hed like to have a turnover back that he had the end of the game with with George he turn the ball over and he very rarely turns the ball over hes got a great assist the turnover ratio in the 90 game hes played it is number one at Clemson but theyd like to have that turnover back love to have it back grab ronell of course trust Chase Hunter so much with the ball as we get to the end of the shot clock Zachary with the drive he got the layup but it wouldnt fall and heres Cooper flag in the offensive zone after a very quiet first half they were quite physical with number two and still are a bump there off the window no bat with a little hook that wont drop big fight for the rebound and Clemson comes away with that Dylan Hunter but you can see right there Dave that Cooper is really much more assertive right now sheflin to the paint draws a lot of blue shirts got it up there no and its going to be tipped out off Duke I think this has been a very well afficiated game when you consider how they allowing guys to be physical yet not continuing to blow the whistle giving both guys a very consistent both teams an opportunity to be able to play in the paint well really thats great the way youre praising the officials I like that we hear Too Much criticism of those guys they didnt bring me a c before the game they made sure they did that for you since youve been away dick hes really changed he really has Im not sure its put better blocking inside very well done for two he has 10 and as my research has been at home Jeff he says in the lane they have been Dynamite when you talk about Clon black thought about the triple shefflin really played him tough hell let it fly no hes not to for eight shooting well hes 0 for three in the second half but hes asserted himself and I like seeing that oh Brad Brownell is really fired up on that sideline lock in body to body up against flag still working hard and thats going to go down count that great second effort great second effort look at the emotion look at emotion he says coach Im going to play this game Im going to play 15 minutes like I did against South Carolina like I did against Georgia Tech games we lost in overtime he only played 15 minutes foul trouble and then of course you see not only his ability to score through traffic but to be able to go underneath the arm of the shot blocker and malawat locked in is absolutely locked in here in this second half boy I like the way you demonstrated that next to me you made like a big guys he used to dream used to dream I wish I was a little bigger I think he did pretty well I used to dream that I got to play in front of Dicky V and him talking about me as a PCP and talking about us being a prime time baby well block it with 13 and a threepoint game nice CL and the stuff by Proctor how about the execution by the Blue Devils every time time Clemson gets the energy going here on their home floor Duke responds with a bucket in the paint thats why youre number two in the nation hoping to be number one leaving this building Proctor with 20 that ties his season High also did that at Boston College Zachary in a Music kick great execution and when you see so much attention being paid to KH canle no one thinking about tyres proor who gets a great look on the interior with the dunk and of course Isaiah slim Evans just shushing the crowd well I tell you this been a great shot moving without the ball a lost art too many guys dont move well without the ball block it going strong lays it in again Im saying I watched the whole game against GE attch stayed up late where is he where was he where was he but hes here tonight in a big way for Clemson to make this a threepoint game with 1645 remaining look at the big guy work and you can see an emphasis from Brad Brownell to get the basketball inside they started the game off wanting to attack the young bigs for Duke and Lockton continues to attack the basket as chy Wiggins responds getting the crowd even more involved in the game I think they really got to him how important he is to them and he came here with a mindset Im going to yeah flag with the left hand nothing falling but the Duke star not much hes had a rough go of it they got a body on him every minute Chase Hunter and a scrap for that and a whistle 1623 to go flag held to Four Points two for nine shooting weve seen the Clemson Tigers a attempt to be physical with Cooper flag theyve contested every drive just showing hands making everything tough for him once he gets around the rim Ill tell you this no matter who you are you are a outstanding Playman no matter who you are talking about any great Magic Michael any of those great players Larry bir their days sometime you just have really a tough night and thats whats happening right here with grer flag will grab the loose ball and the foul be committed by Dell Jones Jones kind of a silly foul deep in the back court and by the way a little bit of foul trouble for one Duke player at this point seion James picked up his third a moment ago Jones with number one for Clemson and you have to remember no Mason Gillis in this game for Duke who saved them in that win on the road at Wake Forest he stop stepped up with three big threes late in that game so some of that experience not available for the Blue Devils here today yeah hes out sick did not travel for this one brown gives it up for flag Proctor a 20point game so far B speed for James and hell draw the foul by chy Wiggins nice pass by Proctor look like hes heading for a turnover but he kept with the ball and a nice pass and had 12 steals in the game this is a different matter here at CL tonight that one knocked down by James who makes 79 tell John sh told me before a game that hes been a different maker not so much scoring points Distributing the basketball defensively doing all the things physical James has been a great great pickup came from Tain I believe right he really has and when you consider his leadership ability and such a strong guard he allows Duke to be able to switch one through five because if you have him on a post player he can hold his ground in there makes Duke so versati yeah he can because hes so strong physically he can play a number of people the store of stars does for in a game has to be certainly Proctor Proctors been a Difference Maker Cooper flag just picked up his second Zachary handing off for Applause lockin Zachary they want locking to touch it every time now shot clock the factor its at six another bucket for the big he took right there Cooper defensively he took him oneonone he was determined to score he has been absolutely Sensational today I got to believe this is one of his best games for him to stay on the floor as weve got another foul believe theyre going to get Jaden Zachary and knocking James down here with 1503 to go he is slow to rise I got a question I got a question now right here hes trying to think of one1 he wants to think of one i1 he goes and he did he really got to get the kid going to tip the hat to him my question is this if Duke its a word thats so big if but if Dukes winning streak of 16 comes to an end tonight whos number one in the country Auburn got be they get beat at two whos number one to be completely honest being that Florida is rank number six in the country Im not sure that alurn comes off the number one spot it could still be the alurn Tigers simply because Im not sure whos at three right now Jones got an open look that wont drop and kiple with the rebound but were certain that Duke and Auburn have been the best two teams in the country all season long so with the winning streaks if they do come to an end still have an opportunity to stay in the top I think K nipple has a different Theory at this I think hes thinking number one OB as he drills along three I think Duke sply saying dont even ask that question this its not going to be really a factor at all I think could can he shoot the ball or what squares his body plays hard but Dicky V how about the fact that Cooper flag isnt having a great game but yet the Blue Devil is still with a threepoint lead here on the road in a Hos envirment that speaks to The Testament of how good this Duke team is overall theres no question Duke has more than this Cooper flag Cooper flag is unique hes a special talent hes heading for greatness in the NBA but all these other guys were Big Time Players out of high school they were not just some Johnny from L they were players lock and will knock that out of play so itll be Duke basketball and Patrick GBA the 611 freshman will come on to the floor now for John shy you know I I really believe this I think to have super success theres a formul I believe in it starts with Talent Plus coaching plus incredible desire to play both defense execute offensively you do that youre going to win and thats why they win done a great job as a coach brown with a miss and another whistle in the paint so look at that AP top 10 as mentioned Auburn was beaten earlier today by number six Florida so they record their second loss of the Year Duke had been the only team to beat them so far this season at Cameron indor thats right after Auburn won at Maui and Alabama at three with a matchup tonight that we could see them possibly if as you mentioned the big word if Duke is unable to get a win here on the road could possibly be that number one team you know Tennesse had a big win today and Tennessees been really playing welln well lately so they can make a case for them its going to be interesting but I dont think its GNA be a factor until we get down you know Dukes up right now three still 13 minutes to go now canle in some foul trouble now with Music three flag about to come back on the floor now hes two for 10 shot clock all the way down to 34 before the tie up possession arrow will keep it here on this end of the floor and here comes Cooper flag see why I dont why I hate that rule alter they made a great defensive play and they get penalized you have some stupid Ru you look at an arrow does the arrow dive on the floor did the arrow make the play The Arrow did nothing and the arrow wins thats ridiculous your passion has not dimmed my man welcome back theres the arrow that did absolutely nothing the arrow actually did change size well give the arrow that credit from going from right to left 136 left guys I want to just say this really Im having a blast being both of you you really treated me so well here today and its more than I ever ever expected really it is so great to have you back and to hear the sound of your voice and to hear you in such good voice as well your passion is always there it always has you love this game so much this is where you belong and for us it is such an honor I got to tell you its not just to H honor Vicky V but you also we get to do this because of you you started this my man and you are the reason we get to be here celebrating Ian shefin knocking down a huge three to tie this game at Little John this Clemson de doesnt look like theyre going away Cross Court heres Proctor now this is the first time this game has been Applause tied by to get off a shot short with that rebound tip controled by sheff hes one tough kick that kid sheff can play for me any day of the week he plays with a lot of heart a lot of energy Chase Hunter driving L it in oh baby oh the cling F and going wild he D with the house where Davos is he in the house cheer CL with their first lead of the game Cooper wants the mo Cooper wants the ball he got foul he got pounded hes bleeding guys hes checking for blood on the lip and shefin confident stepping up knocking down a huge three ball and once they win over the Blue Devils the last time he will play them here trying to get oh what a shot right there post area takes a shot from Chase Hunter but one thing I can tell you Dicky B and youve seen it as well the more physical you get with the Cooper flag the more he responds now hes seeing his own blood look out Clemson Tigers pipple Slams on the brakes Little Fall Away no they doing a good job rebounding tonight we heard by CL they got outrebound their last game and that triple overtime loss 24 offensive rebounds by Georgia tuck not of Myers kids by the way did a great job they beat Louisville that week and they beat Clemson shot clock at five and tipped out of play by Malik Brown at 44 on the shot clock will take the timeout as well the Clemson Tiger and its a big big ACC game its still a big game but the point being I thought theyd be down I think Duke would a pound especially the way Duke started the first five four minutes here but the bottom line is you got to tip the hat and salute the Clemson Tigers for the way they battle to battle tigers with 44 and the shot clock out of the timeout flag interrupts the pass and out it rolls and the shot clock continued to run so I think thats why roon gr is about to head over to that monitor it went down to 16 Brad brell right on top of it pointing to the shot clock see makes eye contact with Ron gr making sure that they go check that out and get it correct you know its my first game back and I want to be a nice guy but watching games at home I became so frustrated watching a number of times go into that monitor and its not the referees fault not at all theyre only going by what the book says what you got to do the people that make the rules got to sit down and make a little adjustment in the number of times you can go through that monitor theyre going to reset both the game clock and the shot clock shot clock at three and the tiger still with the basketball second half Clemson has outscored Duke 16 to8 Victor locken by himself has outscored the Duke Blue Devils Music 98 and so the Tigers to put it stand right in front of their own bench you know some other players like him because you get a little break a little like a timeout but you know down de breaks up the flow of the game got that off but it never got to the iron the shot by Chase Hunter he has really not had a big game hes only got six points and hes a big time scorer hes got to step up now late in this game if you want to finish the deal and get that win your stars have to elevate their game James on the drive went for the dunk he didnt get it and a whistle will go the other way and Obie as much as weve seen Duke this year especially on the road in moments like this this is normally where they respond seon James attacking the basket strong unable to get the Finish to go down and Malik Brown with a great idea to throw it the Cooper flag however unable to execute it and giving the basketball back to Clemson with an opportunity to increase their lead and its normally where U flag really steps up in these kind of moments and takes over again Target it again but not this time he did it get Cy State they were on the ropes he had a great second half against not D had really struggled in that game he goes from 42 still 10 minutes to go count him out thats big thats big are we going to have upset city are we going to have upset City they were only Sixpoint underd by the way they were only Sixpoint underw cson this a good cumson team yes this a good Clemson team doing a lot of things well theyve done a bunch of them today heres James with a shot that three wont fall and another thing the Tigers have momentum yeah they got Uncle Mo youre right Dave youre right they got Uncle Mo on their side they got a great crowd too students have been terrific today in a whistle 1006 to go duke has gone about 4 and A2 minutes without a point and the one thing that Duke has to always face and you as an athlete you get to know this qu you played for 70 years in the NBA All American in Virginia as an athlete you have to understand and the Duke players have to understand they get everybodys best hit everybody plays at a higher level than normal when they see the do Jersey absolutely means more when you see Duke on the front of the jersey and it means even more when youve got Dicky V on his return back in the building and were seeing the Tigers best effort because of that Dylan hun with a Miss but a foul on the deck youre trying to be nice to me they can care let Im sitting there qu side Dicky V I can tell you right now you talked about me being a former athlete as we see this is a game of inches Malik Brown almost got his hand on that basketball but it ends up being a JayZ Bucket look how close it is thats almost a deflection instead it turns into a three for JayZ and allows Clemson to build a fivepoint game but you gave me the credit for being a former athlete Im telling you now it matters to these young men that you are sitting here today they grew up watching you call this game and are looking forward their first chance to being able to play in front of you are you can you mean agent I want you call Mr pataro of ESPN and give me a new deal by the way canle to the bench is fourth foul for Duke Shea with a little reverse underneath its tipped up an in Big Mo indeed is wearing orange right now he scious the five minutes without a point we talked about it early only three teams in the country undefeated on a road Texas Tech and Houston as well Evans catches fires but hes on the line and they turn it over coach vatal you told me in the timeout Duke needs some shooting get Evans into the game John Shyer must have heard you or you guys are thinking along the same lines great action to get Evans a look however stepping on out of bounds line a turnover for the Blue Devils and now the tigers with the opportunity to boost their lead tell you one thing the kid Evans can shoot the ball he can shoot the ball oh nice Cut without the ball oh you got to make that you got to make that yeah hes made everything else oh you got to put that baby down wide open our producer would have made that Kim belon with a bad leg he was a great great player now hes a tackle football flag with a give not a kick out heres Evans on the other side and hell switch it in fivepoint swing Dicky B you miss a layup on one in of the floor it turns out to be a three on the other end just like thats a fourpoint game big swing lets see if that gets Duke momentum going back in their favor blocking thought about it he does have the green light from three big Scramble for Applause it Evans can really shoot the thr Evans can shoot the basketball and if you dont believe me as you see Evans right there go to the Auburn game they do not beat aurn in the first half they on the ropes and Bruce Pells kids didnt guard him like they should have he knocked down 6 three point shots in a half Evans that was worth white their number one but they wouldnt win that game he had 10 points for the blue deves on the road at Syracuse as locking checks out of the game but Isaiah Evans is extremely confident and one thing for certain he is going to let it fly he is in the game to put points on the board and you can see now he has got his momentum going in his favor individually and looking to get this blue devs right back into this game well the 10 really Curry against Syracuse was a blowout game this this these last two baskets were big were needed they really sto that run by Clemson unbelievable 5652 Clemson and the basketball Cooper flag second half just looked it up hes 0 for six you just wait for him to break out he normally relishes these kind of moments Jones around the back gets a shot away Evans went for the rebound taken away by Chase hunter that Mis dun could be big in this game could be that was a big time momentum Builder Hunter tiptoeing in off for Reeves flag wrestled it free and thats a turnover on the carry call right there these refs have done a hell of a job they really have but I love John shy after the turnover immediately sticking out his hand giving Tyres a quick five letting him know its okay because he loves the effort that his team is playing with on the defensive end of the floor Cooper flag coming up with the steel proing with the turnover but a dead ball turnover does not allow Clemson the opportunity to score you know your basetball Hey listen I grew up watching you talk about basketball since 1979 Ive learned a thing or two from you my man Im making you my PR agent Cooper Flags is two for 11 Zachary with a pullup and round it out flag with a board Sho much more line drive going to get more of an arc on that shot under eight minutes to go and he right now Coopers going to make a play hes going to make a play we give them such a big lift he wont shoot it Evans will and that one clangs away a big scrap for it again in the corner see thats the danger that was not a good shot he was being pressured big time you got to understand shot Applause selection more and a plus seven rebound against D Kansas was plus six against them right now Clemson is plus 11 on the boards against s and the similarity between Kansas and Clemson the physicality that they brought to the Game Hunter with the pass in the paint and a whistle and coming up at 830 on ESPN third ranked Alabama in fedil squaring off against Arkansas dont you think Alabama is watching this one very closely and we cap the night number 20 Arizona hosting number 13 Texas Tech thats our West Coast game might feel if Alabama goes beats Arkansas right now one two great games beat Kentucky and they beat Texas on the road my feeling is If Alabama wins that game and Duke loses Alabama deserves number one because the SEC is so tough that conference every game is unbelievable with the talent of That League it absolutely is and talk with Bruce Pearl last week Obie and I were had alurn at all missed even then he was talking about beating Alabama that big robbery matchup coming up soon so those two teams will play each other twice this year but I agree with you whole heartly if Duke does lose this game and Alabamas able to win on the road at Arkansas after the week they had I think they should be the number one team in the country uh I knew that youd listen to me Ive been listening to you for a long time my man Cooper Flag by the way three fouls shefflin at the line 76 and we repeat despite that Miss Clemson at the line lockin kept that ball alive to been ball out hes going to get going hes got to score Chase Hunter with a missfire but it thought it was another off offensive rebound however Dell Jones will pick up the foul two hands in the back but you talked about Chase Hunter shooting 43 from three in ACC hes the leading threepoint shooter in ACC basketball right now but unable to get going oh for from yond The Arc here the even over the top malat with a catch cant lay it in fights for his own Miss and draws a foul and all of a sudden lots of whistles here the last four or five minutes a lot of physical play going on court really a lot of physicality malat is going to be one heck of a player hes in a learning stage now you look at him hes not ready for the NBA but hes going to go because the dollars are going to be unbelievable a draft based on potential you cant blame the kid but Im tell you he has so much ahead of him in terms of learning hes got a pretty good stroke right there you watch him on the free throw line pretty good stroke does 77 coach he reminds me of a guy that I know you talked a lot about when he was a freshman at won and done at Kansas and Jo lmb and when you think about the ability to shoot the three ball you talk about a beid skill level malawat could be on that same path and trajectory as he moves into the NBA career hes got to get a little bit more hes got to Im sure they work with him every day obviously see a joke in terms of post moves and playing on the inside but hell learn that hell learn that but you remember embid that Kansas was pretty much a shot blocker he did defensively nice speed and cheing with the St but locking with the D what a nice high low great high low locking inside right there the shefflin I tell you shefflin moves well without the ball hes done a good job on flag too playing very physical yeah I mean hes D for basket hes D for a basket yeah had a 20 rebound game against Kentucky earlier this year as flag will draw the foul and hes pretty much been a nonfactor in this game yeah but you talk about post play coach V this is how you get the job done but how about Ian sheflin shielding the defender on his back first not allowing anyone to be able to get and then the pass delivered in right to the perfect spot for him to be the only one that could get it finishing it off with a strong attempt good job started off this year struggled a little bit on the free throw line but hes really elevated to that big talk 80 yeah hes up to 80 getting better and better only five points in the game but hes got six minutes to turn this thing around yeah you know one thing about Cooper flag and even though hes not scoring it hasnt stopped the rest of this game often times you see great players and big time scorers when theyre not scoring it affects the defense defensively that is not the case with Cooper the one thing about Cooper what he brings to the table LeBron did and those greatwoods magic and cobby they make every te they going to his own theyre going to his own he makes everybody better because they get better opportunities more spacing because the attention to him is so great Jones off the fake its an open look locken Taps it out High to Hunter its the second time hes done that in the last three possessions offensive rebounding in the favor 10 to6 for the Tigers theyve won the hustle plays the effort plays throughout this game Lockett will take the hit heres our NBA Saturday Prime Time game at ABC and ESPN plus a big Eastern conference match up between the Celtics and the Knicks our coverage beginning with NBA Countdown at 8 Eastern five Pacific oh Im so great there when you see Celtics really playing well well obviously the Nicks are really improved big time my guy Mark Jones who was with me last night for the Sixers at the Pistons on that call as well make sure to tell me to tell you hello throughout this day as I left him this morning wanted to make sure he sends his best wishes to you in your return I appreciate that hey yub Brown they going to have a farewell tomorrow I cant tell you how much learn from yub hes a jersey guy the Jersey Boys forell atab you Brown you know there it is you know whats coming you know whats coming he is special when the game is needed but how about him getting to see the free throw go through and how that opens things up for him on the perimeter that yub is so special I wish him the best 91 years of age he knows more basketball than any human being I ever got new for the record thats my Super Bowl tomorrow watching huie do his last game sheflin tried to dump it downstairs not how to play with seven on the shot clock we are tied at 59 and under five effective offensively today Hunter but theyve got to get Chase going downhill not settling for Threes And as the shot clock is at 7 seconds for the Tigers you like to see him attacking off the bouns if they can create space for him to be able to get to the rim so Dylan Hunter to put it in and his big brother Chase will certainly be a Target Brad on the court coaching man he is out there coaching his are he doesnt want another heartbreak he had it against you know Georgia Tech and the Monday night hes here when you guys are going to be here against North Carolina right theyre one and three in overtime games this year so theyve been bitten a couple times three times out of five losses in for Lockett shot clock to five lock into the paint Falls away hits it he has been impressive toight he has really been pressive nine of 12 for locking thats pretty good yeah thats thats 7 we know you are math teacher showing off your numbers out here block him with 19 James back to flag heres Proctor at a huge first half shot clock of factor down to four hell he it and he hits it wow hes been the guy hes been the guy for the Blue Devils all evening long and comes up with the biggest shot for them to give him a onepoint lead with four minutes remaining tell you one thing he is not afraid to take the big shot veteran player 23 points Zachary on the move swatted away by malawat whos playing with four fouls malawat unbelievable a rim protector came over took that drive right away so thou shall not enter thy leg tyes proor with the big response as kid trust me no child should go through what Ive gone through Im 85 man but no child should have to suffer we need more dollars for research you have raised almost hundred million thank you unbelievable heres Hunter on the move on flag the pullup he sticks it they needed that good me range shoer hes excels in that usually all year long I me hes been a sore of deluxe for that Jase with just eight points sck but a big one here and puts the Tigers back in the lead flag lot of contact and hooks it in how about the star showing up the big stars showing up you have Chase on one side and Cooper whos not all americ hes all World hes all world man shefin malow watch over to help sheflin on the back down Zachary on the attack off the window for two more those are tough shot you go Mal malawat came over and really almost adjusted his shot the tough shot by Zachary Zachary the veteran understanding how to go right to the wire man we make it right to the wire will Duke be undefeated will Duke be number one or will Clemson spoil a party pip balls off the front iron boy sheon is a tenacity unbelievable tenacity out of that kid Che lock and commanding the ball hell draw the foul at 233 on the clock you know you said it earlier da against Kentucky they be Kentucky on this floor and this when Kentucky beat six teams that were ranked in the top 15 in the country Mark pop at the time had the club really rolling shefflin in that game was the reason they want he had 20 rebounds 20 rebounds thats being a Windex man man thats working the wind next and a tough rebound on this end of the floor with malat all over him but thats one of the things that Clemsons done extremely well throughout this game theyve limited Duke to one shot on each possession the Blue Devils with only six offensive rebounds however Clemson double figures 11 offensive boards in this game they about rebounded dude and thats a rarity look at Brad look at Brad on the sideline he is walking straight hes making all gations thats coaches man I like sitting here you always win one guys going to leave here happy and one guys going to have a miserable Super Bowl made the by the way Eagles are going to beat the Eagles are going to beat the Chiefs Markley will be the difference locking 2113 in the second half watch off proor its been such a huge factor in this one right now right now BEC SC flag time whether its a pass or whether its a jump shot flag gets it up there and hits it a triple tied at 67 but flag after knocking down the three is screaming to K malat to get back and match up with Victor Lockton understanding the lockin has been a problem for everyone else in defend wants to make sure Marat gets back in that match up let me tell you something that was one tough three he made Dylan Hunter they dont want to be the n man they dont want to be Denine on a pass from his brother Tigers up three Dyan Hunter coming off a career high 38 minutes in that triple overtime game last time out Music trust flag another Hook off the window no whistle Mal keeps it alive Proctor an open look flag flies in and takes a knock there as he goes to the floor yeah the big big three here avoiding the shot blocker and locked and gets him in the air and then able to elevate knock down the three ball then a huge offensive rebound for the Blue Devils on the last possession that offensive rebound you talking about rebounding laterally and going after the ball he went literally for that b he was determined to get it and now he earned free throws hes elevated his SC the last four or five Applause minutes one and one hits the front end hes become a very good free motion look at our Stars tonight the Stars coming into the game certainly Chase hun with just eight Cooper flag five for 15 shooting it but hes at the line for another one were talking a few minutes ago and he had like Five Points game was on the line and became Cooper Flair Cooper flag time and misses the second and a whistle with 115 to go protection a big loss for the Blue Devils down the stretch you see I shein trying to keep the TM malawat off of his back but that left forearm shoving chef while hes in midair theyre going to call that every time especially when you dont come up with the rebound they continue to work on the caves of Cooper flag he works hes working pretty good now to be completely honest if Im Cooper I stay over by the Huddle and continue to get my Cavs worked on while the free throws are being shot seon James can handle the box out responsibility there but with the minute 15 remaining and of course the potential for overtime in this building is great so could be much more basketball for Cooper to play got to make those free throws man sheelin he was walking pretty good though I watch from walk up and down from the bench he really was very smooth but youve had cramps before you know it only takes that one step very warm in this tooy miss the too big too big free throws that could be a little fatigue right there hes playing so hard James on the drive back for flag Clemson by two one minute to go his flag launches and drains it are you serious are you serious how good a kid his age should be in high school wow just wow give him 18 despite all the problems with his legs here down the stretch 529 and Duke by one weve seen it all year long Cooper flat gives Duke whatever they need hes got to use his driving ability and for get the threepoint shot so here we go Applause 529 chase H coming around runs right into flag Dylan Hunter back to his brother Chase wants to move and F it in downhill baby downhill wow I got something right in my life I cant believe it he went downhill now come to defend now you know Mr flag is going to get the rock right here baby James yes sir give the number two Airborne pass here right back to James hell drive tough angle hes denied Clemson shut him down and Duke commits the foul with 215 Vicky V do you think Cooper was a little too passive on that possession I thought he should have kept it and tried to make a play on his own or to find one of his teammates yeah I really do I I think at times he he a little bit he wants to get everybody involved Victor lockin coming over with a huge block one of the best in the ACC as he gets that block but gets it off the glass and is able to be able to maintain possession miss two big free throws in the earlier possession an opportunity to give the Tigers a threepoint lead here with 215 remaining free throw line is Big shefflin missed two big ones he missed you got to make these free throws you want to win you want to leave with the win you want no moral Victory you dont want to leave say oh we played Duke tough that does he get you anything man blocking the senior from Russia 71 at the line uhoh and it spins out oh how close but that one miss even if he makes this one changes what you have to do if youre the Blue Devils now you can attack the basket try to get a score or even get foul get to the free throw line to tie the game so that Miss makes things much different for the blue Del was in their options well at least this one here if he makes if they go for a CH you got a tie game versus the win he misses that to get the win Tigers 7371 well shuffs going to be tested right here out tested Duke takes one let me just sh to think about the Miss shot being offensively rebounded you got to watch for the offensive rebound anag well you know he watchs it he going downhill black Mak a move slip ball and it travels and turns it over that happened that happened to kooper flag slipped against Kansas and against Kentucky at the end of the game remember those I do remember it he slipped floor oh man it put some bur merish there man oh devastated man the thats like thats like the kids fall thats just unbelievable slide hes skating hes skating as the players come out onto the floor and theyre waiting this was Applause earlier and kind of quickly going over the spot there but heres another thing as the players come out on the floor waiting for Action to happen of course all these guys are perspiring sweat is dripping on the floor when youre standing in one spot Hunter try to get it in but calls a timeout so they burn that one their last one and now nether side has a timeout remaining with 147 to go Cooper flag going over to the same spot oh wow and slips again right there yeah but dicki V look at him hes grimacing right now hes dealing with that that really really happened to CER against Kansas and Kentucky the end of the game slipping on the floor I mean thats not a players fault you cant help that but a giant turnover obviously its back over to the Tigers here after the timeout got to be careful throw this ball and bouns man you got to careful throw this ball and Bounds Dylan hunter from the Music Baseline got it into his brother and immediately chases fouled and hes a 91 foul shooter yeah hes a real good free throw shooter he really look at his stats he really fills up that stat sheet he fills it up baby Malik Brown with a foul hes a staff Brad branell and his team suffered a heartbreaking defeat on this floor earlier this week to Georgia techken triple overtime and then they have Duke in town the number two team in the country Duke number two Auburn number one has already lost today to Florida tell one if you can pick one guy you want in that free throw line if you Mr brell hes got the star on the free throw line over 1600 points in his career he knocks down number one and now he can make it a fourpoint game this is big if its a threepoint you got a chance to foul dont let him shoot the three but you dont foul right away obviously he got 14 seconds but he can make it academically makes this Duke out of timeout Hunter number two you want this kid on the free throw line if youre Clemson this is the guy you want on that Applause line great St 7571 the Tigers I they get empty up stance you think the stance are going to empty out we will get hurt will we we get hurt Proctor on the drive went for the scoop and it is deflected Away by Hunter oh baby what a play they smell that W baby they smell that W look at 77 upset City we got a new number one and its going to be Applause Duke and Tyrese brocker trying to attack Chase Hunter with a huge block from behind denying that opportunity the officials are going over to make sure thats why theyre Stars baby Stars rise to the challenge no Cooper flag on the floor right now for the Blue Devils in for Chase Hunter cradles the ball and draws the foul at 58 they get it to the right guy thats coaching right there make sure you get the ball to the right guy and a new f team an Alabama team that they lost to that they beat early in the year at Alabama in the inaugural ACCC challenge but that speaks about one of the most undervalued coaches in our game nationally Brad Brownell doing a tremendous job with this team and getting them off the mat from A Loss on Tuesday and prepared them to beat the number two team in the country here this even tell you one thing hes not undervalued now check his check his paycheck its coming hes pretty cool he deserves it he ear Chase under drilling number one these fans are ready to take to the court oh boy oh boy oh boy here they go baby here they go 58 away from knocking off the number two team in the country Im to see you guys next week down to Duke Stanford I hope so and he makes another one putting this one away at the foul line theyre very good foul shooting team 78 and 81 and ACC play have a 91 shooter and Hunter tigers on a 70 run the last 33 seconds flag gets it on the inbounds hell heave it up there and shorts tapped around that will do it oh baby it is go here they come the Tigers knock off Duke 7771 thats your finals and were going to have a new number one team come Monday because Auburn lost earlier today their fifth consecutive win against an AP top five of
