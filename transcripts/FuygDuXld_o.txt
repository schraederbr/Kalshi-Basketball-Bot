we willll see some in this game uh you know from a high from Power five conference a guy who didnt play much of his last school or do you take a guy from a lower you know midlevel division one team and laal has made that transition very very well boy is he ever backto back double doubles including that come from behind 14point win last week in South Ben Indiana little Fade Away by Kofi and rattles it in to start the game I tell you you know this Virginia team and you look over this last stretch theyve been scoring the basketball theyve been in the 70s playing a little bit faster Tempo than they normally do its interesting Virginia is among the top defensive teams in the country again they always were under Tony Bennett they lob it into potit and heres leow right back to potit the big fell throwing it down a great action that time high low action while showing off his skills there but uh you know potit he and he need they need him to return to double figure scoring they desperately need that Kofi one more time from 15 and rolls off the rim were talking about Virginia and how good theyve been defensively again this year certainly a trademark under Tony Bennett over his 15 years but on the road they have not been a good defensive team theyre giving up close to 73 points per game on the road that is in the low 60s at home and theyve had four Road games where theyve given up 80 or more we had one of those at SMU and this is as hostile an atmosphere as this team has played in this year so it be interesting to see how they react to that Virginia comes the other way 22 game nearly two minutes into this opening half boy hes the one guy McNeely that Mike young said we need to lock in and know where he is at all times so now Virginia Tech going to slow it down Mike mentioned when we first came on the air in the first meeting between these two teams a 7574 win for Virginia Tech the hokes were 11 of 23 from threepoint range low caught it other side of the rim lays it in see you know a guy like that youre not afraid to throw the ball anywhere cuz hes going to catch it and the difference there too is he knew he couldnt get the shot right away coming down gets his balance makes the play great defense right there by Hammond on Nick Neely loose ball and here come the hokes the other way heres low to the rack and hell go to the Applause Music Applause line lets take a look at our Mark of a fighter moment brought to you by Melo the big man well and thats just while being the player he is drawing the attention of the defense and then again just just throw it up there somewhere hes going to go up and get it and uh you know when when youre uh when youre out front and you have that confidence you can it really makes it a lot easier Le 67 free throws shooter he has five double doubles on the year transfer as Mike mentioned from VCU as Kofi will leave the game after that foul and Elijah Saunders Checks In and well keep an eye on with the Miss there its one area that Virginia has a big advantage over Virginia Tech is at the free throw line Virginia much better percentage and that was a big story in the first game between these two teams Virginia started fouling with about 5 minutes left in the game and Virginia Tech nearly lost the game because he couldnt make free throws bang nothing but the bottom of the net for mcne hes in and this whole offense is based on Rhythm and uh the more you disrupt it the better you are but that was just picture perfect even at five low goes right by ases and lays it in thats a mismatch um you know even though you think out front with the quickness that AES might have a little advantage while just that first step went right by him talked about how good ases has been he had 18 in the win Over Georgia Tech three a little strong and Saunders lost a handle wow hes going to go or no have it Stripped Away thought he was going coast to coast and really lucky on that player W was one on four should have pulled out waiting for some friends oh come on you always love that one on four when you were the one right my coach started to sweat if I dribbled more than once are you kidding me I never got in that situation nice ceremony before the game here in blackburg for Mike young a native of Bradford Virginia was inducted into the wford Hall of Fame wasnt able to attend the ceremony uh and he also picked up his 400th career coaching win all in the same week so Whit Babcock their Athletics director out on the floor nice presentation to coach young good man really good man and this is both teams are similar in that most of their offense over 40 comes from behind the arc so youre going to see a lot of shots out there in this game and again almost you know Virginia starting to establish themselves on the offensive glass and that was Anthony Robinson getting the rebound the wall did not box him out 75 Tech early on snowstorms down in Durham in my four years and I remember one time we got there there was one bus stop on West Campus and bunch of us got there and we were pelting the side of the bus where everybody would got we held the students at Bay in the bus for about 10 minutes we held them hostage its really nice of you theyre pinned in there heres Anthony Robinson a red shirt freshman Ill tell you what hes given this team some really solid minutes in these last three or four games about 15 minutes a game really active rebounder rim Applause protector they like his future he grew up just outside of Atlanta and he hits both free throws to tie things up at seven our officials today are Eric Lewis Justin Porterfield and Applause jeffon Virginia Tech 6 and s in the conference UVA at 5 and8 the swing game the headtohead between these two nearly turned over five on the clock nice rejection thats the guy youre talking about Robinson yeah thats what he gives him and uh only five on the shot clock Im a little surprised that they came to the double with poti but look at this just this is what he does great reaction time good help side well if he laid that off to FTI that would have been an easy slam Johnson comes off the screen shot clock at three young going to have to let it fly off the bench and no good offensive rebound for Tech and unable to cash in and UVA comes the other way in a seven all Applause Music Applause Music Applause game muray is checked in for the first time for the Wahoo shot clock down to 10 heres McNeely off the screen PA away three my goodness is second of the game yeah it just looks like its one of those games where in Rhythm and when hes coming off the screen and its just a catch of shoot almost looks like a a redirect of the ball just no thought at it eighth all time in the history of Virginia basketball is McNeely for made threepointers he now in his career has 206 of them see watch that just enough of a screen there to give him a look and thats all he needs he needs about a half a body to get that shot up so H number one Toby L shooting two Neely whistled for the foul while one of two from a line and gets a first this young man more than likely will be a first team All Conference performer this year hes been that good hes one of only four players in the ACC to rank in the top 20 in both scoring and rebounding well and the thing that Im really impressed with is that his numbers have gone up dramatically in ACC play that doesnt always happen with a guy and uh you play better competition and uh you know hes he has been a terrific portal transfer theres Robinson off the feed from roie how good has roie been no hes just I mean just make and that was an easy pass I mean they really they loaded up the right side cleared it off got a nice back screen for Kofi and that was an easy lob great pass underneath and using that athleticism but theres Robinson again going up to get a piece of it and actually credit Saunders a little bit too he took the body wall couldnt Elevate as much and that allowed the block T Murray the senior from ockland New Zealand theres a lob into Robinson thats a nice catch in traffic there and he draws the Applause Music foul look you see that right side is all loaded up theres no no help there good little back screen its just a welldesigned number 13 Benn and number4 the foul on the floor and its a fourpoint Virginia lead in an out on a threepoint attempt by Elijah saus havent heard from Jaden shoot lately in or yet in this game hes a big part of what theyve been doing from the perimeter poti double team swings it to the far side and that was a tough catch over there for Brandon re Steiner who is so pivotal especially at the line down the stretch and that went over Notre Dame last week well Tom you see the double team coming and and for normally for Mike Youngs teams turnovers have not been an issue they have with this team and so that that double team more to force the turnover than to prevent the score but um yeah its its been an an issue with them all season long yeah theyre averaging 14 turnovers a game Young really got after his team about turning the ball over in practice yesterday I mean let him have it lob into Robinson thats a big body Anthony Robinson and any scoring that he gives you is really a bonus down the other end hes averaging under three points a game hes already passed that hes doubled that hes got six early on not a field goal oh for their last five spanning four minutes for the hokes oh and another another turnover Burnham broke to go back door and re Steiner thought he was posting out beyond the three and its its not just the turnover Tom a good portion of them throughout the year have been unforced like that one and uh you know that that thats the one that really get Mike young fired up well I mean he was really fired up in practice yesterday they went up and down they were playing 5v5 for about 10 minutes and uh kept turning the ball over and he finally stopped practice and let him know that better change training to three as hean Sharma his first bucket Off the Bench for UVA thats three threes for the Wahoos early on and theyre largest lead its 17 to8 and just as importantly they are looking awfully comfortable running their offense which if youre a home team you dont want your visitors coming in and feeling at home youre right about shoot theyre not letting him even catch the ball heres Rex titer thats not his game burn him the rebound theres shoot and there he goes yeah well that was I hadnt shot the ball yet this ones going up and uh you know good result for him and the two guys that we highlighted at the top Ames hasnt scored in this game yet thats his first B show what you know for crying out loud did you pick those two guys I didnt shows you what I heres the here comes the bus get under it thats right first personal all right so good threepoint shooting early on for Virginia theyve hit three of them after this one from Sharma and then the first tray of the game by shoot to end the scoring drought for the hokes on your screen go to news Nation nowcom of course its Ron Sanchez a native of the Dominican Republic who has taken over on an interim basis we asked him about that before the game today and he you know was quite honest and open about it he said look Im not even thinking about that right now my job is to manage what I can control right he said thats getting my team focused KN staying focused he said there will come a time in the not too distant future well that will change but right now thats what I I have to do and you know tomorrow is going to bring its own set of problems and theres nothing you can do about it so you know to for him I think its great to get lost in the season coach this team you know theyre theyre playing their best basketball right now McNeely from way out already has a couple of Threes in his game down at the other end and its been a rough couple of games for Jaden young the sophomore out of Goldsboro North Carolina just cant find that touch because hes a good shooter and his time has really dried up a little bit he been under 20 minutes a game during that stretch and theres Ro who bangs in a three four of them for the Cavaliers right now its just a little bit too much for Virginia Tech to overcome but uh already I mean we look at the I looked we looked at the stats at in the break Road Four assists no turnovers in the game and very early shoot nice bounce pass but hes able to recover off the tip and then missed an easy one inside this is all UVA early on leading by nine and looking to extend it up top ases caught it left hand got it roie again his fifth assist and a time out for Mike young and he is just furious with the transition defense on his team nobody looking to see where the ball was they just got beat on a look ahead pass watch it this is talk about and thats what Ros doing its thats not a difficult pass its not a risky pass the guys open defense is turned you know its its its a great look but you brought up the numbers and you asked Ron Sanchez about it before the game today I mean you look at roie his last 12 games and lets include now a few minutes here today he has 72 assist in eight turnovers what a Turn Around from the prior 12 games yeah prior 12 games to start this year 27 assists 29 turnovers I was like you know what what what switch did you flip here and he said hey its just you know just making decisions you know growing in the position and I I made the comment I looked at I said you know to me watching the league over the years it takes a point guard a guy in that position about a year and a half to get it which would coincide about when y you know when that happened for him youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State youre in good hands nearly halfway through this opening half in blackburg and its all the visitors so far yeah but I mean you know a coach coach likes two to1 assist to turn over 3 to one is outstanding 9 to one is ridiculous big three from L wow yeah if 9 to one is ridiculous then what is uh what I say in his last three games now hes uh yeah 29 and 29 To None is that good hes not Applause bad the wall with nine points now in this game bames has been quiet he has just one basket thats a tough shot right there Im not sure thats what Ron Sanchez wanted out of Kofi Applause looking down to PO and La going to go to the basket left hand thats excellent defense right there by Kofi now you know its interesting with with the double team potit theyre not even looking to throw him the ball now Tom they they they gave him a glance inside and then they just kicked it around out on the perimeter heres Buchanan whos been very quiet has been so good the last couple of games averaging nearly 10 points and 11 rebounds roie the ALU Kofi caught it uses his body sticks it in hell go to the line after the foul by Tyler Applause Johnson well again on these lobs that you know these guys have been really good at catching coming down getting a good base and then going up and converting rather than trying to make this spectacular play give yourself a chance for a threepoint Applause opportunity Kofi The Freshman out of Seattle good free throw shooter 82 and of course soon as I said that he misses so far in Virginia Tech has not gotten very many easy baskets and then this a its a slug if youve got grind it out against Virginia in the half court all game thats a tough shot that was Hammond The Freshman from Fairfax Virginia in and out on a threepoint attempt and lwow with a rebound Virginia Tech needing some offense and they turn it right over Cavaliers three on two with numbers aims a lefthander for three oh my thats five threepointers for Virginia and uh you know Mike young is just hes trying to get to that under eight time out or TV timeout without calling something well remember Virginia Tech trailed by 14 last week very similar to this game at Notre D and then rallied to beat the Fighting Irish by two this crowd has been completely silenced thatll get him on their feet Robinson the foul and the wild is keeping him in the game singlehanded yeah and then yeah he gets that he gets a chance for a threeo he gets him a timeout finally hes got 11 and will go to the line to try and make it 12 his team down 11 I could have sworn it was opener rookie move Virginia lead 728 to go here in the opening half know we talking about you brought up Robinson before he did anything before he gotten off the bench in this one he already has six points and three rebounds and less than five minutes and thats uh you know again their offense is running extraordinarily well uh but and you know and on this side of the floor La has been the only one whos been able to get to the rim against Virginias offense everybody else has been out on the Applause perimeter 55 5 for the Cavaliers yeah and theyre five of 11 46 from three theres Robinson an excellent defense right there by Burnham Robinson got it back and another stick back what a game hes averaging three points per game he has eight and uh just a lot of maturity on that play a good defensive one on the initial play and thats going to its just trying to do a little bit too much there the offensive foul on the moving screen this is you know this is growth right here not frustrated staying in the play offensive rebound pad those rebounding statistics a little bit its okay Rex Steiner whistled for an illegal screen boy you hit Rex Steiner you are going to feel it that dude is put together at 61 195 of course his dad if youre a big WWE Fan for three decades was Scott Steiner Applause and another three this one by Saunders his first and thats six of them for Virginia well theres still 6 and 1 half minutes to go and the Cavaliers have 32 points they average 64 per Applause game heres Burnham he can shoot it passed it up now hell shoot it last touched by UA you know theres one theres a theres a difference though time I mean Virginia is shooting their threes in Rhythm inconfidence got a lead Virginia Techs trying to claw their way back in shooting threes and theres a different kind of pressure on that Virginia Tech only two out of seven against Ron Sanchezs team from three so far and shooting just 33 for the game br will get a breather he wont be out long he averages almost 32 minutes per game in conference play now theres a good look for three and Off the Mark for shoot thats one of the best ones theyve had in in the half court offense thats the thing you know with Virginia with not turning the ball over or taking bad shots very few run outs for a Virginia Tech no easy baskets in transition when Neely thought about it so too did Saunders both passing and the shot clock is at five I think everybodys thinking about it at this point why nots got the balls going hes got the balls thinking about it all heres Burnham again for three and again hes just off the mark batted out by Applause low Lows just TR to go to the r nobody going to get in that poster and uh you know with with two bigger guys for Virginia out of the game now the lane is opened up youve got some room to drive Applause inside wow with 14 of Virginia Techs 19 Music points theres the look and you know things break down you get again theres that double team inside and kind of the half rotation and McNeely really was caught in between and just uh well the wild has really shown me a lot here in the first 15 minutes he is going to be really good he grew up in London uh and they believe his ceiling is unlimited he didnt start playing basketball until he became a teenager its a good thing the way he jumps no k a low ceiling oh come on I mean youre youre in the top what uh five all time top six all time in scor rebounding and blocks and I mean you had big time hops back in your days at Duke in the NBA big time yeah they I dont even think they measured we didnt even know what the vertical was back then so you play Darnell Griffin what a rejection theyre going to call Goal tending on the wow and theres that athleticism we were talking about yeah almost makes a recovery and a great play but again this all right so now youre Virginia you youre getting things in the half court and you get a run out like this and and that just got it up on the backboard and look at that I mean three white jerseys back against L and thats kind of been the way this game has been played in the first half he had to duck his head at the last second did the wow from hitting his mouth on the rim well I tell you one guy around my ear David David Thompson had had he might have been I think he was the first guy they talked about with with a vertical lead and then Darnell Griffith at Louisville shortly after him yeah yeah Darnell was my year 1980 who is Right Pat Kels bringing back those days at Louisville theyre going to be good that young man can coach Ill tell you that well theyve been fun to why you and I were talking oh look its been a down League down year for the conference so far the CW has a brand new dramedy series coming soon called good cop bad cop a detective team who dont always see die die dont miss a series premier good cop bad cop Wednesday night Eastern 8 central right here on the CW but you know you Louisville Clemson Duke SMU making some a little bit of a late statement y wait for us Yeahs taking care of business earlier today against Florida state theyre and theyre really theyre starting to Peak again they had a little rough stretch in January but win against Duke and then backing it up with a big win against North Carolina they hmer North Carolina and then they Hammer Leonard Hamiltons team today theres a turnover uh the first in the last four games by roie wow and you know what mcne is apologetic that he didnt catch it you know Burnham has missed two threes in a row the transfer from the College of Charleston and he drops it in and now a little bit of life for Virginia Tech well again you know they got the double they got the switch and he had aims and he did he had a nice job of taking advantage getting inside and shooting over the top theyve got the W sitting on the bench with 16 of their 23 so scorings got to come from somewhere Saunders lost a handle on the way up and now Tech tries to get it under double digits trailing by 11 yeah I think Mike young is all right come on one of you guys we need a second and a third Guys somebody out there figure it out there you go red Steiner drains a three and Ron Sanchez says hang on a minute Rick Steiner only a 30 shooter from downtown but look confident letting this one fly Music pafic life creating Financial Security for nearly 160 years a threepoint ball has been the game for UVA well and thats really where they base their offense on they get so much of their scoring from almost 44 from behind the threepoint line and uh you know really shooting the ball well and the thing is you cant lock in on one person they got five guys who have made a three in this game mcne the only one with more than ones joined by Sharma ases Ro and Saunders heres mcne working on rexin and stripped out of there by burnner four on two young couldnt find the handle and now burn him to the basket hangs in the air got but no call he was looking for a foul against Buchanan but even though they had numbers look at Virginia track it down big time contact there yanan on the receiving end from poti and a nice bounce pass easy pass but a smart pass by roie yep theres the look wide open you know Buchanan underneath inside its going to be interesting L coming back in a little bit of an extended first half rest for him and I think Mike young trying to protect him a little but hes got one foul he really does not he wants to carry that into the second half didnt want that second foul here tomorrow CW women suits number 23 Florida State taking on the Hurricanes thats tomorrow at 2 pm Eastern 11 Pacific only on the C they got to be playing for something in state dont they I would think so as were playing for something here in state absolutely and Ron Sanchezs team a ninepoint lead with under three to go here in the opening half Rex Steiner trying to bully his way to the basket names is saying what in the world did I do to draw that Applause foul on number were deep into this first half and neither team in the bonus yet function of a lot of Threes being taken yeah the next uh foul for each team will put the other in the one and one and then a foul away from the ball and uh I think they got roie and that will be the seventh team foul and will send Jaden young to the free throw line hes only been there 22 times All Season line number three J young we talk about it from game to game about maybe finding some Rhythm there hes missed every shot hes taken in this game 0403 from the field they get there get a couple of free throws you know its interesting you say that I mean you know youve forgotten more basketball than Ill ever know but you know last week thats exactly what happened for Jadens shoot started off very poorly shooting from the field got to the free throw line caught his breath made a couple and then he lit it up rest of the game yeah I mean its its sometimes its a simple thing like that just to you know a couple of free throws or an easy layup or you know if youre really struggling rather than make the shot harder for yourself you know do something easy get yourself get you know see the ball going through the rim and now he gets to think about it going to the bench at least therell be a good parting call thats exactly right sevenpoint game closest weve been in quite a while looked like we nearly got away with a walk they were screaming for that on the Virginia Tech sideline heres roie always ah head up coming off the screen mcne in and out the wild back in there for the hokes and here we go now twominute Mark trying to get it down to five just when it looked like it was going to get out of hand Virginia Tech is fought back in CTI musling in on Buchanan and hell go to the free throw line no they said he tra oh boy Applause take a look there was a lot of banging both ways all that looked like both feet got up in the air but that was awfully awfully close and the difference was to time that Virginia was not going to double team that play they were hedging in a little bit but not the outright double lets see how that plays out over these final two minutes that have made it a fivepoint game another Miss on a force three that time for McNeil he hit a couple early on and is going dry six six of 14 now for the Applause Cavs wide open the wow oh boy wow is right this young man is lighting it up he has 19 and Ive been looking at his numbers last two games 0 of seven from three Im thinking why is he taking threes you know what he can with what he can do athletically but thats whats opened up for him in this game a showing some of his athleticism he has nine in a game yeah a little too e and he was quiet for about the first 10 minutes of the first half LS a transfer from Kansas State hes only a sophomore and lewow going to give it up to Johnson hes got a great body johnon hes only a freshman well you said it uh you know coming in and then thats where his strength is going to be he can go into the lane and absorb contact was 16 seconds left and the shot clock turned off this lead is now down to four the largest lead in this game 15 for Virginia it was 32 17 so we invite you to stick around our halftime show presented by Subaru love its what makes Subaru Subaru will bounce around the ACC you know one thing that that caught my eye you and I were talking about a little bit before the game Cooper flat everyone is assuming since he walked out of high school that he is automatically one and done at Duke now look I dont have a crystal ball that disappeared a long time ago but he made the comment on a podcast earlier this week that he wants to come back to Duke next year are you stunned by that I was I yeah Im Im surprised because I mean this is a guy who is arguably I mean hes a lock for the the first five somewhere hes a lock for number one I mean come theyre talking about the guards up at ruter and you know but but regardless I mean hes hes uh you know hes hes a very high lottery pick but hey maybe hes looking to look at the teams that are going to be in the lottery and say they want to they may want to stick around another year here I you know what I think a lot may depend on what they do in the NC tournament wide open three and that was Ames who set that up for Saunders and thats the way the first half comes to an end and no surprise it would end on a threepointer from Virginia seven of them in the first half two from Saunders two from mcney and one each for roie ases and Sharma Cavaliers trying to yeah that uh I mean s to be quite honest is a guy that started the whole thing after his first three of the game yeah and because he stood and looked and then uh you know came close lets lets see how the referees react in the first four minutes here if they really TR to clamp down on some things and some if there are any taunting violations called okay so for roie now he got a foul in the first half he got a foul on thech techn and now he picks up this one and thats three not even 15 seconds into the game second half rather oh boy that could turn out to be a huge factor in this game I think Sanchez wants to make sure the number of fouls that roie has we have three yeah I mean that that Tech counts as a you know as a personal foul so you know no surprise there then no movement from Virginia bench so theyre going to stay with him for heres potit here comes that double team and he throws it away yeah he has really struggled out of that a couple of turnovers for him Virginia the opening half lighting it up from the field at 56 heres roie backing in stripped out of there and they call shoot for a foul shoot got hit in the mou after he stripped the ball B uh on the follow through Ros hands inadvertently hit him in the face and they charge shoot for the foul yeah this is going to get real interesting here Tom and there was that wasnt even on the follow through that was coming down and that was after the shot all right Ro is first trip to the line and knocks it down hes hit 25 of 31 from the stripe on the year he had an excellent allaround first half seven assists his first turnover in four games three rebounds and a couple of free throws and hes going to come out of the game in favor of tane Murray so Ro leaves its marked that down its a ninepoint lead 4233 when he has to leave the game not even a minute into the second half and lets see now how Virginias offense runs with uh with him on the bench and see how long Ron sanche says will keep him there oh oh boy how about that that was one Im one you know Mike young is probably saying what are you great shot well you know he doesnt shoot him very much hes 10 of 23 on the year coming in so 11 of 24 is pretty jaw gone good for the Freshman not of Fairfax Ben Hammond boy he lit it up in practice from three yesterday I get it its practice but hes capable just doesnt shoot him very much in the game good catch there by Buchanan and heres ases for three you can see right there and this is where its going to show up at the end of the shot clock too where Ro would be in control of the ball making plays lets see you can do that for Virginia now going forward all righty so the lead is down to six Virginia Tech with ball the wow had 19 in the first half a very quiet opening half for this guy shoot he had one threepointer in thats it heres lewow lays it off for poti rejected by Buchanan nice recovery boy they had the switch Ames was on potit and Buchanan came over and saved him really nice defense Mur been a backup but a valuable backup for Virginia over his four years so hes a one taking over for roie you see right you know if mcneels got to handle the ball a lot maybe that affects his scoring in this second half well well find out or not or not and thats a thats a great second half Virginia possession offensively you get a run third 29 seconds off the shot clock and hit a three well hes got a beautiful stroke whether he sets his feet or even if hes slightly off balance sometimes even fading away which is not ideal but boy just a beautiful release heres lewow this guy you got to get it to him every time down the floor dont you yeah and I think Virginia look they you know they went with Buchanan oneonone no double team they stayed at home and everybody else they may just let Lal go and say Im going to shut everybody else down who touched it last and theyre going to say it was touched by Tyler Johnson so lets take a look at that Mark of a fighter moment brought to you by Melo its 21 in the game now for Toby laow yeah and this is just this is get the he waits for the double team to leave nobody coming and uh you know nobodys going to BU block that jump hook 21 of their Applause 38 sevenpoint game for Virginia with a basketball shot clock at five mcney lobs it to Buchanan shot clock at one rebound to laow and hell bring it up the floor going Coast to Coast had it stripped out of there by Murray good play by T Murray and were seeing here early on second half Virginia Tech getting some rushes up the floor off the long misses well but this guy he can handle in the open floor really does everything well but really nice hands first time weve seen Anthony Robinson who had eight points three field goals two free throws in the opening half UK Canan will lead Robinson a big reason why Virginia has this sevenpoint lead swing it to leow hes going to take it to the basket beautiful pass and luig fell down poti did and then a takeway and a tie up possession arrow goes to Virginia well bti having a tough time today yeah and uh just you know functioning hes not looking for a shot inside unsure of his passes you know good quick Hands by Virginia but also you know what I Ill credit Virginia knowing the possession arrow that time nobody just getting on the floor getting possession knowing they had the arrow not even thinking about burning a timeout re Steiner checks in replacing Hammond hell run the point for Virginia Tech 345 passed here in the second quarter second half for Virginia and McNeely off that screen off the rim and potit with a rebound for the hokes anything its on that on that right side its a little tough for him to swing around and square up for his shot that may be be the only flaw well young just cant buy one from three and thats spanning the last three games Ro out theyre not in any hurry to run to get a shot up in the half court potit rejects the three attempt by Murray shot clock at 11 and thats the under 16 timeout we had a sevenpoint spread at halftime and were there right now a little more than 4 minutes into the second Music stanza five rebounds and you know hes hes building confidence in Ron Sanchez and him being out on the floor and you know over his last stretch you can get eight and five and 15 minutes out of him thats huge hey Virginias got a lot to be excited about looking ahead I mean AES right there is only a sophomore we talked about Robinson he is just a freshman they have virtually everybody coming back on this team next year and uh Ro is going to be the big key that you know Tony Bennett for years seemed like he always had that experienced point guard around very rarely did seem like he ever had to break anybody in and if he comes back if this unit stays intact great future Brody is still sitting on the bench with three fouls he left with 1912 to go and uh you know four and a half minutes at pass inant and theyve actually increased their lead a foul on Rick Steiner thats so you know for right right now Ron Angel playing with house money as long as that cushion stays where it is he can keep he can keep him over there and save him best caseo maybe get under the 10minute Mark with him with three fouls right there is a guy thats got to get going yep I mean he has one threepoint basket and shoot has been lighting it up recently for Virginia Tech Robinson will go to the free throw line got hacked by Jaden Young on the way to the basket and thats a shooting foul Robinson two for two from the line here today and in this stretch where hes been productive he has gotten to the free throw line and he shown its been a big part of his game Applause try to get into double figures and scoring if he can hit both of these its the first one CWs number one showback all new on Monday dont miss all American Monday at 8 Eastern 7 Central right here on Fox no Im not talking about Mike jinsky even though he wasnt all americ I got to give a shot I was with Anthony Robinson the Christ School the Greenies where my where my son Noah went to school got to give them a little plug why not and now youre a granddaddy yes sir heres P cannon not even close and now young we talked about his struggles from the field but hell go to the free throw line attacking the basket there yeah I think for him hes got to abandon the threepoint shot for a little bit and try to get a little easier basket we talked about the Rhythm in the first half but his his perimeter shot is not there he needs to find midrange or closer all right so roie comes back to take over for mcne he left it was a ninepoint game he comes back they lead by 10 and that was in nearly five minutes Virginia Tech has not scored in three minutes and lewow back in there theyve got to get shoot going hes just standing down there in the corner shot clock at three maybe thats going to be get young going who knows yeah and he had no choice in the matter there and that possession was dead in the water there was nobody moving around there was no ball movement and that just a huge bailout maybe a little igniter for young you can tell just by his stroke that Youngs got a good looking shot I dont know what happened there to Saunders maybe he was tipped that was the first field goal of the game for young he had missed his first five and heres re Steiner Im not sure that thats a shot Techs looking for yeah early on in the shot clock really no board coveries look like it surprised his teammates which is the biggest thing hes only a 30 shooter from out there doesnt take him very frequently Saunders musling Burnham the tip got it back lost a handle got it back and hell go to the free throw line thats a good effort there by Saunders Applause oh this is this is an area I mean they havent needed it much in this game because the field goal percentage been so high but this is an area where Virginia really wore down Tech in the first matchup on the offensive glass and just hustle plays right there know its interesting Virginia ranks dead last in the ACC an offensive rebound yet in their last game which was a win yep they had 13 of them yeah they averaged seven yeah and theyre coming off a stretch where that number is stared to creep up a little bit too I mean you look at their overall numbers their pace of play their scoring starting to you know especially the scoring those numbers are way up from earlier in the Applause year theyre waiting to Im assuming there was uh some blood drawn um or is it a contact lens issue for sers I mean Ive been wearing contacts my entire life it would take me about n seconds to take care of that Im waiting for somebody to come back the only thing I can do better than any of these guys put in contact Im waiting for somebody to come back with the Kurt rambus glasses look for sure I I know I need I need glasses out there they call those rect teex or Tech those things they were sweet well today a day CW becomes the exclusive home to the NASCAR xinity series its going to be exciting pure raw racing that only the NASCAR Xfinity series can bring these are all the young guys trying to make their way to the top and it comes your way from historic Daytona thats next right here on the CW were very excited were going to wait for the big one at the end those restrictive Place PL Races they got to those last five minutes five laps as the drag race I think four of the last six races down there the infinity have been wrecks at the end Saunders an 82 free throw shooter his first trip to the line today is successful heres another guy hes a junior out of Phoenix transferred from San Diego State hell be back next year and he gets him both stretching the lead to nine Applause Murray will leave mcney back in there 1305 left does Virginia Tech have a rally in them like they did a week ago in South B against Notre Dame great defense right there by Robinson how about that and theyre leaving him oneonone no help coming in he just he kept his feet wall ran out of room that was terrific oneonone defense well I mean its only a freshman talk about a body on a young man in Robinson I mean my goodness you imagine what hes going to look like in a year from now young get a three and hes going to have to fire up another one here are you kidding me two in a row the two toughest shots hes had all afternoon and he bar roie all over him defensively young fired up see now that thats all it takes now hes forgotten all the misses hes on fire right now two of two o Robinson gets a rebound and then undercut by leow this is two in a row here with a shot clock at three yeah its almost by out by the V and uh a step back with the shot clock winding down number Robson for the they desperately needed to find that second cuz Virginia is theyve kind of theyve quieted L down a little bit here early in the early going of the second half yeah he only has one field goal and Applause Robinson is now four of five from the line talking the balanced scoring that Virginia had in the first half up and down the roster and how about you know whos thinking about Robinson as a guy going into double figures in this game for Virginia well they had eight players score in the first half none in double figures and five of them hit threes so really balanced so Ames and now Robinson reach double figures for the Wahoos and that lead again is it eight to the basket and a foul on you Canon Hammond was passing the ball so that is not a shooting foul it will be the fifth fifth so seven already charged to Virginia Tech and that includes the technical fouls at halftime right two so the both teams started with two foul two team fouls but thats problematic for Virginia Tech if you know for Virginia now theyre shooting one of them you know theyre in the bonus going forward youre talking about team in Virginia that is a 74 free throw shooting team now they brought in Kofi to try and defend lewow whos trying to post up Kofi shot clock at eight and the bounce pass is there but off the fingertips so a Timeout on the floor 1155 to go an eightpoint game the Wahoos on the road and for right finals three years in a row won it twice my brothers you were a first team allam one year second team allamerican another year ACC Player of the Year ACC Rookie of the Year as a freshman I mean uh check every box here I dont know who the people are that built for that College Basketball Hall of Fame they might want to go back to drawing board theres a layup and a foul with three seconds left on the shot clock and look I know youre not going to say it but Im going to continue to beat the drum on it I mean it really does it bothers me because I Ive been around a lot of guys in baseball when I was broadcasting Ron Santo the old Cub great third baseman there have been others uh and theyre guys that deserve to be there and I mean whether theyre a working partner mine or not I dont know how you can walk out of Duke University one of the most prestigious universities in college Universitys basketball programs as the alltime leader in multiple categories and not in some of our numbers brought to you by Morgan Stanley where old school hard work meets bold new thinking yeah and as the shooting numbers have come down for Virginia a little bit in this half but uh Tech has not been able to make up any ground and Ashley Ron Sanchez Ro coming out now and theyve really done a nice job of protecting him with those three fouls kind of moving him in and out being a little cautious with him in the middle over the half right now I tell you where Virginia has made a big difference here in the second half is at the free throw line theyve scored nine points in the second half Virginia Tech does not have a single point from a line in the second half kofy with a bump on Hammond and that will be the sixth team foul so still not in the bonus his third personal foul six foul you know and its funny me you dont think of Virginia and physical but they are when you play against them it is a grind on both ends of the floor and they are they play with their chest defensively and they are always bodying and banging you and uh it is it is a tough tough defense to play against charm of great anticipation and aims with his second straight air ball from three go figure that wow and that was a pretty clean look too swing it to Burnham who passes up the three goes to the basket had a rejected but hell go to the free throw line to shoot two 10 trips to the line here in the second half for Virginia not a single trip to the line until now in the second half for Virginia Tech yeah they shot it well in the first half theyre going to need to finish strong at least theyve matched now theyre in the bonus Applause bur him with three points he is 16 of 22 from the free throw line Mike Youngs team had to Rally last weekend in South Ben coming back from a 14point deficit theyre going to have to do it again here today and a loose ball last Touch by Virginia Tech thats young down there check in for H number 10 Tyler johnon so a ninepoint game Johnson will replace Young for the hokes and Ro being out has really affected McNeely and uh you know hes hes not getting the looks that he would normally get in the offense Sharma walk you know I talked about the free throw numbers a minute ago where not for the free throw numbers this game might be tied right now because only one made field goal in 9 and 1 half minutes by Virginia in this half and Buon drain or burum drains to Applause Three B Neil oh fade away boy that is smooth isnt it thats something hes added to his game too the ability to create off the dribble like that but still had to work awfully hard creating his own offense on that play hes got 13 so three Cavaliers in double figures Applause burnam will give and go thats Music easy wow I think the Virginia defensiv theyll shade that theyll give that up theyre really checking out on the threepoint line its still a good roll and finish by poti nearly a takeaway Virginia able to get it back shot clock at 10 Sharma for three not there and tipped out of there nicely done by Kofi thats a play that gets unnoticed in the stat line but is a big recycle and thats what it gets you right there well that is a huge turn of events right there that tip out by Kofi and its finished off by mcne yeah theres no stat for that time to that side like a layup almost MCN has two threes a twopoint field goal and a pair from the line giving him 10 second half points 16 overall in the game to lead Virginia all right here we go ninepoint game and Virginia Tech with a basketball lot of standing around right now and its knocked out of bounds by Kofi shot clock at 14 and they have really kept Mr LW quiet for the first 12 minutes of this half he only has one field goal after scoring 19 points in the first half yanans a one Guardian theyve got an advantage here if they get him the ball but they dont get him the ball how about that little Dipsy do from Hammond then he missed a layup yeah see everything but finish and got the switch thats the thing Virginia not afraid theyll switch a big on onto a point like that and uh you know they get the stop Virginia has not one in this building since 2020 theres a takeaway Johnson just rips it out of the hands of Brody and he draws a foul in the basket and thats number four on roie with eight minutes to go and that is not a smart play by Mr roie I mean you got to understand hes frustrated right now he got he lost the ball out front youve got to let that go thats a cheap foul let him have the two points take the ball out go down the other end and Ros going to have to leave the game so well play this game once more earlier he left with a ninepoint lead he came back in with a 10point lead after almost 5 minutes so he leads now with a sixpoint lead after the made three throw so lets see what happens over the final Le your upper class and you have to understand that what your situation is you know when what you can give up and when to take a foul when to let something go you really put your team in a bind now unless this guy just keeps knocking him down this is insane for mcne he has 19 thats his fifth three of The Game and his third here in the second half yeah and he was he was under control for a while too man can he shoot look at another situation where Hammond they got a big switched out on him that Virginia just does not care and they and he cant find anybody shot clock down to three and Hamond 43 going to be uh partially blocked by ases and now Virginia will slow it down 715 to go UVA sits on a ninepoint lead yeah they theyve somehow got to massage this at least Under The 4minute Mark with Roy with those four fouls re Steiner is trying to stay with McNeely and that has not been a winning formula so far for the Hoke three on the shot clock thats over the back on Kofi and that is the 19 foul so we have a under eight timeout 647 to go can Virginia hang on on the road in blackburg well its its going to be how long they can last without Ro in the ball game its going to make a big impact on their ball handling um you know theyre going to be very deliberate I think the more again you know Virginia Tech can get to the line and make Virginia pay there slow the game down a little bit score now the front end of this is critical they missed a bunch of those in the first matchup they missed three of them as a matter of fact and you know I I say that Tom but when you get to the bonus here 78 n youre shooting to one and one they missed all three of those in that game so youre youre passing up a potential six points right there and uh so thats why converting those on one and on is so critical laow hits him both so he does his job yeah they were 14 of 23 from that charity stripe in the onepoint win at Virginia I I dont know and they they started off they had Hammond on mcneel early in this game and thats what they guarded him with in the first match up and I just dont know how you you know how you quiet him down at this point shot clock at five day day a spins into the lane little lefthanded Fade Away in and out and Lew the rebound and now with 615 to go its a sevenpoint game got the shot he wanted he got to his left hand Rex Steiner and he bangs it in WoW his second three of the game and all of a sudden now fivepoint game first time all day this building comes alive and theyve had other people step up and uh you know toight down threes young finally came alive and now that three good defensive switch and then res switch there by Tech shot clock at seven heres Saunders and all of a sudden that three ball KN falling as frequently for the Cavaliers big trip now with 520 to go for the hokes right Virginia Tech doing a better job in the defensive glass too not allowing those tip outs or second shots two and 12 minutes scoring drought for the Cavaliers allowing Tech to get closer Rex Steiner thought about it passes up shot block at five heres Burnham theyll give it off to Hammond somebody better shoot it shot clock at one and unable to finish thereis Hammond that was not a good offensive possession for Virginia Tech yeah and I tell you and then how about great confidence with Robinson in the game under five minutes right now he bothered that shot down the stretch Ro still sitting on that bench with four fouls and we have 430 Murray to the basket in the senior lays it in his first bucket of the game wow thats just a great read off the screen rather than flare out for the jump shot he kept circling around and got an easy layup lead from four back to six that was a spread when roie left with his fourth foul and now Burnham defended by ases heres Hammond for three yes sir Hammond they relied so heavily on RA in that first half and credit the other guys on the team theyve had some guys step up and make some big shots Virginia with a basketball lead down to three with 350 to go and a take away for TCH Hammond to the basket beautiful pass to Johnson oh he missed the lay up with a left hand that would have brought the house down and now Robinson falls down was he fouled he was I believe hes going to be shooting oh boy missing the layup and then Johnson in frustration fouls so a two shot foul when we come back those two threes with a shot clock at three lets see Virginia Tech you know I mean Ro back in the game now theyve theyve gone as far as they can with him on the bench under four minutes now you know if Im Virginia Tech Im going to shade another half guy on McNeely if I can and I let somebody else beat me Johnson by the way picked up his fourth foul which will send Robinson to the free throw line the second half its been all mcne Applause for U he has 13 points in this second half nobody else has more than three and and the thing thats so tough about guarding him Tom is he moves so well without the ball I mean when youre guarding him in the half court you are running like a fullcourt play almost hes just constant motion what a game for Robinson season high in points with 12 he has seven rebounds hes been Dynamite from the free throw line hits them both right there he is seven of eight from the strike and thats been the thats been the magic for Virginia over the years that freshman that red shirt freshman year to come in learn the system dont play get bigger get better ham goes to the free throw line after kissing it off the glass his freshman Ben Hammond out of Fairfax Virginia having a big second half well it was that screen and Buchanan a little late getting there on a you know late and damage just so quick off the dribble does a nice job getting into the body drawing the foul and getting the Finish but see now thats thats the respect that Hammonds got with making those threes theyve got to defend them a little bit outside its opened up the drive for them really coming on here down the stretch for Coach young is the Freshman Ben Hammond and here we go boys and girls 320 to go Virginia leads by two ands not going to pull the trigger his last two three attempts have been air balls now this guys been lien it up oh my goodness a dagger he has 16 here in the second half Isaac mcney and its just everybodys sitting back down in their seats so those are the shots that break your heart and break the momentum of a run heres Johnson spins into the lane thats a nice move by Johnson he draws a foul he really has a nice body for such a young man hes got a good future ahead of him and I you know I mean this is the you know the clock winding down again no thought and now granted there is a there he does have a a size advantage over him and and thats the issue he can get his shot over the top 64 to 51 he has six threes in the game does mcne four here in the second half a nice stroke there by Johnson 70 free throw shooter a make here and its a threepoint game and it is its see I mean take that last play Tom with ro in the game it allows McNeely to run around and be that receiver at the end of the shot clock instead of being a ball handler well if you watch this UVA offense I mean it is Robinson setting incredible screens and that ones off the Mark and burn in the rebound very lucky for uba that yanan was not whistled for a foul going for that rebound yeah just not quite as solid when hes coming off screens on the right side of the floor who is this guy he has 11 all of them here in the second half Ben Hammond and just used the rim brilliantly that time to ward off Robinson as a shot blocker and hes trying to track mcne they just kept skting screen after screen after screen for mcne thatll be a foul against Tech and a two shot trip to the free throw line for the fouls on Young and I think its Robinson whos going to the line or is it no going to be roie I beg your Applause pardon Ro is two of two from alive only 30 trips there the entire year next week CW court side Saturday were headed to Louisville to see the seols against the Cardinals and Then followed by pit going to Notre Dean CW Courtside Saturday next week 12 Eastern 9 Pacific only on the CW Fighting Irish fighting to get into that ACC tournament Ro a couple of big ones from the line right there if Im Virginia Tech Im continuing to attack the basket and you know well and Robinsons still in the game but um theyve had such success doing it see if they can get some threepoint play opportunities both teams in the double bonus interesting that shoot is sitting on the bench and hes among the better threepoint shoot Here Comes Hammond again in the Land of the Giants down there and he gets it off to Johnson who aays it in somebody fell asleep for UA there and a timeout by Mike Young done its a onepoint game 7170 Virginia both teams are in the double bonus and the possession arrow right now in favor of the hokes lets take a look at our player of the game brought to you by Progressive Insurance save when you bundle Auto home and motorcycle insurance visit progressivecom and you know this second half for Isaac McNeely has just been off the chart no you know as the first half of of Toby wall and the second half of Isaac mcne I mean take your pick but uh you know hes kept them in him offensively Virginia has had some droughts stretches where they havent scored but he has been there to pick them up McNeely had six points at halftime two threepointers he has four threepointers throw in a two and a couple of free throws man what a game and he is sitting on 22 points for those of you joining us for the NASCAR

everybody lost him and what a great Play2 time out here you can see look mcneel on the left hand side of the floor everybody caught looking everybody the rest of the team on the right hand side thats just a welldesigned play roie has nine assists two turnovers Robinson I mean we talked so much about NE McNeely but rightfully so but you before you know he he even right when he came in the game lets put it that way when we saw Robinson um you mentioned about you know his Improvement and how much better and better he is getting he has played 17 minutes in this game and there are the numbers season highs in both points and rebounds he been lights out from the free throw line yeah I mean when you have a guy whos averaging three points a game and he goes five times his average um you know thats just this is a guy whos playing his way into more and more time on the floor and you can see hes here in an endgame situation and nothing speaks more loudly to the coachs confidence than that a lot of time you know a lot of that coach being stuff you kind of roll your eyes well Im not worried about who starts it Im worried about who finishes well Robinsons finishing today yep xinity NASCAR coverage
