their ship too And the zoo is starting to rock a little bit Obie They got a pretty good population in the zoo right now So this is a game where it can get exciting for the Panthers especially if theyre able to shoot the ball well early Now Pit wins the opening tip and they get the first touch And heres Cameron Corin whos been really their most reliable player at a big at 610 Get about 13 and eight And theyll turn it over quickly into the hands of Javon Hadley cheering Hes been battling a little bit of a flu bug He flips that one up and it wont go and Kenny Roots is not going to play tonight Theres McNeely on target as he will bury the first triple and thats the start that Louisville needed Remember we were there Tuesday night to watch Virginia get out to a 140 run against the Cardinal So for the Pit Panthers guy runs the point Demarco Miner at 6 feet He is out of Chicago Barry Dunning Jr is 66 senior is another guy they rely on for plenty of scoring and he had an excellent night against Georgia Tech this week with 17 cheering the big 611 junior with the rebound Louisville in that game against Virginia fell behind on their home floor 14 to nothing You and I were there for that They just got hit right in the face and you know barely were able to get back into the game late but never really had a great chance to win Heres Conwell with a misfire from three Rebound is tipped but a foul inside the first 90 seconds of play Theyre going to get Adrien Woolly over the back But the Panthers had similar fortunes when in their win at Georgia Tech They got off to a 122 start to start that game So Jeff Cable understands the importance of his team getting off to a positive start as well And Jeff in his eighth season at the helm for the Pit Panthers And of course you have a dramatically improved ACC this year I think today more than any other day of the conference season so far That one spins out I think a a good indicator how tough the league is going to be It really is We had a number of upsets in the league throughout this day And when you consider that now anyone can beat anyone on any given night that gives the Panthers even more of an opportunity to get a big win here on their home court Lets fly F with the rebound a dribble down goes to the other side of the iron lays it in Nice job by Sand Fu there who had three of his five rebounds were offensive rebounds against Virginia And thats one of the areas where he can really be effective for this Louisville Cardinal team Mentioned upsets today How about Cal knocking off number 14 North Carolina the pick and the layin by Hadley and a very quick start for the Vil here Thats the one thing that the Panthers cannot afford with such a smaller margin of error with their injuries They cannot afford to allow Louisville to get off to big leads especially early in games Pit not incredibly deep and they are very young On the wing heres Miner who can hit 40 beyond the threepoint line Corin gives it up and an air ball by Miner Theyll get an opportunity to get it up here with two seconds to play on the shot clock and the shot clock will expire Never did get that second effort up there And Pit shooting 0 for three Three turnovers Yeah this is not the start that Jeff Cable was looking for from his team especially coming off of what he taught their best offensive performance They had 19 assists in their game at Georgia Tech And when you consider the fact that this is their first ranked opponent of the season you want to you would have loved to have gotten off to a better start than this Very unusual for a team in the ACC to play into mid January and have not seen a single ranked opponent And whats whats weird is weve this is the second game in a row that weve had this Virginia played their first ranked opponent in the Louisville Cardinals as well on Tuesday But cheering Virginia showing that they can beat anybody anywhere win today over SMU Big win on the road in Dallas McNeely turns to fire Got a good look He buried that So exactly what happened to Louisville on Tuesday theyre doing to Pittsburgh tonight Yeah And when you consider that McNeely getting going and this is a Louisville team theyll shoot 34 threes at least throughout this game So you dont want to give him easy ones early because that will start the fire that you will not be able to put out Drew lunging out and fouling Miner 1638 to go here in the first half Terrific start for the Cardinals They lead it 10 to nothing So Pat Kelsey going to be delighted with that The fiery head coach who just recently got his 300th career win Saturday Stops at Winthrop and College of Charleston before a dramatic rebuild at Louisville last year A very tough angle shot there by Cummings Couldnt get it to go Zipped up to Rogers Kobe Rogers 63 senior into the fray Conwell cheering in amongst the traffic Cant hit that short shot This is a time now where Pittsburgh youve got to settle in and think about whats your best offensive action How can we guarantee that we get a bucket or at least get to the free throw line to put some points on the board and just get something on that scoreboard McNeely with a quick hands knocks it out of play Joe Pit will have it Jeff Caper will be able to make it through through to the first media timeout which well have on our next dead ball most likely But again its risky to go down 100 and not use that timeout But that timeout is going to be necessary later if Coach Cables team is able to get back into this game Swing here for Cummings whos been a very hot shooter as of late Five on the shot clock Theyve already had one violation Cummings leaning inside the three left it short Nice shot by Hadley there staying out of Cummings way not fouling him on the jump shot at the end of the shot clock So Pit still without a point Ali Khalifa big guy a terrific passer Hell swing it here round the horn for McNeely Khalifa tempted to take a three Shot clock to nine McNeely gets another one as he buries a three Nothing but the bottom of the bucket there to make it 13 to nothing 40 shooter You chase McNeely everywhere and you deserve it when you get it after a mental mistake as such Well he came into the week McNeely having taken 138 shots 116 of them from three So the book is very clear Dunning chased into the corner and Khalifa will commit the foul with the body really really fascinating day in the ACC today and you and I have been talking about it all season long How much better the league is how tougher the conference how deeper it is this year Games like Virginia SMU today where Virginia won it 7268 A great basketball game very gritty tough game Cal knocking off North Carolina on the West Coast 8478 There were a lot of games like that today There were a lot of games like that How about Georgia Tech going to Raleigh and beating NC State after the Panthers go to Georgia Tech and hand them a loss earlier this week and picked up their first ACC win Miner will swing it Cummings hits it and finally Pin is on the scoreboard and that took more than 5 minutes and finally the confetti can fly in the Oakland Zoo across from us They cheering have to wait until the first bucket of the game for the Panthers and here they are already having played five minutes of game action Good ball movement Woolly is the open shooter And nice touch there by the sophomore who had 21 at Cal back on December 30 So he can fill it up And this is the danger of the Louisville Cardinals They make 117 threes per game which is fourth in division one And the way that theyve gotten off to a great start Ive seen this before OB Ive watched them make 18 against Memphis And theyve had multiple games this year where they made 20 Youll see Aleppa airmailing a long one there 163 Louisville has made six of their first 10 cheering McNeely red hot got a great look and hes going to draw a foul while shooting a three from deep in the corner So he is to the line to shoot three shots And even though that shot doesnt go in he stays perfect from three simply because you dont get a field goal attempt when youre fouled on the shot So now a chance for McNeely to put three more on the board and to get into double figures with just over six minutes being played Also in the conference today Boston College in overtime knocked off Syracuse at Chestnut Hill 81 to 73 cheering Georgia Tech beating NC State 7874 So a really really entertaining day in the ACC today McNeel an excellent foul shooter 90 and has one more coming Yeah already in double figures 6 minutes 1 second of game action being played A McNeely already in double figures but really setting the tone as to way the Cardinals have to play on the road to be successful Remember this is a team that lost their first game on the road at Arkansas and then lost their first ACC game on the road at Stanford which was part of letting people know how good the Stanford Cardinal really were Going to be tough to go out to the West Coast and win both of those games Stanford and Cal Although you like Dukes chances but but both those teams much improved especially on their home floor Cal showing that today with the win over the Tar Hills the top cheering in recitis lost it It was tapped out by the Cardinals 6 seconds on the shot clock here and again Pit has already violated the shot clock once Got to get a shot in the air pretty quickly here They kick into the corner and will knock that down from threepoint land Anditis keeps up his hot shooting Four of six for him at Georgia Tech after going the first three ACC games without scoring a point Had tied his careerh high with 16 on Wednesday night A transfer from Iowa State Khalipa is open Got an excellent look He buries that And the Cardinals really hot tonight in Pittsburgh Khalifa now shooting over 50 from three in ACC play Came in eight of 16 from beyond the arc and knocks down his first one of the evening 24y old from Egypt and a collision and a blocking foul Roger right there for the call 216 Brandon Cummings attacking the basket One thing youre not supposed to do help off of the ballside corner the easy pass to knock it down and then the ball movement on the other end of the floor Khalifa able to knock down his first threepoint field goal of the evening Brandon Cummings at the line His brother Netti played three years here And now the officials will get together momentarily with 1255 to go in the first half And Nelly Cummings does does cheering ACC Network extra games for the Panthers And normally when Nellys on the sideline talking it up Brandons getting buckets Some of his biggest games have come with his brother calling the game Im sure which has to be exciting for both of them cheering Theres Nelly right there So expect another big one I guess Although hes not wearing a microphone today Yeah its different when hes not calling the game as Brandon misses the first free throw There you go Well needs the same night that he had against Georgia Tech this week He had 23 points in 34 minutes Also had 29 against Syracuse So 52 points in his last two games Hes been sizzling They really need a big one this evening you know And Jeff Cable bringing him off the bench He started the season as a starter but then was injured and after that coming back was seemed to be pressing a bit Jeff Cable deciding to go back to him off the bench and its worked out in the favor of the Panthers Hes gotten much better production with Cummings coming off the bench McNeely thought about it from around the logo Hell drive it instead The leaner No Rebound torn down by Miners only about 6 ft Andrew Situs trying to go two for two McNeely with the rebound but Jeff Cap will take that look You got a good shooter taking a good look in comparison to a turnover which hampered the Panthers early cheering Khalif a tremendous vision Helps to be 72 to pass over guys but hes such a willing passer Conwells been pretty quiet so far Shot clock down to eight He will drive it It gets Messi out for Khalipa Yes Obie I watched the Duke game where Khalifa hit five threes and he seemed hesitant to shoot the three early A guy that shoots it this well Im not sure why he was ever hesitant but he has really been shooting the basketball extremely well from beyond the arc in ACC play 17 in that game against Duke down the lane and flipped up by Cummings Cant get it to go Conwell through down the lane lays it in A wellrun break You know this is a lineup we havent seen a lot of from Pat Kelsece throughout this season but he has both his bigs Fu and Khalifa on the floor together Theyve talked about with Alana Ruks They need some help at that four position Kasem Prior will be a guy that we will see in that spot but this is a different looking lineup for the Cards going with both bigs Extends the biggest lead here for the Louisville Cardinals on top 267 Another turnover for Pit Khalifa will give it up Here comes a long one for McNeely And its going to be tapped up and in by Fu And a timeout for the Pit Panthers Louisville is threatening to run away and hide with this Theyre on their way with 1059 to go in the first half To nothing and seven to nothing And Pat Kelsey still coaching it very hard but a huge lead here early And the team so reliant on the three when theyre making them they are deadly They are deadly And Isaac McNeely starting off three of three from beyond the ark Getting to his spots and showing aggressiveness But its not just McNeely Theyve had a number of guys get involved in the threepoint conversation early Wooy able to knock down one Khalifa knocked down two threes already So the performance from the Louisville Cardinals to start this game has been right up the script for Pat Kelsey So they heave about 34 attempts per game and they make about 12 per game number one in the ACC fourth in all of division one It is the thrust of their attack and tonight they are burying their threes But part of it also Obie is there theyve scored 10 points off of turnovers So more importantly when they get turnovers theyre running in transition and finding those easy looks which are uncontested Jeff Cables already called two timeouts to try and stem the tide but good luck with that Cummings with it averaging 12 points about five rebounds a game and again the shot clock a problem Its down to three and the long jumper is going to be around and out Seeppa couldnt hit it 287 Its about 3 minutes since the last field goal for Pit Meanwhile the threes are raining Javon Hadley He buries it to make it 317 And again its part of what the Cards do Its not as though theyre just shooting these because theyre hot They would take these same shots if they werent making them But now seven of 10 from beyond a threepoint arc 21 points already shooting from distance Conwell disrupts the play there Under 10 minutes to play here in the first half And recitis looking for help Heres Dunning Jr Transfer from South Alabama into the lane and that wont drop So it doesnt seem to matter where the shots are coming from for the Panthers Nothings falling for them Caleppa got a good look on that one again One where he can take his time a little more Had a smaller McNeely trying to defend him Didnt use his physicality to get a bucket Woolly to the baseline The kick out Hadley thought about it Shot clock to nine Conwell will lift One of the few guys who does not hit a threepointer here in the opening minutes And the guy that leads the ACC making 37 threes a game He really hasnt been able to get going Slam dunk but youre going to wave that off The foul came before that 913 to go in the half And a dream start for the Cardinals here tonight on the road in Pittsburgh 317 And this is really about a response from the Cardinals I mean and thats one of the things that you want Pat Kelsey and shoot around earlier today was animated as he always is but he had a little extra juice because you knew that this Panther team was coming off of their best win of the season thus far and they would come in with a lot of energy to attack this game but the Cardinals have pretty much taken that away from start They sure have cheering Situs lets fly around and out Going to get a second opportunity the block and a foul The foul will go against the big guy Fu We talk about Pat Kelsey and the intensity and the energy I swear they plug him in somewhere every moment laughter you know before the game and he just rocks and rolls But tremendous energy And we talked about this hell wear a microphone during practice and so no ones going to miss anything he says but he is constant movement He is a whirling dervish on the floor Ive never seen a head coach go from player to player to player and play defense harder than his guys are playing Well and again that as a as a player you have to respect that to watch your coach out there working as hard as he does You can see how invested PK is every time he steps on the floor Its hard not to play hard for a guy like that Pit by the way over four and a half minutes without a field goal cheering handing off Rogers Lets fly And why not Kobe Rogers coming off the bench But OB as soon as Kobe Rogers caught the basketball Jeff Cable was standing right behind him with his hands in the air wondering why are they continuing to go under screens and get hit by these screens not chasing guys Kobe Rogers who hasnt shot the basketball very well during ACC play is able to get the three to go Their biggest lead tonight 348 Dunning Jr trying to get inside that paint Hell draw a foul And going back to Rogers 63 senior But look at Jeff Cable You cant see him His hands are already in the air Why are we going under screens Why are we not getting out to the shooters Theyve already shown that you can shoot the basketball extremely well And Jeff Cable extremely frustrated with the fact that his guys just arent following the defensive game plan So Dunning Jr headed to the line 66 senior 12 points a game at the line Hes their best foul shooter at 89 And naturally misses Louisville with eight threes made Pit with two total field goals Khalipa finds the paint and a kick out for Hadley Conwell coming in averaging about 20 points per game inside for two So theyre doing it outside and inside And thats truly Khalifas game being able to play that stretch five position at the top of the key where hes able to initiate offense He actually leads the cards in assists in ACC action A great defense there by Khalifa just shutting down Corin Rogers off the fake and swung to Conwell They cant bury it Rebound tapped around and a loose ball Thatll stay here 728 to go So Pit has yet to get into double figures And youre almost 13 minutes in Pit two for 14 from the field and theyve turned it over four times And when you consider the fact that the only field goals made for the Panthers thus far are beyond the arc The only two the two threepoint field goals one by Cummings and one by Indry So those two guys are the only ones that have have a field goal for the Panthers Eight points and they have shot two of five from the free throw line Only 40 to add insult to injly Heres Khalifa straight on Got it Boy hes just deadly out there But Im trying to figure out why he has so much space Again I understand you have to respect his passing ability So but its easier to defend a guy whos a great passer if youre putting pressure on So be there on the catch Dont allow him just to have easy looks from three Another defense Louisvilles has been superb as well Another misfire as that one was off target by Dunning Jr McNeely will pull up and pop and a bit too strong So a rare one and done there for the Cardinals tonight Demarco Miner coming junior Tough angle shot with a left hand that wont fall So theyve gone about seven minutes without a field goal That is tough to do especially gets a a ranked team that shoots 34 threes a game and makes almost 12 of them coming into this building off of a loss cuz you got to understand that Louisville right now is desperate Thats one of the things cheering that Pat Kelsey talked about as another beautiful pass from Khalifas unable to be finished by Kobe Rogers But Pat Kelsey talked to us earlier today about they needed to play desperate He felt like Virginia played more desperate than they did on Tuesday night which was the reason why they were able to get a win on the cards home floor Witherspoon pulls up kind of air mailed that one Theyre going to get a third crack at it though cheering Miner lost it got it back in the corner And finally they get some points on a field goal See Aleppo will knock that down But that took forever to hit a shot It really did would give the Panthers a lot of credit for doing the job on the offensive glass Got three opportunities One of the reasons why Pat Kelseys calling the timeout doesnt want to allow his guys to relax with the big lead 535 to go first half and the Bill leading at 3911 music music first Goliath battle but the last one of those we had David won So So therefore laughter the big one youre talking about Im talking about the big one The one we really remember The one we remember thats in the good book Well I hear you but uh I I hate to spoil your fun on that but this is no team in the game is going to beat Indiana and and and I understand completely why you I mean they have absolutely annihilated all competition leading up to this national championship game and you know I got to go with the U Its the ACC squad Caleppa lets fly and buries a three Backto back threes for Caleppa as hes able to cut the lead to 25 and so a little bit of momentum now on the favor Conwell will answer with a triple of his own And that momentum just went away by Louisville knocking down another three The Cards have made 10 threes already Obie so that is certainly quieted the crowd here in Pittsburgh at the Peterson Event Center the zoo which for a long time was one of the really really tough places to come and win in the glory days of the Big East Miner heaved that up with three and a half on the shot clock It didnt touch anything Yeah Miner lost that one on the way up Still tried to force the shot cheering Jeff Cable could only turn and walk away after seeing that offensive possession with his team trailing by 28 with still 434 remaining in the first half So 4214 Louisville with one turnover So theyve played a very clean game Obviously theyve shot the lights out Conwell on the wing and a hold underneath and theyll get Barry Dunny Jr for the foul with 420 to go in half number one Pat Kelsey taking this opportunity with the big lead to get Zuger some minutes as well going deeper into the rotation No Canai roots in this game So going to need front court help Weve already seen him experiment with the two big lineup which was successful and now both bigs watching in traffic a leaner there and fouled on the play So Khalifa to the bench for a bit of a breather Zugers getting coached up in live action Pat Kelsey calling him over as soon as the foul was committed to give him some instruction But watch coach Kelsey with Zugris and with Kasem Prior earlier today and he was on them over in in their shootound but afterwards he made sure to go over to both guys dap them up and give them a huge hug and made it very clear that he were going to need you guys And so with the front court depth lacking a little bit Zuggers getting an opportunity to get some minutes now Now this is Kase Prior sixthyear man out of Chicago blew out his knee a year ago down in the Bahamas after a strong start He says the knee feels great but hes not getting a whole lot of playing time in those early games a year ago I was covering those games down in the Bahamas and he was their best player or second best player Yeah And I heard you ask him earlier today how his knee felt and he said Im great I can play 30 minutes right now But I believe we all know and recognize and watching him run hes not 100 Hes not back to anywhere near where he was as you mentioned last year when he started the season Probably is their best player And again thats saying a lot when you got Chucky Heburn going on to be first team all ACC Thats right Cummings Lets fly No Zergus yanking down the rebound as he gets knocked to the floor And how about the bench How about Zugriss teammates up celebrating the big board music as he goes up three already in this game But McNeely and Khalifa both with three threes And this is a team that shares the basketball extremely well But this is coming off of what has been the best Panthers game for them offensively and defensively on Wednesday at Georgia Tech So they had momentum coming into this game but the Cards took that away with a 100 start Conwell left wide open but cant drain it So actually a guy whos been a very good threepoint threat and takes a ton of them has been their chilliest guy beyond the threepoint line so far here in the first half with 319 to go on the back door going up in the dunk and the slam by D Jr A rare highlight for Pit Very rare highlight and it turns into a turnover Oh that interesting to see that one Yeah Going to keep it on this side for Conwell and Louisville Take a look We take a look at the big dunk by Dunning Jr going baseline and a nice pass to get him a bucket And at this point if youre Pittsburgh down 28 in the first half right now its simply about trying to play to your principles getting better on each and every possession The likelihood of coming back in this game isnt high Doesnt mean that it cant happen but one thing you got to do is find a way to stop the Cards from getting so many good looks from beyond the arc and Adrien Woolly knocking back a three The 64 sophomore to make it 47 to 16 The threepoint shooting has been lights out for Louisville Corin gives it up That one barely nicks the iron Off target by Caleppa Louisville 11 for 17 beyond the threepoint line trying to get it downstairs and draw the foul Call of 222 to go Obie theyre close to their season average in the first half And again itd be one thing if you didnt have a great season average but youre talking about the fourth best shooting team in division 1 basketball 117 threes per game and theyre already there with still 2 and 12 minutes remaining in the first half of this game Jeff Cable has to be disappointed with the way that his team has followed the scouting report I watched their shoot around earlier today He talked to the team about making sure they ran guys off the line Dont give them quality looks At Obie at one point Jeff Cable took the basketball at the end of shoot around and he walked to the logo and he said Guys Isaac McNeely Conwell will shoot the ball from here We have to be on them everywhere they go Follow them to the restroom if they go to the restroom during this game and do not allow them to have those easy looks from three and they have not followed that scouting report Miner into the corner on the drive the bank shot up and in by Cummings Cummings able to adjust going to the left hand to finish that one off the glass and the Panthers have found a little bit on the offensive end over the last few possessions getting a couple buckets to go but defensively has really been an issue for them throughout this game Zerus with the kick Conwell trying to penetrate and gets two more So Louisville gets over 50 51 and not done with the first half yet as Corin slams it down But still trailing by 31 on their home floor Back for Conwell in a triple and no one got to the rebound for Pit That draws some booze from their crowd here Conwell again tried to go over the top for Zubris but too much So a minute to go before halftime and a first half thats probably going to feel like it never ended for the Pit Panthers as Louisville got off to a terrific start 13 to nothing Off to the races since then And a quick strike by Hadley But transition defense was a point of emphasis to Jeff Cable also in their practice earlier today And just an easy kick ahead layup for Hadley Hadley was surprised that he caught the basketball He thought it was to one of his teammates before it hit him in the chest Slithering inside Seal up for the basket The offense has picked up for the Panthers down the stretch here this first half but defensively theyve given up way too many easy looks So Louisville content to hold for the last shot with the shot clocks off They have made a ton in the first half and a run away with this thing Conwell trying to feed downstairs Going to be picked off The heave here is going to be way short And thats how the first half comes to an end Louisville running away 532 our table out of the way Try to try to knock my man OB over Well see you know hes laughter he earned that right you know at the first half he had He can do anything he wants And McNeely with an early touch here underway here in the second half at the Peterson Event Center Theres some booze in the building at various times aimed at the Pit Panthers Ryan Conwell Conwell will drive the baseline and scoop up two in a quick start for the Cardinals But once again too easy There has been little resistance if any for the Panthers on the interior when guys were driving the basketball So its one thing to give up threes but you cant be weak at the rim as well if youre going to give up things on the perimeter In your experience as a player you had nights like this on the wrong side of the score What was said inside that pit locker room Well it was simply about lets get better Lets see if we can work on some things to help us moving forward in the season the likelihood of coming back and Jeff Cables not going to tell this team that they cant come back because anything is possible with the threepoint shot Barry Dunning Jr will knock that one down But they have to get back to playing with the scouting report talked about from the beginning Chase guys off of the threepoint line Dont allow them to have easy looks to see if they can find a way to improve as a team Knocked away by Pit Pit coming in at 89 one and three in the conference Jeff Cables team had a really good win this week against Georgia Tech after ACC defeats to Miami SU and Clemson And Obie this is a team where you know we we we all understand now that in college basketball and honestly college football as well the older you are normally the better youre going to be This is a Panthers team that five of their top eight rotation players Conwell is able to knock down his first three of the game but five of the eight rotation players for the Panthers are underassed You consider Brandon Cummings as a sophomore and industry as a sophomore and then you got three freshman CPA and who just missed the shot there but youve got three freshman in the lineup as well True freshman going up against a team that is built with veterans I mean Mike El Brown the only true freshman getting minutes for the Cards and hes out So theyve got a bunch of fourth and fifthear guys as Conwell is able to knock down his second three of the second half 6124 So if Pit was hoping thered be a cooling off because of halftime that is not going to happen Yeah And again you know talking to the the Panthers coaching staff prior to the game they talked about how Louisville shooting was down in ACC play They wanted to see if they could find find a way to keep that going but that has not been the case The Panthers already up to forgive me the Cardinals up to 13 threes in this game as DeMarco Miner drives it Hell draw the foul A sixfoot grab Brad out of Chicago And so he will be headed to the line to shoot here He is their number one foul shooter Both he and Dunning Jr make 89 And what an ACC SEC womens basketball double header we have for you Sunday afternoon on ESPN 2 Laura Ziggler leading number nine Louisville against NC State And then Faj Johnson and number six LSU squaring off against the Bears 13th ranked Oklahoma And thatll be at the Lloyd Noble Arena in Norman 6126 Javon Hadley for Khalifa dumping it downstairs McNeely has it swatted out and a clean block by Dunning and the first time weve really seen any resistance at all at the rim So a positive sign for the Panthers as Dunning Junior is able to come up with the block shot Miner jumping in the lane to tough shots and look what it turns into Some energy on the offensive end as Miners able to get to the rim Miner a transfer from Oregon State Khalifa Hadley leaning in and knocks down two Pat Kelsey wondering why theres no whistle on that possession as Hadley goes up against a guy thats a little bigger maybe even a little stronger than Cleppo But Hadley still able to get a bucket Hes having a good game too at 116 rebounds Miners open for a triple and knocks it down Weve seen stretches where the Panthers have gotten a little bit of momentum going on the offensive end of the floor but the problem has been on this end where they havent found a way to stop the Cards Conwell took the hit He goes down hard but he makes the shot and hell be headed the line for a threepoint play Tremendous body control there despite taking a pretty good hit Yeah the finish was maybe even more impressive than the pass but Khalifa continues to drop dimes Another back door cut And then you mentioned it the body control by Conwell to be able to keep his eyes on the target and finish through the contact Opportunity for threepoint play the oldfashioned way So Conwell the senior from Indianapolis threepoint play Very good at the line too 82 Obie as weve watched Conwell get going in this second half it brings me back to a conversation earlier today where Jeff Cable tried to get Ryan Conwell to transfer to Pittsburgh twice Once when he left Indiana State and then last year when he was leaving Xavier he tried to get him as Pit able to knock down the three by Omar Harrison is able to give go one to go Give me Witherspoon And a timeout here by Pat Kelsey with 1610 remaining 6634 Louisville started the game hot They have stayed hot all night No they laughter all right Dan sign makes it Youve swung me Your argument your argument is just too good Now Miamis had a tremendous year Im Ive always been a big Canes fan Yeah I Im a fan of the way that you know Mario Crystal of course who played at Miami but when you consider how theyve tried to bring back so many of the players from when you know the Canes were at their best in the 80s and Michael Irvin showing up and kissing Crystal Ball on the cheek after the first round win and stuff like that Just seeing the nostalgia of who they were and getting those guys back involved in the program Remembering indeed how good they were A turnover and now back to a national championship game 6634 Another timeout 1540 to go Louisville having a great time in Pittsburgh tonight Season high Five threes made tonight Whats the record for the Louisville Cardinals for threes made in a game And for a team it is 22 back in 2007 versus Harford And for an individual it we only have to look back to last season Rain Smith made 10 at SMU Same game that Chucky Hburn had 16 assists So Isaac McNeely now this is one of the things that I Ive had a gripe with Isaac McNeely about his entire career He hasnt taken a three in this second half And again when you got it going like this as he lines one up after the whistle and knock down you got to stay aggressive And I know thats one of the things that Pat Kelseys talking to him about And so with a half like this first half he could mess around and tie that record or even break that record by Rain Smith And I know thats one of the things that Pat Kelsey is looking for Hes not looking to run up to score He wants his team to play the best basketball they can the entire time You take a guy whos naturally unselfish and youre asking him hey keep doing exactly what you were doing When you have a lead like this that could be hard to coach into a kid But thats what he wants to see It really is And human nature is you know to say Hey look weve got a big lead Were pretty much chill But thats what Pat Kelsey said really got them in trouble against Virginia They had too much chill And so he doesnt want to see any chill in this second half Wants to make sure their guys play just as aggressively in the second portion as they did in the first Mer with a pass off the fingertips and out of play off Seppa And for Jeff Cables team a nightmarish start a 13 to nothing start for Louisville and chasing from the getgo Eight turnovers now for Pit and Kobe Rogers to bring it up He played for Pat Kelsey at the College of Charleston before Louisville Kobe Rogers who had to sit out last season with a knee injury that he suffered in the NCAA tournament champion I mean NCAA tournament game for the College of Charleston Pat Kelseys last game at College of Charleston but made the trip to Louisville with his former coach and has really been a leader in the locker room as Cameron Corin is able to get the foot back Cory came in averaging 13 points eight rebounds a game and also playing at 34 minutes a game which is third most in the ACC Pass never gets to Khalifa Picked off Heres Miner Cummings gives it back to the point guard Hell set it up now for the Pit Panthers Over the shoulder here for Corin Had a great look but it wont fall for him and a whistle and this foul will go against Pit So Corin will pick up the personal foul here 1357 left Louisville won both contests against Pit last year Pittsburgh going 17 and 15 They finished ninth in the ACC Though they started the season very quickly They were 122 And you look back at the roster you consider Jaylen Low at the point guard position Of course you had a number of veterans up front cheering GMO Diaz Graham on the interior And it goes back to you know with the Panthers they have to recruit according to the budget And we mentioned earlier Jeff Cable tried to recruit Ryan Conwell twice to be completely honest And we could talk about this in todays age NIL They couldnt afford him His number was too high And so its right now to pitch budget they cant go get the highlevel transfers like a McNeely like a Conwell which Louisville can go get as they able to get the easy bucket So what Jeff Cable is doing is hes recruiting freshmen And when you go out with freshman in this level its going to be difficult for you Like theyre playing three freshman now They got a great a top 10 class coming next season But are freshman ready outside of Cameron Boozer and AJ Debonsa and Mike El Brown Are freshman really ready to contribute at this level Well you had a peak there of the class and hes very excited about the kids he has coming in next year He believes they can help right away and and I Im hoping they can and but you also consider that youve still got to be able to keep some of the guys who are here now The retention has been an issue Had a very good class three years ago Bob Carrington of course a lottery pick You cant blame him But now Jaylen Mo is out for the season as the point guard at Kentucky Both of the Diaz Graham twins have transferred one to Oregon State one to San Francisco So that class that you helped develop from two seasons ago theyre all gone Drew flying down the lane takes the pass from Conwell and Dougen Holmes 70 to 38 So right now Pit pretty much just trading baskets here with Louisville Fu with eight points Hes perfect from the field and Obie if its about trading baskets thats better than what we saw in the first half And so again at least pitch scoring at least theyre getting opportunities on the offensive end of the floor where theyre getting they took them over five minutes to make their first field goal in this game So if they can have some success on the offensive end it at least gives Jeff Cable something to build on Dunning with the strike on the other end Javon Hadley Hadley zips for Conwell and drains another triple Right now Louisvilles doing anything they want on the offensive end of the floor They would they got more resistance defensively from their scout team in shoot around earlier today than what theyre getting from the Panthers Louisville 14 for 22 from threepoint land Make it 23 Convos had an excellent second half Hes really exploded here Shot clock down to eight Thats going to be out of play and back over to the Cardinals Ryan Conwell really starting to at both Cal and Stanford on their west coast swing So not easy places to win but the Blue Devils handling business out west Tarheelss upset by Cal 8478 today North Carolina went in number 14 So Louisville with the basketball and a giant lead and looking to add to that although out of bounds it goes and will go the other way to pit Nice hands by Anders getting in there knocking that one off of Fus leg But we once again see that big lineup by the Cards where theyve got Khalifa and Fu on the floor together which allows Pat Kelsey to rest Javon Hadley talked about earlier he cant play a thousand minutes Also battling a little bit of the flu bug inside but it wont drop for Indraitis Conwell huge second half trying to drive it and hes held and fouled 1111 to go here in the second half And so Louisville to put it in from the baseline Rogers Heres Fu putting it to the deck Getting closer to the 10 Cant lay it in Tough D there by Corin Corin up against Brew Andrew Sidus Yes A threepointer on target And Jeff Cape was talked about injuritis can really help them as a scoreer We talked earlier about the fact that the first three games in ACC action he did not score but had tied his careerh high with 16 Now Kobe Rogers a little shaken up He took a hit He made the shot but the senior in some pain and now on his back or along the baseline Take a look the cut to the rim and takes the hit on the way up as you mentioned Still able to finish but immediately puts his hand up looking for a sub Great cut Another nice find from Khalifa as he catches a bow to the nose from Cameron Korn coming across trying to defend that play As banged up as the Cards are right now they can ill afford to lose any more of their players But Kobe Rogers knew immediately he was going to need some assistance throwing his hand up right after he was able to get the shot off Kept on playing Made the shot as you mentioned but then could not continue Might be seeing stars right now as you said the elbow across the the bow Notable injuries guys theyve lost And theres nobody more important than Mike El Brown Jr who is now missing his eighth consecutive game reported as a back injury Conwell missed one game after a knee And theres Mike averaging 17 points a game recently named 2025 USA basketball male athlete of the year And we have had the opportunity to watch the last two shootounds for Louisville Markeel didnt do much of anything on Tuesday shoot but today he was more active in shoot drills going up and down So it seems to be hes getting closer Not sure when there will be a return but we do believe that he is getting closer to making his way back onto the court More news this week from Louisville London Johnson the former NBA GLeager who they were originally going to red shirt and then for about 10 minutes thought they might not during the Boston College game Well they are deciding they are not going to play him this year He will red shirt definitely Well and part of the reason why there was the sway to actually playing London Johnson was the absence of Mike Keller And so if not without Mike Kell on the floor and no definite timetable for a return for him now is when you could really use London Johnson in this lineup Thats why the idea was floated around But coach Kelsey after Tuesdays game making a statement that London Johnson will not make his appearance this year will go back to the original plan of red shirts a little bidding for their 13th win of the season here tonight and a victory they desperately need after some rough waters lately Up top Khalifa off for Conwell Under 10 minutes to play here at the Peterson Event Center Khalifa with a miss Hasnt missed many tonight No he has not shot that one looked a little rushed but he knew he was shooting it as soon as he got his hands on it As Brandon Cummings is able to get the bucket on the way to the rim one of the best passing bigs in the country Theres McNeely swinging it for Conwell Hell lift the three off the front of the iron and hell get McNeely for the foul with 723 to play So Obie as of right now you would have to consider that the the Panthers are winning the second half of this game They were down 31 at halftime Theyve cut down the lead down to 29 So if youre Jeff Cable its the small victories that youre looking for What can we build on What can we show in the film session tomorrow for Monday to help our team get better moving forward Once Louisville got out to the 100 run we knew then it was going to be difficult for the Panthers to get back into this game They had no idea they would have ballooned to 30 plus in the first half but at the same time you cant allow a good team like the Cardinals You cant spot them 10 points on the regardless of whether youre playing or not Kieran Holland the seven foot freshman from British Columbia getting in and grabbing himself a bucket and a chance at a threepoint play Yeah his first action of the game as Endritus attacks the basket Unable to get it to go but Mullen right there to be able to pick it up and finish through the contact Flexing I see with the mustache too You got a stash you can flex like that OB I suppose he is the fifth sevenfooter in program history So theyve had their share and another freshman and another you know development player for Jeff Cable in this bunch But again would be much better next year But the problem is can you have the retention Can you retain guys Because when the portal happens theres not much you can do to stop it McNeely gets a look off the back of the iron One and done there for the Bill And Situs will heave it up That wont drop If youre with us early in the game and youre still with us well you get a medal for that But theres no question Louisville was shooting the lights out from threepoint territory and theyve had a great night from distance and continue as Conwell has just been brilliant in the second half Yeah Conwell that was the one thing that Pit did in the first half Positive They were able to keep Conwell for the most part in check but they have had no such fortune here in this second half but hes been able to get anything he wants from the offensive end 17 for him in the second half Louisvilles 15 for 27 beyond the threepoint line Very tough shot off the window by Cummings An acrobatic basket but if youre Pat Kelsey you simply say Hey you going to make shots like that So be it But they did a great job defensively by Conwell forcing the tough shot Conwell to bounce Zugris underneath on continuation He can count that and he draws the foul So Louisville keeps on scoring 748 to go here at pit fell this year Do you think thats going to come into fruition I think its going to be a stretch that that happens now I think probably Stafford wins that but judging by what I saw with the allp pro voting today one and two and he was the two guy That usually means the number one guy is your MVP But I was hopeful and still am because he had a he is having a great great year Hes having a great year as are your Patriots having a great year And being that Im a Cowboys fan I think I got to go with your Patriots tomorrow because we cant have another team in Texas making it to the Super Bowl I like how you think laughter I like how you think But even though the Patriots do have more Super Bowls than my Cowboys so I cant have you guys winning it I dont mind if you get there Sugar up top Shot clock to eight Woolly wont fire it downstairs for Hadley Hes in the double team Feed for Woolly Shot clock winding down and at the buzzer Its up and in And Woolly with a stronger performance in this game was only one of nine from the field against Virginia Really struggled to score the basketball Has been able to have a number of good looks throughout this one and get his confidence going on the offensive end So back up to 32 31 at halftime and eight different Louisville Cardinals have scored in tonights game Down the lane thatll roll off the iron for Mullen Tall freshman getting some minutes here in the second half Jeff Cable looking for some guys Hadley leaning into traffic Banks it in Its a shot he loves He does And Hadley has just been you know surgical with his approach passing the basketball attacking the rim but does the job defensively every night He was a strong has a strong defensive performance on test Derritter against Virginia He really kept Ditter from getting going in that game It was just his teammates unable to get the job done defensively Virginia with a really impressive win Probably the most impressive win today in the ACC as they beat SMU in Dallas 7268 Yeah especially considering Booby Miller is back on the floor for SMU Uhoh Over the top And it really wasnt that dramatic in the end Just kind of trickled in for F It really did trickle in for F Fr didnt quite get his hand on the basketball We thought we had a highlight coming Well just call it a light We were ready though Not low light just a light We were prepared We were prepared for it Youre always prepared 8751 But Louisville certainly came to Pittsburgh completely prepared tonight to lay it on the Panthers and they have done that all night long will go down the lane Swatted away by Fu But thats what you have to love if youre Pat Kelsece Even with the game in hand guys continue to do the job on defensive end of the floor F could allow that one to go and let Cummings get an easy layup but he does no such thing Boy thats a almost impossible angle for Hadley who thought he was fouled on the play but hell take the basket to make it 8951 But what you appreciate is Hadley playing through the contact not looking for a call If a call happens so be it But if you get the bucket thats most important So the with their largest lead tonight Miner with the kick and in traffic Laid in by Andrew Sidus And a backcourt foul on Miner with four and a half minutes to play McNeely throwing it up I will not say F throwing it down Well just say that it hit the rim softly and was able to go in and then Hadley finishing through the contact as Jeff Cable can only smile Sometimes you have to laugh to keep from crying right now and Jeff Cable who and again we watched the shoot around one today We saw how they prepared coming off of their best game this season with a win a 20point win over Georgia Tech on Wednesday And this team just did not follow the scouting report throughout this game Gave up way too many easy looks to the cards to start the game Isaac McNeely getting good looks from beyond the arc Khalifa knocking down three threes early without a without a contested hand in their face And again that type of discipline or lack thereof you cant win at this level without it And a lot of it you have to you know put on the fact that this is a very young Panthers team and they dont they dont have enough talent to have a large margin of error a motivated Louisville team thats been as high as number six in the national rankings Right now at number 20 as Kase Prior goes onto the floor and Khalifa will take a seat But the Lion share the credit of course goes to Louisville and the way they came out of the gate just hitting everything in sight and buried Pit in about 5 minutes They really did They approach the game the way their coach preaches to them to do with a sense of desperation and again when the shots go down that makes it all the more better Zugris nice feed and approve will dunk this one So how about the biggest lineup The Khalifa is not on the floor but youve got Zugrus Prior as well as Fruit on the floor So three forwards up front for the Cards Pat Kelsey able to experiment with a number of different lineups throughout this game Andrewis swatted away by Fu and a whistle as Louisville makes a run at 100 points which theyve done four times this season Season high of 106 shots for a great shot Pat Kelsey has to be happy with the way his team is operating on the offensive end And the College Football Playoff National Championship game presented by ATT coming up Monday 730 on ESPN Pregame coverage all day Then we have you covered for the game on every conceivable platform TV radio digital So many ways to enjoy it biggest game of the year cheering and the end of the college football season national championship game between Miami and Indiana I dont know who had that as the choice for those two teams at the beginning of the season but good for you You got the Heisman Trophy winner going back to his hometown to play against Miami playing the national championship in their hometown Spoon with a miss but a second try here for Mari Moore who grabs the rebound Three and a half minutes to play here at the Pete Moore a freshman from Michigan on the spin move Well short here by Caleppa and a scrap on the deck It comes free and Louisville again with another chance to get closer to 100 And a traveling violation by Zugras Had no place to go and pulled the foot And I was simply about to talk about how well Zugris was handling the basketball for a big guy until he traveled Young man who spends considerable time in the wait room Obviously under three minutes to play here on this Saturday night where Louisville just took off in the opening minutes and just destroyed the Pit Panthers Theres a foul on the drive Stops the clock at 252 Give you a look around the conference Weve been talking about some of the really interesting games today in the ACC There were a bunch of them Cal 8478 against North Carolina on the West Coast Duke went out to Stanford and pounded out a big win How about Georgia Tech after losing to the Panthers on Wednesday going to NC State and coming up with a huge road win cheering Pit on the other hand will drop to 1 and4 in the ACC 8 10 overall Louisville will go to 135 and three and three in conference play Rogers swings it Kasem Prior from the corner No And an over the back foul with two and a half to go to go here And 93 to 55 And so it will be Zuberas to the line as he shoots a one and one and drops in the first one Another one coming We start to look ahead schedulewise now for Louisville Theyve got Virginia Tech coming up on January 24 then at Duke and SMU go back to back very very tough opponents before Notre Dame and Wake Yeah January 26th the first big Monday of the season You myself and Jay Will on the call Its such a big Monday It takes three of us to do it laughter So we cant wait for that Its going to be a terrific game Yeah its going to be a terrific game and looking forward to that one And you know of course of cheering course with the two of us going back to Duke with Jay Will where hell be celebrated as the celebrity that he is Yes In that tight booth in the crows nest Indeed laughter Somehow going to cram us in the three of us to call that game one of the great sports venues anywhere on the planet and two of the you know historically best programs in the history of college basketball when youve got the Cardinals coming in there taking on the Blue Devils And maybe along with Fog Allen probably the two most iconic buildings for college basketball standpoint Cameron and Door I I would agree There people out at UCLA thatll tell you Paulie Pavilion belongs in that conversation but of a more recent vintage youre talking about places like Duke and and Louisville Has Paulie Pavilion been there long enough that coach Woody coached there Oh sure Yes Oh yeah Wow I was at Paulie a couple years ago I didnt think it was that old of a building 96 to 55 under two minutes to play I got a chance to meet Coach Wooden several years ago with my pal Steve Lavin when Lav was doing games you know at ESPN And coach was in the midst of the UCLA cheerleaders They were surrounding him and they were posing for a picture and he was just having the time of his life and one of the nicest four or five people Ive ever met in my life Yeah Just incredible Never had opportunity to meet him Only heard great positive stories about him But his impact on our game of course is tremendous Definitely on the Mount Rushmore of coaches He and Coach K I believe are the two main stays with everyone Yep Hard to beat what Coach Kay did Of course the alltime winningest coach in basketball Prior takes a shot here with a minute five to go And the game cannot end quickly enough for the Pit Panthers as Louisville still eyes 100 points leading at 9855 And what is on the mind of Jeff Cable after this one This is one where you have to look at it and decide do we just burn the tape Do we even bother going back to look at this game Is it an outlier you know or is there something that we can learn from this to get better And at this point the way this game has gone I mean you know one thing you can absolutely look at is the Cards get to a 100 points off of the nice spin by Zubris to the basket cheering is the lack of discipline on the scouting report in the first half of this game and how the Cards were able to get off to such a great start but getting easy looks which you cannot afford to give to a team this big particularly when you know that Louisville can be so deadly beyond that threepoint line Yes they are fifth in the country from field goal threepoint field goal attempts They are fourth in makes You know coming in that is a point of emphasis to shoot the three make as many threes as you possibly can When you know that coming in you cannot allow a team to beat you like that especially in the first five minutes of the game Thats what theyve done tonight 54 from threes 64 overall They made 15 of 28 threes and theyve struggled in ACC play throughout the first five games So this is really just what the doctor ordered for Pat Kelsey and his team here tonight So final half minute of play here from Pit A runaway victory for the Louisville Cardinals as they pick up their 13th win of the year and are now even at 3 and three in ACC play The shot clock down to four Sherman heaving one up there is partially blocked by Witherspoon and he will step in Cant lay it in but it is going to be goalending Count that basket with 77 seconds left But good to see Kobe Rogers back on the floor after taking that hit Going in to block that shot Picks up the goalending call But Pat Kelsey just happy to see that Kobe Rogers is able to go back in and play So thatll be your final score tonight Louisville sailing to the victory They blow out pit here at the Pete 100 to 59 Well and again the Louisville Cardinals getting back on track Theyre playing with
