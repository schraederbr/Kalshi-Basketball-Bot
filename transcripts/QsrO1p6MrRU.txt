and Notre Dame Carson Tout and Gavin Pendergast for the Sharks Tout wins the tip and its controlled by Notre Dame The 202526 season is underway from Southbend Marcus Burton starting it out for the Irish here Preseason first team allac wooden award watch list makes things go for the Irish Now heres Harelson inside his first bucket in an Irish uniform The highly the most highly touted recruit in the history of the program Hes going to look to make a big impact for the Irish this season Great first possession for the Irish there Jack The ball touched two three sides of the floor Got all the way for a layup And now right away tout a steal Harrelson the other way Lost it for a moment and its intercepted by LIU Its Gordon going the other way Drops it off Fuller cheering surveys and resets Heres their man Malachi Davis He averaged nearly 18 points a game last season but he turns it over Its Shrewberry with the steal Drops it off Tout looks for his options Shrewberry pump fakes inside for Tout Irish will reset it here Now Burton inside And hes fouled Little little bit little bit jittery there to start Couple of turnovers to start Up and down very quickly to start Theres the headman for Notre Dame Micah Shrewsbury in his third season Hes looking for a bounceback campaign Was very successful as the coach of Penn State and had a good start to the season last year before a couple of injuries and part of the campaign before the start of ACC play Well Coach Cruz is excited about uh taking this next step this year with the Irish What you saw there with Marcus Burton is what I think youre going to see all year long which is hes an improved threepoint shooter and an excellent driver and he gets to the free throw line like nobodys business And the fact that hes bumped his threepoint range out a little bit is just going to make his driving that much more effective and get him to the free throw line And hes efficient from all areas of the floor 37 12 from three and nearly 85 from the line Now heres Davis quickly inside for the Sharks WILD SHOT and on the follow is Gordon Notre Dame quickly the other way Harrelson the floater No good Tout couldnt come down with the rebound But we talked to coach Shrews earlier today about creating the pace being great in defensive transition and putting pressure on him with the early offense Notre Dame trying to do the same Harrelson inside Walled off Burton now working on Lassu from the corner No good Tout offensive rebound That was Garrett Sundra the freshman with the threepoint attempt Tout couldnt get anything going inside Nearly turned it over Now Shrewberry under 10 to go on the shot clock Burton with a lane A euro step and a crafty finish for the junior Well I dont as athletic as LIU is I dont think theres anybody whos going to be able to guard Marcus Burton oneonone So theyre going to have to bring some help Now another turnover for LIU And although its been tough sledding for them offensively this was a heck of a highlight early in the game Well nobody blocked Gordon out Everybodys Everybodys ball watching and Gordon just walks in and climbs up the rim to stuff that one home Gordons playing at his fourth school in as many years Started out at Driersburg Community College where he was at Jo AllAmerican That had stops at Iona and UAB Making an impact for LIU now in 2025 Shrewberry working on Fuller now Drops it off for the freshman Sundra Heres Burton and hes fouled Heres a look at the head coach for Long Island University Rod Strickland Longtime NBA star He played 18 years in the NBA Received MVP votes during the 1998 season Just an outstanding career for Coach Strickland Notre Dame nearly turns it over off the inbound Now Harelson inside finishes and the foul Four early points for the Impact freshman Carlson except for the early turnover you can tell that uh theyre going to get a lot of mileage out of him at at the kind of point forward position Hes a creator a guy who can score it but also spray it around to his teammates Misses the free throw there Tout nearly had the offensive rebound Liu quickly the other way Theyve got Fuller Now its Joe Mo going Fuller Quick crossover Wild shot off the backboard Tout the rebound Harrelson pushes the other way with options Swings it out to the corner Shrewberry No good Rebound tipped around Taken by Tout Well Tout is living up to his press clippings as he is rebounding the ball like an absolute maniac to start this game Hes got four rebounds already and were not even four minutes deep into the game and two offensive rebounds already He was the leading rebounder in the country last season at Northern Arizona And its a big country Jack It is a very large country Hundreds of millions of people And he got the most rebounds than anybody Thats a lot That is a lot of rebounds 124 to be exact last season His 423 total rebounds were a conference record And Im Im uh if the last three and a half minutes mean anything Im starting to get the idea why Well Towns got the rebounds but Burtons got the points Thats his sixth already I think thats a pretty good recipe for the Irish 102 early lead for Notre Dame with just 16 12 to go in this one cheering Lu trying to get a start here offensively Porter Brown to Goings his threepointer Short rebound tout again Burton the other way to Shrewberry now Sundra he hits the three and its the first points in a Notre Dame uniform for Garrett Sundra Irish lead at 132 here in the first period Thats to uh Sundra who knocked in an even more open three Theyve been moving it well so far in this one Liu looking for something offensively They havent scored in over two and a half minutes Although this will help that under the basket Porter Brown was fouled Hell go to the line and shoot two Little bit of a wholesale up sub substitution there and uh four new guys in the lineup and and just missed that rotation off that side ball screen You mentioned four new players in the game for Notre Dame Kebajai Sir Mohamd Colerta and Brady Keeler As Porter Brown makes the first free throw Porter Brown is a transfer from Indian River He started 22 games for them a season ago and he averaged nearly 17 a game Played against his teammate Fahhem Moran in the Citrus Conference down in Florida That was the side ball screen that that Notre Dame was working on uh in the shoot around today They handled the first level of it which is the screen They were able to help on the roll but then they gave no help to the helper Ended up fouling at the rim Cole Serta the sophomore hits a three off the bench He is someone this staff really likes and theyre really excited about Cole Serta is a sniper Jack and if hes in the building hes open and he was here and he drained this one Not a lot of hesitation on that He just caught it and shot it and thats what hes thats what hes out there to do Shot just 278 from three last season but definitely not a guy whos afraid to shoot it played meaningful minutes down the stretch in ACC play last year So the staffs got a lot of confidence in him as Notre Dame tips a pass out of bounds Well hes the real deal And now hes got a little bit of mileage under the hood and uh knows a little bit more about what hes doing Hes going to be a lot more comfortable and I think youre going to see that 27 bumped up bumped up significantly this year On the other side LIU has not made a field goal in three minutes Baseline out of bounds here to try and change that Lassu Porter Brown Can they get Davis going Hes defended by spinning and missing Rebounds tipped and Goings has the offensive board Hes inside His floaters no good Another offensive rebound now to the corner This is Davis They work it inside again Tough shot No good Rebound Keeler Here comes Sir Mohamd Defended well by Moran that time Heres the freshman Keeler Nearly threw it away Davis got a hand on it Sharks had four cracks at it that last time Thats not going to Thats not going to work for the Irish Theyve got to do a little better job on the boards Sir Mohamd will inbound here They get it to Ims One of the more experienced players on this team The junior has played in 64 games the last two seasons for the Irish Now its Sir Mohamd dropping it off for Jai and hes fouled Well Logan played a lot of uh minutes during uh Burtons injury last year and hes been a steady player off the bench for the music Irish as you said for the last two years Another one of those Indiana guys A lot of Indiana guys on this team bell The Penn State transfer has been a consistent presence inside for Notre Dame over the last two years He averaged 61 points and 59 rebounds last year His 22 offensive rebounds a game Were 15th in the ACC Well hes an excellent rebounder and a very good defender A great anchor in the back line of uh Notre Dames defense He is a very good defender Hes also for his size a solid free throw shooter up above 70 last year He makes both that time Hes going to get fouled around the basket quite a bit And if you watch him youll see hes very vocal on the defensive end Hes really good Does a really good job of talking to his teammates Davis working on I spins nearly had it taken away but Jai fouled him Davis really the offensive engine for this Long Island U squad The Arizona State transfer like we mentioned averaged nearly 18 a game last year Hes one of the conferences best free throw shooters Also averages nearly two steals a game So a bit of a doit all guy for the Sharks He is he you got to keep your eye on him He is uh got an ability to score the basketball in a lot of different ways Its the first one there Andys going to make free throws cheering Makes the Met a high clip over 80 last season And right on Kiwi misses the free throw Here comes IMS the other way Kaylor now another three Oh its Serta again Hes feeling it Well they must have been looking at the percentages and not actually paying attention to the scout cuz he was ready to go under that ball screen And I guarantee you if you go under the ball screen on Cole Serta hes going to shoot it every time Lets take one music more look at that shot here from Serta Coach what do you see that you like here Well I like the ball going in the basket As a coach I always like that But you can see hes ready to go under the ball screen Cole sees it tease it up Thats just a nobrainer for a guy who can shoot it like him He could really shoot Even though the percentages didnt necessarily show it last year he made 42 from three on 110 makes in his senior year of high school So a guy thats very capable from outside Kaylor picked up the foul for Notre Dame there as LU drops it inside But Fuller Fuller oh had a nice look but it was tipped away under the basket Goings tipped again Davis way outside Nearly hit it late in the shot clock Serta tough rebound and Goings picks up the foul I think thats what you would exactly what you would like to see out of Cole Serta is he can be a 3D and rebound his size on the defensive end He can re be a real bonus for the Irish Hes 65 but if hes rebounding like that you got to figure hes going to see a lot of time this season Hes 65 but hes got hes got hes even a little bit longer than that Heres Sir Mohamad spinning his way inside Wild shot Hes fouled And the sophomore will go to the line Well theyve been the Sharks have been willing to kind of just handle the the Notre Dame drives oneonone And if they keep doing that its just going to be a march for to the free throw line for the Irish cuz theyre driving it in there Theyre playing off two feet Theyve got good poise at the end of their drives and theyve got the ability to get fouled at the rim Yeah theyve already shot seven free throws about seven minutes into the game Thats certainly a rate you love to see Well that support for the drive has to happen a little further out on the floor You cant wait till the guys already at the rim Its too late Mohamd makes one of two there He shot just 40 from the line last season So looking for some improvement in this campaign Now Miranda and a foul on the inside on the rebound attempt Looks like Kaylor dragged down Fuller That might uh that might have been close So thats one of those you know you dont see it until the aftermath and guys are sprawled on the floor and its like who did what to hook and hold here which would be a flagrant foul Certainly does look like Fuller has a hold of his arm But the call was on Keeler So hes going to hes got a hook and hold on the guy that he did they didnt call the foul on So I dont know how that gets adjudicated Yep hes got him Watch number six there hit the floor Thats 33 Fuller who looks to be grabbing his arm a little bit though he does release him as they foul on Keeler and it be a flagrant foul on Fuller I dont know that you can that you can call the foul I dont know that you can call two fouls in this situation music but maybe you can Ive been doing this a long time I dont think Ive ever seen this one come up This is an early one to be reviewing like this Yeah I like it though But it looks like the call might be coming here very shortly 22 to5 early lead for Notre Dame here in the first half Our officials music talking it over Clarence Armstrong Nick Terry and Connor Mooney discussing things Show you one more look at it here You watch number six here on the left side of your screen battling with 33 Now its a little difficult to see there but those arms do get tangled up To see it in the first seven minutes of the first game of the season we have a common foul on six white and an F1 on blue 33 So you heard our official there Like we said flagrant foul on Fuller and common foul on Kaylor Heres Kaylor to shoot the free throw Missed it off the back iron One more here for the freshman taking his first free throws in a Notre Dame uniform Thats that one You got it calibrated after the first one They just needed to see one go in Yeah Hey thats nervewracking taking your f taking your first college shot on a flagrant but not even theres by yourself out there Theres not even any action going on Thats tough Notre Dame keeps the ball because of the flagrant They started off with Sir Mohamd another player another sophomore who this staff is really high on Sir got a lot of lot of run last year Serta again Oh nearly that time but it was in and out And Suir was very impactful in those two exhibition games that Notre Dame played in the preseason Played a number of minutes in both games Just someone that coach Shrewberry really likes Theres Davis inside hanging and finishing Thats tough Tough shot from Davis All the way to the front of the rim changed hands over the over the bigs down there That is a tough one Serta spinning looking for Jai Its the lanky Miranda defending there but no problem for Jai Pretty good poise right there I thought he might be in a little bit of trouble when he didnt go up right away but he kept his cool and figured it out Miranda missed the jam but he was hanging on the rim for too long call offensive goalending Lets take a look at this finish from Kebai Tough just pivots through pivots through little lefty hook Tough finish there from Jai over the 7 foot one Miranda Now from the corner nearly J the offensive rebound had it taken away by Davis and Notre Dame will inbound Just under 12 minutes to go in this first half Notre Dame 25 14 points for the Irish on the other side Strickland led Long Island I should say Depal with 17 Those two guys Rivers and Strickland both first round draft choices in 1988 Well thank you Tyler Certainly a storied history everywhere you look with Rod Strickland in the NBA in college with Notre Dame with Depal Hes a guy that has his fingerprints all over the game 14000 points scored in the NBA Thats a lot of points 8000 assists That is a ton Many people think he is the best player in the history of the NBA to never make the AllStar team One of the rare few to have made an AllNBA team but to have never have made an AllStar team Now weve got Notre Dame nearly turning it over but it was tipped by the Sharks So theyll inbound with just five on the shot clock Five on the clock right here Got to have a plan See what that plan is here shortly Coach Coach R is doing Heres the plan Ill tell you right now Well here comes Burton quickly into the other end And shot clock never started Oh so well do it again Now some confusion Well my guess is they got to make sure that even though the shot clock didnt sh start they got to make sure the game clock didnt start because the game cant be 40 minutes and 5 seconds long And so 8 minutes and 44 seconds in our second review of the game Show you what theyre looking at here See up in that top left corner of the screen the shot clock never moving The clock did move though game clock The clock game clock was moving and the shot clock was not So now we got to reset the game clock to what its supposed to be because the shot clock never moved When we come back though 5 seconds left on the shot clock You were talking about the plan for Notre Dame Does it change at all Well I I I dont think so You want to put the ball in Marcus Burtons hands Hes got a running start in the open court right here and hes got after review we have a shot clock violation and hes got decisions to make uh whether pass it or try to score it Now theyre going to say its a shot clock violation So a turnover for Notre Dame and LIU will have the ball So you can get a shot clock violation without the shot clock actually running because the game clock ran down more than the five seconds Porter Brown That was a tough one Tough rebound from Tout nearly tripped from behind He drops it off for Harelson Heres Sundra Harelson again inside Nearly lost it Sundra pump fake Shrewsbury Harrelson for three Way off Tout the rebound Wild shot that didnt hit the rim either So its backtoback shot clock violations for Notre Dame Well I dont know about the first one but that one is my favorite kind of violation which is you know you looked around you tried to find a good one you didnt find a good one the clock went off and now there theres no transition involved You can just get back and get your defense set Inside its Lassu nearly finishing through the contact but hell go to the line for two instead Harrelson picks up the foul LIU has done most of their damage at the free throw line Theyre just two of 13 from the field Lassie with a quick slip off of that ball screen and Harelson just a little bit late on the help I think hes probably well hes not inside the charge circle but he was not set Lassu was a pleasant surprise for the Sharks last season wasnt originally supposed to make as big an impact as he did but they had a player ahead of him leave before the season So all he does is finish the season with 58 points per game shooting nearly 60 from the floor led the conference in rebounding and offensive rebounding and averaged a block and a half per game as a freshman Hes a long athletic active guy who plays really hard You can get a lot done with those uh with those attributes and still a player with a lot of room to grow Hes still very young as Burton turns it over for Notre Dame And a timeout taken by Micah Shrewsbury Not happy with the last couple music of possessions Well be back after this on the ACC Network without any kind of movement and you know just bounced the ball off his foot And those are the those are the kind of turnovers you just you just dont want The offensive numbers have come down to earth for Notre Dame Theyre still shooting 50 from the floor though Heres Goings for the Sharks Defended by Shrewberry Goings Nice move inside Back out Floater way short Lassu nearly coraled the rebound Its a jump ball Possession arrow keeps it with Long Island Davis inbounds Lassu has it now Heres Goings working on Tout The big man move his feet nicely there Oh nice passing And Liu converts late in the shot clock Its Greg Gordon dropping in the layup Sundra walled off They get it to Harelson at his team Spinning and traveling just going a little going a little too fast Wasnt able to get his feet underneath him and uh the Irish got the turnover yips right now And coach Rusberry coaching him up over there on the sideline Freshman playing in his first game for Notre Dame Highest rated recruit in the history of the program Sundra with the steal Here comes Notre Dame the other way Shrewsbury blocked Coming in from the rafters was Porter Brown to pin that off the glass How about this coach Great hustle play and he got up to get that one I think Braden thought he was kind of on his own there and out of nowhere Mohamd inbounds to Tal Burton thought about the three now takes the three and hits the three Well as we talked about in the open Marcus Burton much improved threepoint shooter Improved last year over his freshman year Improved another seven percentage points into his sophomore year and thats just going to create lots of things for him Porter Brown is fouled on this end Well take another look at that Marcus Burton three his percentage all the way up to 38 last year Well hes been beating him off the drive and you can see he gives him a little bit of a jab step Puts the defender on his heels Whoops Oh youre going to give me that much room Im going to knock it in Burton has not missed a shot from anywhere on the court today Hes got nine points Two for two from the field four of four from the line Coach you love that efficiency I do I do And I think for him hes got to trust his teammates just be a little bit more patient because the ball movement is going to just maximize his opportunities offensively Davis lost it Lassu coralled it Now from the corner Davis again missed it Long rebound and a foul inside That was Porter Brown with the offensive board and drawing the foul Quarter Browns tied for the team high with 11 minutes already in this one Well theyve had a little bit of a difficult time keeping the Sharks off the offensive offensive glass They are they are long and bouncy and athletic and pretty relentless when that ball goes up So theyve got to the Irish have to do a little bit better job of carving out space when the shot goes up Yeah six offensive rebounds for LIU Burton thought about the three Mohamd to Shrewberry Now Mohhamd top of the key missed it long Jai the offensive rebound Burton same spot missed it that time Tout nearly had the put back and skying for the rebound is Gordon cheering Now Fuller his three He got it Fuller makes the first threepointer of the game for Liu And its a 13point game Mohamd has it now Drives Shrewberry takes the screen from Jai Now Mohhamd lost it Porter Brown nearly had the steal Burton comes up with it Heres Shrewsbury TOUT THE LOB CHAI THE FINISH Good hustle play on that loose ball That last rebound offensive rebound that Tout wasnt able to put in was his ninth rebound of the half He has been all over the place on the glass for Notre Dame Fuller for three again Backto back threes for Fuller and a whistle and a foul Notre Dame leads it 308 How about this action in the last couple of moments here back after this on the ACC Network Extra That was a That was just awful how they handled that ball screen right there Thats not going to cut it That is not going to cut it How we doing We Okay were good Okay I The one thing I will say is just you you on those replays just talk right away Okay And one Notre Dame is in the bonus So Jaw was fouled off the ball and makes the first free throw there Hes got another one coming hits the pair there and hes working on a good start Seven early points for Kebai Well you said it earlier about Keba Hes a good free throw shooter and he needs to be because hes in the middle of the scrum all the time around the basket So hes going to get to the line Porter Brown nearly got his own rebound off the ugly miss Heres Burton the other way driving inside working on Porter Brown And that pass was tipped Trying to force the issue a little bit Trying to force that pace Keep a little pressure on the Sharks That was something coach Shrewsbury told us was going to be a big point of emphasis not only this game but this season as Burton gave it away in the corner and immediately fouls J Mo Goings and Burton slow to get up Looks to be okay Well they have done both things that coach talked about trying to do So I think they have tried to push the offensive base and then and in general theyve kept the Sharks out of transition Theyve been able to get back get their get their walls formed get their defensive defense set and have done a pretty good job of uh of limiting their ability to get easy buckets in transition Heres Goings at the line The Slippery Rock transfer averaged 17 12 points a game for them last year Was first team all PAC Played more than 33 minutes a game for Slippery Rock last year He was a very good free throw shooter as well 83 from the line and he makes both there Burton nice move there but he missed the floater Porter Brown has the rebound Gordon now defended by Mohamd swings to the corner Goings walled off nicely by Burton cheering Now Davis defended by Frost Davis step back three way off Rebound inside Gordon He couldnt get it to go Goings was fouled on the follow Sharks on the glass Jack another another possession with three music cracks at it And very often when youre in those scrambles and and youre and you dont have people blocked out music thats when youre going to foul guys cuz youre in there late trying to make something happen And uh the Sharks are just a music little quicker when the shot goes up right now Yeah that was their seventh or those were their seventh and eighth offensive rebounds And heres Goings at the line again This is the first one that time Well Coach Rubberry told us that we would we could probably expect to see a rotation of at least 11 guys and I think were right there in terms of uh how many guys have have seen action on the floor this half Yep Notre Dame has played 11 guys in this first half so far Here comes the freshman Harelson You work it over to IS now Harelson again had a steam Sort of thought about it from a couple steps outside Now works his way inside Missed the floater short Here comes Porter Brown with some pace in transition Nearly turned it over Now Davis as Tout on the switch Works inside Hook shot way off Another offensive rebound Fight for it on the floor and its going to be a jump ball Possession arrow has it with the Irish Sorry when uh when he put the fist out to the side hes calling for a side ball screen trying to get Notre Dame to force that switch and get Mal Malachi Davis on a little bigger guy a guy he can take off the dribble And it it it kind of worked that time that we just werent able to convert A tough start for Davis Three points one of seven from the floor He averaged 177 a year ago He defends Harelson now Harelson trying to use that size off the glass Missed it short Tout nearly had the rebound but Serta eventually tracks it down Now Ireelson defended by Lassu Spinning his way inside Throws up a wild shot It was blocked I believe by Lassu Excellent defending for the all NEC defender Now heres Gordon on two Irish defenders Harrelson couldnt grab the rebound and it stays with Liu Well you we talked about it earlier the fact that uh the Sharks are going to switch everything So all of uh the ball screening that the Irish are doing uh theyre switching it all and the the Irish have to come up with what they want their counter to be against that Heres Davis Sharks still trying to get him going Heres Goings Missed the floater short Harrelson has the rebound Tough sledding for both teams offensively LIUs missed their last six Notre Dame is one of their last eight fight for it on the floor now Porter Brown Harelson Tout Lu ball when we come back Well well get a look at offensively LIU first Davis brought it up quickly inside Its Miranda Short jumper No good Touts got his 10th rebound Here comes ISA thought about it for a moment Dangerous pass to Shrewberry Sundrew defended on the outside by Miranda Tried to find him on the slip but Miranda batted it away Heres Goings Heres the lob Oh my goodness Greg Gordon parachuting in for the finish Well hes showed us his athleticism a couple different times tonight He flew for that one And its under a 10point lead for Notre Dame now Sertas fouled by Goings Lets take a look at this finish by Gordon coach Holy smokes Just went up and over the top of Braden Shrewsbury and its a great pass Put it in the only place he could Seen it from down here It looked like that ball was in the air for about 10 seconds before Gordon eventually caught it They had a they had pretty good pretty good nonverbal communication between those two guys right there Heres Serta from the line Excellent free throw shooter 917 last season Hes already made two threepointers today Well they figured out that hes a shooter and I like the fact that he put the ball on the floor and and made a good direct physical drive because thats the way hes going to get to the to the free throw line U people have got to respect the fact that hes a sniper and hes got to be able to go off the bounce a little bit Meanwhile weve got an LIU trainer cleaning up Isaiah Miranda Maybe a little bit of blood on his face but hes ready to go And Serta just about ready to shoot this second free throw And he hits eight first half points for the sophomore And the Notre Dame lead back to 11 Heres Gordon after that acrobatic finish Quick double team Davis working his way inside and threw it away I think whats going on with that ball screen stuff is that that uh every time theres a side ball screen the weak side is just not coming over far enough to cheat towards the action and then when they do execute it theyre just a little bit late Serta again inside Here goes Tout Burton One more to the corner Sundra pump fake Burton Shrewsbury to Serta in the corner Oh thats beautiful ball movement And Serta pays it off You had a couple different guys turn down shots on that possession to get better ones for their teammates And thats really what you like to see Inside Gordon nearly finished that one And Sundra may have his foot may have been on the line as he came down with the rebound Lets take a look at the ball movement here from Notre Dame Well thats a that that is exactly what you want to see Shrewberry probably could have shot it One more to Serta Sertas had the hot hand a little bit tonight So you want to get him as many looks as you can as they look to dig themselves out of a 14point hole Looks like our officials will take a look at this last play to see if Sundra Yeah So here comes Sundra for the rebound Hes got it No thats Braden Shrewsberrys foot Its a white shoe Its not a or a whatever Thats a lavender shoe right there that Shrewberrys got on He doesnt just know basketball folks He knows the color I know footwear I know Im a big footwear guy Heres a good look at it here You got Gordon trying the acrobatic face So heres Shrews Shrewsberry in the back there Sundras clearly in That is not his shoe Thats Thats Shrewsberrys shoe And so and thats a good thats a good challenge by coach Truz because theyre going to win that challenge Sundra is not out of bounds Yeah Have to imagine this will be a very quick review cuz Sundra is very clearly inbounds there Have to review Notre Dame We got our call Notre Dame basket Burton will take it up for Notre Dame They used to make everybody wear the same shoes Now everybody wears whatever they want Probably helped Notre Dame there It did Heres Burton running ac screens Working on Porter Brown Had it blocked Porter Brown from behind Somehow recovered Serta pump fake Shrewberry lines up the three Not that time Here comes Gordon the other way Goings drop it in for Miranda and he could throw it in but hell go to the line Well Mr Miranda has he has uh bounced around quite a bit and he is a talented guy and maybe hes found a home here with the Sharks Yeah this is his fourth school in as many years He was a highly touted high school prospect top 50 in the country who began his career at North Carolina State then transferred to Oklahoma State followed by Green Bay last year and now hes at LIU Hes 71 and very athletic someone that coach Strickland tells us just has limitless potential and he expects to get better and better as the season goes on cheering hits the second free throw there and they cut the lead to 13 Burton inside floater couldnt get it to go over Miranda Here comes Davis the other way Porter Brown walled off nicely by Shrewsbury Missed the midrange jumper Now heres Gordon spinning and is fouled cheering Zerta is displeased at the call Gordon happy with it Hes happy with it He got bailed out a little bit cuz he was a little bit off balance sort of kind of pulled the rug out from under him but ended up getting called for the foul And here it is here Just Im Im pretty sure that was his own uh his own doing right there Put him on the floor In any case though hes at the line shooting two He makes the first one Gordon is the leading scorer for the Sharks Hes got seven That would have been eight Another rebound for Tout Touts got 11 Bert what a hesitation move and banks it in off the glass Under a minute to play in this first half And that pass was out of the reach of Miranda LIU has not scored in the last 2 minutes and 36 seconds Theyve had a couple of extended droughts in this first half Notre Dame looks to build their advantage 45 to play Shrewberry fell down Got it off to Sundra who goes inside Touts floater just off the rim The follow no good And its LIU ball He was battling down there for a while He had his fifth offensive rebound of the night on that possession Well it started with Shrews slipping and it looked like maybe a little wet spot on the floor over there I would have thought they would take a look at that but they didnt 35 seconds to play 30 on the shot clock 51 the separation Here comes Davis Sharks look to hold for one quality look here Theyre going to try to get Davis in an ISO It looks like got four low Looking for a side ball screen again A good defender to run this ISO on Davis just discards him Lost the ball Three on the shot clock Taken away by Notre Dame Here comes Sir Mohamd Under five to play and he is fouled Great job by Logan Arm I right there to finish the half Nosing up with Malachi Davis out front Really good defensive effort And now instead of the Sharks having the last look Sir Muhammad will shoot two from the line to potentially push Notre Dames lead to 16 Tyler applause Second free throw for Mohamed Not that time Two seconds to play Fullourt heave from Gordon Oh he nearly made it Instead well go to the half with Notre Dame 40 and LIU 25 Coach whatd you make of that first period Well I think the really encouraging thing is that they held the Sharks to 25 points to start the half which means the teams to start the half Well you know you always want to establish your stuff first five minutes of each half And I think the Irish did that in the first half And uh I like what they did right there which was post Harelson up on the on the on the music very first possession and hes going to the free throw line They got to get him going a little bit He was fouled hard there Moving towards that Notre Dame bench Maybe a cut on his face Looked like he got he got whacked in in a couple different locations on that one Good play though to get the freshman isolated down low on that smaller defender Yeah that was very very intentional Went to him right away and he was going to try to score there He was working on Davis He got an elbow in the nose and then he got a hand along the side of the face So he got fouled about three times on that possession And then he hit the ground hard on top of all that Welcome to college basketball Welcome to college basketball And this is a guy that everybody wanted to play college basketball for them He had offers from everywhere Instate Indiana Purdue out of state Kansas Well but he chose Notre Dame Yeah Well you can see it right You can see it Hes just got the size Hes got the athleticism Hes got the ball skill Hes super fast Shrews told us this afternoon hes just super fast with the ball and hes incredibly unselfish He can spray it around You know hes not a hes not a lights out shooter at this point in his career but he does every other thing that you would want a basketball player to do So hes bleeding They got to take him out Coach hes got to shoot free throws here Im not sure what the official ruling is but Serta is shooting free throws for him So his substitute will shoot the free throws here I think in the NBA you have to shoot them or youre done I think in in uh in college you can sub it up Liu throws it away on the offensive end Harelson is into the locker music room so well have more on him shortly Theyre going to have to bandage him up a little bit He took a shot there Sera made both free throws to push the lead to 17 Hes got 13 points Burton lines up the three Misses it short Tipped his own rebound to Sundra Now Serta thought about the three Tries to get it inside to town Gordon took it away Here he comes pushing it in transition Lassu spinning and finishing through the foul Great move by Lassu right there He kind of kind of eyebrow faked him got him up in the air and then spun away from him and was able to draw a little bit of contact Little bit of an old school NBA continuation type play but they gave it to him Thats a good finish for Shadrach Lassu A lot of contact here from Santra Here comes the free throw Well thats what the Irish didnt want to do is let the Sharks get out in transition on them 62 and 12 from the line last year Misses that one there Seeing the free throws there for both teams Notre Dame 15 of 19 LIU 11 of 17 So a lot of free throws in this game so far Now Mohamd the inbound to Burton Tout Sundra wide open Not that time Goings the rebound Here comes Gordon Quickly inside Wild shot miss Tout the rebound Hurt Sundra and a goend Porter Brown goes down hard and a nice job by Sundra to get it off the glass quick and a great pass by Burton in transition for his uh first assist of the game Yeah we mentioned that during halftime though Burton had been scoring well he didnt have an assist Well theyre theyre going to be playing through him Theyre going to be playing through him all the time And uh thats an area that he can really help the Irish with Goings off his own foot and turned it over Great job by Sundra that time Good hard high hedge Put a little pressure on the defender Got him to bounce it off his foot The Shark struggles continue offensively That was their 12th turnover of the game Sundra in the corner off for Mohamd lobbing it in for Tout off the glass Shrewsbury on the drive Pump fake and the finish First points of the game for Braden Shrewberry Great take by Braden Got in there played off the two feet froze the defender a little bit able to finish that layup Shrewberry averaged 14 a game last year missed the last seven games of the season with an injury but before that was on a real heater in ECC play He can really shoot it from outside Guy that Notre Dames going to need to step up for them this season again Tout now battling for it in the paint Bob lobbing it out to Sundra Burton on the drive High off the glass Hes fouled Good ball movement by the Irish that time and Burton was able to get his guy in a long close out and thats when he is at his most dangerous Feels like that ball movement that good ball movement has been a common theme for Notre Dame today Well on the on the possessions where theyre doing it theyre having some success for sure And as a coach you just want to you want to get them to go to that well all the time And as a player sometimes you want to get it a little bit too quick and easy And uh thats when you can get yourself into a little bit of trouble Well no trouble for Notre Dame on that possession And no trouble for Burton on the first free throw Little trouble on the second one Going the rebound This is Gordon trying to drive by Sundra Porter Brown Now its going size mismatch on Burton that hes fouled on the outside Hes trying to put some pressure on him Really up into him And as an offensive player thats when you want to rip and go by because you can get that foul call a lot Marcus didnt like it but probably was the right call Thats his second of the game Goings again on the drive into a crowd and just threw it away No theyll say its Liu ball that uh Im not sure anybody got a piece of that one Didnt look like it Yeah Well he he reached in and knocked it loose and then I thought going might have big enough cheering In any case its LIU ball and weve got Gordon throwing up a prayer late in the shot clock and its a violation Another turnover for LIU 13 now for the Sharks Well for whatever offensive struggles Notre Dame has had the defense has been excellent Sharks shooting 258 from the field and two of eight from behind the chalk I think I think theyve been good in transition Their communications been really good And that is a welcome sign Burton another threepointer Well thats going to be huge for Marcus because they went under that ball screen like we talked about with Serta in the first half And uh if Marcus can just pull that three every time they go under the ball screen Fuller was fouled there Hell go to the line Lets take another look at this threepointer from Marcus Burton Pretty good job by Tout there the screener He kind of rolls in and takes out both of the defenders to give Marcus all that room to tee that three up So its a 20point lead for Notre Dame Fuller looking to cut it to 19 Hes a capable free throw shooter 701 from the line last year Hes a transfer from the Academy of Art Does convert that one and Notre Dame looks to answer with Marcus Burton Mohamd driving inside a pump fake and couldnt finish over Goings Here comes Gordon swinging at Fuller from the outside Not that time and looks like Burton tipped it out of bounds We will head to break with Notre Dame leading up to the Irish in March It certainly can and it helps the net ranking This is the time of the year you want to do that especially in the ACC And for Notre Dame a team that many people have on the bubble of the tournament games like these can go a long way even early in the year That was Malachi Davis with the field goal there for the Sharks Thats only his second of the game See if he can get going here in the second half as he picks up a foul away from the ball Thats going to be his third Well theres one of those situations where we saw the uh the switching work against him Davis ended up on Jai Hits the jumper Little floater by Davis Nearly had the steal there It gets closed by Jai Hard fall for Davis And the Liu basketball like we mentioned before is a guy that was picked preseason all NEC He averaged nearly 18 a game for the Sharks last year Hes got just five today Can he get going here Defended by Burton Drops it inside from Fuller Quick swing to Goings His three way off Didnt even hit the rim Mohamd the rebound and the other way Pass out of the reach of Jai and hes frustrated You know its a game of uh quick decisions and youre not always going to make the right one I dont think sir made a good one a good one there Even if Jai catches that hes moving away from the rim Yeah that would have been a tough one to collect that right under the basket Fuller misses another threepointer Here comes Burton Dancing his way through the paint passing to Serta finds Jai Burton on the drive through contact The offensive rebound The follow no good Burton the rebound in a crowd Mohamed pump fakey Step back and hits Sir Mohamd A step back three Im glad he made that one because he had Serta wide open right next to him and Serta was screaming at him and I was wondering there why he was tapping the chest saying my bad after he made it but that would make sense coach you saw him out of the corner of his eye It was kind of too late Lassu was fouled by Mohamd under the basket Well take a look at this late shot clock step back three Hes just calling for it But hes happy he made it Hey its the contested three here Taps his chest My fault Cole Even though I made it it worked out Okay now Lassu on the other end makes the first free throw But I like that move by Sir cuz you dont want your teammates to think youre not paying attention to them Now Coach Rusberry coaching up a little bit maybe having a laugh about that last possession I guarantee you thats exactly what theyre talking about Funny how much easier youre making those shots makes everything Yeah thats when you do you do your best coaching after uh plays that work and wins Thats a good point People say you learn from you you can learn more from losses Im not sure I buy that Wow that is a flaming hot take from coach Bill Fenon Although youve got a lot of games won to back that up Few few They got Burton working on Davis Good defense there from Davis And Gordon collects the steal Good hands there Now Porter Brown from the corner hits the three and the lead is down to 15 Taylor dropped it off for Ims Shai couldnt find Taylor inside Davis has done a good job on Burton and that continues here Big collision on the baseline and a foul on looks like LIU Davis pleading for a review Well they had about four guys in about an 8 foot square area And here is Burton Jais just trying to get out of there Davis throws himself in front of him I think trying to draw a foul and ended up committing one Notre Dame gets it into Jai Gordon nearly ran through that pass to Kaylor Now Kaylor for three didnt get it to go Hines couldnt grab the rebound but it stays with Notre Dame So I will inbound for the Irish Heres Burton working on 15 points Trying to sneak by Davis and hes fouled Marcus just forcing the issue there off the bounce and the Sharks just they want to be physical with him but hes so strong with the basketball that hes going to draw a lot of fouls in that situation Thats five on Davis So hes fouled out with 1246 to go He picked up the quick one on the baseline a moment ago and then that one may be just a frustration foul and coach uh Strickland talking to one of his assistants there and they may be talking about whos supposed to tell me how many fouls my best player has Yeah you got to imagine that just slipped their mind because with four fouls and 13 minutes to go Well usually you have one guy over there going Get him out of there Hes got four now Frost He connects on the three and those are his first points in a Notre Dame uniform He can really zip it from deep He led the Under Arour Aaou summer circuit shooting 45 from deep his senior year of high school Well he is a he is a big sniper and the Irish have really upgraded themselves in the shooting department How about glass answering there Big man stepping out Now Tout drop it off to Serta He thought about it for a moment Burton on the drive with a bump and the finish Thats Crafty from Notre Dames leading scorer And and that thats where hes really going to do damage The third side of the floor when the defense has moved Hes going to have much bigger gaps and better opportunities to create offensively If you give him any space hes dangerous Tout with the steal Here comes IS He had it tipped away but itll stay with Notre Dame The Irish leading the Sharks 5841 with 1140 to go in the second quarter Notre Dame finishing from outside Lassu Thank you Tyler Thats valuable information on Jaylen Harelson a talented freshman and a good sign to see him back in the game Absolutely And uh another good sign for Notre Dame is Malachi Davis goes to the bench with five fouls in that last se segment Frost again hes two of three from outside Ryder Frost is not messing around Hes hes locked and loaded when he gets it Irish got a number of guys with the quick trigger from outside Well you got two snipers out there at the same time and Serta and and Frost So a lot of space on the floor Fuller filling it up from deep Thats his third threepoint make of the night And again they went under the ball screen again Jack And uh Serta is making them pay every time theyre not aggressive on him on the ball screen I get the feeling you might want to put a hand up when Cole Serta has the ball on the outside That is a nice finish from Greg Gordon torrent action here in this second half Heres Tout Grimes Serta Cross working on two threepoint makes in this second half Harrelson quick pass to the corner Serta not that time I tries for the rebound Serta eventually gets it Now they find Frost Can he do it again Yes he can Ryder Frost has made his last three from the outside Pretty good start for the freshman Pretty great start Notre Dame has made five of their last six from the field Fuller nearly turned it over Now fading away and is fouled Little bit of a delayed whistle there Now lets take a look at these threepoint makes from Ryder Frost Frost a good step beyond the threepoint line Just no hesitation Serta was way out on that one And Frost again stepping up No hesitation Just knocking down that rhythm three Theyre feeling it from outside right now and their threepoint percentage all the way up to 478 Theyre 11 of 23 from behind the line Well when you have two guys that can space the floor like those guys can on the out there at the same time the the the gaps just get wider So its an opportunity for guys that can drive it Harelson Burton guys like that If theyre willing passers all kinds of good offense can develop that way Fuller missed the second free throw and he defends Harelson now Trying to post him up spinning Got Goings on him Leans in and is fouled Just not a good choice by Goings right there Harrelsons in a little bit of a bind You got to make him take that tough shot instead of whacking him when hes really already in trouble Theyre going to say thats on the floor Thats an interesting call That ones tipped way into the stands Good hands by the usher over there And Notre Dame will do it again Harelson on the baseline High for Sundra Its tipped Grab it Nearly stolen away And it is stolen away Heres on the other side Porter Brown He misses the layup but is fouled Well the Irish had three chances to grab that loose one and just didnt Couple guys trying to maybe dribble it up and possession is the main thing Yeah this was a tricky sequence here Little too casual by Sundra going after that one Didnt realize he was under pressure And then Frost had an opportunity to grab that one and whiff Porter Brown missed it off the back iron Another talented transfer as we mentioned for LIU cheering Five of six from the line today Now hes got 10 points Looks like the Sharks are going to extend a little bit defensively See if they can create a little bit of offense that way and trying to make some of these younger players handle the ball a little bit more maybe moving it around on the drive and he got by Miranda but couldnt finish hell go to the line instead take great opportunity again ball hits three sides of three different sides of the floor puts a lot of pressure on the defense and they got the switch there again with Miranda on the guard times and he took and he took did just what he should do which is take advantage right there and get to the rim whacked Im shot 688 8 from the line last season He misses the first one there Misses both Cross Tried the tip and quickly ahead goes Gorton Right by Shrewsbury and drops it in Transition buckets How about the speed from Greg Gordon comes Frost for Harelson working on Fuller Thats a tough matchup Himmes the drive to the corner is Shrewsbury and he was out of bounds as he caught it Couple empty possessions with turnovers here for Notre Dame Pretty good play by IMS right there rejecting the ball screen Whips it across the court to Shrews and and just not not enough court awareness of where his feet were Good defense there to wall off Gordon by Harelson Now from the corner its Fuller This one misses way short Battle for the rebound Gordon Harelson took it away and then Frost or Sundra excuse me threw it away So a number of turnovers there and Notre Dame lead You know as as we talked about during the action Im not sure they knew that Malachi Davis had gotten his fourth foul and uh hes been down for a long time We agreed on that Just felt interesting to keep him in with four fouls in 13 minutes left We both thought they just forgot he had four fouls Thats usually uh one of the one of the guys in the coat ties over there are supposed to keep track of that But maybe they felt like they needed him in there to stay in the game Its hard to say Every coach has a different philosophy on that stuff Certainly In any case hes out of the game now though Notre Dame leads by 17 He finishes with just five points Burton on the drive throws Fuller out of the way Thats going to be an offensive foul That is a small man moving a very large man Burton just gave the gave the uh gave the muscle sign to shrew like can I really am I really that strong that I can knock him out of the way right there But thats a pretty good pretty good job of showing his hands by the defender and he did initiate contact there applause Good call Coach Rubberry did say the type of mistakes he can live with are aggressive mistakes And that certainly was an aggressive mistake Same call now on the other side as a block I was going to say the same thing Jack It looked like the exact same play And uh Im guessing that in a very polite way Marcus is going to say something to the official about you know is is whats good for the goose not good for the gander Hes got his hands back The offensive players initiating contact This is Fahheim Moran who was fouled Misses the first free throw The Miami Dade transfer was first team all citrus conference He started 30 games for them last year Averaged nearly 14 a game Thats a very good junior college league down there in Florida A lot of talented players come out of that league cheering Now Porter Brown whos his teammate now on LIU competed against him in that junior college league makes one of two there and its a 16point lead for Notre Dame Heres Mohamed Waldoff on the drive Serta pump fake wide open and hits Cole Serta electric from outside Gave him a good fake on the threepoint line What we call a flyby just relocated his feet and knocked that thing in Hes five of seven from deep tonight I think I think this is not the first time youre going to see that kind of shooting performance from him this year Hes hes the real deal as a shooter No sophomore slump for him Heres Jai working it around to IMS He turned it over Here comes Goings the other way The layup and the foul Joe Moings fighting through the contact Well the Irish shooting themselves in the foot a little bit and just having a hard time pulling away from the Sharks because of the the little bit of an unforced error there by Logan Bounces it off his own foot Its kind of been feast or famine here for Notre Dame Theyre six of their last seven from the field but theyve turned it over five times in the last three and a half minutes That free throw wasnt even close from Goings He gets it out to Fuller though after getting his own rebound Miranda inside guarded by Sundro Thats a mismatch And Miranda throws it down You saw a little bit of uh Mr Mirandas athleticism right there and hes getting hung on a little bit and he still gets up there and dunks the basketball Creates a little space Knocks it in He flew on this one and Liu has cut the lead to 13 6 minutes to go here in Southbend Well you didnt see it but Logan just kind of dribbled it off his foot Boeings able to get full court and then Miranda slips by Sundra to the rim and then carves him out and dunks the basketball with him hanging on the with him hanging on his back So that was that was a stretch that uh shook the Irish just a little bit as the Sharks cut the lead to 13 with Miranda on the line Yep And heres Mirandas free throw Shot nearly 70 from the line for Green Bay last year though he missed that one See some of the fouls for Notre Dame Burton and Sundra have four which is why we havent seen as much of Burton here in this second half Mohamed traveled Thats the sixth turnover for Notre Dame in the last four minutes Here comes Goings Lu can cut it to 10 here Miranda defended by Tout Work his way inside I picked his pocket and here comes the other way Hanging and is fouled Jamal Fuller the guilty party Pretty good play by there He is the gap help defender and just snuck up on Miranda and able to draw contact music in transition right there Thats Fullers fourth He missed his last two free throws I think when he was up there And you know Indiana guys theyre not going to do that Thats not going to happen that often So hes going to settle in and knock these in applause Kind of stop the bleeding a little bit right here uh for the Irish Liu on the other end is eight of their last 10 from the field Himmes misses another free throw Hes one of four on the night Heres Serta Hes unconscious and that continues Cole Serta cannot miss Well credit uh Ryder Frost right there keeping that missed free throw alive and uh Serta just the just the uh fortunate beneficiary of that bounce Now Going open on the other end and the foul Joe Moings answering with a make of his own Lets see both of the makes here Had the tip back out to Serta just stepping up and knocking it in Goings answering right back and getting fouled by What a bit of a cardinal sin there to foul a threepoint shooter Its just the last thing you want to do Goings Not that time Tout has the rebound Both teams having a little trouble from the free throw line Thats rebound 15 for Carson Ta Liu is 18 of 30 from the line Mohamed had it tipped away Hes open in the corner Pump fakes and drives Almost turned it over but Miranda was out of bounds Well theyre theyre using Sir Muhammad as a primary ball handler here along with and uh theyre theyre both struggling just a little bit against the against the Shark pressure Hes going to inbound Gets it into Burton Working on Gordon Heres Frost on the drive gets by Fuller and lays it in Ryder Frost having himself a nice night Hes now four or five Pretty aggressive confident offensive player is Ryder Frost Oh Miranda missed the bunny and Tout has his 16th rebound Irish four of their last four Inside goes Burton AND THE FOUL Marcus Burton finishing through contact Well he had a he had a little bit of space right there Had the defender on his hip Didnt push him off with his off arm There he goes Got a good direct line Hes physical all the way and just a good twofooted finish right there Shows a little strength at the end of that drive Hes strong for a small guy He is man Hes a package Hits the free throw there and hes up to 20 points An efficient 20 points on the night Coach Shrew said Go get out there Steady the ship Im going to bring you back Im going to get you back out with four fouls Hes still playing on four fouls So we wont see him until very late in this one Notre Dame up 19 Heres Miranda Goings defended by Ives They get it inside Miranda finishes with the foul Miranda feasting inside Long Island trails though Just doesnt have time to get back The third defender has to show a little bit on any kind of roll out of the middle of the floor And thats a guy thatll make you pay if you dont get back in time cuz hes not only tall hes very athletic down there Hes going to if he if he has a chance to get it around the rim theres a really good chance hes going to score Here comes Ims Serta Can he do it again Not that time The rebound Yeah that was a set out of the timeout to get Serta another look It worked He just rushed it a little bit Can you blame him Miranda hook shot Thats old school coach Yeah that was uh theres not a lot of guys that can do that right there Thats a pretty skilled play Frost fake to three They get it to Burton Gets by Porter Brown Throws off the floater and converts Talk about tough Miranda nearly threw it in That would have been an athletic finish Hes behind the play Notre Dame five on four Frost little indecisive there Throw it to Serta in the corner And a foul call on Liu Take a look at that last Marcus Burton finish An outstanding move from the Allac junior Well in in general Marcus is a a very patient driver Gets all the way in right there Gets to that little flo floater right over the top of 7 foot one Miranda that is a skill that not everybody has Jack Ryder Frost shooting some free throws for Notre Dame Now its the first one here Pretty good debut for Ryder Frost Pretty good Hes uh thats his own rebound off the miss there Ringing the bell for about 12 Hes made four threes and a couple of free throws Four of five from the field Burton on the inside Not that time Town finally got one to go on the follow with another rebound to boot with his 18th rebound of the night Gordon inside couldnt finish over Burton Porter Brown It was blocked by Tal applause and rebounded Burton Frost in the corner He hits and Notre Dame leads by 22 transition basketball right The push gets the wide openen three in transition for Frost Here comes Gordon now to Porter Brown in the corner working on Serta and hits it from the elbow Tough contested midrange shot Burton walking it up now as Notre Dame nurses a 20point lead Got to imagine coach Rusberrys been pretty happy with what hes seen from his team offensively as they put up 87 points on a tough LIU squad Turn it over that time though Well he had it he had it in a pretty good spot He had a lot of options including shooting it and uh just turned it over picked the wrong picked the wrong option Miranda for three Missed it short Big guy stepping out there and shooting that one Now Burton defended by Gordon Contact and a foul Burton will go to the line to shoot two Take a look back at that sequence from a couple moments ago Carson Tout had the offensive rebound and his first points of the night after collecting 18 boards before Well there he there he goes and gets it again like hes been doing all night Able to finish it off and I think thats his first Notre Dame basket It is his first Notre Dame basket And its a gritty one And then Frost followed it up with a make in the corner Well that was that one was all Yep that one was all about transition Jack Weve talking about that from the beginning is the push puts pressure on the defense and you cant get everybody guarded Burton made both free throws to get to 24 points on the night on seven of 13 from the field So an efficient game for Notre Dames leading scorer Miranda again for three Missed it short again Shot clock officially turned off and it looks like Notre Dame will win this one 8967 over Long Island Marcus Burke the leading scoreer Coerta had 22 and a pretty good performance You got to think for coach Michael Shrewberry squad Yeah Well you you get to see everything that you want to see How do the how did the first year guys react Are the sophomores acting more like veterans than they were How is this rebounding machine from from Arizona going
