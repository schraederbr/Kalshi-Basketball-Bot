this team is very dangerous offensively so that word momentum a lot want to get a lot of positive momentum going into the tournament next weekend in charlot and we are underway from South Ben M Dame controls the tip coming off a 5654 win over Stanford on Wednesday they had lost seven of the previous nine before that late game victory over the Cardinals matako for three puts it down on the first play of the game for Notre Dame what better way to start senior night for matako than knock it down a three which is what he does has been battling a little bit of a wrist injury all season but didnt seem to bother him too much on that one great start both of these teams have been injury tested this year Notre Dames matako certainly included in that same with Cal theyre starting their eight different starting lineup today and again they are without Joshua Ola Joseph the transfer from inota fifth straight game he will miss foul on Notre Dame itll stay here and the foul is on mat alako well Notre Dame head coach Micah Shrewsberry in his second season said it was just so nice for his team to finally come away with a singled digigit win they had lost four by single digits in the last month in ACC play and its had a ton of close games this year here you see black Shir knocking down to three to answer but its amazing what a win like that can do sometimes especially like we talked about heading into the ACC tournament next weekend where every game normally is close like that a one possession game see Burt get on the scoreboard but yet very very much needed win the other night here against a good Stamford team that theyre going to look to springboard here over the last couple weeks of the Season day going with a bigger starting lineup as Burton wins that back and picked off back to sasoko and a foul on kevay of the shooting variety and M Soko a little bit shaken up lot of contact there with Kevin Jai its part of the reason why Notre Dames going with a big starting five starting Jai and constantini to handle this man in the paint my sooko is a force in there and on that first possession Notre Dame came right away with the post trap so theyre going to force somebody for the Golden Bears to beat him besides number 12 sooko the grad transfer for Michigan State played in four consecutive NCAA tournaments under Tom Applause isza and cow showing some full court pressure early going with the Diamond one 1211 full court right away try to speed up the Irish a little bit Notre Dame does a pretty good job handling it the cow team that will switch it up defensively quite a bit theyll play Man theyll play some Zone at times full cour pressure like we just saw Burton with less than 10 to shoot here he is again with a basketball the leading score in the ACC this year Davis beats the buzz over the Baseline floater he has been terrific David particularly over the last month of the Season he has hes had a terrific season for the Irish and Marcus Burton obviously gets all of the attention rightfully so from a scouting standpoint but Tay Davis has had a great season that is what his midrange game is his strong suit pretty good interior defense there that time by the Irish against ahoko Burton pass picked off by Wilkinson and the Freshman lays it home great job there by Jeremiah Wilkinson just completely read the eyes of Marcus Burton who came off that ball screen and was just thinking pass the whole way when you come off that ball screen you got to first place you got to look is at The Rim almost just Telegraph to that pass on what he was going to do well look Cs record is what it is as Burton gets the n one to go and well have a chance at a threepoint play at the line Marcus Burton has just been so effective all season long just makes the right decision and give him credit on that time did a good job of stepping in and drawing the contact initiated it himself wasnt a whole lot there for Cal but he is just so tough to defend do you switch it do you trap it do you play Drop coverage what do you do hes just so quick with the basketball was interesting watching him before the game he actually took a tennis ball was standing on the Baseline down there doing some ball handling with a tennis ball you dont see that a whole lot but obviously pretty effective something that maybe some other guys may want to start doing too they can play like he does he is lightning quick with that basketball in his hands reigning ACC Rookie of the Year C has been in a lot of games this year in spite of what the record says and jovon blackshire picking up right where he left off and the loss to Louisville earlier this week had a season High 22 against the Cardinals jovon blackshire the transfer from Grand Canyon knocking down a little midrange jump shot you know these two teams are very similar in that regard theyve had a lot of close games that just have not gone their way which see a foul here on tay Davis on the jump shooter something you never want to do but you know Notre Dame getting that win the other day down two with the ball with less than 20 seconds left knock down to three to win the game sometimes thats all it takes its just growing pains with with younger teams we were talking to Michael shuberry earlier today and he said were an older team but our older guys are not ones that we rely on so had to kind of learn trial by fire a little bit this year and gain that experience the hard Music way Music juler but now Julian roer one of a number of Irish players honored before the game on senior day eight players and two managers part of the Senior Day festivities this afternoon in South Ben game tied at 10 1622 to go in the first half Cal and Notre Dame both playing for some momentum going into the ACC tournament Burton Off the Mark rebound to Applause sooko deep three Wilkinson knocks it down and Cs first lead of the first half and this is the start you want if youre Mark Madson they have struggled at times mightily offensively this year have not shot the ball well especially on the road but a great start for the Bears 13 early points in just the first four minutes of the game theres kabaji into the chest of sasoko forced back out under 10 to shoot good defense there by Soko just Walling up holding his ground going to get an illegal screen here I think on Garett sundra indeed closer you got to scoot closer now Micah Shrewsberry in year two of rebuilding this Notre Dame program that has such a rich tradition of winning not only at the conference level but at the NCAA tournament level believes hes got great pieces returning for for next year including Marcus Burton who is headed back to the foul line good set there by another Dame coming out of the timeout just clearing out that side for Mark buron as we take a look at Mark Matson it was it was very interesting talking to him this morning about and weve had a chance to do Stanford this season as well the adjustment moving into the ACCC not only from a basketball standpoint but your first question to him was about the travel and I I thought his answers were very interesting theyre just trying to figure out the best way to do it you know theyre at such a disadvantage Stanford and kalar every other week they have to fly either the central or the Eastern Time Zone whereas the teams out here Notre Dame for example doesnt have to make the West Coast trip so it it was its going to be very interesting to see how those West Coast Schools adjust to having to fly across the country so much throughout the season to your point Cal just one in eight this year in the Central or Eastern time zones that lone wi came in the middle of January against NC State but a much better start tonight than they had on Wednesday night at Louisville sto yakovich his first jumper short and there is kesn on senior day with a rebound well you would expect the second game of the road trip to be better your bodys more acclimated you feel like youve got adjusted to the time zone that youre in and were not making excuses by any stretch I mean it is what it is but it definitely makes a difference for these guys having to travel that much well Madson of course spent a lot of time in the NBA twotime World Champ with the Lakers told us he feels like this is more difficult travel than when he played in the NBA and everybody on his staff still figuring it out theyve met with Sleep Experts theyve met with recovery experts and its an ongoing conversation throughout the season and you had a really interesting stat from doing the game the other night not only Cal the Stanford team but also their womens teams the record of those four teams having to travel back here is just jawdropping but again its as far as we know its not going to change anytime soon so theyre just going to have to try to figure out the best way to make it work 75 of the losses by the Cal mens and womens Stanford mens and womens basketball teams have come on the road this year shout out to my man lee torbin running stats today dug up that Gem and it will be interesting look this is the first year in the ACC for Cal and Stanford and SMU who obviously doesnt have as much of a jump with a time zone change but certainly something to keep an eye on well clearly theres a way to do it UCLA is in the Big 10 now obviously and theyre having a great season so theres a way to do it its just something you just got to figure out as you go inside to Dort left to short and kantowski comes away with it well dor made a great move right there got to the spot but he didnt need to shot bake kantowski didnt leave his feet he just walled up no need to shot Pi just go straight up with it oh Burton drawing contact as does so well and hes headed to the line for the third time already in this game just so quick coming off that ball screen getting in the lane and you mentioned it he just does such a good job of it initiating and drawing the contact and if youre cows the last thing you want to do is send him to the free throw line hes an 88 free throw shooter well David padet mentioned it earlier in this game Monday night will debut our documentary chronicling last season NC State mens and womens basketball teams who both made magical runs to the final four never before seen footage interviews with players and coaches the oneh hour special why not both Premier 7 Eastern right here on the ACC net on Monday night such an improbable run for an NC State mens team that was a 10 seed going into the ACC tournament yeah they would not have earned an that large bid last year in the NC a tournament they had to win the ACC tournament and then won those four games to get to the final four just incredible and they stole bids from other potential teams that could have had an at large because of exactly what youre talking about didnt have the record to get that at large bid and Notre Dame feels like theyre a team that can make a run you commented on it earlier today their shoot around was as Lively as weve seen any team shoot around all year and this is a team with a losing record yeah the morale was through the roof I mean it certainly didnt seem like a team that has had its fair share of ups and downs but Michael shw is very credited as players that he said I coach a great group of kids who just come to work every day with a great attitude you know you got to love to see that when theres definitely some adversity thats hit throughout the season picked off by rer and the Northwestern transfer too heavy but mohamd on the follow and a timeout taken by Mark Matson today helps them in their effort to get that coveted first round Buy in Charlotte next week yeah getting that nine spot now theyre going to need some help with that Syracuse and Virginia game and a few other things throughout the day but if they take care of business here at home he end up getting that Nine Street or excuse me that nine seat somehow thats huge having to play one less potential game DJ Campbell knocks down at three its the second made three three of the game for cal cal a team that only shoots 29 on the season DJ camell only 21 ACCC play have come out shooting the ball really really well so far here on the road foring the turnover on the other end by Tay Davis fourth turnover of the game so far for the Fighting Irish Mark madsons team shot 50 from the floor so far in this game well above their season average in League Play Applause sto yakovich late whistle comes in from Clare Aubrey and the Stanford transfer will get a pair of free throws table before the game and said hey we had two really good nights of practice here at purcel Pavilion before our game today and the guy at the line right now Andre sto yakovich the son of the Great NBA player Pia sto yakovich didnt miss in warmups this afternoon no I was very curious to watch a lot of these guys but especially Andre sto yakovich before the game and I watched him for a good six seven minutes doing their shooting drills I turned my head a few times so Im not going to say he didnt miss anything but I did not see him miss anything Im not going to hold you to it David I guess well go to the video tape later on exactly Cal going a little two three Zone here out of the timeout switching up Cole Serta just coming into the game hit that gamewinning shot on Wednesday night against Stanford and Burton Off the Mark last touched by Cal one Back by Sir muhamd who has inserted himself back into the regular rotation after missing 10 games this year with a knee injury Mark Matson not happy with his team right there giving up that offensive rebound they played a very good possession of Defense Notre Dame didnt get the ball anywhere near the middle of that zone just play catch around the perimeter and nearly a five count here that was a major midair collision by blackshire and Burton who was arguing that it was touched by Burton should have been a backourt violation instead under 10 to shoot for Notre Dame not sure if Notre Dame sees it I think sir Mohamad does seconds gets to the cup Tapped Out by Dort Here Comes dakovich yo off glass wont go and now Alo leading the break for Notre Dame Burton extra pass and Co s has stepped out of bounds Mark Matson begging for a foul called on that last drive by sto yakovich an able to get that whistle but another Dame just a little out of sorts here over these last couple of minutes got up to a good start in the first five or so minutes of the half but these last couple of minutes a couple turnovers almost a 5sec count on ear out of bounds just careless unforced turnover there stepping out of bounds in the corner Notre Dame has struggled with turnovers this year they actually have a negative assist turnover ratio in h Music play something to keep an eye on count not a team that forces a ton of turnovers but so far for Notre Dame struggling to take care of the basketball DJ Campbells going to the foul line for Cal it is a place the cow Bears have lived this year Davids talked about it a bunch already in this game not a great shooting team but one of the best in the conference at getting to the foul line and making their free throws 23 of their points this year have come at the charity strike well Sunday well have the ACC Wrestling Championships from Cameron Indoor Stadium in Durham coverage of the finals being begins at 8 Eastern right here on acc Network in the ESPN app if youre a fan of wrestling you dont want to miss that five programs ranked in the top 25 entering the ACC wrestling Champs rebound kabaj Campbell makes one of two going to stick with that zone and I dont blame him that last possession by another d Thats first time theyve gotten the ball into the middle but Kev is not a threat to shoot that So Cal doing a good job staying it home Alo extra pass and rer bangs down a three how about the friendly roll there for rer from the corner but that was Matt Alo did a great job of cutting the ball went inside to ke alako didnt stand he cut got the zone to collapse great kick out to rer for the three Campbell Applause Music Applause Music Applause heres Burton with eight and rims it down Burton in double figures with 10 how about the last couple of rolls the Irish have gotten on these rims you said its one of the friendliest gyms in America it is I had a chance to play in here I coached in here and Notre Dame always shot the ball well in here whenever we came in here but its a great Arena to shoot in obviously the Irish very familiar with it being their home arena but getting a couple of really friendly rolls last couple of times but again C getting back to the free throw line lead door but you see matako great back cut and a great kick to the corner to a wide openen Roper gets the friendly roll then again Marcus Burton just getting his spot hes got such great elevation on that midrange jump shot hes obviously not the biggest guy guy in the world but he gets such good lift to knock down that midrange jumper six team foul already on Notre Dame one more Cal in the bonus the rest of the first half that was one of the big things that michah Shrewsberry in our meeting with him today during Notre Dame shoot around stressed to us have to keep Cal off the free throw line and its something they havent been able to do so far in the first half been very lucky because thats Dort thats a second Miss there for Lee Dort So Cal doing a good job getting there just not taking advantage of making the free throws but Notre Dames doing a good job so far on the backboard C is a very good offensive rebounding team now other side of that coin is when you dont make a lot of shots theres going to be a lot opportunities to get misses but Notre Dame so far in this game doing a good job of controlling that backboard some may call that pading the stats D page hey every shot is an opportunity never do that no I didnt shoot outside of 5 ft so my chance for missing wasnt very wasnt very high Burton in his bag early four for eight from the floor with 12 points to lead all scores and he has averaged 28 and2 points per game over the last four since Bren Shrewsberry went down for the year with his Applause injury and that was lost by Cal back to Notre Dame yeah Jeremiah Wilkinson looks like that just went off his foot plead for a foul there but Marcus Burton is just so I mentioned it earlier how do you defend him in the ball screen every team has tried different ways to do it throughout the season but nobodys really found a successful way he just does such a good job of probing and not being in a hurry just takes his time getting to his spot and just always makes the right decision Burton draws a foul going to get a go no were going to get a go 10 and its going the other way called by Jerry heer From The Far Side largest lead of the half for Notre Dame at four eight minutes and change to go Marcus Burton already with 14 points in this first half the rest of the team with 10 combined rebound Soko and with two hands drops it down yeah that is exactly what Mi Soko does best just went up and got that and he got it with two hands hes got such a quick second jump just went right back up with it stops a 4 and 1 half minute drought for the Bears without a the year and probably one of the two best players in the country with a legitimate shot at National player of the year the other Janai broom whos in a battle right now over on ESPN against Alabama sundra on the turnaround Jay and rebounds snatched out by Reus petrius the air force Music transfer picked off here comes rer Andre stovic just got caught in No Mans Land There picked up his dribble but he was in the lane so didnt have a whole lot of time just a heads up play by Julian roer to pick the pocket and go down and lay it in Notre Dame after struggling there for a few minutes offensively has certainly found a rhythm petritis going right into the teeth of the defense lays it home and his first point to the contest Burton back the other way with the B no problem drops it in over the top of black shirt I just dont know if you can defend him oneonone especially in the open court hes just hes so under control just showing off that midrange game right now just knocking it down every single time p tritis right back to the right hand back to back for the former Air Force Music Applause star Davis might have gotten away with a little bit of a chicken wing there drops it in nonetheless two for Davis Cal staying with that two3 zone and Garrett sundra is the one whos flashing to the middle missed that first jump shot and didnt look real comfortable in shooting another one I think maybe Notre Dame can get Tay Davis in the middle in there might be a more effective but Cal right now just throwing the ball over the gym fifth Cal turnover heres Burton operating oh thats filthy from Burton fading away in the lane he as 18 Cal just has no answer right now whatsoever for Marcus Burton and that basket looks about three times the size that it actually is right now for number three in white just putting on a clinic from the Applause midrange Burton coughed it up petritis leading the three on two oh and Soko is hammered by Julian Roper the second underneath and free throws coming for Cal good job there by Marcus Burton just reading the passers eyes picking it off going down the other way and right now just playing with all the confidence in the world getting to that ACC logo and not even touching the rim on that Music one seventh team foul another name five for Cal its been a physical first half here in South B C has already doubled up Notre Dame in terms of free throw attempts this afternoon sasoko off the mark and constantini with a rebound Marcus Burton get a quick breather here before this next media timeout So Tay Davis sitting on the bench as well matako is going to have to be the guy here for Notre Dame especially against this Zone but they got to get the ball in the middle there kantowski is in there they just got to get it to Applause him with the ball five to shoot heres kesn eyeing the shot clock fading Applause away black shirt catch and Applause shoe petritis and hes just right place right time so often and just off the mark Music Applause kesn left open thats a three thats about as simple of zone offense as it gets right there go get the ball to the wing wing to the interior defense collapses kick it Opposite to a wide open kesn knocking down the three here on Senior Day 70 Notre Dame run over the last two minutes and change black Shir almost lost it the trius and daring him to take a three hes missed back to back from downtown trus is a capable threepoint shooter but I think he was almost too open that time you mentioned it Notre Dame almost daring him to shoot it which can actually screw you up a little bit if youre that wide open Music Applause heres AO with five step back jumper kzne rebound fresh 20 for Notre Dame and last touched throughout the season especially has been incredible and definitely going to get a chance to play at the next level somewhere whether its maybe in the G League or somewhere overseas but hes one of those guys that dont be surprised if he has a 15year pro career somewhere and makes a very nice for himself but he got to love to see him just give him back to his home country the one of his main priorities as a college student didnt start playing basketball till he was 16 when he moved to the United States not knowing a word of English as Wilkinson draws a foul against Jr kesn his first and that will send Wilkinson to the line where Cal has been frequently so far in the first half 7 for 11 from the line sokos story is really remarkable that Village when he was growing up no electricity no cars he worked on a farm youngest of 10 children a work ethic that was praised by his former head coach Tom ISO well were excited about our next gymnastics meet on AC Network tomorrow at 5 Eastern its all part of the Elevate the stage quad meet four schools all ranked in the top 25 C in North Carolina as well as Alabama and Michigan State squaring off in Huntsville Applause Music Alabama under three minutes to go in the opening frame in South bent Notre Dame with a 3528 lead Cal has cooled offensively still shooting 40 and theres a foul on Wilkinson now going to almost a not a box in one but as soon as Marcus Burton gets the ball up there just faceu guarding him just trying not to let him get it back sokos just sitting in the middle of the lane constant noski not a threepoint shooter or of a facilitator up there right now now just hoping somehow some way they can make somebody else beat him Marcus Burton has just been on fire here in this first half and Tay Davis picking up those two fouls continues to remain on the bench over here got a quiet first half by his standards well that is where Wilkinson heads with two fouls for Cal onto the bench heres black Shure again one and done for Cal good offensive rebounding team but only two offensive rebounds to show so far in this game and theyve missed their last five threes after opening the game three for three from distance briefly took the lead here in South B Mark M would be happy with them continuing to shoot the ball from three as long as theyre good shots I thought that last one not that black Shire cant make that shot but its in transition youre going Full Speed Ahead your momentums carrying into the basket its really difficult to just stop and gather yourself and knock down to three your teammates not set for offensive rebounding like seem to be a little bit more patient maybe work shot clock a little bit more no field goals for either team in the last two minutes Music plus Jai with three backing down petritis and Stripped by the air force transfer forcing a shot clock violation good defense there by Cal did a good job on Marcus Burton on the ball screen and then the good hands there by petritis ke a not quite aware how much time was left there until it was about two seconds and you just got to turn and try to force something up where you going here if youre cow theyre nearing 5 minutes without a field goal another D going in a little zone of their own here St yakovich obviously has been quiet just havent had a whole lot of success from anybody quite frankly until now dakovic stops the streak of five straight misses from distance and those are the threes that Mark Mass wants the ball moved it went from side to side Got It reversed a few times and again you see the stovich I mean his dad is one of the great Shooters in the history of the NBA so you know he can shoot the ball as well his percentage is just misleading he hes a much better shooter than he has shot this year you can see it right there alaka lost it here comes blackshire up ahead to Campbell and it is back to a one possession game and a timeout taken by Micah Shrewsberry we will be right back in 30 seconds and currently on the 12 line they too can move up three spots with a win and some help from their ACC comrades this afternoon final minute to go in the first half Burton leads all scores with 18 Serta short from way downtown oh last Touch by staka and he is arguing with Clare Aubry saying he did not touch it Mark Madson wants them to take a look at the monitor but I dont know that they will its Notre Dame ball and he clearly did not touch that basketball I think what confused the official there was the fact that he chased after it but right there his hand clearly does not touch the ball but you see how he kind of goes after it just a natural reaction but a huge break there for the Irish Irish nearing a fourminute scoring drought on the wrong end of a 70 Applause run Ser of with less than 10 alako lays it home and an unlucky break for cow there thought they had a stop and now theyll get the final possession of the first half thats exactly right that was a big play could have tied or even taken the lead Now find themselves down four off the Miss call there by the official sto yakovich a three rebound Dort two seconds one back by mohamd and instead of a chance to tie or take the lead for C they take a fourpoint deficit into a chance to tie or even take the lead but still to find themselves down only four after how well Marcus Burton played in that first half Id say Mark m is pretty pleased overall with that half to his team his team ended the first half on a 72 run the only makeover that stretch for Notre Dame after the favorable call and there is petritis with a chance at a threepiece great job there by sooko recognizing on the post double team petrius did the right thing just cut right to the rim great pass great finish and that is exactly the start you needed here if youre Cal and right to the free throw line go the Cal Bears to start the second half they shot 13 foul shots in the first half and as a team this year a allowing opponents to shoot 17 per game cow on Pace to well Eclipse that here is Tay Davis goes right to the cup with the right hand sat a lot of the back end of the first half with two fouls good to see him back on the floor for the Irish and I like that right away first possession offensively go to Tay Davis to get him in the flow of the game you mentioned it picked up those two fouls quickly didnt play a whole lot there in that first half so good job by Michael shry getting him involved early wow how did sto yakovich flip that up in a phone booth and two shots coming for the former Stanford Cardinal see here got to respect his shooting ability and then just putting the ball on the floor and finding a scene but again getting back to the free throw line this will be the 15th and 16th free throws of the game under Dame very fortunate though that c has not shot well from the free throw line only 9 of 14 before this attempt for a team that is averaging right around 75 from the line Mark Madson in his second season at Cal most recently the head coach at Utah Valley won two wack regular season titles and Coach of the Year in the conference he told us I have absolutely no reservations about the fact that I believe well get it going in the ACC here at Cal the biggest thing is figuring out the travel in this conference as Roper goes coast to coast and scoops home that was perfect execution there in the Press offense by another Dame just got the ball in quickly and got it up the floor for the twoon one Mark Madson did an unbelievable job at usah Valley you mentioned at the two whack championships and you know he youre never going to worry about how much passion and intensity he puts into the job he coaches like he used to play how about that by rer walking the tight rope flips it to alako still dealing with that WR but how about this Coast to Coast from rer again just perfect execution against the full court pressure and sooko putting a tough spot there but Julian roer getting to The Rim finishing CS just hanging around just havent had a chance to tie the lead yet but playing with a lot of confidence here offensively to start this second half made their first three threepoint field goal attempts of this game theyve since gone one for their their last eight from distance Davis takes the bump and two shots coming for the Indianapolis native good job there good recognition by Notre Dame Cal had gotten switched there Soko was guarding Tay Davis out on the perimeter David just likes a oneonone match up said Im going to use my quickness to get to the rim and Tay Davis being aggressive here early in the first two minutes of this second half after sitting out most of that first with two fouls a legitimate dont you think Contender for ACC most improved player Oh without a doubt there theres no question he has just continued to get better and better the last piece will be becoming a consistent knockdown threepoint shooter I think a lot of that is confidence he just doesnt have a ton of confidence in right now doesnt shoot a ton but I was watching them today in their shoot around earlier this morning hes got a good looking shot and he was shooting it well but hes just so athletic that his strength is getting to the rim and he takes advantage of it anytime that he can that might be number three on Davis remember he sat much of the back end of the first half with two fouls and that is the third on the secondyear transfer from Satan Hall first time as a primary scorer in his career already more points this season than the total combined in his first two years of college basketball is Wilkinson is in double figures with 10 execution there on the underneath out of bounds play just a simple screen to screener cows playing well offensively in this game they have struggled at times this year to score the basketball not shot it particularly well but its not much of an answer defensively for the Irish Davis thought about a three instead takes it to the rack no second chance you bet and thats the one if he can get to the point where he can catch that behind the arc and knock that down consistently he will almost become unguardable you saw just a little hesitation but he put the ball on the floor got to the rim got his own Miss and laid it back in and defensively can guard one through five we saw it on Wednesday night guarding Maxim Reno the 7 foot one Center for Stanford meanwhile Wilkinson is going to the foul line and that is number two on the ACC leading score Marcus Burton and already four on the Fighting Irish and Notre Dame heres got to figure out a way to stop the dribble penetration without fouling right now Cal just putting the ball on the floor and getting to the rim and getting to the free throw line you mentioned already 14 fouls for the Applause Irish well weve talked about it a bit already this afternoon both teams have solidified their place in the ACC tournament remember the bottom three teams do not make the tournament this year but these two teams will make it with a win today both can improve their chances of bettering their seed line going into the ACC tournament this week Notre Dame could be as high as a nine seed and get that coveted first round by they would need a win plus some help and with a loss Cal does lock themselves in the bottom seat in the tournament on the 15 line here is Burton contact no call and the rebound sto yakovich C putting Andre sto yakovich that time on Burton maybe trying to get a little bit more size to try to help defend that midrange when Burton gets him the paint worked that time black Shir off the bounce Wilkinson sizing up rer blackshire at three and there has been a lid on the rim from downtown so far this half for Cal Burton ripped by petritis ball on the deck and its out of bounds last Touch by the Bears mark again pleading his case and like the end of the first half disagrees with who that was last Touch by according to the referees heck of a play there by petrius just to take the ball away from Burton and at first glance it looked like it was going to be Cal basketball but I think after seeing that I think petrius was the last one to touch it so good call there by the officials it remains a fourpoint game in South Ben 16 minutes to go in the final regular season game for both teams look how Andre stovich is just face guarding Marcus Burt just not even trying to let him catch the ball keevi thats a Nifty move by The Freshman over the grb transfer from Michigan State mty Soko well the play was definitely designed to get Marcus Burton in some kind of handoff but Cal did a good job defending it kep a j sometimes you just got to do it yourself great little jump hook there getting to his right hand and I beg your pardon ji the junor secondyear transfer from Penn State and he and sissoko on the deck both gripping their heads and M Soko pointing to Clare Aubry asking for them to review the monitor for a potential flagrant foul we will continue to monitor the situation as kevi remains down a sixpoint lead for Notre Dame well be right back after this I think kevi definitely got the worst of that looked like it hit him right on the front almost left side of his face in the cheek area and he was definitely the slower of the two to get up so lets hope hes okay but it looks like Soko is going to be fine to stay in this game but just a bad break and just a nasty head on collision and remember this is a Notre Dame team that has been snake bitten by injury all year theyre without their third leading score score Braden Shrewsberry for the rest of the season matako of course his injuries have been well documented starting just his first game since early February today playing with a wrap on his right wrist now theyre down Kevin J Burton rejected by sto yakovich that has been a favorable matchup in the second half for Cal Burton still scoreless after he had 18 in the first Music petritis no off the window and last touched by Notre Dame I love the adjustment at Halftime by Mark Matson to put Andre sto yakovich on Marcus Burton s that size even though Burton was obviously able to get by him right there just a great come from behind block one of the most wellrounded players in the ACC only he and Cooper flag have a similar stat line in League Play and that includes defense Soko no good with the bunny patr is fighting for it its mohamd coming away with it for not Dame theres just been a lid on the basket for Cal to start this second half just unable to find anything got to the free throw line as far shooting the ball from the field just unable to really get anything going is one way to get yourself going right here oh take flight Mr wilon with the back we talked in that first half about Notre Dames troubles at times this year taking care of the basketball and just a careless pass right there but give Jeremiah Wilkinson a ton of credit read that perfectly able to turn a little bit of Defense into offense there and get an easy one theyre going to whistle stovic with the foul heres another look at this dump Marcus Burton just careless there and Jeremiah Wilkinson Im sure that was quite the time for the windmill but nonetheless was able to finish it hey man if you got it in your bag you got to show it well thats one of those that if that doesnt go down oh yeah hes hearing an earful but hey give him credit playing Fearless you got to love it 14 points on four of seven the second leading score in this game behind Marcus Burton still looking for his first two of the half Roper extra pass Mohamed Campbell with a rebound three balls to yakovich Applause pretty good look there by Andre sto yakovich in transition just unable to get the friendly roll and is that an offensive foul it looked initially like Jerry heer was calling an offensive foul there and I dont believe it is I think this is going against Cal it looked like the officials were trying to figure out its going to be the second on on Lee Dort the Vanderbilt transfer and Off the Bench forward for the Cal Bears it it looked like they almost werent on the same page and were trying to get on the same page but Cal going back to that two3 zone here Notre Dame did a pretty decent job in the first half getting the ball to the middle there it is Tay Davis back in the game its his oneonone match up and hes going to win that one every Applause time draws the second foul on Reus petritis fourth on the team and Davis to the foul line now he and petritis a little bit shaken up after the Collision well we talked about it a physical game that saw both teams reach the bonus in the first half Cal getting to the line early in the first Music half this is dve his second trip of the afternoon the nothing but net crew is on S side in Greensboro both before and after the ACC womens tournament championship game tomorrow on ESPN the preview show begins at noon Eastern postgame with all the highlights analysis and interviews with coaches and players right after the final horn on ACC net and the championship game is set NC State and Duke for an ACC womens tournament Championship heres stovich Campbell eyeing the shot clock with 10 probing tap out to kesn and again nutre Dame has done it a pretty good job throughout most of this game of limiting Cal to one shot sooko had a couple offensive rebounds but for the most part Cs been one and done almost every time down one of the best offensive rebounding teams in the conference actually trailing Notre Dame in that category today and last Touch by kesn meanwhile during that last exchange ke AI coming back onto the floor and sitting on the Notre Dame bench after a brutal headtohead collision with M Soko just a couple of moments ago good news for Notre Applause Dame sto yakovich Stripped by kesn another Dame has done a good job here in the second half hes challenging everything at The Rim when they havent fouled theyve been very successful defensively whistle and a charge no yeah theyre which is his fourth we take a look at it here yeah thats a good call you dont see a whole lot of charges anymore in college basketball the defender has to have both feet set before the offensive player leaves the floor and Lead for was right there just held his ground great job that is a big fourth foul there with 12 minutes to go Tay Davis second leading score for this Notre Dame team going to spend some time over there on the bench Dort cannot handle the lob itll stay here last Touch by Notre Dame entering a break Zone and still Cal within Striking Distance trailed by four at the half down five with 12 minutes to go in regulation sto yakovich creating space and Bs it off the window first field goal in four minutes for the Bears Cs just hanging around hanging around how do the feel one of those games where if they can tie or take the lead got to like their chances but they just have not been able to close this Gap to more than two Applause almost picked by Wilkinson and one back by alako Notre Dame ball when we return with a threepoint inur from a civil rights standpoint with the Vietnam war going on but especially in Berkeley California and my dad was in high school at the time and has some pretty crazy stories but unfortunately for my grandfather and everybody else in what was the pack eight at the time there was a pretty good program down in Los Angeles called UCLA that kind of had it rolling so everybody was competing for second place every year but it was interesting to listen to my dad talk about going and watching those games with Kareem Abdul Jabar who at the time obviously was Lu Al Cinder and Bill Walton and all the great players that went through UCLA and they just were they were literally unbeatable especially there for 88 games in a row which ties in here with Notre Dame but just a uh an incredible fouryear run there he was actually hired by the legendary coach Pete new who was the coach at Cal WI a national championship in the 50s and ended up hiring my grandfather and they remained very very close friends and uh you know definitely a lot of basketball in our family need this to say so third foul on Lee Dort had to be a thrill although maybe not during for your grandfather to coach against one of the best all time in John Wooden but looking back on it when hes not in the trenches against UCLA probably a cool memory for your grandfather well its ironic when I was trying to figure out where I was going to go to school I took a visit to UCLA when Ben hen was the coach there there and I had a chance to go and eat breakfast with John Wood and he remembered my grandfather and it was just it was really funny and a good call here clearly Julian roer dipping that shoulder but the basketball world is a really really small world and yeah just what an incredible time to to be able to say that my grandfather coached in the pack eight against John Wooden and the UCLA Bruins well that offensive foul against Julian roer is his third and now six on Notre Dame one more cow shooting free throws the rest of the way meanwhile the Bears have five team fouls free throw line could be a major story here late and a tight game for both teams and remember Tay Davis second leading score for Notre Dame on the bench with four fouls stakic to blackshire tough shot over the outstretched on arms of AO and he makes it a onepoint game give jovon blackshire a lot of credit right there that was good defense by Notre Dame just a tough midrange jump shot right inside the threepoint line and all of a sudden Cal again mentioned before that timeout if they can just find a way to tie it or take the Music lead are you surprised to see roer on the floor with three fouls as alako buries a three that was a huge basket there by mat alako no Tay Davis is over there with four cant put him back in the game yet its a little too early still so you got to leave roer out there Notre Dame both these teams obviously very thin with all the injuries they battled but you just got to leave them on the court still have not seen kevi return after he went out at the 15 and 1 half minute Mark of this half after knocking heads with M Soko who has also primarily been on the bench since that in Campbell off the heel did it get interfered with yes theyre going to count the bucket I think theyre going to get a foul here on the rebound to get C oh wow and Mark Madson Mark Madson again does not agree I thought constantini might have interfered with this here right there yeah in real time I did as well and I think they got the foul on Dort youre right thats number four on Dort with the push and con stanowski in the back did that not look like constantini touched that ball when it had a chance to bounce back in well it did and in real time I thought the same thing the only thing I maybe they decided was the ball was below the ren so they didnt have a chance to go in but interesting sequence there and now dor goes to the bench with four fouls M Soko comes back on for Cal Andre sto yakovich again just faceu guarding Marcus Burton that time got switched off oh sto yakovich sends back mohamd itll stay here with seven to shoot for Notre Dame he has changed the dynamic of this game Burton had 18 in the first half scoreless in the second since dakovich took the assignment and where does Notre Dame turn for that second scoring option Braden Shrewsberry obviously out for the season with an abdominal injury the Tay Davis over there on the bench in foul trouble and matako hit that last three but other than that there not a whole lot of support cast from Notre Dame kesn comes into the game right on for Julian rer to the bench with three fouls and knocks down a two foul trouble an issue for both Applause Music teams sto yakovich hanging on the drive short sissoko put back in the foul for the crb transfer from Michigan State how timely of an offensive rebound we had talked about several times Cal just not getting any success whatsoever on the offensive glass but finally Soko great drive by sto yakovich even a little bit of contact but Soko just going up and getting it with five white shirts standing around and only the fifth offensive rebounds of the game for Cal who averages over 13 per game in lead play very very timely sooko now with seven points and six rebounds and its back to a one possession game how do you get Marcus Burton going in the second half if youre Micah Shrewsberry well give c a lot of credit the adjustment of putting Andre sto yakovich on him has made a huge difference but somebody else is going to have to step up here and contribute a little bit might be this guy right here matako knocked down that three cutting it out through the wrist injury has five quick points in a twominute span regularly needing a lot of ice after shootarounds and practices but he is in his final few games as a Collegiate athlete wouldnt want to spend it anywhere but on the floor Wilkinson goes right at him and lays it in for two and if youre cow right now you just got to figure out a way to put together a couple of stops cant continue to trade baskets a cheap hair K sto yakovich the Cal Bears hanging around here Marcus Burton at the line looking for his first points since the first half had a game high 18 over the first 20 minutes and there it is well Monday night will debut our documentary chronicling last seasons double run to the final four both the mens and womens program at NC State made it all the way to the final four the 1H hour special why not both premieres at 7 Eastern right here on the AC n five straight games with 20 or more for Marcus Burton has elevated his game to another level and a whistle against Notre Dame is going to put Cal on the line and that is the third foul on matako clearly what the offensive plan here is for Mark madsons team is just get the ball to Jeremiah Wilkinson and kind of get out of the way Notre Dame faithful and Michael Shrewsberry disagreeing with that call foul trouble David is a major story for both teams Wilkinson now with 17 the Bears without Lee Dort hes on the bench with four they have four more players with at least two fouls meanwhile Notre Dame Tay Davis remains on the bench with four Julian roer on the bench with three and now AO with three and for Notre Dame an injury shortened bench no Braden Shrewsberry the rest of the season we havent seen kevi come back since he took that blow to the Head early in the second half and I thought after that last time out I thought mik shry might put Tay Davis back in the game but again another block from behind by Andre soyak and takes it all the way gets rewarded on the other end what a play defensively by Andre to yakovich his third block of this half alone all on Marcus Burton he has locked down on the accs leading score still without a field goal in this half and he makes it a onepoint game kesn Baseline looking for the hammer and gets a for two and his bounce over coko well I guess two points is two points right you got to love the aggressiveness of kesn of going to the rim and trying to put c and a poster but a good block by Soko just bounced in the rim sto yakovich with the runner backto back for the former Stanford Cardinal who is having a career year in more ways than one for the Bears 6 minutes to go a 5958 lead for Notre Dame Bol teams playing for seeding in the ACC tournament KZ turn around J is silky and he made that look easy it was pretty good defense there took away the Baseline and just used his size on the turnaround jump shot all of a sudden JR kenni turn to feel a little bit on offense he has nine points sto yakovich to Campbell Bang from downtown and the first three for Campbell in this half and I thought Andre sto yakovich should have shot that one in the corner but decided to put it on the floor but DJ Campbell tying this basketball game up another block rockovich again is third block of Burton Here Comes C oh rejected at The Rim mamed sends it back for Notre Dame gets your popcorn ready for the final five minutes in South bed how about the defense here Andre sto yakovich with the block from behind and on the other end sir Mohamed timing it perfectly what a play there to save a basket looked like DJ Campbell had a wide open layup and sir mohammd just came out of nowhere and sto yakovich needs a breather hes been doing it on both sides of the floor meanwhile Tate Davis checks back into the game for Notre Dame with four fouls we are about a minute away from that under four mediate timeout mAh shw B hoping that Davis can make it to that break without picking up his fifth Burton spinning shuffles oh yeah constantini pays it off with a twoand jam a great job there by Nikita constant noski if not standing in the corner and cutting to the basket Burton kind of got caught in the air there but a great find for the easy dunk Applause p tritis and constantini with a rebound I have a feeling Andre stovich is going to be checking back in here but doing it like you said on both ends of the floor a big possession here for Cavs they can get a stop Applause in a break Zone in South Bend twopoint Applause Music Applause game Campbell backing down kzne floats it over the top and Campbell in double figures with 11 a timeout taken by Cal tied at 63 less than four minutes to go on the final day of the regular some help can reach as high as the nine seed gaining a first round byy in the ACC tournament meanwhile cow playing to get that 12 seed currently on the 15 line tied at 15 3 and A2 minutes to go Burton still without a field goal in this half Alo catch and shoot and last touched by Constantin offski that takes us to our final media timeout eight ties four lead changes buckle up for the final three and a half in South Music Ben good shots and huge reason why this game is tied here with just over three minutes to go Micah Shrewsberry has been managing foul trouble really all Game dating back to Tay Davis picking up two early fouls in the first half he is on the bench with four final three minutes in change and picked off by rer tied at Applause Music 63 kesney off the pump fate Splash and kesn in double figures with 11 just simple basketball Defenders flying out at you shot fake one dribble two dribbles little pullup J kesn has had some huge baskets in the second half of this game that has really helped to pick up a slack with Marcus Burton not really playing the way he did in the first half playing in his final home game as in Notre Dame Fighting Irish basketball player one of eight players honored on Senior Day Campbell rims out of Applause Music Applause three Burton knifing red checked it again by stoak his sixth block and wins it back for the Bears this is unbelievable by Andre sakovic Marcus Burton thinks hes got him beat and then just uses his wingspan I mean that is just great individual defense there just times it perfectly and gets just a fingernail on the ball I mean he is the reason Cal is in this basketball game in the second half Marcus Burton was unguardable in that first half its been completely different story here in these second 20 minutes there he is offensively sto yakovich off the window Banks it in playing out of his mind in this game 15 points six blocks three assists three rebounds and he ties it at 65 with under two minutes to play in South Ben I wonder at some point here if Michael Shrewsberry says maybe get Tay Davis involved a little bit I know hes had the foul Applause trouble here is Davis with 10 to shoot sizing up Campbell Davis step through rejected by Soko and a late whistle comes in and the Michigan State transfer cannot believe it and neither can his head coach Mark Matson yeah arguing verticality partner your thoughts as we get another look well the block initially was completely clean there was no foul whatsoever the only thing I can think of here is on that follow through there when he comes down which was clearly after the shot that should be a one andone free throw that shouldnt be two shots that was not a shot on the foul there was certainly contact when Tay Davis came down and sasoko was trying to land but I certainly understand why Mark Matson is upset right there those good defense just kind of a strange timing foul more than anything onepoint game as David makes one of two third foul on Soko both teams have been in so many tight games in League Play often coming off on the wrong end trying to flip the script this afternoon sto yakovich no in the rebound constantini who has a new season high with 12 boards 60 seconds to go in South Ben DJ Campbell nows matched up on Marcus Burton so well see if Burton can take advantage of it not having the taller sto yakovich on him Burton probing lost it and a Applause whistle and that is number three on Jeremiah Wilkinson and the way the matchups just worked in transition there sto yakovich unable to get to Burton and I think Marcus Burtons eyes probably lit up a little bit when he saw that sto yakovich finally wasnt guarding him Mark Madson uses one of his final two timeouts here before the free throws for Marcus Music Burton Notre Dame still has three timeouts they will send Burton to the line and can make it a threepoint game David how do you see this playing out for both teams down the stretch well even if Marcus Burton makes both of these if youre cow you dont need to come down and settle for a three obviously if you get a good look by all means take it but but he got to get something going quick here you want to try to extend this game as much as possible try to get a quick basket got to get it in try to get a trap and then foul you still got one timeout left now Notre Dame has all three timeouts which Im sure Micah Shrewsberry is reminding them of right now but just get something quick but it does not have to be a three if youre cow are you going back to sto yakovich offensively hes been a menace in the paint particularly over the last few minutes well I think you got to put the ball in Jeremiah Wilkinsons hands and get something sto yakovich off the ball which they did last time just tried to get a little down screen but yeah its got to be one of those two guys but again its got to go quick you cant come down and use 20 25 30 seconds to the clock you got to go quickly and try to create more possessions neither team with a foul to give and remember just one timeout left now for Cal who has lost eight of its last 10 games including four by single digits trying to climb into that 12 line with a win and some help meanwhile Notre Dame with a win can move as high as the nine slot they would need some help as well later on this afternoon but have to control your own destiny first with a win and get that coveted first round by in the ACC tournament with a loss today cow would lock up the 15th and final seed in the ACC tournament Im sure at this point cows just glad that theyre going straight to Charlotte not have to fly all the way back to San Francisco for a change weve talked about their travels they have been long and winding theyve been on the road since Monday including a stop at Louisville on Wednesday night Burton makes the first he has three points in the second half all of them have come from the foul line and rims it out twopoint game sto yakovich with the ball 40 seconds to go in South B one time out for Cal and you dont change whatever you drew up just stay with it it doesnt matter that now youre only down two instead of three well draws a foul on constantini his first and two shots coming to tie the game with 332 remaining and I like the aggressiveness to attack the rim and do it quickly it was very clear what they were trying to do get Wilkinson going to his left hand which is his strong hand 80 free throw shooter in ACC play so probably the guy you want to go to the rim and Tay Davis is fou out of this basketball game they changed the foul it is not on constantini it is on tay Davis and that is his fifth that is huge especially if this game were to go to overtime free throw struggles have been a story in this game for Cal typically a very good threepoint free throw shooting team rather Wilkinson misses the first onepoint game and a timeout taken by Micah Shrewsberry so itll be Notre name basketball two timeouts left what are you drawing up here of your micel Shrewsberry well theyve done a good job handling the full court pressure the the few times that Cal has shown it so far today obviously you want to put your best free throw shooting lineup in the game with only a 3se second difference between shot clock and game clock but if youre Cal you want to try to get a 5sec count first and foremost try to get a trap or a steel when Notre Dame gets the ball across half court obviously you got a foul right away but I would try to get a trap or a steel right away a 5sec count try to force the ball into the hands of the guys that you want to foul obviously Notre Dans going to do everything they can to get the ball in the hands of Mark is Burton Notre Dame we have roer Burton kesn constantini and Alo on the floor kantowski not a great free throw shooter just five for 15 this year and they may be sending him to the bench yes they are theyre going to put sir Mohamad in instead hes only six for 15 from the line this year he will inbound the basketball and now Cole Serta checks in as well a better free throw shooter on the floor for Notre Dame heres Burton splits the double stoak ofic goes down and its an offensive foul on Marcus Burton and Cal wins it back theyre Mark Matson wants them to take a look at the monitor for a potential flagrant and theyre going to there was clearly some contact to the face there third foul on Marcus Burton and sto yakovich a little bit dazed Marcus Burton just trying to get the ball up the court with the dribble you saw the elbow to the face there obviously it wasnt on purpose by any stretch just trying to be strong with the ball but there was contact this would be our best angle right here yeah clearly contact from the forearm elbow area to the face of Andre sto Music yakovich so not only will that stay as an offensive foul but do they elevate it here to something else where Cal could potentially get free throws and retain possession of the basketball the question is does the play involve excessive or unnecessary physical contact I think we could both agree its incidental correct of course to me theres nothing unnecessary Marcus Burton is just trying to be strong with the ball making a basketball play exactly hes just doing what hes taught you try to step through when you get trapped he didnt have his elbows out is ruthless as it sounds Andre St yakovs face was just kind of in the wrong place at the wrong time you know but like I said hes been in the right place at the right time a lot today defensively hes been a menace six blocks in the game and youve talked about it time and again his defense on Marcus Burton today changed the course of this game for Cal and it does again winning the ball back down a point with 30 seconds to go here in regulation I think that just stays as a common offensive foul Notre D excuse me c should get the basketball it wont be freeos cuz it was an offensive foul a player control foul but theyll retain possession and then you just let it go and now with that foul Cal in the double bonus so the next Notre Dame foul Two Shots automatically for the Bears still AJ decide Jerry heater Clare Aubrey discussing what they reviewed at the monitor big call here obviously in this game the fact that this is taking this long makes me think that they are contemplating elevating into something Applause more after review the call on the floor of an offensive scenari Mark Madson cant believe it and I dont know if you heard what was just said over the over the loudspeaker here he just threw his clipboard down the call was overturned from an offensive foul on Marcus Burton to a to a technical foul on sto yakovich David heres why well of all the the outcomes we talked about that wasnt one of them I I thought maybe initially that they would call that by chance but you just the fact that they overturned it from an offensive foul to a cylinder foul you just dont see that very often that is needless to say that is a massive call in this game Mark Matson is I rate whats y old saying maybe the ball doesnt lie rare Miss by Burton just for context a cylinder foul in college basketball occurs when a defensive player illeg legally contacts an offensive player while invading their cylinder certainly it didnt look like it to us but nonetheless twopoint game shot clock turned off and one timeout remaining for Cal blackshire with the basketball almost lost it and a whistle on Marcus Burton Julian roer wanted a double dribble and so did Micah Shrewsberry but Two Shots coming now for Cal and they can tie the game what a chaotic final 60 seconds in South B yeah that would be putting it mildly and there was some contact on the wrist there little hesitation on the Applause whistle black Shure an 80 free throw shooter today eight points on three of eight shooting you said it chaos is the word to describe the last couple of minutes of this game my goodness tied at 6 to8 Micah Shrewsberry does have two timeouts as Reedus petrius checks back in for Cal he is playing with a pair of fouls looks like Michael Shrewsberry either going to get the ball over half court here and call one or hes going to let his guys go hes going to use one right Applause here all right so take me through this if youre Micah Shrewsberry because your leading score Marcus Burton has been stifled from the floor in the second half well the other day when they won here against Stanford they did a little twoman game with Marcus Berton and Tay Davis but Tay Davis is out of the game with foul trouble but here in the second half Jr kesn has been the guy mat Loos had a couple of shots as well so I think you got to get some kind of ball screen action with kesn and Burton and Alo is that third option but you said it with what Andre Stak has done on Marcus Burton here in the second half its going to be a tall task but I think if youre cow you got to make somebody else besides Marcus Burton here beat you stay in front of the ball the most important thing do not foul is this a situation where you think about putting Tay us back into the game I mean this is potentially the final play of Regulation he does have no I beg your pardon he did foul out remember they changed the foul call on constantini so they dont have Davis the rest of Regulation well one thing that I dont think teams do enough of and I wouldnt necessarily be surprised to see Cal do this right here right now Notre Dame is drawing up a play against man to man Cal played a lot of Zone in the first half of this game maybe come out and show manto man but as soon as the balls about to be inbounded go Zone can just throw Notre Dame off of what theyre trying to do make them use that last timeout final game of the regular season for both teams ACC tournament seating is on the line for both Cal can finish as high as 12th Notre Dame as high as ninth with a win and some help and that would secure a first round Buy in the ACC tournament in this week Final 14 seconds to go joy stovich on Marcus Burton here but again Jr kesn 20 in white is the guy to keep an eye on here Alo with the basketball 10 seconds alako a three no rebound effort Tracked Down by sasoko C with a timeout and they will give it to Mark Madson and he wants them to take a look at the clock feeling like he got that timeout called before it wound down to 14 that was really good defense there by Cal Andro stockish did a great job not even letting Marcus Burton get his hands on the basketball mataco just forced to take one and we couldnt quite see when Mark Matson was calling the timeout nonetheless itll be about a 34 court length inbounds pass but with 14 you can catch and shoot at minimum might even be able to take one dribble and get a shot off quickly here if they add time it wouldnt be that much more time maybe another handful of TS of a second and like you said you got to go 34 of a court so youre really looking at close to a halfcourt shot of your cow and theyre going to leave the clock at 14 now remember both teams are in the double bonus weve seen crazier things happen over the last 60 seconds of this game a foul puts Cal on the line with a chance to win it another Dame without Tay Davis one of their best defenders fouled out of the game late they will put Julian rer back in and its an awkward place to inbound the ball its about equal with the opposite free throw line but youre throwing it in a weird angle not Dame going to put Garrett sundra on the ball to try to discourage the vision again with 14 you just got to catch and shoot even taking a dribble is going to be too risky for that clock to run out sundra 611 the inbounder Campbell at 62 Chucks it toward midcourt picked by Burton half court heave and were going to overtime on the final day of the regular season in South B Notre Dame no Tay Davis we have not seen Kevin Jai since the 15 and 1 half minute Mark of the second half out with an apparent injury meanwhile Burton did not score a field goal in the second half of regular can he flipped the script in overtime tied at 68 and a fresh period in South B Wilkinson baiting Soko with a twoand jam great interior bounce pass Jeremiah Wilkinson getting in the lane and drawing the defense and adoko in the right spot at the right time and Cal just finding a way to build the confidence and again sto yakovich matched up on Burton and it seems like just reading the body language a little bit of of Marcus Burton just frustrated for for good reason here in the second half offensively only fitting that these teams end their regular seasons in overtime the amount of singled digigit games these teams have played over the final two months of the regular season maybe more than any other two teams in the ACC with tournament seating implic ation on the line blackshire with five doubled sissoko draws a foul and two shots coming for the former Michigan State Spartan right now here in these first couple of possessions this little twoman game has been really good you see just a great little interior bounce pass andoko when he gets his feet going to the rim like that is Unstoppable drawing a foul again off the little drop off pass that last time getting to the free throw line and Cal trying to open up their biggest lead of the ball game havent had many its a good time to have your second one we mentioned how many times theyve gotten to the free throw line but just had some timely misses and that one right there big as well will keep this a one possession game if hes able to make this one Cal has led for just over six minutes in this game meanwhile Notre Dame over 29 minutes leading in regulation but you said it all game long Cal just hanging around Burton will still be without a field goal since halftime but hes headed back to the foul line where he is 8 for 11 today and that is the fourth foul on Andre sto yakovich a major story now for Cal he has been their MVP since halftime there was just miscommunication on that ball screen defense I think Andre St yakovich was expecting a trap or a harder show and it just wasnt there which allowed Marcus Burton to get going downhill with his right hand Burton with a game high 24 he scored 20 or more in five straight games from for the Irish keep the ball here in Jeremiah Wilkinsons hands if youre cow sto yakovich right past constantini or it to the guy that got you back in the game here in the second half just uncontested going downhill with his right hand but now you got to be careful if youre Andre stovich being too aggressive defensively with those four fouls might have been an offensive foul no theyre going to catch blackshire I believe hanging onto the arm of kesn and that is number two on blackshire a good little set here just a little dribble weave into a high middle ball screen with a back screen a lot going on there in the lane but stojakovic is getting to the rim and Notre Dame almost playing just four on four down here offensively because Marcus Burton as soon as he gives the ball up on joov is completely denying him not letting him get it back since halftime Burton is 0 for six from the floor what changed Andre sto yakovich yeah six blocks by himself in this game four five of them coming on Marcus Burton alone just using his size back to a onepoint game three minutes to go in overtime in South B Applause Music Applause T to shoot Wilkinson sips right past too for two that is just four straight possessions to start overtime where Notre Dame has just had no resistance whatsoever at The Rim now just having their way getting in the lane and just finishing uncontested Burton up and under his first field goal since the first half well if Cal doesnt change what theyre doing on that ball screen not Dames going to continue to stay with it there was a show that time but Soko was trying to get back to his man almost set a screen on his own guy on sto yakovich just allowed Marcus Burton to go uncontested to the rim Wilkinson triple team finds Campbell elevating to the rack with a twoand jam as much as Cal has struggled at times this year offensively here in this overtime they just have an answer for everything we have not seen offense like this all season from Cal on the road just one for eight in the Central and Eastern time zones kesn no and Soko the rebound this is a huge possession here if youre Notre Dame its a threepoint game give up of any kind of points here it all becomes a twopossession ball game you got to give some resistance at The Rim Wilkinson knifing short and the rebound kesn constan oi giv just enough resistance oh AO goes Coast to Coast onepoint game in South B and a minute to play in OT minute minute sto yakovich yes off the window he has been money with the right hand in the paint this afternoon I you just cannot say enough about the half that the overtime that Andre St yakovich has had just to will his team back into this game Burton from downtown ties it at 79 Applause mohamd just checking in for Notre name kesn and alako on the floor for the Fighting Irish here we go final 35 seconds and change in OT sto yakovich with five Campbell at three no rebounds to sooko Final 5 seconds and a timeout taken by Madson and wisely so uses his final timeout of overtime and the officials will likely re view the monitor just to make sure there are in fact 33 seconds left but itll be Cal basketball this time though unlike the end of regulation theyll have the ball in the front court with a chance to win it yeah itll be taken out right there on the side in front of Notre Dames bench but good defense there excuse me cows bench but good defense there by Notre Dame forced to yakovich to kick it DJ Campbell I thought should have shot the first one right there shoot that one gave a little shot fake and kind of lost his footing but great great job by m Soko to keep that ball alive and track it down and plenty of time here can make a pass can take a couple of dribbles if you need to but get something going to the rim too many times in situations like this we see just a bad fallway three desperation get something going to the basket to try to draw contact and at the very worst get to the free throw line Cal without a timeout both teams the double bonus Arrow favors Notre Dame tied at 79 winner improves their opportunity for a better seed in the ACC tournament Campbell the inbounder to sto yakovich for the win OT number two coming your way next in South B Marcus Burton meanwhile has played Play 41 minutes and has 29 Points five straight games with 20 or more hes averaged nearly 30 over the last five games and Cal Begins the second overtime with the basketball sto yakovich Wilkinson a three and Burton the rebound another Dame doing a better job these last couple of possessions defensively of forcing Andre stovich to get rid of the ball daring somebody else to beat him kzne walled off by sto yakovich heres aako playing in his final regular season Collegiate game the grad transfer from Princeton doubled to constantini with the left hand to beat the buzzer and Notre Dame grabs the lead to start the second overtime that was a great job by mat alako to not panic with the shot clock running low M Soko came over to double basically left constantini wide open near the rim but a great find by mat Applause alako blackshire jumper and kantowski adds to his season High rebound total he has 12 this afternoon Andre stojakovich is on Jr kzn now just got switched on to Marcus Burton because of the screen Burton puts it past to yakovich largest lead of either OT for Notre Dame the offens has played Cal all year long and bad time for them to go again just been a basket on the excuse me a lid on the basket here to start this second overtime you just feel with the way this game has been played they need a bucket here 10 to shoot welin in a deep three puts it down to make it a onepoint game and a huge basket at a time when they needed it most like you said just a kind of a broken play had no choice really to Just Let It Go J Dame gets a stop there and comes down to score this game might be over that is a huge three by Jeremiah Applause Wilkinson Burton sitting on 31 and hes headed back to the F line where he has lived this afternoon already 10 for 13 from the strike thats the fourth foul on mty Soko Marcus Burton just does such a great job when he gets in there of drawing the contact as a big guy that could be frustrating because you feel like youre going vertical and he initiates the contact getting into you and just gets the whistle its a skill to be able to draw fouls like Applause that really picked up where he left off there in that first half and a new career high for Marcus Burton the leading score in the ACC this year as 33 threepoint Notre Dame lead two minutes and change left in the second overtime ACC tournament seating on the line for both Applause teams black Shir wall off almost lost it sto yakovich Tap Out secured by alako and Burton slows the pace for andd well youre not going to get a much cleaner look there if youre Cal Andre sty yakovich is wide open just unable to knock it down in a huge possession here Bang from downtown Burton with a triple well Marcus Burtons midrange game has been Unstoppable in this basketball game but until overtime had not shot it well from behind the arc with just taking what the defense gives him if youre going to back up Im going to shoot it and has just come up with some huge timely baskets give Notre Dame the sixpoint lead here hes just simply not allowed to get tired Mike shry just will not allow it Burton has played a game high 44 minutes excuse me a team High 44 minutes meanwhile the guy who defended him the whole second half Andre sto yakovich has played 45 minutes to lead all Cal Bears Mark matsons team in a pickle here down two possessions with one 37 to go the you need to three at this point no not yet theres still a minute 37 left you can extend the game but again you just got to go quickly now they dont have any more timeouts that was the last timeout for Cal so a lot had to be covered in that last huddle got to get something going quickly if you score get your fullcourt defense set up if you dont youre going to have to look the foul and just try to extend this game Applause Wilkinson knocks in a three he has had a response for every major Burton bucket in this overtime and cuts it back to a one possession game double on Burton and Notre Dame does have the arrow so they will maintain possession keep in mind now because the ball was inbounded JR kesn cannot move now you see a huge three here by Jeremiah Wilkinson which means that Cal now they dont have to foul now its still a onep possession game you do not have to foul old teams in the double bonus no timeouts left for Cal two for Notre Dame they get it across the timeline quickly and now Burton with 20 seconds to shoot by Marcus Burton I am not giving this ball up unless I am just flat out strapped Soko hedging double heres alako eyeing the shot clock five to go fadeaway jumper no sissoko has it STS kesn Off the Mark and coko Taps it to Wilkinson a chance to tie for Cal Soko lays it in counted in the foul and a chance to tie it at the line for the gr transfer from Michigan State what a chaotic sequence there on both ends of the court but a heads up play by jovon blacksher and not a whole lot of contact at all right there I can certainly understand why this crowd is not happy with that call as physical as this game has been that was pretty Ticky Tac there its ahoko going to the free throw line chance to tie the game today he is four of six a 68 free throw shooter on the season entering the afternoon a chance to tie it with a m 88 a piece two timeouts for Notre Dame will Micah Shrewsberry use one he might have to here and they will to avoid the five second Music count tell you what man not Dames played backtoback games at home to close the regular season they won with 18 seconds left a gamewinning shot against Stanford on Wednesday night threepointer by Cole Serta a chance now to win it on senior day at home in OT where you going offensively and when do you decide to go with 29 seconds left that in a moment heres the last two plays by Cal C just oneing it seemed like they were down and out down six Jeremiah Wilkinson knocks down the three to cut it the three which allowed Cal to not have to foul and obviously the crowd not very happy with that call but nonetheless Mi Soko finishing with a threepoint play to tie it up but to answer your question you just got to continue to stay with that high ball screen Marcus Burton just last time Cal trapped it they did a good job of forcing Burton to give it up but JR kesn and mat alako one of those three guys has to try to win the game for you right here but again very similar to the ending of the first overtime with the shot clock off you do not want to go too early and give Cal a chance to somehow score here sir mohamd can run the Baseline shot clock turned off Alo gets it across and now Burton can hold for the final shot if he so chooses sitting on a careerhigh 36 if Im Cal right now excuse me if Im Notre Dame I just one for flat keep everybody flat let him go to work right now youre bringing the Trap into play 5 Seconds Burton the kick to Sera Wilkinson that will not count from petritis and were going to Triple OT in South Applause Ben teams with a win can improve their chances of bettering their ACC tournament seating and here we go C wins the tip in the third overtime in South Ben talked about Marcus Burtons 36 points jeremi Wilkinson 27 in his zone right give him three more a 30 piece for the Freshman who has been Sensational how timely have those last two threes been by Jeremiah Wilkinson ties a career high the second leading freshman scorer in the ACC behind only Cooper flag and now Burton with the basketball for Notre Dame kesn off the bounce had it Stripped by Wilkinson blackshire up to Campbell through contact brought by kesn wideopen three Wilkinson how about that block by Jr kesn to save a b right there if there is one word to describe the last 30 minutes of basketball here it is chaos Burton off the catch and shoot thats a three 39 for Marcus Burton and a new Notre Dame record for points in an ACC Applause game 91 a piece with 3 and 12 minutes to go heres dakovic defended by alako crowd wanted to travel Wilson bumped and draws a foul on Julian roer and that is number four on the secondyear Northwestern transfer JR kesn saving a basket that would have made this a fivepoint game and on the other end who else surprise surprise Marcus Bert knocking down his third three of the game tie it back up what perseverance by Marcus Burton who finished the second half 0 for six from the floor he scored seven in each of the first two overtimes and knocks down a big three to tie it for Notre Applause Dame and how about the play of Jeremiah Wilkinson did not begin the year as a starter The Freshman from Powder Springs Georgia jumped into the starting lineup over the last 13 games and has averaged nearly 20 a game since gives k a onepoint Music lead Alo elbow J no Soko the rebound Soko with a double double 13 points 12 rebounds 13 t eyes seven lead changes if youre just joining us Cal trailed for much of Regulation but maintain Striking Distance almost picked by rer still tend to shoot sto yakovich Ando the rebound playing with an injured right wrist in his final regular season game as a Collegiate athlete has been nothing short of a warrior for Notre Dame well fatigue certainly stting to set in for both teams offensively you can just tell shots are starting to hit the front of the rim those legs are getting really tired on sanosi the offensive rebound alako back out to Burton five to shoot Burton a three yes are you kidding me right now 42 for Marcus Burton ties an ACC season high with Cooper flag sto yakovich ties it at 94 and a chance to take the lead taking the bump hes headed to the line for a threepoint Applause play it was a great pass to the corner and a great job putting the ball on the floor and again not a lot of contact Music in fact no contact whatsoever as far as we could tell on those replays but a great job by Andre stojakovich of finishing well sto yakovich this year team best 82 from the line chance to get Cal the lead cannot tied at 94 with a minute and a half to Applause go that time Notre Dame staying in the Trap kzne no tap out and a whistle against Notre Dame Micah Shrewsberry cannot believe it on the re B attempt and it is number four on Nikita constantini so four on rer four on constan owski and remember Tay Davis fouled out for Notre Dame at the end of regulation and so M sasoko will go to the line for the cow bears not very often in a situation like this do you see it over the back call unless Soo going to the Freo line Applause Music Applause Music Rus petrius comes on Joon blacker Jr still one more free throw to go for sissoko onepoint Applause game Marcus Burton has been the star all season for Notre Dame the accs leading score with a game high 42 and he draws a foul is that on sto yakovich if it is that is number five yeah it definitely was and theyre going to get it on the floor but nonetheless two shots that is a big loss for Cal not only because of what sto yakovich has done defensively on Burton but David he has 21 points for the Bears today yeah they just simply cannot afford that loss right now and Marcus Burton just using his quickness get into his right hand give Andre sakovich credit he was a huge reason why Cal was able to get back into this game big reason why theyve even gotten to this point but hate to see this game end for him in that way and that puts even more pressure on Jeremiah Wilkinson try to carry the offensive load for Cal well the previous season high for points in a game this year by an ACC player was 42 by kooper flag against Notre Dame yeah Marcus Burton is one point away from breaking that this afternoon against Cal in triple OT and fatigue again anytime you start missing those shots Applause short and a new season high is owned by the sophomore from Misha Indiana tied at 95 less than 60 seconds to go in triple Applause Music Applause overtime Campbell a contested three Roper the rebound about a 10sec differential between game and shot clock here two timeouts for Notre Dame one for Music Cal DJ Campbell just trying to flat out deny Marcus Burton from Catching the ball doing a pretty good job so far and Michael shrewbury is going to get a timeout so one remaining for each team both in the double bonus and the arrow points to Notre Dame everybody in the gym thinks youre going to Marcus Burton do you think about going anywhere else if your mic is Shrewsberry no you got to get the ball in his hands and it may even be a situation where you have him take the ball out might be easier to get it back to him if he takes the ball out of bounds Cs going to try to just completely deny him face guard him if not put two people on him but no if youre Michel shwb you got to leave the ball in the hands of number three here and just get him something even as simple as a high ball screen to see if he can get going or even a 1 14 flat clear out type situation just let him use his quickness to his Advantage either way if youre Cal you have to rebound the Miss and give yourself a chance if there is a Miss to have the final possession a triple overtime you still got the one time out so if you get a clean rebound Mark mats may call the timeout to get what he wants you said at about a 9sec almost 10second difference here and Marcus Burton is taking the ball out of bounds sto yakovich out of the game for Cy with five fouls tied at 95 10 to shoot for Notre Dame Burton trying to get free instead its aako into Blacker yes by the gr transfer and a whistle comes in from Claire Aubry she wants to check the game clock as alako took a bump at the end of that tap but what a warrior playing through an injured right wrist you see the wrap on his hand puts the game on his back and gives Notre Dame the lead well clearly they were trying to get Marcus Burton coming off that little pin down opposite but mataco took one look at it and said its not open and the defense was so lifted because of the attention that Marcus Burton was drawing that he had a wide open Lane to the rim and a great finish certainly looked like there may have been some contact but nonetheless not Dame with a twopoint lead here each team basically gets a free timeout because of the review on the clock and they do add 610 of a second to the game clock they did take that timeout off the board for Cal Mark Matson was trying to call timeout but Claire Aubrey stopped it to review the clock and shes telling them that you still have that one timeout so they will add a timeout for Cal and if youre Mark Madson thats huge because youve got to inbound it and go the full length of the Court here if you dont get something right away you can use that timeout and set something up in the half court 15 ties 10 lead changes 10 lead changes not Dame is Led for almost 34 minutes in this game game Cal just hung around the entire second half to force overtime and now they have a chance to tie it or win it at the end of triple OT Wilkinson the inbounder has the basketball with 10 to go Wilkinson barreling his way to the cup and ties it at 97 one timeout left for Notre Dame 56 to play and Micah Shrewsberry will use the final timeout what a take by The Freshman from Powder Springs Georgia I love it just put your head down and say I am going to get to the rim and finish just pure determination there by Jeremiah Wilkinson getting to the rim to tie the game up but if youre Notre Dame here plenty of time left with almost 6 seconds to make a couple of passes take a couple of dribbles and as quick as Marcus Burton is with the basketball he can get the length of the floor in 5 seconds thats not a problem but if youre C yous got to keep everything in front of you here I mean this game has been unbelievable everything you could hope for or more David padet in a regular season finale on senior day for Notre Dame honoring eight seniors or grad students plus two managers you know theyd love to send these seniors In This Crowd out with a final win to cap the regular season and a chance for both teams here to improve their tournament seating Burton the inbounder instead he shuffles it to muhammd 5 Seconds no timeouts alako for the win we going to 40s in South Ben is that not fitting on how this games going hes ready to go man hes playing in his final regular season game as a Collegiate athlete constantini the grad transfer from Ukraine and it is C winning the tip Wilkinson kicks to Campbell and kantowski with the rebound season ey 14 make it 16 I think everybody in the arena needs second to catch their breath all have been standing at the end of each of the previous three overts at the end of that last overtime marus Burton just put his hands on his knees almost in disbelief as much as anything black Shire makes the first bucket on the 4th o Blacks going to have to step up a little bit obviously with st yakovich out of the game Wilkinsons going to be getting all of the attention defensively by Notre Dame rer playing with four fouls sets a screen for AO 10 to shoot for Notre Dame a three and Alo rims it out that b was halfway down before that thing came back Applause out Campbell off the bounce defended by Burton Burton fouled him counted in the foul and just a a silly foul there just to reach in Campbell was almost dead in the water just had to force it up you just dont want to reach in in a situation like that and if youre going to foul him foul him dont let him score the basket make sure doesnt even get the shot up to the rim that is number four on the accs leading Music Applause scorer who has an ACC season High 43 in the game today and the largest lead of OT for Cal 10197 three minutes and change to go Burton off the bounce doubled rejected maintains the ball five to shoot kesn shuffled constantini shot clock did reset Alo draws a foul boy that was a late shot clock reset well after Notre Dame kicked it out to alako and now he will go to the line for two shots and that fouls out mon Soko and he cant believe it giving AJ toai an earful playing in his final regular season game as a Collegiate basketball player and hell have to watch the rest from the bench and Lee Dort whos going to come in also has four fouls of his own and I dont blame Mar Soko theres no fouled there and theres been some as physical as this game has been there has been some very touchy foul calls both ways here in these overtimes so now C is without Mi Soko their 69 240 lb interior enforcer theyre without Andre sto yakovich as well who fouled out with Music 21 and was excellent defensively in the second half on Marcus Burton Notre Dames leading score without a field goal in the final 20 minutes of Regulation back to a twopoint game 250 to go Wilkinson probing black shirt takes the bump rebound petritis and is that the fifth foul on Burton yes it Music is so the sophomore from Mishiwaka will foul out with an ACC season High 43 just an offensive rebound another Dame played pretty good defense this crowds going to give Marcus Burton a standing ovation rightfully so what a performance what a tough way for this game to end for that young man Michael shry let Jerry heer have an earful then Applause some 21 of Burtons 43 came in overtime this has become a war of attrition two players have fouled out for Notre Dame Tay Davis Marcus Burton they top two scores two players have fou out for Cal sto yakovich and cissoko and multiple remain in the game with four fouls back to a fourpoint lead for Cal two and a half minutes to go in the 4th o just the second time in cow Bears basketball history playing this long of a game the other in 1960 heres constantini spins it puts it off the window for two to say how much that changes the entire complexion of what Notre Dame is going to do Applause offensively but a huge basket there to make it a one possession game again by constant noski Applause Here Comes kesn shuffles the co Serta and a chance for Notre Dame to take the lead on a three by Applause alako well who else do you expect to step up on Senior Day Matt a lot has not shot the ball particularly well in this game but absolutely Fearless right there knocks down a huge three give the Irish a onepoint lead with just under 2 minutes to go and you got to love that by matako he knows Marcus Burton is out of the game so somebody else is going to have to step up and he was not shy whatsoever to do so returned on Wednesday against Stanford after missing six of the previous seven games with a wrist injury gutted it out out for seven points seven rebounds today he has 19 and we talked to michah Shrewsberry before the game and he said nobody outside our program knows how much pain matako is in just to practice just to play Ice wraps and all kinds of treatment all night before game day he wouldnt miss this one his final regular season game in a Collegiate uniform well and obviously its affected his shot that goes without saying but you just got to love the fearlessness to just step up and knock that down now if your Cal Jeremiah Wilkinson Julian roer has got the assignment trying to stop him if you Notre Dame you got to rebound the ball theyve given up a couple timely offensive rebounds in these overtimes got to limit count of one shot heres Wilkinson for three Banks it in come on Wilkinson with 36 and Cal Reg gains the lead with 90 seconds to go in the first four overtime game ever in the history of the ACCC regular season youve got to be kidding me right Applause now AO eye in the clock 8 seconds fadeaway jumper puts it down tied at 106 60 seconds to go one timeout for each team both in the double bonus Notre Dame with the arrow black Shir Shuffle Dort with the hammer whoa Applause how about that pass by blacker that play was dead in the water and just a late drop off to dork for the hammer finish David thats his first field goal of the game and it gives k a twopoint lead 4 second differential between game and shot a loto for three Applause well to say that matako has stepped up big time would be the understatement of the season so far just absolutely putting this team on his back with Marcus Burton fouling out of the game and knocking down another massive three to give nutre Dame a onepoint lead I could not believe cow just didnt switch that ball screen decided not to and Matt alako made him pay for it and whats going to happen next just when we think weve seen it all nine of aos 24 points in the fourth overtime with Marcus Burton on the bench and now with one with no no timeouts left for Cal and 15 seconds to go they Trail by one the Continental coplayers of the game Jeremiah Wilkinson for Cal with a team High 36 and Marcus Burton with a new ACC season High 43 in spite of fouling out he will watch the final 15 seconds of the fourth overtime From the Bench Cal without a timeout has to go the length of the floor a bucket to win it for the Bears you got to go quick here cuz if you miss you got to give yourself an extra opportunity you dont want to let this clock run all the way down Wilkinson spinning defended by alako he stepped out of bounds back to Notre Applause day Cs got no timeouts left cant set up their defense other than scramble mode right here but good defense by who else matal lock forcing The Freshman to go Baseline just lost control of it Notre Dame does have one time out with a foul they will shoot two Logan Imes checks in for the first time in this game to add another free throw shooter to the mix for Notre Dame and Sir mohamd cannot run the Baseline right here that was not a made basket obviously got to stand still gets it in Serta almost lost it and Dort is fouled out the third cow bear to foul out in this game and he sends Cole certa to the line now the question becomes if Serta is able to knock down both of these free throws does Notre Dame foul if theyre up three whats your philosophy on that absolutely its a perfect time just under 5 seconds if theyre able to make both of these free throws as soon as cow gets the ball in bounds you foul right away Music but we got a lot to get to before we even get to that point so the way this game has gone 45 is an eternity Spencer Mahoney is going to check into the game here well Cole Serta goes to the line this year he is 9 for 10 from the strike Knocks down the first this game tipped over 4 hours ago 3 hours ago I beg your pardon feels like four Applause hours threepoint game and micel Shrewsberry will burn his final timeout so if Notre Dame fouls and cow goes to the line for Two Shots you try to make the first Miss the second if youre the Bears you probably have to at this point because theres going to be at least a half a second if not more that will come off the clock so youre just not going to have time to to play the free throw game again you know interesting I didnt know if Mah Shrewsberry would use a timeout right there because he was able to huddle the other four guys that werent shooting and now you give Mark Matson the chance to draw something up where they didnt have a timeout be very curious to see if they do foul here M shry obviously with a lot of NBA background coing with the Celtics and Brad Stevenson excuse me Brad Stevens Im losing my mind I cant even remember coach names anymore has it been 3 hours has it been four hours nobody knows very curious to see what Notre Dame does here but if Im Notre Dame I absolutely foul on the catch right away let the officials know that that is your plan so they are not surprised and theyll be quicker to blow the whistle no timeouts left for either team both in the double bonus Notre Dame with the arrow up three and matako just now told all the officials that theyre going to foul on the catch very smart to do that theyll be much quicker to blow the whistle what a star he has been in the 4th o nine points for Alo this period plus the potential gamewinning stopped defensively 45 to go Wilkinson the inbound gets it into money it was fouled immediately by eyes and now theyre going to have to check the game clock because I believe more time came off after the whistle and an ACC play Spencer Mahoney is only one for two from the free throw line its interesting he was seemingly the first option for Wilkinson streaking down the sideline right in his perview they were trying to Jeremiah Wilkinson took the ball out of bounds what they were trying to do is hit Mahoney hit it right back to Wilkinson to get it some momentum but Notre Dame was smart they fouled before he could even make the pass seconds here yes they add a second and a half to the game clock here yeah I think back to your question I think you try you make the first one I think you have to try to miss the second one theres just not enough time to foul M Dame again another Dame going to put their best rebounding team in the game the strategy here Mahoney pulling petritis in as well as Campbell and this is where youd love to have M Soko if youre cow but he fouled out in the third over time well you got to be careful here if youre jovon blackshire and Jeremiah Wilkinson you cant go in until the ball hits the rim from the top of the key and he made it never fails still a one point game with 4 seconds to go mohamd running the Baseline with no timeouts into sundra and he is fouled with 32 remaining and sundra this year is just eight for nine from the free throw line and that is the Fort foul on the cow Bears leading score Jeremiah Music Wilkinson with 32 left if he makes both of these I still think you foul one more time now Cal is going to be much more aware of the fact that they may do that so you got to be a little careful that they dont just catch it and try to he it but its enough time to where I think you still do it one more time as well as they executed it the first time I think if you Notre Dame you do it again obviously if you misses this one you certainly dont Sandra to make it a threepoint game he does not rebound Tapped Out petritis For the Win oh just off and Notre Dame survives a 40t thriller in South
