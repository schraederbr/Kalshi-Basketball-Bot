jaminsky Applause and you when youre in Blacksburg fans start to say that hes going to become the Frank Beamer of basketball those are big words in just four seasons well you win the ACC tournament that certainly helps um you know what I like the fact hes wearing coat and tie too see we havent seen a lot of coaches do that after after the covid year Applause good answer right there by Borden so we the ball a little bit up the lane and that gave him some room to turn to that right hand thank you a doula to pressure from cotton the Doula fills it gazillion Applause welcome everyone that watch Louisville get a victory alongside the GMan Mike jaminski Im Dean Lincoln were at the castle where Grambling stayed a team thats already beat two power five teams as an early lead there are two threes followed by a bucket and thats where we stand nice to see that from Kenny Paynes team got a little girl big breath to start the year but a couple of wins now Gordon with the three welltraveled Gordon but he has found a home with head coach Dante Jackson now in his six seasons by way of Milwaukee Jackson is all about the Milwaukee Bucks and everything in the Milwaukee area heres a shot from distance nothing but the bottom of the net then hes there by Couture 40 which is where hes going to be I think a couple other guys on the team need to pick up their average sum but uh you know that that shot for him just sets up the drive tour at 22 season High against William and Mary Im talking about Milwaukee thats the Grambling State logo looks awful lot like the Green Bay Packers no wonder he loves it so much now at Grambling State and another three as thatll be finished by coward and this Grambling State team is not a threepoint shooting team per se the five average five a game already closing in on that in the early minutes here its a fivepoint lead for the Tigers trying to get big for doula great yes he found Maddox hes the guy whos got to get going from three really youve got you know a big basket last year from rat range but percentage down this year 27 but a good confidence builder for him Howard down low thats a tough shot and made neatly there by a coup Ill tell you what the correctly state is running their offense very well here early on they look very comfortable on their end of the floor medulla deep off the back end of the rim and a rebound here to the Tigers the early threepoint shot for him nice little kick out attacking much did well to get his hand in there and I believe its going to be a backcourt violation there was a yeah Maddox almost push forward to the ground though Applause by way of Nigeria coup this is a tough shot but part of grambly states lead 139 Music to be the Castle Coliseum where Grambling State the tigers with the lead lets take a look at todays keys of the game brought to you by your local Ford dealer lets take a look at Grambling State first and they want to generate turnovers thats how they generate offense and this is a Virginia Tech team that does not turn it over but for the Hokies defend the two now I say that Dean Grambling State has been really good from three here early on in this game but thats a little out of character for them theyre normally a twopoint scoring team family States been good period five for six to start and theyll get another rebound as Virginia Tech starting this game three for eight from the floor thats the first nonthree that theyve taken in the games they need to find a little more balance work inside out in the offense step back now nailed right there by coward this is as good a start as Dante Jackson could have dialed up here Howard leads the team in minutes averaging 11 a game for doula the Doula had the layup tried the drop and a turnover for the Hokies as you said no coaches happy about turnovers but Mike young especially likes to have a high turnover since Rachel Applause time for todays starting lineups brought to you by your local Toyota dealers as you see cotton Kristen coward Gordon and Aku the starting lineup for their head coach Dante Jackson starting lineup also presented by Toyota for Mike Youngs Hokies Couture Padula Maddox zilly and mutts Smith Cotton Almost traveled looked like he was gonna hook up in the air turnover Applause and Virginia Tech was looking for a layup and a little kick right there itll stay with the Hokies and thats the one you dont mind that kick that saves the layup on the break what a job Mike young did at Watford and you know weve touched on it already but the transition here to Virginia Tech it just feels like he was made to be here no question about it I mean this uh you know it he had a home in Wofford but this I think checks all the boxes medulla has been thinking past first hell shoot this one off the front of the rim tries to get the rebound but running with it is coward quickly the pass and Couture with the foul as Kristen will go to the line now with that long shot Dean there wasnt great defensive balance that time Tigers a nice break up the floor what a start for the Tigers six for seven three for three from three shooting two Jinx right there theyll miss the first free throw good look at head coach Dante Jackson pleasure to talk to you at the shoot around this morning see the numbers on Kristen 43 from the field one of three guys on the roster is averaging double figures this is a team theyre feeling good about themselves Dean threegame winning streak being in Vanderbilt there you know for this program to be six and three at this point in the season is the best record that as Dante Jacksons best record by far hes ever had at this point of the year in his first season they won the swac regular season the veteran team with a lot of transfers nice move Virginia Tech and hes there by mutts yeah theyve looked to him and when they talked about the balance inside theyve looked to him to deliver get some points maybe work inside out offensively this is an air ball and Castle crowd letting yeah you hear an air ball as its a 1611 Grambling State Music watch this Grambling State Defense what they want to do is keep you on the sideline and keep you on the Baseline they dont want to give up any middle Drive mutz is fouled whats has five already thats a tough guard a tough matchup for Kristen inside you want to try to work at him get him in some foul trouble wow called against Grambling State foul going to Kristen medulla he will come out of the game the Doula with the inbounds down in the corner Couture kid and mutts both going toward the same time kid Taps it over to mutts mutts is how hes feeling it and hell go to the line so the thing is too I mean Smith just came into the game doesnt have a sweat yet go right at him try to make him defend and so far mutts has been the most reliable option theyve had offensively in this game Music foreign Music choice for todays Hardy star to watch number 25 for Virginia Tech yeah four double doubles so far this year a great passer 36 assists out of the post you see the points rebounds a very reliable shooter hes having a 50 years so far are you season all ACC selection is mutts who had 27 in the win over the Tar Heels as Virginia Tech already 10 in the ACC after this game itll be all ACC rambling state with a fivepoint lead and a foul on MJ Collins his first team second it really bailed him out with that foul it was going to be a tough converter 16 Virginia Tech 11 but the Pac12 and the swac have entered into an agreement where theyre going to play each other and actually home and home so this is a home game for Grambling State and then the road Victory against Vanderbilt part of their threegame winning streak coming in to this game so hes like I said earlier these guys feeling very good about themselves yeah I felt like you know look rounds can be different but the mood with bramleys take the Tigers theyre very confident coming into this one and its not easy to play here we werent sure about the crowd because the students arent here well the crowd is here yeah and uh and they go on in the uh the road gets a little rough before them before they go into conference play they got to go to Wisconsin and Liberty good look at coach Jackson Applause talks about the fact that well have more on it but he spends time with Willis Reed is health is we certainly wish Willis the best but still around the program of course the court well have more on that is also named after Mr Reed I just think its so important for any program to have that sense of history and reach back to the players whove been there especially when youve got a guy whos in Springfield in the Hall of Fame in Row three so far neither team shooting the ball very well from the freethrow strike and thats now Grambling is the Grambling State is not a great shooting team but that is a strength of Virginia Tech theyve got to win that battle today turnover for the Hokies and the Tigers will push it the little step up nice finish as Mumford is in good call yeah and uh why not reward yourself you got the steal waiting for some help to come down and then fold up and hit a nice jump shot Junior from Dallas Texas Padulas got all three helpers but has not scored yet Applause a little kick out driving to the basket floater soft rims dont fall there for the Hokies the lead is seven or the Tigers approaching 11 minutes remaining here in the first at Castle Coliseum Music cotton Under Pressure there from bazilly and another three Gordon you know I havent made one all year I think Ill go out and shoot a few against Virginia Tech unbelievable I actually talked to him about that at the shoot around and he said Im starting to get into it as Padula with a nice little Runner and you remember his coach said he wants Gordon to shoot more threes well and you know it didnt take a coach twice to tell me to shoot the basketball you know the guy turns on the light they told you once that you were fired right thats it the GMan cotton Smith contested and blocked there what a great block from Virginia techmatics the Hokies off the block Maddox had the block and short on the three Applause the right straight transfer Vasily with the rebound and then forced it right now Virginia Tech surprisingly with the four turnovers thats not normal well those the interior passes if you dont throw a bounce pass theyre awfully tough to connect and then I think if you put it on the floor at that time he might have had a chance Applause see the four turnovers just three for Coach Jacksons tigers largest lead of the half four Grambling State at eight trying to add to it pays for 80 points right now were shooting 73 percent and 100 for four from three Gordon oh he is he is showing uh a lot of Versatility in this game weve talked about the threes and now being able to go outside put it on the floor teen this year against Texas San Antonio he had 14 rebounds for a season high as he goes to the line to shoot two makes the first good foul out against Vandy so you know at this point now if your Virginia Tech may want to try to attack him a little bit make him defend Gordon a perfect three for three two for two from three and two for two from the line hes in double digits already thank you for doula just scored his first bucket looking for another one contested Grammy state will go the other way no passes on that possession it was just trying to manufacture some offense off the dribble the lead is 10 zilly who forgot the basketball good defense there yeah well nice help that time mutts coming over to pick him up Applause and shot clock got a quick reset a job by the officiating crew thats Trey stallions Bill Covington Junior familiar face out there with Kellen milliner the officials for this nonconference tilt both coaches trying to steal a little talk with their team during that but the clock getting reset at 24 seconds so Mike Youngs team starting this game shooting 33 515 three for ten for three and theyll get the whistle there the foul going against Munford Redshirt Junior out of Carter High School in Dallas will get the whistle transfer from Hofstra who leads the Tigers in minutes played per game this season trouble on the inbounds and theyll bring it all the way back Maddox Applause good handle good step back and an even better finish for Padula yeah he was slow to get into the scoring column but he has been very aggressive looking for his own shot the last couple of possessions medulla Five Points and three assists now the crowd started to get into it a little bit Gordon to help defense comes he goes away from it and here Bells it gets his own rebound and misses backtoback shots Virginia Tech very lucky that time uh got to stay hang in there for the rebound wow there from Padula as the two are looking for him right now there is a cover on the basket for the Hokies because were looking a lot more active on the offensive glass were a little sluggish early in this game Applause a crew has it ripped well I thought he found bazilly theyll change it and out of bounds so when receiving the ball out of bounds was Kristen came on the air talking about Padula yes Ill step back get behind the line Ill take the three for the Hokies Music he was um First Team all defense he was the MVP of the AllStar and he was the MVP of the finals thats checking the boxes yeah theres not many other trophies you can walk home with well said from the GMan whos got to be one of the only people I know that had his jersey retired when he was still playing that was a tough game for you wasnt it brutal emotionally I was spent months misses at the basket and mutz gets his hands in there be careful we got a foul Earl he didnt want to pick up a second cheap one State out there with cotton Kristen Powers Smith and Aku this is Kristen pretty tight rotations for both teams were gonna go about eight deep and thats about it cotton who looking for the rebound but bazelis got it Applause medulla who has made a three in 11 of the 12 games played for the Hokies and hell go to the line and he created that they had a switch theres a screen up top and a coup was on him and uh Padula just made that play kept going and attacking and attacking until he got the foul coming up on the Toyota halftime report well have the first half highlights and stats well take a look at highlights from Louisville Louisvilles win over Florida a m and well also Bounce Around the ACC scoreboard Applause the Doula now has seven and hes cut the Tigers lead to five walking our way to six minutes and 30 seconds left here in the first Tigers started six for seven they are two for their last seven thats a rough shot Applause oh denied at the basket and really I think he was more denied by the rim than anybody else and the Hokies fans like it the rim get credit for a block on that play tour dribbles into trouble Cross Court pass to Padula medulla really good at using his body with the ball theres Maddox at the basket and flying referees letting him play I like it cotton he really took a bad shot as last time this time was thinking Im gonna give it up here hell get it back hey good health defense from Maddox that was enough for the Hokies take care of business theyll go the other way and uh the referees letting these guys play both ends of the floor a lot of contact inside could score for three so gramley States gonna call time out after the long distant finish from Couture cutting the lead now to two it was 10 for the Tigers good time out here and you see the this is what mutts does I mean we talked about he was a scoring threat inside also a very good passer as well and uh heres where the rim went up to about 10 feet two inches it was a good aggressive take a lot of times youll get the call in that situation but the referee said play on but uh you know for uh for Dante Jackson a good time out there they had that good lead he wants to try to you know take the crowd out of it a little bit in this Game Preserve that lead get a good possession here see Jackson and he knows hes got to keep an eye on Hunter Couture the man who just made that three boy he was so great at the ACC tournament the MVP of the ACC tournament he lit it up Applause Music Mike young wins another one of those he may get a street named after him around here like coach Beamer has his legs being well said the first seventh seed to ever win the ACC tournament ever Applause clock down to four cotton has had to take some tough shots good defense from Padula no that was just south of the third that was 28 good seconds of Defense by Virginia Tech forcing that tough shot will get it back to kid Ford passes outside of the threepoint line now Padula for protection kids got two that was two on four basketball good scrambling state but man theres a Couture stepped up great pass that 10point lead wiped Away by a 100 run from the Hokies and the Castle Coliseum getting behind the home team here off to one of their best starts in history tried to go 111 before they begin real ACC play as I mentioned they already have that one win over North Carolina Applause yeah heres the look you see look at all the attention the fake stand underneath youve got he occupied Three Guys by himself on that play then Kidd the Junior from Gainesville Florida the transfer from Clemson good job using the rim go ahead Mike no Im just saying that this that lead has evaporated Gordon was off the floor for most of that hes trying to figure out why it wasnt in any foul trouble he was by far their best offensive player its in the two fouls now on Couture we have to keep an eye on number zero for the Hokies foreign has gone to Mike Youngs bench Mike young will stick with guys with two fouls too but thats how you finish Ill tell you what Lynn Kidd has been really good in this game a little high low action that time and he is very athletic in the low post the Hokies let it 20 now this is their first lead again 2523 where Virginia Tech were down by 10 theyve used a 120 run to take only their second lead of the game the only other time they LED as we mentioned going to break was the first bucket of the game Mike so kid see his numbers on the season really efficient and you know the thing is picked up too for Virginia Tech team is on the defensive end of the floor that uh I thought Grambling was very comfortable in the first eight minutes of the game and things have gotten a lot stingier down there well and adding to that GMan is we mentioned the four turnovers a long long time ago they have not had a turnover since and thats a turnover for rambling State thats their seventh well and the thing thats thats helping now Virginia Tech theyve got some depth inside last year really really thin but for a guy like Gordon they can run a few different bodies at him got a few fouls to waste but that was really good defense by Kid branley State their last field goal came at 10 49 were at three 12 remaining Padula wow thats pretty well you notice that a lot of their shots are coming out across Court passes and thats just the best way to combat this defense and where they want to send you Applause so Padula now has 10 to lead the Hokies doubledigit scoring machine for number three he didnt score for the first six or seven minutes of the game yeah he was thinking past first Padula kid I almost thought he took an extra step there but he got fouled well I dont know that you know it turned out okay but that wasnt the best place for uh him to deliver the ball to this big guy is it right there a lot of bodies around you dont want to have him put the ball on the floor look at that great pass out of the post a lot of young guys dont make that one you know thats why a skill they learn late you know its a junior but he only played 10 games last year so I almost say almost a sophomore developmentally raises 21st birthday they sung happy birthday here at Castle Coliseum I wasnt sure if it was your birthday or not GMan I had to focus not a Leo brother August 3rd there you go expect you to remember that too 160 run here oh flushed on the rebound right there what a finish from Malik Layman nobody getting a body on him and thats the most thats the friendliest bounce that the Tigers have gotten in the last 10 minutes ending the 60 run with that dunk on the far side off the Gordon Miss as Gordon has missed three in a row medulla forcing it diamonds a nice help that time defensively makes the Steal threepointer with down by the Hokies that was MJ Collins on the shot for the Tigers Music mutts yes Mike young off that threepointer caught a quick timeout 3225 preseason all ACC for a reason yeah and that uh that threepoint shot percentage has really slammed up you ever see the tigers climbing on the offensive glass in one bright spot theyve had in the last five top man for the Hokies Applause 90 seconds remaining here in the first Point gramleys date out a 10point lead they find themselves down seven the only time this year Virginia Techs been down with the half is the only loss of the season they were down five at the half against the College of Charleston another turnover and you see coach Jackson try to cheer on his team Applause s doing a terrific job at the College of Charleston and talk about this that was a good experience for this Tech Team One True Road game that theyll play before they start conference play at BC a restart conference questions kind of a funky time of the year you know with we got the Christmas break coming up youre done with exams right now so theyve got two Road games in League with the outlet pass now the rebound brings that muscle up the bench you talked about their death particularly at the post Poteet is a part of that but do it is still wide open but they didnt need him as the Finish coming from MJ Collins thats you know we havent even we havent said potentis name a lot hes just getting into the game lighter stages of the first half but having an impact Elijah Poteet the Junior from Reidsville North Carolina transfer from rice season high this year in the opening game nine against Delaware state in that same game another guy we havent said much about Grant bazilly had 30 the transfer from right say thats a good way to make your debut yeah hey guys Im here um you remember my name there he is sitting on the on the sideline is that a rough start offensively o of two is not scored three rebounds though Music seconds Maddox well I mean you look at it and Virginia Tech had a couple of fouls to burn so they dont put gramley State at the line right here now you got 11 seconds on your back to try to manufacture a shot see if that pays off for them that was the plan heres coward Boutique did well to get out and help and thatll do it after trailing by 10 at the halftime Mike its Virginia Tech 34 Bramley say 25 yeah no Panic I mean you know the Grambling State was really shooting the ball extraordinarily well but a good bounce back by the Hokies the afternoon has been fabulous same starters that started the game will start the second half Grambling State again in the dark uniforms Virginia Tech in their home white uniforms cotton Kristen Gordon Cowart and a crew starting for Coach Jackson and the Tigers Couture Padula Malik Maddox Brazilian musk out there and thats mutts well done by the mutts the country foul just knew the drive gets to the right just yeah what happened to you see the little dip of the shoulder right there Gordon now picks up his first foul a ton of whistles in that first half as you talked about Mike Kaminsky there letting him play and thats you know and all you want from the officials is consistency and they let both teams play fair whistle on both ends of the Court Padula saving it behind the back pass Maddox Padula again and you talked about getting the transfer from Wright State rolling and finishing it there was basily just moving around the basketball a good finish after that save cutting down the lane Music bucket for the transfer from Wright State never got to play Dayton when he was at Wright State played Dave Mission had a massive game Applause tour with those two fouls every game this season Padula has been in double figures Couture off the front of the rim and Couture now two for four from the floor now theyre going to get Gordon again heres the look and it almost looked like that save was for nothing but then youll see the watch the cut right down the lane there could find and finish and then on the other end of the floor that Gordon his second foul in his many possessions with the wrap around didnt really need that Gordon made his first three baskets of the game including two from downtown Couture and this is the tour now for five and three good defense under the basketula coward getting up in the air not a good decision there Applause side of the backboard with the Finish amazing what happens like you you feel like youve forgotten how to score you dont score in the first half and then you get a basket and things open up for you now so well said missed his only two shots in the first half has made both in the second heres Gordon Gordons got those two fouls got to be careful lowers his shoulder again forces the shot excellent work as its finished there by Christian nobody got a body on him and his interesting thing early in the game they were coming in double teaming Gordon but theyre letting mutts play him straight up now mathematics misses seven Virginia Tech Hokies have scored a point for Mike Young Music Applause breaking some ankles out there I think Padula really just slipped its going to stay with Grambling State I liked your comments about what coach Jackson was probably saying at the half but man hes got to be feeling a little bit they were up by 10 Mike feeling it and then all of a sudden Virginia Tech put the clamps down yeah he just uh you know no easy points and you know the way you can extend your off are your defense is to be more efficient on this Ender before Applause next time Gordon earns the whistle against mutts Music in the second on mutts Court 15 seconds on the shot clock Patton fade away his shot selection is pretty random but he makes that much first one of his first base field goals of the game but thats a pretty nice step back that one looked more under control than some of his other shots in the first half his coach has known him a long time as cotton is from Milwaukee and thats in the ties That Coach Jackson has to the state of Wisconsin and gazilly goes strong hell go to the line and I think that might be three now lets see where they give that to personal and the thing is too that two of those three have been offensive fouls in this in this half 21 there are four points now all coming in the second half I mentioned that game against Dayton he had 23 and 10 rebounds they made 393s last year and hes got 26 already months thats his third personal life Music double technical I think its just the frustration of this whole thing for Gordon and uh hes having a long conversation with him but unfortunately Music yeah all four of those coming here man just in the opening minutes here of the second half one of the thing too is he was so dominant early in this game his way to a 24 an afternoon well and he was kind of feeding off the awake crowd as well knocking down a couple of threes Elite is 10 that is not going to make the coach happy as kid rips it out of the air on his birthday a lot of the passing of the ball by a Grambling State right now a lot of oneonone on things off the dribble Music thank you kid the tour Padula for a really nice passing on that game it started inside you may get the touch inside and then work out for that three team to lead all players for Padula and you said it Mike nice extra pass from the tour those are the two players who started the show with those who involved in that last one mountain misses everything kept alive though the Tigers stayed with it and finished by Smith kid was reluctant to go after the ball and you know hes going to let it go out of bounds so you never want to make the referees make that fall if you can get the ball get it Music Applause Collins the zilli kid wide open at the elbow money right and that you know this is just such an unselfish team and that was a great find by basilia you got uh jammed by the defense kid left open he knocks the shot down I think a good time out here for Coach Jackson especially with Gordon down Padula making threes 4431 Hokies Music foreign TC basketball is brought to you by your local Ford dealers by Worx Nitro available at works nitrocom and by The Fresh Market voted number one best supermarket in America 4431 Virginia Tech seeking their first 111 start to a season since 201819 that year Tech opened with a 141 ledger through its first 15 games Mike

Music medulla really good day four for ten you know its funny theres a theres a Grambling State thats their logo and uh Packers right there and theres been a tough second half for that man right there to Gordon four fouls one of those technical two of those offensive Applause foreign medulla way downtown yes and Padula now with 16 right about his average Applause season High 22 and career high this year against William and Mary for fedula as he and Couture Applause yeah thats normally number one Cameron Christian for Brentwood State its a Christian third personal foul do you remember Gordon on the bench with four it wasnt a great look but they felt like that elbow is up high enough so Couture with the upgrade this is uh yeah the one area there now Virginia Tech four of ten from the free throw line normally a very good free throw shooting team Applause um Music theres Kristin saw that one upgraded to the two shot technicals Virginia Tech makes one of them and its 4831 another 60 run right now for the Hokies and thats coming in just 47 seconds theyve got the ball again Collins forces it just Collins over dribbling on that possession a little too much dribble himself into a turnover Applause Christians still out there theres Kristen a little floater thatll go out of bounds off the Tigers and back to the Hokies yeah I mean you know you look at the offense for Gremlin State and its just been you know whoevers getting the ball putting their head down trying to make something happen on their own Music coach Jackson looking on the Hokies led by coach Young have Couture Collins Padula kid and the zilli zilly with it top of the key and hes a good enough threepoint shooter hes got to honor him out there and that just opens things up inside now kid is not a threat out there so theyre operating high low with him down in the low block Virginia Tech called for the offensive foul out of bounds my apologies out of bounds this half has been kind of the opposite of the first half as far as calls are concerned they let both teams play and uh its been a real tight whistle in the second half hes still on the bench with those four fouls he was feeling it early Applause Studio power this might have hit a sliver of the rim Mike Im not sure still fits the airball call though Petula why not staying with it his kid great pass for zilli kid with the assist work inside because the interior passing between the big men kid with two helpers to go with his seven points brazily now with seven as well Smith with that left hand Strokes it for three finally a threepoint shot opens up for tigers they made their first four and they havent made one since that one yeah that was the first one of this half great game its five for 11 five assists three rebounds and a whistle yeah heres heres the look almost uh getting away with it but makes up for it with the helper you can feel confident content 16 now with 11 57 remaining the game its Virginia Tech 50 Grambling State 34 you take a look at the next five games its time for ACC basketball and so it starts we talked about it a little bit of a tough time of the year with uh going home for Christmas around BC and then Wake Forest on New Years Day night but uh this was an impressive start to their year and Mr mutts really dominated this game for Virginia Tech terrific night for him great win this really started a little bit of a slide for North Carolina 70 and they had lost four in a row and in a tough game today with Ohio State yeah you said it months 27 in that win against UNC MJ Collins also had eight points eight rebounds and three assists that was when you started to see the depth that youve been talking a lot about Mike as it relates to coach young and Virginia Tech great and you look at this team you know this game and again tight rotation its going to be eight guys barring injury the rest of the year probably and seven of those guys have scored in this game and potique has done other things even though he hasnt scratched number one Music the Doula missed the first came back with a couple days turned into another big game thats what he does now for Virginia Tech big game after big game in many ways Mike he makes it look easy its a pretty good line too I mean five assists three rebounds to go along with the scoring Smith challenged at The Rim tremendous help defense by Brazilian medulla attacking the basket and hell go back to the line one thing on the rush up the floor youve got to stop the guy with the ball with the live dribble and nobody for Grambling State did that and Padula recognizing it and going all the way stop me stop me no all right Ill just go up and try to score Im going to draw the foul good smart play two fouls now number 23 Quentin Morrell makes the first has one more lets go its the second as he was one away from 20 5334 bro this game would be over over if they had made their free throws eight of 16 coach young might bring that up to tell you you know these games like this you can have those tough coaching moments with the win thats the best of all worlds brazily got his hands in there late yeah theyre gonna call it against level 21 to transfer from Wright State its going to be interesting to see him make his run through the ACC you know you think about last year what manic did for North Carolina the zilly could be that kind of player well and you look at you look at the transfer the big transfers for the schools like Pete Manson North Carolina or abander Plaza Virginia here that that four guy that stretch four guy trying to incorporate in a team that has a lot of people back always great to be alongside Mike jaminsky were at the Castle Coliseum where they are still making noise as we mentioned the students are done with exams at home but still theyre loving the Hokies yeah and you know and Mike young said that to us is is facility no but hes got a different skill set and he does some pretty good things on the floor for you youre not gonna you know youre not going to find a clone of these guys from the from you know last year yeah Luma so good as well and that run to that ACC tournament title Ralph Outlet pass Collins tracking back will go off of Collins Jackson liked that pass goes out of bounds yeah and that was a great Point by you the Freshman chasing that play down from behind not giving up on it gets the deflection Music with defense you know we talked about ahead and scored but doing other things Elijah Poteet number 34 wants it so much more than that scoring good see thats what basily can give you that high low presence inside especially with kid and Poteet theyre inside players let them work and the GMan asked for points Poteet delivers hits the boards they share it Brazilian will rip it down Applause the Doula bounce pass they were going to try to get another dunk this will look a good seal right there the late front and uh thats just an easy basket good luck Applause season high in the opening game for petite his career height when he played at Rice he had 18 against UAB and see with that you know when youve got guys out there with threepoint Shooters and the floor is spread that high low action really is its an easy pass from the tour Cross Court pass cows will give it back to Couture hes open you just know that that weak side corner shooter is going to be there for Virginia Tech look at this things close up for you do you got that guy right in your hip pocket that was a beautiful delivery seven of his shots have been from behind the threepoint line hes made three hes got ten in the game Music good double team denied at the basket mutts mutts and kid now mutts good little spin picked up my kid oh good cut from Collins missed him though so hell come back and get it mutts Applause under the rim shot clock back at 20 Couture now he checked four for eight from three four its not quite the same threat with mutz although we did talk about his threepoint shooting but uh takes to play Work especially you know you get the the second chance opportunity there Applause 199 career threes made for number zero Couture good extra passing right there for the Hokies you know I I said it at the top and it was funny Mike young said when Couture came here he couldnt guard Mike young and thats the you know hes always been the defensive threat theres that recycle you see everybody scattered he gets a great look at it but you know that that part of his game is always going to be there its on the other end of the floor that hes really made big strides so hes at 199 the career record for threes made is 267 he has one more year left because of the covet situation I feel like its not a stretch to say hes going to chase that down yeah he can uh you know youve still got you know twothirds of this year left you know so I think hes probably got another 50 in him this year at least there you go so Grambling State back out there with cotton Kristen Gordon has come back into the game hes got the ball Tower and Phillips Gordon wants it mutts did a good job of fronting Gordon and then off that pressure so hokey stay with it and then the Finish thats just all out hustling thatll be the play that coach young will remember too perfect job by Maddox well just uh staying with the play and not only you know give me the deflection he got on the floor and this is good Hustle five points for Maddox but as you say the hustle part of this 100 run in the last 154 and I mentioned thatll be the play that hell remember I mean he was pumping his fists and clamping he loved it Mike Young you see thats how you see the jackets off now the sleeves are rolled up and uh the hot button on the shirt on by Mikey on his coaching now into the game for me it started with his popcorn though right yeah every year every game good defense for much on board a minute ago Music that ends that 100 run Music Virginia Tech 17 Force turnovers a season High and the Hokies cruising here 6338 7 remain in the game and its been a dominant performance here from Virginia Tech once that they got through that early run from the tiger 6338 they make a correction that North Carolina game not over yet North Carolina threepoint lead to 17 seconds to go in that game thank you GMan well that were not done guys and the Tar Heels his wife a Virginia attack as we mentioned earlier theyll start the ACC season you know again they have a win over North Carolina but theyll go on the road at Boston College and Wake Forest on the 21st and the 31st this free throw Grambling State Patton gonna push it oh missed at the bucket there by Grambling State as that was Phillips Applause much because you download a kid and they travel for months getting a little Happy Feet out front this is you know and with that rotation especially with the figs inside that Mike young can try different combinations and see how things work and well keep getting a little bit extra run now its going to serve him well as ACC season starts the news defense from Couture Tristan back of the rim foul down on the floor Ill go against kids thats his first its his first team foul in the half Music oh good fight what a great Punt and a beautiful pass Kristen finished in the pass from Gordon with him off the block things opened up inside they were cutting lanes and that was a nice combination Music 6 30 remaining in the game Collins Music Applause kid travel yeah with the spin took an extra step I felt like he was thinking about a big old nasty dunk right there Music I like this by Dante Jackson that when uh when Gordon picked up that tea you know he had a long talk with him over on the bench and got him calmed down and you know let him come back into this game see what he can do down the stretch so he can how long he can last without getting that fifth foul but try to reenter the game piston another three Miss there for Grambling State they started so hot four for four in the now five for 15 from three if you remember Mike Virginia Tech started code from three and its been the opposite well and the thing too aside from a couple of foul you know foul baskets followup baskets not a lot of easy looks at all for Grambling State none air ball so the Tigers will push it here still I mean even with that air ball good defensive rotation back by Virginia Tech stop that Rush up the floor Gordon its fair to say when he got his fourth three and then the double tactical which counted as his fourth so it was kind of good night for the Tigers yeah and you know but cotton he gets that look because of the defense thats drawn into Gordon inside he just he didnt knock the shot down but he got a great look all right final North Carolina did beat Ohio State 984 as much kid strong ER can you talk about the high post and thats the thing I think you want to encourage him to shoot out on the perimeter so Id give him a little bit of room make him beat you over the top just one here the and one for number 25 mutts bounces around hit about every part of the ribbon back forward and in yeah so much will get a break and high fives from everybody on the hostess bench Applause three players now and double figures for the Hokies this is mutts final season with the Hokies thats a really nice drive but missing just not falling right now for the Tigers so if you do a little hes not afraid to go the distance oh Collins with a slam nice easy basket for the Freshman to get and the run up to four the doula doing it all right now feeling the pressure from your house missed it with his left switch his hands in the air going the other way Gordon going to try to rock one and he does Gordon was late coming down the play he never got over half court so an easy cherry pick for him first two points of the half for Gordon thats five miles on Gordon Padula running the show you got to step out on him and then Collins with the Finish to the Hokies love it Collins at the basket you know and his his right he had a second run up the floor hes just looking at Padula and pointing up to the rim police another one throw it up there Ill go get it look theyre chatting right now foreign thats a real coaching moment right there Im guessing it was something along the lines like weve got incredible Talent weve got to make sure you keep it together all the time yeah and its but again its you know hes hes used to having his running mate out there 100 Couture and now you got a guy whos really athletic not the tourism but uh Colins running the floor that you can do that you know hes gonna hes gonna be looking for lobs on the Break Meanwhile Padula at 21 is third 20point plus game of the season a season that has seen him scored double digits in every single game and he might be the most improved player in the ACC which is saying a lot and there he is Padula finding Collins and the Hokies are rolling in Blacksburg 7042 Music four offensive fouls yeah pretty good line right there across the board first 255 game of his career and he sits down one shy of his career high in points which is 22 hes at 21 hes like coach come on man one shot leave me in there one more basketball Applause Music get him out so true with the bucket is now Mike young will start to go deep to his bench into the game is Camden Camden right there with the pass Richard freshman out of downington PA cancer from Memphis as they try to get it to Camden Johnson a sophomore and whistle on the floor well before the shot thats his first 15 pounds so Camden Johnson wearing number 10 the sophomore in with John Camden its about exactly the same way the redshirt freshman they wear 10 and 11 respectively you know you look at I I tend to look at you know and shoot rounds and pregame and warmups and this Virginia Tech Team really on the same page and it just looked like theyre really a together group you know we talked to Mike young he loves this team a lot of coaches dont come fly it out and say that but you just feel like a really good vibe with this group you nailed it that was the first thing out of his mouth today as he walked down these stupid steps here as Maddox its a tough shot looking back Applause oh we got that too all right thats exactly the kind of look he gave right there is were now under three minutes Dante Jackson also starting to go to his bench Smith Applause shot clock at five two thats a good shot hes got six comes in averaging just two points a game cabinet big man number 34 with a nice soft touch right there gold teeth you got Prime position inside used his body well doing a little bit of talking in the paint they match buckets under two minutes remaining two big bodies out there back to the rim to Rebound with four points and a couple of rebounds so T got your pass to Maddox proud to love it if this goes in front of the rim just missing there for John Camden the redshirt freshman Applause rambling State as we mentioned came in with those two power five wins and thats a power boost for the basket but Jackson will call timeout to finish from putting Muriel the sophomore from Milwaukee yeah its just to get to get some players out onto the floor Applause big day for Mr Padula yeah and uh you know the big day with a late start letting everybody kind of work into the offense he didnt score for a stretch in that first half but uh then once uh he knocked down their first three no looking back for him actually Music Applause stepped out of bounds Applause that would have been his first three Michael Ward The Freshman from Bethesda Maryland Walt Whitman High School they were going to go crazy they kind of did anyway well you know what the the great thing is that you know all the guys on the bench are really pulling for for the guys out on the floor right now to score you know do something do something well you know come ACC play they may not see a lot of court time oh the crowd loves it taking the charge right there number 14 Owen doyatt how about Mike young up giving him a little standing ovation thats awesome a big smile from doyatt as he walked back over in front of Coach Young so only about a two second differential here at the end of game clock and a shot clock Camden Boutique yeah Applause a little pump fake but missing at the bucket final seconds counting down Murrell with a nice move and now we got 12 seconds as Virginia Tech and Mike young will move to 111 yeah nice and uh you know you gotta you get a good easy home win here nobody gets hurt get yourself in a good Rhythm for ACC play Mike
