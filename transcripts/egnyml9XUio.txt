Tamar Langford to the Eagles here in Purcell Pavilion and the Joyce Center the Irish and the Eagles our parties start a watch for this game today is Quentin post big man in the middle for PC Mike hes had a terrific run and still not in top shape had a broken foot earlier in the year but uh those last two games averaging 13 and a half had 17 against Armando baycod down in North Carolina on Tuesday he was seven of 11 from the floor and the close loss for BC on Tuesday at North Carolina 7264 for Notre Dame coming off a home loss on Tuesday that against Florida State 8471 BC traveling maroon Notre Dame the home white blue and gold Boston College is 811 on the season two and six in conference play one of those ACC wins in early January at home against Notre Dame host too strong youre not bad though I mean hes able to go with both hands inside was able to face up look for Notre Dame to double him when they can this afternoon Applause Music on the drive post was there to block it nice idea by lushewski tried to make him guard defend side to side but uh post made a nice defensive Play heres a look at our Toyota starting lineups visit your local Toyota dealer today Makai Ashton Lankford is the leading scorer for BC but post has the first bucket well you know you got to choose something you only made two coming into this game on the season so good start for post how about Boston College after going oh for six Mike for the first time not making a three in a game since 2009 at North Carolina Earl Grand tolls for the game his number hed like to see 14 or 15 attempts uh in the course of the game they only had six against North Carolina not bad start Hammond does not get the soft bounce here at Purcell Pavilion inside the Joyce Center Fighting Irish are nine and four at home this season all of their victories have come on this floor Boston College in search of the first road win this year for the Eagles Ashton Langford misses out of the corner post the onehanded rebound and a foul is called against Notre Dame Applause time to take a look at our Ford keys to the game theyre brought to you by your local Ford dealer with Mike jiminski and this is Boston College they want to try to get into the paint they want to win the freethrow line battle and try to force Notre Dame to defend and for the Irish match the physicality up front especially in the defensive glass wow a second three for post extending the range Applause how about Quentin post the senior from Amsterdam in the Netherlands I think we have to readjust The Scouting Report here early as you mentioned Mike he was just two of eight on the season now granted hes missed 13 games with a foot in here all right were going to have our centers in a threepoint shooting contest here today Tom here we go with mashewski now the Irish fire away with threes they have six players on the team with 20 or more made threepointers Boston College does not have one on the roster for the year the coast is zeroing in on it this game good defense Ryan brings it up after the Steal Starling puts it on the floor bounces out Goodwin had a chance BC comes away with it Applause the foul coming up against the Irish on the drive by elipe Marcus Hammond is going to get that foul ball and uh Earl Grant on the sidelines for Boston College I really like a league bat I think theyve got a real a gem in him they really want to try to make him work inside out if he can and he was very aggressive on that drive just 56 percent of the season from the precoll line for Prince a league Bay The Freshman from Minneapolis Minnesota Mike Bray on that Notre Dame bench this would be his final season he said the programs ready for a new voice and uh you know he said he was thinking about it last year on the way back from the ncaas but uh he had a a group of six grad students coming back and uh decided to stick out one more year but felt like the the rumors and stuff were uh it might have been a distraction so he got that decision made this week 481 wins the head coach of the Irish thats the most in school history 584 his career for the head coach of Delaware good win the turnaround well Goodwins been so reliable seven straight games double figures he didnt play well he played okay at BC but uh very reliable and this is what youll see from Notre Dame theyre going to play zone today they really want to try to save uh lacheski as much as they can Applause hackery back to collect it for PC post whos made a couple of Threes already thats a tough pass to a league Bay whos able to get it reflected around shot clocks inside of 10 post again wait a minute its supposed to be the Luck of the Irish right uh thats some performance early on by Quinn close at the other end tipped up and in by Ryan so BC attempted six threes made none of them against North Carolina theyve already attempted four in this game Mike and theyve made three of them all from post Applause Zachary in the lane had it knocked Away by lucchesky Applause who is this number 12 in a VC uniform Mike Quentin hosts serious heat checks for the big man his third three of the game well we talked about Quentin post head two of seven for three coming on in but he is perfect from the 43 of three Tom or me and uh and he looks like he was ready to shoot too I mean there was no hesitation in those threes and uh you know we talked about Notre Dame this is a team that in BC that you would like the zone and make them prove themselves but that may change for the Eagles foreign Music T that he would prefer it to be in the 60s uh you know if it gets to be much more than that um you know this team just doesnt have the offense to keep up with it its an Notre Dame team that doesnt like to play at Great Pace uh you know the thing they have to do is is the match or you know they they definitely have to win the threepoint battle in this game Ashton Langford the lineup for BC Bickerstaff has come in words who just came in forced the turnover Applause Music Irish amiss out of the corner in Boston College able to grab it as Starling misfires one thing Notre Dame doesnt do is offensive rebounds so if theyre not shooting theyre only going to get one shot thats Langford trying to hang post to clean up Duty he really brings a great element Earl Grant told us that you know with him coming back they had to tweak their offense they were used to playing with him and then you put a post guy out there or it changes things but he continues to play like this theyre going to be very very tough six straight games for post doubledigit scoring trying to defend the what a shot as he took it right to post had the block on the first drive But luccheska continuing to try to put pressures and you mentioned he fouled out in the game down in North Carolina on Tuesday Langford the jumper his first points he was shut out in the first half on Tuesday against Boston College as their leading scorer for the Eagles this season foreign Applause Music trying to go behind the back and then post committed the foul Music ones especially on the road it was just a casual pass that leads to a turnover and you pick up a foul and uh what six and a half minutes into the game and hes in double figures already with four rebounds so the 11 points for post just below his season average of 118 per game to go along with five rebounds per game he is a spectator now on that BC bench so Lubin came in for Notre Dame as well number two in white good one in traffic trying to back it down on Zachary and the Tamara and uh look for them to run their guards in the post Mike how about his 146th game playing for the Irish thats a School record for Dane Goodwin its two careers and he plays a lot of minutes he leads the league in minutes long rebound to Hammond hes one on four Goodwin provides some reinforcement nice job BC getting back cutting off that break and they shut off Goodwin who had spotted up for a three Matson had just come in for Boston College and committed the foul to his surprise Dane good when the graduate student from Upper Arlington Ohio and then Matson hes really the BC threepoint shooter although he was limited against North Carolina I came in right down to the last three minutes Earl Grant said they had the tempo going their way all of the game except for the last three minutes when North Carolina distance itself from the hard fighting Eagles Applause Music his second three of the game and you know hes been up and down scoring wise which is surprising to me not only uh six double figure games in the last 13 his threepointer has tied us and the Irish able to produce a turnover good one fight his way through the lane and lost it potential three on one Boston College medicine back to Zachary really nice break and thats you know the turnovers happen out front like that theyre easy to convert into points but that was good passing between the two Jaden Zachary who is a doubledigit scorer for this BC team almost 11 points per game at 18 points against Notre Dame Applause at the other end for the Irish and you know not a big time scorer most of their scoring comes from their starting five so any offense they get from him is a bonus but that was a good move he got a nice deep position in the post moving the Freshman from Orlando Florida Irish of me their last three field goal attempts and now the Zone somebody else is going to have to step up and make shots from Langford with a Miss designated threepoint shooter Clinton post is not in the game feel like he will be very soon after this rest tied at 16 Goodwin cut off by the defending of Matson Hammond the Lefty lines up a three ball for the Irish well heres the problem they had a double they felt like they came and doubled Goodwin down in the post the guy who left them leaves the shooter wide open first lead today for Notre Dame Applause picker staff had it knocked away on the Baseline and kept alive good hands by Goodwin defensively not a shot blocker per se out there for Notre Dame Applause Music works Applause Hammond looking for another three this one Off the Mark Lubin grabs it Hammonds the cutter skit and offensive foul against the Irish Hammond on the Move BC head position so well take a timeout here in South Bend Hammond on the Move Makai Ashton Langford had the position for BC left after one year they didnt even ask anybody else they called Mike up and said he want the job he took it and here we are 23 years later speaker Phelps took this program to the final four back in 78 it seems to me theres another team there from the ACC at the time led by Mike jaminsky back in 1978 at the final four and in the national title game Mike yeah Duke had a good result against Notre Dame that year but not so much against Kentucky GMan played pretty well from what I hear that close to that National Title back in 78 Les schewski lets it fly well I tell you both sinners now you expect that from blusheski coming into this game uh Clinton post has proved himself so far lets see if he starts to work closer with the basket but certainly the start that Nate lashesky wanted thats now an 80 run over the last two minutes and change for the Irish shooting 53 percent as a team got in this Zone theyve got lacheski out on the wing theyre moving inside battling with post Applause Matson tees one up for the Eagles this just a completely different scoring game from the one we saw on Tuesday so now Matson with that three hes got 20 made threes on the season and he leads the team in that category Matson didnt even attempt a threepointer against North Carolina on Tuesday he didnt score a point thats a turnover a league Bay the other way for BC got it back trying to make his move at the freethrow line posters back in tried to go over the top and poor Mac Ryan pulled it in Applause Ryan got the defender in the air too strong lets see a post had an effect on that then Ryan just he got it up there on the backboard a little he was hurried in that shot and thats you know what a seven footer does to you when hes right in front of you Irish have already turned it over five times today post makes the move to the rim Music very impressed with him uh you know heres a guy now hes settling back into what he does but hes in the back of his mind he knows when needed he can step out behind the threepoint line and again for post just his seventh game of the season missed 13 games to start the year with a foot injury good win the pirouette Im so good now as opposed to Ryan on the last play he pivots and Fades away in the lane and hes made that shot a couple of times really win averages just over 12 points per game for the Irish who only turned it over seven total times in the previous two games and that includes the loss here in their home floor against Florida State on Tuesday where they shot just 39 Les schewski way behind the line Music isnt even hesitating and pulling the trigger right there this is just an incredible shooting performance by both teams has four made threes in the game Mike that puts him at 210 for his Notre Dame career threepointers Matson cant answer with a three of his owns Applause Irish have lost five of their last six games last win was January 10th that was at home against Georgia Tech and it took overtime and a 92 run at the end of regulation to force OT for the Irish and get the win against the jackets Madsen quick release theyve done a nice job coming in helping out on the glass and you know its going to be curious to watch this Notre Dame team again dont take your eyes off oh no that forces Earl Grants hand for a timeout that is five threes in the game hes only too shy of his career high for threes made in a game lacheski wants it and he absolutely rips the ropes for the Irish here in the first half Music from Nate lashesky G man hes already knocked down five of them in the first half yeah I mean these you know 38 on the year like you said is a guy who has proven himself capable but he came out knocked down a shot early and really has been an incredible Rhythm throughout this first half not even hesitating to pull the trigger and how about this um the centers in this game have combined for 30 of the 51 points and they have eight made threes between them simply amazing and thats after lashesky had struggled at Boston College in early January he missed all five of his threepoint attempts in the loss to the Eagles earlier this season Applause The Langford Brothers only come by for two points so far one of six shooting heres Makai Ashton Langford down the lane doesnt get the bounce post trying to out jump everybody and Bickerstaff ends up with it for BC Langford for three and he knocks it down lets see as this game unfolds if the offensive glass becomes a you know big weapon for BC they get the possessions recycled that time and the good look at the three the guy asked him Lankford he shoots 24 from Beyond The Arc this is Madison with the steal and jam it almost looked like he was wearing a white jersey I mean that pass was basically right to him out front thats as easy a blip as youre going to get in the game Mason Matson is the transfer from Cincinnati into the BC program Applause that goes out of bounds on the Baseline words couldnt catch up with it and its back to the Eagles Music the Notre Dame team that Prides himself on taking care of the basketball they usually dont turn it over and they dont make unforced errors but already seven in this game about near where they would average for a game that equals their total from the previous two games as far as turnovers are concerned Madsen line it up a three strange things happening this afternoon Tom its just the first half Ryan wants it posts the rebound Mr Langford running and too strong hes way out of control as Im Starling trying to maintain control of the other end finds Hammond Lubin into the lane its a chance Applause Music Applause then Allen Lubin determination and second effort for the Irish he earns himself to bucket and a free throw located the series in ACC play leading 154 but BC has won three of the last four meetings between the teams including this season in early January Lubin cant finish off the old school threepoint play that was the first free throw attempted by the Irish in this half Applause another three for Boston College Ashton Langford teaming it up and uh interesting now too with a couple minutes left in the post out of the ball game somebody else stepping up and knocking down a three so BC has now made six threepointers they are last in the conference by percentage from Beyond The Arc at 27 percent but not today six of ten for the Eagles Irish not too bad either theres six of 11 now six of 12 missed by starling Ashton Langford teeing up another one two threes in a row and that was all set up by Jaden Zachary good push up the floor pull the defense in and uh I could just followed him behind him file called on the play Jamie lucky AJ decides Jamel Spearman are our officials why citizen pushup before he drives the defense down and uh Langford able to catch it in Rhythm I think from you know percentage and total wise that this is where Earl Grant would like his team for the game I was just thinking he would have preferred maybe a few of these threes in the game against North Carolina the outcome might have been different instead theyve lost 15 of the last 16 against the Irish angular rebound and it is run down in the corner there by McLaughlin bigger staff determined to get to the rim and they spins It Off The Square but you know with Jen moving in there that you can go attack the basket a little bit and not worry about a shot blocker the only thing you have to worry about is uh charges but good strong take hes working on an 80 run over the last minute and a half and Bickerstaff his first basket of the game Applause Hammond dribbling in tight quarters trying to wrestle it away from the Eagles and find Goodwin Lubin weeks side back up and in level again you know Tom Mike Ray talked to us today and uh you know Lubin got hurt toward the end of that BC game and they really needed him but his absence was really felt but its been a presence here early in this game on the glass so moving back to the free throw line and he gives the Irish the lead 3534 Music in the feski 24 of the 35 points for the Irish at the other end from BC Ashton Lankford and host of the leading scorers post with 13 Ashton Lankford with 11 points that puts him over a thousand for his career both at Boston College and Providence and thats McLaughlin you know this the pace of this game I think it really you know BC has fallen into it very nicely of course you get a great nine point cushion early with three threes from post but they look pretty comfortable offensively seven made threes for the Eagles six made for Notre Dame five of those from luccheski shot clock winding down final 30 seconds good win top rebounder for the Eagles had the position and I think with post that one of the things with lucchesky shooting that theyve had to go smaller with him and have a guy who can defend him out on the perimeter could be the eagles with the final possession of the first half theyve got the lead right now Brockton comes up shorty grabs it might be a last second chance Goodwin couldnt handle the pass it goes out of bounds and Boston College will go to the locker room with the one point lead 3635 after making seven threes in the first half and again this is after BC missed all six of its threepoint tries on Tuesday million they will certainly Miss coach Bray making the announcement earlier this week that this year will be his last 23 years as the head coach of the Irish and right now staring down a onepoint deficit against the visiting Boston College Eagles and just about set the crank up the second 20 minutes Tom and Mike from our broadcast position Courtside and Mike you expect threepointers from Notre Dame not so much for Boston College although two games ago they made nine against Wake Forest no I mean its been a fabulous shooting uh first half for BC I mean this is a this is kind of what Notre Dame does I mean they are an excellent offensive team a very good shooting team but uh you know itll be interesting to see how it continues in on the second half had five of those threes in the first half Quentin post leading scorer for Boston College he came out firing with a few threes of his own and BC finished the first 20 minutes on a 72 run to take the onepoint lead well and for uh for Notre Dame uh their freshman JJ Starling has not scored in this game yet and hes a double figure guy Ryan misses out of the corner and post has the rebound Applause first meeting between the teams early January in Chestnut Hill theres Notre Dame built a 10point lead it did not hold up the Eagles came back to win that game in fact thats the last victory for Boston College as they move through the month of January a league base spinning on the Block and a foul called Applause I guess you know along with the scoring Tom theres some good thing both uh post and lechesky are not in any foul trouble but there you see the shooting both of them even in Notre Dame in that loss at BC only shot 40 percent from the field BC 52 but thats seven of eleven really gets your attention the league Bay is at the freethrow line for Boston College plus the other thing its an elite level Tom theyve got 11 assists on 14 made field goals and thats that is spectacular offense Boston College is a team 69 from the freethrow line that is the last of the ACC itll be one of two for a league Bay Applause Music Eagles won it 7063 at Connie Forum on January 3rd against the Irish Music has trailed at half in that game by four had a onepoint lead after 20 minutes in this one on the road but they did outscore Notre Dame by seven at the freethrow line in that game Applause Music Applause thats now eight rebounds for Clinton post to go along with his 13 points hes the leading scorer for BC bashesky with 17 has the most for Notre Dame really honoring him out a threepoint line now hes right in his jersey shot clock is down to seven Demar Langford pumps up the jumper hes a guy I mean from range hes only 15 from three and uh so youre gonna go under the screen and test him a little bit but BC has been making jumpers offensive foul against warts of the Irish question Langford his brother Demar just hit that jumper at the other end for his first two points of the game foreign Applause Ts team played tough and physical against North Carolina including this guy Clinton post they came up short against the Tar Heels theyve got the lead against the Irish that was some Up and Under and he has got great length and came up on the other side of the basket Mike Ray wants an early time out with his sixpoint lead how about Quentin post hes up to 15 points after the move on the inside Mike Bray calls a timeout and the Eagles are in front by six 4135 is the lead for the Eagles on campus with 1806 to go on a Saturday in the ACC and Clinton boasts leading the way for Boston College Eagles trying to get their first win here at Notre Dame since 2019 when they want to buy a 7372 had lost 11 in a row prior to the win here in 2019 at Purcell Pavilion at the Joyce Center interesting theyve got a Libre Elite Bay on the chesky now got a smaller guy to get him and stay with him out on Perimeter the movement is matched up against post Australia Applause Ryan misses Lubin feeds it back to Ryan warts hosts the board on the weak side Applause Music in traffic thats who they are it happened in this season Tom sixty percent of their offense comes from two from the twopoint range they are really good at attacking the basket Goodwin three was halfway down and popped out entry to post and a foul called Works was defending post and giving up some size on that pick and roll they got caught in the switch and that was a good find that mismatch second on wurtz Music see the the doubles actually slipped the screen right at you know that time and uh late coming over for help last season the teams played beer Mike in February and OT win for the Irish 9995 Zachary straight away that bounces out post lachesky and Goodwin grabs it for the Irish for post hes so long you have to box him out a few feet away from the rim and Notre Dame did well to come away with that board good win at 66 averages almost five rebounds per game and now Lubin against post has to give it up to words Hammonds front rim got his own Miss preserving The Possession Goodwin with the shot clock at 10 poked away from Lubin but a fouled against BC quick post that time and just because Lubin really worked hard to get position and of course the cheap foul I think another guys been quiet Thomas Hammond hes been really scoring 18 plus points in his last two collected shot looking for a field goal making the second half and thats Langford flying down the lane and he got bumped the eightpoint lead the largest for the Eagles in the game Makai Ashton Langford brother Demar Langford Jr the younger brother Tamar is going to the freethrow line how about these young guys thats pretty much life hasnt changed a whole lot for them has it just a little bit older now theyre still together from Worcester Massachusetts the central part of the state Music you know anybody else from Worcester I do I know a lot of people from Worcester most of my familys still back there in Central Mass representing Worcester quite well in Chestnut Hill as are you trying my best and leaning on the GMan as I always do great to have you with us for ACC basketball Applause as we steamroll through the season amazing coming up to the halfway point already 20game schedule in the ACC for the conference schedule quick ball Movement by the Irish we talked about the threepoint shooting as the foul is committed Notre Dame has missed its last nine threepoint attempts trying to get the Rhythm back for the Irish against the Eagles here at Purcell Pavilion game 4535 Quentin post has a doubledouble with his 15 points and 10 boards and the Eagles on the road strong in the second half coming out of the locker room GMan its part of our Coyote Tractor Turning Point yeah really uh were comfortable right from the start in this game and continue to do that their shooting has been terrific theyve done a lot more attacking the basket in this half cup not relying on the threepoint shot Mike Murray uh trying to figure things out on the sideline over there with a 10point deficit and thatll tell you the second half story pretty easily the Irish have not scored and again Earl Grants team out to their largest lead of the game after leading by one at halftime 3635 for their second year head coach well and you know lasheski was so hot in the first half but the Notre Dame needs to find a second and a third score in this game nobody stepped up to find any rhythm six of 19 on threepointers for the Irish and another Miss thats wurtz really struggling now Mike at 37 percent shooting for the game for Notre Dame yeah has five of those Maids threes wow up the ladder for tomorrow Langford able to tip it in an athletic play and uh thats where that pass was thats the best he could have hoped for eight points now from Langford BC is at 51 shooting for the game increasing its lead which is 52 in that first game poked away Ashton Lankford trying to beat two Defenders over Starling trying to calculate that angle off the backboard and he was fouled Applause Music well actually you know BC has been theyve been willing to push the ball up the floor given the opportunity here and they got the steal out front so on turnovers theyre going to be opportunistic its a good take Music Applause a moment lets get a message from Coyote Tractor from my experience if you work the land you got to be a jack of all trades you got to have a little bit of optimism a whole lot of getgo Makai Aston Langford at the free throw line 84 on the season part of that brother Duo from Worcester Mass and hes able to convert from the free throw line and not only the threepoint line but now free throws in the second half are starting to be a factor for the Eagles they work it around a Goodwin in the corner and that bounces out you are not going to get a more wide open three than that one no and then you know then Notre Dame getting not much inside a little good steal lets see if this leads to something Ryan his teammates trying to join him trying to do it himself once again just not getting the bounces that one halfway down and could have been a chance at a threepoint play for Matt Ryan heres the look of a little lazy pass but Ryan anticipating it well nobody really stopping the balls trying to make something happen and just Goodwins had a couple of jumpers go down as well but it has been very tough for Notre Dame to score and still is hes 83 percent on a year Applause Notre Dame is a good freethrow shooting team fourth in the conference for the entire body of work on the season of 76 percent and Ryan breaks through and hell get some Applause for the first point you know the second half for the Irish Applause maybe a maid free throw is what they need and try to climb back into this one post from Ashton Lankford steamrolled the defender Les schewski with the position offensive foul third personal foul on post but a nice job by lukeski on the dribble moving his feet getting in position Music so as Mike mentioned third personal for post leads the team with 15 points even with that a little pressure up the floor by BC trying to do this nothing to try to steal the ball just trying to take some time off the clock oh of nine from the floor this half for Notre Dame and the thing is youre not outside of a layup on the break or attempted layup everything has been jump shots for Notre Dame for Matt Ryan he hits a three and hes starting to come away and you know it four points for him in the last couple of possessions seven made threes in the game for the Irish the first Cormac Ryan in six points out of Steal yeah Ryan with the deflection Applause Starling by the way Mike The Freshman has not scored in the game Goodwin inside and Metson tied him up and picked up the foul but you know what Tom to to starlings credit a freshman who comes in after Double figures might get a little antsy if he hasnt scored at this point but hes really working within the frame of the offense I like that you know letting things come to him where they can hes third among freshman scorers in the ACC over 12 points per game with Goodwin at the free throw line 86 free throw shooter Music Applause Starling has missed all three of his shot opportunities Mike and he scored 16 points in the loss at BC in early January two missed free throws for Goodman two of six as a team Applause once again good one 86 percent from the line its Baker staff at the other end yeah with post out a little bit different look offensively and he does a nice job moving without the ball lacheski catch in release and its another three his sixth of the game first basket of the second half theyll see if that ignites some offense from him and thats with a smaller team out there here in theory should be able to cover him from three theyre just late Aston Langford missed good win the rebound the chesky has 20 points to lead the way for the Irish fifth time this season number 14 in white has scored 20 or more in a game Ryan crosses it over against Bickerstaff McLaughlin rather bicker staff threw a good one to the floor the basket as well Applause Music Applause made three for him like that like that you know its making Giants are capable its a dangerous team ties a career high with his seventh made three Tom and this they really work to get him and even Zachary with the challenge and you see on the uh on the weak side Victor staff didnt even foul Applause last year the sheski made Seven threes at North Carolina and we have returned to normal good with the freethrow line its good well and where neither team got into the bonus in the first half Notre Dames going to be shooting for the rest of this half and BC is close foreign so what seems like just a moment ago Boston College led by 14 here comes the Irish somebody removed the cellophane from the basket in front of the Notre Dame bench maybe it was that one free throw by Cormac Ryan just to get him on the board in the second half Madison on target with a three ball really good answer on that uh to stop the drive prior to the Manson make it was an 80 run from Notre Dame Applause foul coming up against Zachary for Boston College so lachesky and his crew back in this one 5447 your local Ford dealer and by The Fresh Market voted number one best supermarket in America Mike Bray responsible for 13 of those trips to the NCAA tournament couple of elite eights in 2015 and 16 and the ACC tournament Champs back in 2015 but you know what and he said something interesting though in his uh press conference is thered only been one time in the last five years I think and that was last year the ncaas and I think that Weighing on him wait on the decision talked about bringing a new voice in energy but what a marvelous Legacy he leaves here and just the whatever hes done here as far as his record is concerned just the better person and Ive been privileged to call him my friend for a long time and hes been with me through thick and thin for sure no question about it I Echo those sentiments lecheski leading his team without question with the seven threepointers the rest of the team trying to keep up with luccheski at the freethrow line so one more for lashesky he and his teammates have made their last three shots after missing 10 in a row prior to that trying to creep back into this one against the Eagles now this is I mean still a lot obviously left in this game but we remember we talked about Earl Grant saying were like 14 15 attempts from three thats where they are right now but shooting a much higher percentage than you normally do see what they do the rest of the way eight made threes for BC nine for the Irish especially against the zone defense that Notre Dames using right now shot clock is at 10 for the Eagles looking for their first road Victory away from Chestnut Hill this season Makai Ashton Langford rattled around the rim and the shefty cradles it for the Irish Applause foreign coach Bray took this program to the NCAA tournament a season ago Hammond had a chance as it bounced off they made the first four last year Mike beat Rutgers in overtime and Alabama in the first round before losing to Texas Tech in the second round of the tournament yeah and it was on that flight back that you know those first thoughts Mike Bray started to reflect on the year and you know is this a good time to step aside and I decided to come back but that was a great take by ham and they had everybody lifted out there was no chance for post to you know to help inside Hammond the grad student student from Queens New York 64 guard for Coach Bray and the transfer from Niagara six grad students on this squad the most of any team in division one it is now a one possession game after Hammonds first free throws of the game Notre Dame extending out a little bit defensively disrupt BC a little bit that zone Has Lifted out a little bit higher Defender fell down post made his way to the bucket foulfall comes from Jamel Spearman on that on the foul heres the look and uh that was uh that that could have gone the other way easily with post first free throws for post in the game as well what are the chances your last name is post and youre a post player I mean and youre accomplished youre youre yeah I mean youre youre pretty much locked into the position youre going to play I mean its like if you name this is a butler it happens it happens good win from the corner he hits a three well its the other guy whos finally stepping up Cormac Ryan Dave Goodwin joining the scoring party now its just a twopoint game and 10 made threes in the game for the Irish after the slow start in the second half Hammond up ahead this is Ryan feeds it to Le Chester you let the defender go Ryan from the corner Music theyre going to let his team play through Ryan giving the Irish the onepoint advantage halfway through the second half backed away from both great hands like Goodwin Applause thats why just a completely different Notre Dame team offensively very active Applause crowd has been disbelief with missed Applause Michelle has tied his career high with seven made threes bicker staff turn around you know you cant you know hes going back to your comment about post you cant what if but boy this team with him healthy from the start of the year different story I think missed the first 13 games with a foot injury Applause actor against North Carolina on Tuesday 17 points and five rebounds the cutter score the basketball offensive fouls its a foul right there Mike Bray is apoplectic on the sideline Applause tough call I mean if you if you get there and you youve established defensive position that was really really close Applause dispatch cant believe it officials were talking JSI were discussing it the foul will be against lecheski well the thing was it looked like he had started to fall down already which is you know it should have been a block there he was he was anticipating taken there watch him hes starting to go backwards right right at this point foreign was in position theres one point of contention he did well though to get outside of the restricted area and then I commend him for taking one of the teamski had a full head of steam going into the rim its a onepoint game BC throws it away well you want to stay tuned for the fast break its presented by your local Ford dealer and thats coming up well talk a little bit more about coach Gray announcing this year would be his last on that Irish bench 11th BC turnover 10 for Notre Dame so theyre about equal there Applause Starling spinning and scoring on the Baseline first basket and he was very aggressive that time going to the Baseline and giving Notre Dame the onepoint lead back and forth we go BC led by as many as 14 points here in this second half Irish has battled its way back into this one Langford to turn around and he makes I like him in the middle of the zone They had a leak Bay there early this year I like him too as a guy to get in and make things happen they both have a nice jump shot from about 10 feet Langford hit double digits with 10 points after that jumper Elite Bay with luccheski now they got the switch Ryan fires away and post adds another one to his rebounding total hes got the DoubleDouble this afternoon first of the year just his seventh game of action Langford cut off by the schewski a league Bay a league Bay knocking it down from the threepoint atmosphere right in front of his own bench and that was his first made field goal of the game and uh they you know what they like for him Tom to build inside out but he looked pretty comfortable on that three BC is tied at season high of nine made threes in a game Cormac Ryan Applause Music side to lashesky and the good kick out to Ryan so Cormac Ryan hits the 123 of the game for the Irish and its a onepoint Eagle League Music BC by one of the road here at Purcell Pavilion a very slow start to the second half of the Irish they did not score a single point about the first five minutes of this second half but they have broken through since in a race to 14 point second half lead for Boston College the other thing too Tom is theyve gotten to the freethrow line which you know what you said it on that one uh the one made free throw and that really was a spark for them cormack Ryan then they followed it up with a barrage of Threes bro Grants team has made nine Notre Dame has made 12 Cormac Ryan by the way weve got two players who win over a thousand points in their career today Makai Ashton Lankford for Boston College number 11 and number five for the Irish Cormac Ryan between here and Stanford for Cormac Ryan Applause Zachary nowhere to go stock clock at 10 for BC post threepointer you know I was just going to say you know Notre Dame is really going to test that threepoint shooting here in the last minutes of this game but four for four from three season High ten made threes for Boston College driving to the Basket Hammond Applause Music Applause BC by two inside of six minutes to go in regulation post was double teamed it didnt stop him tell you what hes shown the ability to I mean he didnt have a charge but he is not bad off of the dribble vasheski is really crowding him out on the perimeter so he just went inside 22 points for post foul committed by The Eagles thats going to be on Jaden Zachary Zacharys been a little quiet in this game for BC Mike with just the two points and thats his fourth personal foul too but uh you know the other thing only three field goal attempts so he really hasnt been hunting his offense hes been letting other people step up and score he was the leading scorer for BC in that meeting in January earlier this month on January 3rd and that was at County forum Zachary had 18 points to lead the Eagles at the line Music so Zachary out Madison in Matson has eight points for Boston College lacheski can get Point number 27 right here so far you got you know Ashton Langford posting Madsen of all multiple threes in this game so theyve got a few weapons out there Music so lasheski right now with 27 points Applause post short on the first attempt second time its in knows good about that he never brought the ball down he kept it up high used his sight never brought the guards into play and got it up quickly tying his career high with 24 points for Clinton post for BC and up by four could win elevates and hits Music it just looks so good in his setup and he really gets his feet squared away and its an easy easy motion one of the best Shooters in the ACC at 46 for Goodwin Ashton Lankford carving his way Up and Under move Betty spotted off the class a little English from Ashton Langford the Celtics have a little Bob Koozie yeah dribbling inside and finishing love it the coos zewski thought about the three a league Bay closed gave it to Goodwin thats as easy a shot as hes had about 10 minutes Music Goodwin now one of six on threepoint tries a little bit of frustration on the defensive end Ill tell you what with Notre Dames runs BC has had an answer in this game it did not shy away not in this instance Miss from Ashton Lankford where Matt Ryan drops it up and kicks this is warts over top of backboard and back to the Eagles Ward still has not scored in this game and its a fourpoint deficit for the Fighting Irish shut gets the Eagles team who leads everybody with 27 now normally Tom that you know you would say all right that post is you know those three those four made threes though if uh those you know that that is normally not a part of his score but he has been fabulous and those three of them came in the first three shots of the game posted only made two threes All Season prior to today Nathan chesky has tied his career high with the seven made threes in just one point off his career high of 28 which hes done twice Notre Dame back into mantoman three and a half minutes to go in regulation roughly post just heaves it Zachary the save right to Starling too strong Madsen was in the vicinity and it looks like hes going to get the foul now see in that instance I mean you like the Hustle but Zachary should not have tried to save this watch this going out of bounds and this this just starts the break and Starling in the right place at the right time hes been aggressive taking it to the rim sometimes you just uh you know he did try to save it back in the direction of his basket but thats the first prethrow attempt of the game for Starling in the first Miss in eight tries yeah just 61 on the year for him yeah Irish had made eight in a row before the Miss from Starland Applause 15 points for Ashton Langford for Boston College second leading scorer today Starling now with three points Three Irish players in double digits also three Boston College Eagles and double digits hes scoring today Applause Zachary trying to work against Starland shot away and Starling committed the foul yeah he bodied up and you know and hes got a size advantage against Zachary he didnt have to pick up that foul bid a little bit on the puff fake but that was a pretty heady play by Zachary to draw the foul right here see hes got him in a good position and uh he made the he made the contact and earned those two free throws Jaden Zachary 82 for the freethrow line on the season his first free throw attempt sophomore from Salem Wisconsin Music Applause he was big in the win in early January had 14 points in the final 10 minutes this is Boston College got the victory 7063 thats uh its Notre Dame is going to have to come from behind in this game they had a 10point lead late in that game and gave up a 174 run DC led by one at Halftime by as many as 14 in this half the cheski takes care of the defender hell go through the freethrow line you know and this a couple of times now the referees have held the whistle on those guys trying to buy an offensive foul Applause you see right you get the you get the mismatch right here and Zachary tried and uh it was close but no whistle on that you know the other thing they havent called is any of the flopping and thats five fouls on Zachary so he leads the game with four points and unfortunately for BC now he will be a spectator on that Eagle bench flopping is a technical foul too comes with two free throws on the first call so lacheski won more free throw thats now 12 of 17 as a team from the line for Fighting Irish foreign Music 28 points how about his day Mike hes got 29 now a new career high with the 29 how about eight of eleven seven of nine from three doesnt miss the free throw either score the basket for BC Applause theres looking uh nice post that time no pun intended that was a good call nobodys stepping in front of him I really I really like this game and now three for three from the freethrow line for post with the make saying theyre going to go a little offense for defense two pulling pulling those a little counterintuitive but pulling post out defensively so they can be a little smaller and stay at home on the fesky cant really see the offense for defense go the other way around so post is now up to 27 points thats a new career high for him as he goes to the benchmarkman is in there for BC now post will come back in other words Cormac Ryans going to go to the freethrow line for the Irish foreign here when the Irish go to the freethrow line you know I I get it I always like noise even at home you know its shooting like this is kind of its a little Eerie a little disconcerting you can actually hear the Irish Echoes when its so quiet Music Applause for Ryan Applause theres uh those missed free throws by Notre Dame starting to loom a little larger 1420 from the line in the game for the Irish trailing by five Boston College has made eight of its last 10 field goal attempts Matson Applause clock is at two minutes shot clock is at five Ashton Langford just pumps it up and makes it a shot that he had to take because the shot climbing that possession was going nowhere what a huge bailout 18 points Makai Ashton Langford and his fourth three of the game on eight tries Applause Hammond Stutter Step move and the defender went down thats Demar Lankford foul for BC I mean this is the shot because he has to theres not much going on they didnt get much out of that pick and roll and uh he just Rises up Music so Hammond at the freethrow line two for two so far today seven points Applause Irish leaving some points on the floor Applause empty for Hammond postgrad that and a foul was committed in the backcourt Applause this is you know if youre looking at the game coming in theory should have been a huge Edge for Notre Dame at the freethrow line one of the best shooting teams Applause so post is back at the free throw line for BC where they are 11 of 13 as a team post hasnt missed and he still has it this one heres your upcoming schedule presented by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina for the Eagles well I mean should they finish and close the deal here its going to be a huge confidence builder for this team going into the second half of the Season you get Louisville at home which looks like a winnable game you know at this point then the uh he picks up a little bit with Virginia and Clemson in the near term but having that guy Mr post healthy is huge hes got 29 Points and the Eagles have the ball back Applause Boston College lost at North Carolina on Tuesday Mike but I think they gained a lot of momentum from the effort for their game against the Tar Heels the loss 7264 it would have been not fouling in this situation will reach in on Ashton Lankford on the drive so the lead is 10 right now lets take a look at todays protecting the paint its brought to you by CPI Security as if post hasnt done enough he does it on defensive end yeah three blocks for the Eagles on the game you know I said shot blocking has been a big apartment that was early in the first half and thats what happened to seven footer in there does for you you know some there are media guides seven Footers Tom and then there are legitimate and he is all of sudden feet what a day for Quentin post to the Eagles 29 Points and Kai Ashton Lankford his teammate at the freethrow line can get it to an even 20 with this free throw Applause win over a thousand points in his career with his effort today for Makai Ashton Lankford with 20 points and 44 from the free throw line Applause starling his quiet afternoon continues and now the final 50 seconds or so inside of Purcell Pavilion it was really close in the second half Mike and it looks like BC is going to outlast the Irish in this instance well and thats you know its impressive that a team like this you know with a losing record you know they fought hard you know they fought hard down to Carolina and its carried over to here I think theyve uh Mr post is getting in game shape thats the first Miss from threepoint distance for posting the game he had made four after making just two allseason vickerstaff for deflection the Eagles are just going to dribble this one out so Boston College has its first win here against the Irish in South Bend since December 2019 final count Mike 8472 Earl Grant and the Eagles get their first road win of the season and how about bouncing back oh of six against North Carolina from 3 11 of 19 in this game with just a terrific overall offensive performance a season high for made threes by The Eagles with those 11 Notre Dame hit 12 threepointers but it was not enough lachesky led the way with 29 Points a new career high for him once again our final score 8472 from Mike jaminsky and our outstanding ACC basketball production crew Im Tom wormy so long from Purcell Pavilion its the Eagles over the Irish this is the ultimate easy entree our ultimate lump
