to an H opposite TJ Pickers tap we mentioned the injuries Makai Ashton Langford out for Boston College once again today for UNH Kyrie Brown is out as well for the Wildcats the Junior from Oakland California averaging 124 points per game and so both teams dealing with it as we get this game started Eagles win the tip and off week goal here Boston College has lost two in a row UNH lost five straight since winning their first two games of the season so both teams looking to kind of spark things once again DJ Pena first chance on the drive and bucket yeah great Drive Right There by Pena to start it off we talked about earlier how hes getting an opportunity and way to start with an easy drive with a layup Dania is gone for at least 10 points five times this year including each of the last two games for Boston College losses on the road at Nebraska and at Duke the ACC Big Time Challenge and then opening up conference play threepoint Try by Trey Woodyard was off the mark possession will stay here with 1912 to go in the first right there paying you with the great drive one dribble getting to The Rim finishing strong to the basket were gonna see those threepoint shots today for UNH they are consistently taking them significantly more than we see out of Boston College that should be an interesting look at this game chance here for two teach goes left hand and gets the friendly roll the Freshman from Serbia whos playing at his seventh game and making his fourth start today averaging four per contest and he ties the game Applause Lamar Langford making his third start of the season and theres the bucket from TJ Bickerstaff nice two for the Eagles senior and thats a bonus when TJ can score we know how tremendous athlete he is and how he rebounds but when they get baskets from him post cram the staff are happening Daniels cut from three so two attempts one mate from behind the arc for unh Daniels came in five of 13 from behind the arc averaging more than 14 points a game the Wildcats leading scorer 10 to shoot for Demar Langford Jr trying to find Space turns around and makes great shot right there by Demar patience great balance did the shimmy with the shoulder easy elbow shot Applause its important for him to find the confidence in those shots early on in a ball game Applause those again that time in and out looked good from behind the arc for Clarence Daniels he goes up by one early Applause these two teams this is not a game of Run and Gun here today both of these teams play it fairly slow tempos thats a traveling violation called on CJ Pena gonna see a lot deep into the shot clock as this was from DeMar Langford it was great Patience by Demar trying to find someone he said oh no ones open let me get to my spot and pull up easy shot preferred averaging six points a game missed the first two games of the season and then also missed the Wyoming Game dealing with injury as again has been the theme for this Boston College team this year Applause Nick Johnson making his first start of the season the Junior from the Bronx whos the lone returning starter from last years UNH team 10 newcomers on this Wildcat Squad Madisons triple try not there and theres a rebound for Daniels Applause certainly see how involved Daniels is in everything that UNH does absolutely they go to him all the time trying to get them down low and get things going off and on the early on the offensive end some of the guys were talking about for Boston College theyve been without Quentin post all year Lamar Langford Smiths Time Prince aldeek Bay is expected to play today again limited minutes but more than what we saw against Duke as he comes back no Makai Ashton Lankford as we said and Donald hand Jr out for the season for Boston College he had a lot of energy injuries for this BC team but you have to come in BC and their staff what theyve done with as many people out Astro Grant earlier today I said is it hurting you in practice too because youre just down bodies and he said practice reps are actually much more about the games and how did the schedule of you know just last week going to Nebraska coming back you got to give an off day somewhere then going to Duke so a twogame trip not staying on the road so it does lessen the practice time it does trip to Nebraska then to Duke now UNH home Im sure these staff and the players are happy to be back in their own bedrooms against Jaden Zachary for Boston College Applause sends Nick Johnson to the line and averaged eight and a half points a game last year for unh talked about the newcomers on this UNH roster you see Earl Grant looking on in his second season as the head coach of Boston College with the line for Johnson Earl tout with this last year where Boston College only had 27 percent of their points returning UNH brought back just 18 of their points from last season when they finished tied for third in America East theres the followup by bitter staff great rebound right there by bicker staff growing up after Penas missed thats what he does give BC extra opportunities Eagles lead by one back and forth early the game playing out of Doubt as expected foul will go against Pena which sends us to a Timeout on the floor early stages first half and a onepoint lead for Boston College Music take a picture her boss to college over New Hampshire early to chat about the Wildcats as we were talking about 10 newcomers 16 percent of the scoring coming back the biggest thing though that jumps off the stats is this is a team that just does not turn the ball over no theyre not theyre well Coast they Pride themselves on defense and they dont like live ball turnovers theyd rather shot clock expire than turn the ball over I dont know if Earl Grant did this on purpose but he has gone with the veteran opposing coaches throughout his card this year Bill Harry in 18 years at UNH 32 years overall consecutively as a head coach since 199192 hes with Drexel and East Carolina 18 years here with New Hampshire foreign Applause there is Daniels an early five points for Clarence Daniels and a rebound as well yeah thats a tough matchup for Demar with the size and strength and as you were talking about earlier the fact that its the left hand with Daniels as well Damar left hand here a little short but read it early got it back finds Matson whos short on the three somehow the has kept that alive CJ Pena walks into a triple great work right there by McLaughlin keeping the ball alive giving the Eagles a second chance opportunity and Pena right on cue making a big three right there Second Chance third chance Ive even been a fourth chance on that sequence lost to college up by two Eagles put on a bit of a press that three ball was well short for Nick Johnson and Chaz Kelly in the game for the first time for BC The Freshman from Houston again down Makai Ashton Lankford really a lot on Kelly kind of mixing in with Jaden Zachary at the one couldnt finish at the rim and this is out of bounds to the cats lets go back to this play that the plotton made over here yeah great effort to play diving keeping it alive getting into Madison and then bang the big three by Pena CJ Pena 33 from behind the arc again Boston College who dont rely on the threepoint shot all that much compared to what we see from a lot of teams obviously a weapon when they can be efficient with it Applause at harassment lost the handle on it so a rare turnover for the Wildcats and its Prince Elite Bay into the game and off the mic from three the league Bay who had just that marvelous debut against Cornell including the buzzer beater that is Daniels right to the 10 certainly making his presence known yeah theyre right there again tomorrow not used to playing the low post Guy usually guarding the outside its a different beastwind Daniels is down there wide opened up 1111 in Zachary back in as well for BC Demar thats a three on rebound a league theyve got a piece of it ends up with Zachary whos straight on and couldnt finish DC had two pretty good looks but now all of a sudden just one of their last seven from the floor but its another turnover and then the foul goes against New Hampshire and Matt harassment and right here Demar goes for the reach Daniels gets it and says oh the Seas party ice easy lefthanded dunk foreign so far seven of New Hampshires 11 points so far coming off of a doubledouble against Colombia including a careerhigh 18 rebounds been a really impressive start to the year coming in from Lake Region State College in North Dakota where he was an NJCAA AllAmerican honorable mention but still the Step Up In level and Daniels has really made an impact for UNH yeah no hes a tremendous player and right now hes real comfortable scoring early and often thats a dangerous recipe started his career at Montana state division two team Montana State Billings that is offensive rebound try Johnson Music there was timeout calls there was jump ball calls that is indeed a held ball which will keep possession here I think you have to have the ball of a call timeout its just safe right yeah absolutely everyone wants to call a timeout but right here everyones fighting for the ball you got to get the Wildcats and the Eagles credit no ones giving up on these 50 50 balls trying to get extra possessions for their teams Applause per game you want to go more than that these are two teams that were going to see sequences like this where we can go a minute or two without seeing a basket were gonna see deep shot clock runs and again both of these teams just you know in terms of their points per game right around 63 64 points a game its a steel off yeah great play by biggerstaff not giving up great still by Kelly couldnt finish it but bigger staff Patton stats getting that offensive Rebound in the bucket Bakers death who went for double figures the first two games of the Season it cooled off offensively a bit recently and how about Daniels who already has 10 points beggar party they actually called that a two not a three so nine for Daniels yeah he can do it all face you up shoot it get back to the basket looks good a league Bay offensive rebound Applause rebound by Prince going back up he needed that just to see the ball going in yep first basket since the gamewinner against Cornell twopoint lead Boston College of the debut for Prince a league Bay the game winner against Cornell to give the Eagles the 7977 victory in the opener you talk about bursting on the scene as a freshman how good was that no that was awesome because coaches staff are really high on Prince he came out proved it first game scoring early and often and then what way to start a career by with a game winner now it comes into one of these scenarios where four star recruit immediately comes in as one of the higher rated recruits in Boston College history theres a lot on that when you come in as a freshman for a program thats obviously looking to take kind of the next step and again the injury kind of slows things down a little bit but now is starting to play again play four minutes against Duke were expecting certainly a little bit more maybe some time in both halves today but he has an opportunity to really be something special oh absolutely hes one of those players that will go down on the record books at BC he does it all scores rebounds plays defense and hes a tremendous leader plus hes named Prince and hes from Minnesota so thats a good start right youre absolutely right on that whatever and a chance for a league Bay and that is an offensive foul Applause yeah Franks hitting the ball down low got to give Daniels credit gave up his body charge on the other way cant argue with that call time the elbow comes out thats going to lead to the call more times than not so a league Bay will go to the bench for Boston College after two minutes on the floor and he works back in from injury and was injured just four minutes into the next game against Detroit Mercy a couple of days later so really again weve not seen that much of a league base since that beautiful debut three ball is Off the Mark that time from Jackson Baker the grad transfer from Central Arkansas Applause played 18 Minutes last year four and a half points Zachary goes crashing into the cheerleaders Applause yeah passed by Damar tough there but Zachary doing a great job saving it throwing it off the New Hampshire player giving DC an another opportunity on offense tough year for the cheerleaders got Zachary going in they were on the wrong end of it TJ biggerstaff block earlier this year run around Kelly on the drive out to Zachary three ball is Off the Mark Eagles are just one of seven from behind the arc tonight and then kind of a wild sequence on the other end Nick Johnson Off the Mark heres Kelly on the Run missed the buddy but the fagoid great fun credit yeah and a lot of people I thought Kelly was going to finish that you know as a freshman coming up hell get better with that but not give up on the play bigger staff with the Tipping Applause so eight for bicker staff heres Daniels on a strong drive but couldnt finish at The Rim Zachary getting the rebound going Coast to Coast pushing it makes a great drop pass to chase Kelly couldnt finish it but TJ not giving up on the play with the Tipping Im not so sure that didnt hit Kelly on the way up they may take a peek at that and I wonder if theyll end up giving that to Kelly either way its a 1713 lead for Boston College halfway through the first half Demar Langford and couldnt finish at The Rim those are big good on the offensive boards though so far Zachary got there so BC so far eight offensive rebounds in the game it has led to 11 Second Chance points Daniels Up and Under move Applause tough move right there by Dennis reverse pivot Drive Baseline and use the rim as protection as he finished with his left hand and now in the double figures thats 11 for Daniels Applause all eight games and his first to the division one level in double figures for Daniels Pena faked and then missed at The Rim Applause and a double triple Applause great reverse pivot Drive Baseline using the rim as protection from The Defenders and finishing with the kiss great move right there by Daniels this is what we just saw on the double dribble when he was trying to pick it up may have been in a second time yeah right there he has to pick it up control it and pass it he thought he can dribble it and recall by The Ref with the double trip thank you a twopoint game as the Eagles back on offense BC shooting 33 percent from the floor really sometimes it hasnt been Second Chance points maybe then third chance fourth Champion all kinds of goes into the same category so as we said 11 of the Eagles 17 points or second chance points today it is it seems like right now their best offense are missed shots Zachary for three there again Applause Eagles have struggled from behind the arc theyve made up for it on the offensive blast so far Daniel Hart charging down the lane and he ties the game 13 of unhs 17 points for Clarence Daniels Zachary to answer blocked butt a foul what a job by Clarence Daniels impressing so far you are team points on six of eight shooting he is hes been efficient at a nice dunk to get going unreversed basket right there going to the rim right now and paying you taking the contact falling off glass I tell you Garden lefties are tough everyones so used to guarding people going right but Daniels is definitely making the most of his uh night right now feels like when hes driving too hes picking up speed as hes going in the lane as well he definitely is he doesnt want the contact what I love about Daniels game is that he cant absorb it also not bouncing off of these tough BC players Trey Woodyard committed the foul before we went to the timeout so Jaden Zachary at the foul line for Boston College two at the line to give the Eagles a twopoint lead Zachary leading Boston College 86 percent from the foul line in his first two points of the game Applause Azeem Derry in there for the first time for UNH got it to Woodyard short on the three ball how about that rebound from Daniels oh man the it looked like it was there for Matt harassment I just couldnt finish at The Rim yeah unfortunate Miss right there for Q a shes not going to get an easier shot this evening Applause then in there for Boston College for the first time heres Mattson and hits a three thats a big one for Madsen who had started over two today he was just one of his last 17 from behind the arc and for no though with those Shooters sometimes just takes one to get hot youre absolutely right just one to go in and seems like the rim is really huge for him but he has to continue to shoot him shoot when hes open we already saw Madison tie a career high with five threes in the win against Detroit Mercy thats the three ball from the Zim Terry foreign Applause College to the division two level in Wilmington Delaware now Daniels follow his good from rip on to each freshman ties the game again for unh there he is again Daniels right along queue with a steal couldnt finish it but the UNH team following up his bet their best player with the Tipping foreign this game is not going to go into the Museum of Modern Art in terms of layups made but the second chance ones were getting there 2422 BC it was a ride on QP Pena beta layups for you there Eric heres the three ball erasmay no good I want a rebound by Woodyard though both teams strong on the offensive glass thank you an eight to shoot for Daniels Applause thats a tough shot when youre feeling it youre feeling it great defense by paying you sometimes you got to tip your cap to the offensive player Demar Langford off the mark from three Daniels walks in got it Daniels has already tied his division one career high with 18 points wow right there talk about walking into a threepointer when the players feel that hes filmed it Im telling you from experience Eric that Rim looks huge to Daniels right now Applause two for McLaughlin I hope youre saying it from experience because I dont have that experience so thats why were relying on you for that one yeah when youre filming it thats what you call a heat check three right there Applause 2726 New Hampshire Applause harassment on the drive back the left hand Applause two for Matt harassment Applause great work right there by harassment missing it just giving energy and effort getting a second chance opportunity and scoring Langford again a little strong that time and harassment is going to pick up the offensive foul so Langford draws it and sends us to a Timeout on the floor I mean you talk about feeling it 18 already for Mr Daniels well by visiting vorg Stuart amazing cause once again during this fee week here on the ESPN family of Networks threepoint lead New Hampshire a glockton elite Bay Kelly all back in for Earl Grant and Boston College and that did not get off in time yeah great defense right there by unh over communicating on defense switching pointing thats what leads to shot clock violations 29 Points for New Hampshire 18 of them for Clarence Daniels nearly a steal but Daniels has another layup its a new division one career high first time at 20 for Daniels this is first season with New Hampshire thats impressive we still have another half to play Applause Ellie right hand floater good they did by the way change that earlier basket that we were talking about to Kelly so thats four points now for the Eagles freshman I was certainly getting thrown into the fire this year because of some of the injuries that Boston College has dealt with Applause averaging 17 minutes a game Applause will go against Jamar Lankford Music and the Eagles have to figure out whos going to guard ends theyre trying to Mar Daniels little taller scoring over him maybe they need to put Prince on to try to switch things up I got a piece and then second effort was called a foul so 2 000 a row there on Demar Langford and thats what can happen sometimes right you try to be over aggressive and then all of a sudden you get the backtoback fouls yeah and thats just what happened right there Lamar trying to make a play on the ball the first one he let go the second one was a lot of contact they had to call it by the way thats also the seventh foul on Boston College so UNH will shoot for the remaining 228 of this first half thank you Boston College two fouls on Langford two fouls on a league Bang so another thing we dont really talk about Daniels we talk about his rebounding and scoring but he gets other opponents in foul trouble Applause its down the free throw where he shoots 77 percent again last year was an AllAmerica honorable mention at the junior college level at Lake Region States after coming in from Montana State Billings which is a division two School but worth noting each he did not play Montana State Billings did not compete in the 20 20 2121 season due to the pandemic so really he played 201920 with Montana State Billings then basically the whole year off then last year at Junior College and now hes averaging almost a double double at the division one level impressive by that young man just going through all that adversity now hes on the stage hes having fun right hand Applause gun has limited coming back from injury Applause Music Applause twopoint lead New Hampshire 94 seconds remaining first half five to shoot Daniels Zachary guarding him close one to shoot and a big block outstanding defense by Jaden Zachary yeah great defense by Zachary shot clock winding down theyre holding his ground staying down Noni wants to get left 10 to the threepoint shot probably got away with a little Ticky tack to him Prince backing down getting to his spot got the charge last time this one finished and easy Zachary on the blow by four for Zachary and the Eagles Square the game once again 32 a piece and a block by McLaughlin followup no good for Johnson and all of a sudden this is turned into a bit of a track meet a league Bay on the run and fouled by Daniels uh Music with a blow by by Demar but McLaughlin had playing Team defense getting in there for the block hes such an underrated shot blocker for this Eagle team a blocked in thing just kind of writes itself right I like that we gotta we gotta we gotta let him know about that hes 10th in the ACC and blocks coming in for the sophomore something that we chatted with Earl Grandpa for the game the fact that McLaughlin redshirted last year but was around repeating every day in practice against James karnick and against quick post and being around has to make that transition to this year and being able to produce as fast as he has a little bit more seamless oh absolutely him taking that year off and like you said practicing competing with these guys and carnic was a man amongst boys last year and for him to go against him every day you know Devons confidence is really high when he goes up against other opponents two at the line for elite Bay and the Eagles lead by two Applause with a league value is hit and fouled foreign Music Applause with the steal he was switched on to Daniels the leak out by Prince got his foot taken out of him for the dunk officials gonna look at to see if its a flavoring one Eric obviously a scary situation where Elite Bay coming off of an injury was injured in a similar area on the floor against Detroit Mercy and thankfully seems to be okay this was the injury right there kind of going down stepped on a teammate and this that one remember that was four minutes into the game against Detroit Mercy so came back for his first time four minutes against Duke last time out just to get him in just to get a little bit you do have to build back up after basically sitting for a month yeah no absolutely Coast Grant put him in against Duke just to give him some experience uh before this game get his legs going against an ACC opponent but right there as youre coming off an injury when you go up to finish a dunk and you feel your leg getting taken out of you sure he had flashbacks of him hurting his ankle John Gaffney Doug shows and JD Ross are officials today call on the floor stance so it will be two shots Ill take one more look it almost seemed like he was trying to get out of the way and you ended up making contact on the way by it did but you still have to protect your players on both sides you know game I dont know if that warrants the flagrant one but I think the the correct call is a common foul but coach Grant doesnt like that Music so a league Bay will go to the foul line six points so far for Prince Music despite this last sequence on two fouls which he picked up early you see working through it getting his points foreign here Applause thats six second difference between The Possession and the game clock and the timeout by unh threepoint lead Boston College late in the first half will step aside for 30 seconds we love our new family thats awesome what a name sunny beautiful baby great to hear for Lewis and our congratulations so 14 out of the timer 20 of the game in the end of the first half Woodyard hes had it for a long time Derry cats got to do something down to three they do get to the rim but it was blocked by a league Bay then thrown away but a foul was called before the pass so Nick Johnson called for the foul on UNH and Boston College will shoot as thats the seventh team foul on New Hampshire the Eagles very fortunate Blow by Devin with the block again it looks like and Prince uncharacteristically just threw it away but got bailed out with the foul call A lot of times in a sequence like that you see a team youre going down to seven or six and you wait to go but UNH did actually manage to get to the rim on that sequence a good defense by BC as you said and now a league Bay back to the foul line seven points already front end to the one and one no Applause annuals pulled the rebound chance for Derry lake is good so that is seven nothing Boston College run and it ties the game for UNH as we go to the halftime break you see the shooting numbers 41 for Boston College 45 for New Hampshire but again nine of the 14 makes from the floor for New Hampshire were from Clarence Daniels you know that that threepointer late almost skews what was remembered on a seven nothing run and it really felt like they had taken a Stranglehold of the game before that three it didnt thats what you call a momentum stopper for the Eagles always want to go up at the half versus tied or down the EC has lost two in a row UNH has lost five five in a row Applause on this Tuesday night in Chestnut Hill it is Zachary against Daniels to start he gives up some size there thats the traveling violation though against Daniels thank you and a great job by coast friend and his staff switching Zachary on to Daniels little different look there a little more base down low for the for Zachary a different look and right there forced to turn over I know this wasnt an issue for you very often but whats the challenge when youre a smaller guy guarding a guy who you are giving up as bigger staff at The Rim so much size too yeah its one of those things where you have to find that Medium you dont want to be too aggressive its because youll get a charge but you also dont want to be too soft because now the defense has a leverage so you have to pick and choose but I tell you every time I just got offensive foul just went through them on first got a twopoint lead for BC oh Pena got the strip but it cuts back to Johnson and Nick Johnson with four points third game of the season for Johnson at first start after missing the first five at 11 points two games ago against Sacred Heart the only returning starter for UNH and now its nedson who connects and draws the foul yeah great Drive Right There by Matson getting to the rim two dribbles pull up got hit in the face ref called it horsing it for the shot to go in now he has a chance for a threepoint play youll like with Madsen if you can just get that stroke back a little bit and again its not like youre just relying on all things without evidence weve seen him earlier this year against Detroit Percy it just adds such another dimension to the offense oh absolutely you need a shooter and thats what coach Grants uh been missing so far but its so early in the season still a lot of time to get it going and Im sure Matts going to switch that yeah Daniels five to shoot strip pass Johnson three ball good Nick Johnson and UNH has the lead Applause Daniels did a great job right there getting the double team passing out for an open three in the corner starting to add another dimension Im not sure hes had a make since Zachary was switched on to him at that time obviously made the right pass Madison knew he missed it tried to follow it up helped with the tap out and Zachary is valve foreign comes passes it out with the one more pass in the corner wide open three bang thats what coaches always love to see its they dont get the hockey assistant basketball but this should be a stat Applause asked up an okay look a better one and connected UNH is five of eleven from behind the arc Zachary with five points now its one of those games for Jade thats sort of a Next Level game when you know one of the things Earl Grant mentioned to us is you know when youre a sophomore and all of a sudden youre way higher on the Scout than you were last year its a different kind of challenge so in a game where Zacharys just one of eight from the floor hasnt made a a threepointer but you still got to find a way to catch your points no you have to because hes one of the the top scorers in one of the floor leaders on the floor hes logging a lot of minutes playing great defense and like you said now they know about you its going to be harder to score what yard with a really nice job to avoid Zachary in a fake pass kept it alive Daniels was blocked and thats out of bounds off New Hampshire boy Zachary being switched on to Daniels has created a totally different element to this game it is he absorbs the pressure with his quick hands his guardlike skills got a deflection went off of Daniels out of bounds Applause if steal of the game for Boston College Applause Zachary tried to split and ends up as a held ball and possession wont go to New Hampshire a great defense right here by New Hampshire closing the gaps getting hands on the ball right there A lot of times you dont want help from the strong side but Scotty report was great big when Zachary goes he wants to get to the rim and great defense like when you were rushing for an elevator door and its just slams shut nowhere to go nice job by two teach to wait got it back oh but he missed twice Applause I know he wants that back easy layup right there did everything right pep it high but just couldnt finish its been very different ways that both these teams have gotten their points Daniels has 21 of unhs 40 Austin College everyone who has played has scored Pena for three Bickerstaff got an offensive rebound it was fouled yeah like coach Grant said he wants to get a little more continuity on the offensive end seems like theyre doing a lot of oneonone where the UNH side the ball is popping moving around back and forth getting reversed that was the first foul on to teach already the Third on UNH heres Mattson thats no good for deep but Zachary has an offensive rebound and that is a held ball and possession will stay here when we come back to Conti forum gone on a little bit of a scoreless drought here but Zachary has picked things up defensively love our new home theres so much space but we have ants expired expired its a lot of house I hope you can keep it clean at least Geico makes bundling our home and car insurance easy for bundling Made Easy Go to geicocom some members of the Boston College volleyball team say congrats to them as they have established a School record with 21 wins after win over St Johns this past Saturday they will look to add to their record Winton tomorrow night here on acc Network extra in the third round of the national Invitational Volleyball championship they will take on Xavier thats a 730 start tomorrow night in the third round right here on acc Network extra Applause Congress to the ladies very successful season were at the canal center that is an offensive foul Applause and right there Kelly has to understand he has the advantage no need to lower the shoulder come to a jump stop and kiss it off the glass Applause its one of those perfect for Earl Grant to cue the tape and if just as you said as soon as that shoulder dips its going the other way again hung around this one point lead for Boston College for a while Eagles havent hit a field goal in almost three minutes but UNH has not scored in more than two minutes that ends now Nick Johnson with nine and the Wildcats Take the Lead back right there offensive rebounds we said it UNH seems like the best offense for both teams are missed shots its our 11th leave change tonight the league Bay back in for Boston College vicker stop trying to find something to teach has the rebound Applause oh its Daniels 24 points for Clarence Daniels and right there UNH got him off the ball people driving down the lane find the best shooter wide open Bang I think that was the first time he got free of Zachary ever since BC made the switch could have even been a travel ends up being thrown away and Wildcats theyre Applause arches lead of this second half Daniels foreign ER good 26 points for Clarence Daniels and a timeout Earl grants yeah quick 50 spurt right there for Daniels what a game for Clarence Daniels he scored five in a row cats have scored seven straight to lead by six all right back here great find for the open three for Daniels right now backing down his own five old spurt showing Zachary that hes too small great start right here in the second half for unh hey on the drive goes up and gets it prints a league Bay big spot and that ends the New Hampshire run which was 70 and brings it back to a fourpoint game Music for a guy who was coming back and again was going to play limitedish minutes Prince the league base been really big on the offensive end theres a bell and count the bucket he has Prince has been tremendous on the offensive end right now not playing a lot but right there the Eagles have to secure the defensive rebound played great D but you got to secure that great bounce right into Nick Johnsons hand easy layup and see if you can have a traditional threepoint play its the third foul on Demar Langsford and Johnson does indeed that is a new season High by the way for Johnson whos up to 12 points was the America East Rookie of the Year as a freshman a couple of years ago averaged nearly eight points a game got another solid year last year again hes the lone returning starter from last years team McLaughlin was off balance there and UNH with its largest lead of the game and on possession here with under 13 minutes remaining in the second half Applause fastball inside to teach got another yeah great play right there by UNH using the high ball screen dragging it out so the big man can roll and finding two tips down low for the easy layup its a nine point Wildcats lead Zachary trying to drive inside floater no and that time Daniels going for the rebound and was fouled and if thats a league Bay thats three on a league Bay Music three on Langford and three on Prince alike yeah great defense by UNH but Daniels going up for the rebound a league big got caught with his hand in the cookie jar its a foul every time its a 122 Wildcats run over the last three minutes Eagles are one of seven from the floor over that span Applause seemed dairy in there got it off Johnson three ball was strong Applause entrance for Langford trying to go up and go sh great catch right there by Langford showing the hands great law by Zachary in the easy finish by length Eagles needed that one and one free throw coming up when we come back Music the thing that you know Earl Grant doesnt want to make any excuses and hes talked a lot about how you know just next guy up we gotta continue to perform but uh this is a lot thats out right now for Boston College and again you missed a lot of the league Bay early hes back now but still on a minutes restriction although we may not see that the rest of the way depending on what happens and again without tunnel Camp as well for the rest of the year oh youre absolutely right you know you you have one of your other floor generals out Makai and then you have your centerpiece Quentin both who arguably is one of the best players on this BC team our miss the Antoine remember that UNH is also without Kyrie Brown their second leading scorer Whos Alex but Daniels has made up for that and more 26 points on 1114 shooting to lead the Wildcats who are up 5245 on Boston College Johnson again Falling Away Daniels got an offensive rebound the timer did not reset so he had to go up quickly and is up to 28 points what a show right there by Daniels in an offensive rebound again being conscious of the shot clock and going up scoring Applause 28 points with 11 minutes left my goodness Langford trying to find Space managed to get up that was good work with the footwork not to travel that was dont know how he got that shot off thats called athleticism right there great shot in the crowd also probably could have got called for a foul as well 5447 Applause Woodyard was up high five to shoot New Hampshire Derry thought about it Daniels got to get it up and is fouled and that is the fourth foul on Prince a league Bay yeah thats a tough one right there shot clock running down it goes about three seconds left on it got hit on the elbow Daniels with the ball Prince with his hand up this got hit on the elbow Applause lets watch that offensive rebound again yeah great work by Daniels you keep calling his name but hes been doing everything this evening 29 Points has not have an opportunity to get to the 30 at the charity strike but he has been UNH all evening Applause wont get 30 for now 5547 New Hampshire Zachary has not had the stroke from three tonight no right there was a wide open shot just couldnt get it to go down Eagles have to start getting some stops consecutively on the defensive end 10 minutes to go in the game UNH can tend to run it deep in the timer theyve done it all day three ball bouncing around and out offensive rebound and Daniels again trying to find dare you missed the three Applause tend to shoot tied up underneath and its out of bounds to Boston College right here UNH is having the industrious work down low tipping it out climbing over BCs back clawing giving them Second Chance opportunities fighting for everything Music Applause Music lob for DeMar Ford Demar Langford I think thats the easiest basket the Eagles have made in this second half its an 1810 run for New Hampshire a lead at the moment is six down to six to shoot two teach nice move but couldnt finish yeah that was tremendous move great footwork right there fastball Ford McLaughlin and the Eagles starting to go inside and get some momentum back here I think UNH is going to call a timeout right in front of coach Bill Harry and indeed they will yeah thats a great time out right there by coach the Eagles have been committed to going down low like you said and scoring easy BC try to claw back in it down to a four point UNH lead for cancer research this is a game at changing research that helps save lives you can join the fight against cancer by visiting vorg donate and remember 100 of your donation goes directly to cancer research great to be part of the ESPN family of networks and part of V week its amazing thing that ESPN does every year foreign to go out of the New Hampshire timeout its a good look for the three balls short from Matt harass me that was great executedly executed play coming out of timeout they got a wide open shot just couldnt make it Applause have to think theres going to be a lot of pain touches down the stretch here for Boston College Applause and ride on cues they go down low lankfords backing down kept the handle on it went one on Two And managed to draw the foul yes bar taking his time bouncing ball faking and just came over and hit him in his airspace most of the free throw line every time on that referred with eight points so far today his season high is 10 remember missed the first couple of games due to injury still working his way back into form Applause and Boston College is within two Eagles putting on the Press Applause foreign Falling Away two teams got an offensive rebound Johnson on the drive short two teach again and a foul on Langford how about two tips right there down low doing all the Dirty Work throwing bodies around with this big frame this shot okay no problem Ill go in and get that rebound and Langford reach standing got him on the foul now heres the trouble for Boston College its 4 000 tomorrow Langford and 4 000 Prince a league back Earl Grants Gonna Leave Damar Langford out there with 7 22 remaining here in the second half yeah thats the dicey call but Im assuming hes saying hes a veteran player hes been there before this hope he told them do not foul foreign Music Applause defensively Applause its a sixnothing Boston College run UNH despite that whole sequence did not score Applause preferred Falling Away a little short on that jumper we saw him make so often last year oh Jesus he did that was his patented goto Al came before The Block I think theyll get Madsen on the foul sac foul on Mason Madsen the transfer from Cincinnati yeah it seems every time the Eagles make a run UNH counter punches right there going to the rim match and gets him on the elbow two shots for unh Applause to have not scored in three minutes in 41 seconds Applause Johnson only other Wildcat double figures this is the front end Daniels has had 29 Johnson with 12 then he had two teeth with six Derry with six and harassment with two thats it whereas Boston College has played eight and eight have at least four points killed missed at the line and a get a chance for Boston College to either tie or potentially take the lead with the three there is a cut to Zachary and it was touched by harassment yeah great backdoor cut right there by Zachary with the overplay UNH thought it might have hit off Zacharys leg on the way by Applause front on the drive and that and that if so Langford fouls out on the offensive foul yeah thats a tough way to go right there trying to make a play great defense right there by Nick Johnson sacrificing his body and you said it earlier Eric coach Grant rolled the dice one to play him and unfortunate that that was the bang bang call officer foul fifth foul so he will go out tying his season high with 10 points tonight if felt like there was some momentum there offensively and I think thats what Earl Grant was trying to ride it was you know hes one of your best players youve got to go to him and uh just a great defensive play right there by Johnson Applause Ray ball Baker Applause and thatll go out of bounds and Boston College will get possession back UNH has not scored in four and a half minutes now lead which was as much as nine foreign Boston College still is on a six nothing run here though the Eagles now have not scored in about a minute and a half is poiser a premium in this game Zachary and Daniels flying in for the rebound and the foul is on Zachary Daniels going up over Zachary grabbing the rebound and lets see here Applause and that battle goes against Jaden Zachary Applause or beg your pardon that foul goes against Daniels so I guess the refs came together and must have changed that is Daniels on the foul called over the back but that was a great rebound by Daniels adson open for three Off the Mark and its Nick Johnson who pulls it down Applause two minutes 29 seconds without a point in this game and UNH remains up by two Applause Johnson steps out of bounds yeah that was great defense right there by Devin McLaughlin not giving up any uh room for the Defenders the offense offensive player to get to the rim and those lines are out there for a reason Eric got to stay away from it seems like every game players step out Applause another grind to the Finish Madsen saw his defender on the hardwood in front of him and then thrown away Applause and UNH will try to slow things down we have held it 5553 for three and a half minutes now Applause Baker that is off of Boston College Prince the league Bay back in for BC yes uh UNH is definitely fortunate because that definitely went off of Daniels leg cant review that right now aint too far out from the reviews as the game gets closer to the end nice play inside and the foul on Kelly if the defender up in the air and UNH will go to the line yeah great out of bounds play curl there but no help by the Eagles on the young freshman Kelly got into the air and committed the foul Applause Johnson who came in five for eights at the foul line this year was three of four before that shot in the game so far Wildcats five of nine from the line in the game Applause and that one goes and it ends a threeminute 31 second drought without a point Applause and UNH despite not hitting a shot from the floor Danier in seven minutes still holding a threepoint lead yeah thats the thing about it theyre all so proud themselves on defense so theyve been playing tremendous defense during their nonscoring drought a league may open threepointers too strong Applause got a bounce off of unh BC will have five on the timer when we come back to Chestnut Hill Daniels is were gonna need some other pieces around him and heres the breakdown still having a very good second half but not nearly the number of shots and its really been more of an allaround effort to get UNH to this point no it has and Daniels not saying hey theyre stopping me putting more people on me in the second half but hes still going to the rebounds getting the offensive rebounds and defensive rebounds moving the ball and still efficient three or four in the second half UNH leads by three remember five seconds on the shot clock as we come back here out of the timeout Zachary three ball a league Bay got an offensive rebound and fouls Applause thats the fourth foul on Matt harassment he actually looks like they got Daniels beg your part so its three on Daniels they have a great work by Prince not giving up on the play Zachary had a wide open three just not feeling it tonight Applause been big tonight its 10 points now for Prince a league Bay Applause picker staff got an offensive rebound Zachary again oh boy did he need that Applause seems like he hurt me Eric so take that threepointer tonight for Jaden Zachary at Boston College leads for the first time since it was 4140 early second half and and now a traveling violation against New Hampshire and now first lets watch the three ball from Zachary yeah great officer rebound rebound by Bickerstaff kicked out to Zachary they even pay for it this has been a little bit of a trend here for UNH recently they worked really close against Colombia they were close against Sacred Heart couldnt finish the game offensively late and here they have not made a basket in eight minutes Kelly not there from three and Vickers staffs gonna be called for the foul on the rebound were sort of holding out at the line and then played really good defenses you talked about on Boston College but now the calculus changes right all of a sudden no field goals and eight minutes and seven seconds for New Hampshire it is I mean both teams Pride victims they Thrive themselves on defensive men playing great D but right there I just thought Kelly took a illadvised shot deep three early in the shot clock and then TJ with the foul UNH and one and one Applause two teach got the free throw foreign Applause after that make nine of 11 at the line this year staff out for Matson with 3 15 to go Applause short on the second will we remain tied with three ten to go Applause this is where execution matters Eric Applause kick out Madison in and out Applause Eagles are just three four twenty from behind the arc tonight yeah that was a good shot though right there great find by McLaughlin to pass out for Madison for a wide open three Daniels against a league Bay in and out Kelly grabs the rebounds Daniels has been sitting on 29 Points for quite a while oh yes Applause Daniels had the last field goal that UNH made at the 11th 21 marks for the second half we have two minutes left now Zachary is found yeah the great play right there eyeball screen waiting for Zachary to come off on his dominant hand going right as all the momentum gets fouled by unh Daiquiri an 86 free throw shooter this year first Miss tonight Applause Applause I mean Earl Grant is opening press conference said you know ready not pretty and Zachary makes this one its definitely exemplified some other places might be trying to take it it Earl started it here but this game these two teams are combined two for their last all right 19 from the floor Eagles lead by one with 154 to go well thats the thing about claim just great look at top Gasson Hall the beautiful campus here at Chestnut Hill is that your favorite study spot spend many a nights there in Gaston Hall you know its all about the education here at BC and it is a one point lead for Boston College over New Hampshire Daniels 29 Points a career high but has been held a check here over the last seven eight minutes or so just one point the line but he has still been remarkable in a career day and for Demar Langford Jr fouled out for talibe is on four and remember the injury backer in this game Kyrie Brown out for New Hampshire their second leading scorer the Eagles without Demar Langford now because he felled out a kayashton Langford and his 11 points a game still without quick post Applause a league bait coming back from injury today but I I guess you would have to say hes back hes up there in his minutes and has needed them in a major spot 15 minutes in the game so far and big ones harass me pass it up two ball no and the rebound foul called on the rebound attempts by Daniels again right there Daniels knowing he has the size advantage over Zachary just fighting down low going up for the offensive rebound now hes at the free throw line the Eagles are in the double bonus so he gets Two Shots here Music thank you Daniels has not scored since the 1021 mark of this game when he got his 29th point at the line Applause what a game by Daniels I mean very composed team player he has 30 points on 17 shots very efficient 12 rebounds go along with it career night for this young man full double of the season foreign Applause UNH has the lead back 31 of 59 for UNH tonight A clocked in in a big spot 15 to shoot good for McLaughlin Eagles back up one and a timeout New Hampshire great move right there but McLaughlin taking his time Fountain going over his left shoulder baby hook all net I love the patience right there waiting for the guy to cut through as a size advantage like Shaq says thats barbecue chicken all right so now New Hampshire out of the timeout wait that is the final timeout for New Hampshire the Eagles have two remaining and worth noting the possession arrow favors the Wildcats with 118 to go where are the Wildcats going here again remember its been 10 minutes New Hampshires hit a shot from the floor and theyll have to go the full length yeah I mean its no secret theyre going to Daniels but its about where they get on the ball is he going to be in the postup or if it can pop um I like it when they have a ball screen with Daniels on the opposite side and they find him for a shooter its easier for him to get the shot off that way than having the ball pulse up and the defense is locked in on him remember both teams in the bonus so the Eagles cannot foul one point lead for Boston College Johnson trying to find Space kick out harassment elbow jumper is good with just under a minute remaining New Hampshire takes the lead back at a tied up busted College yeah that was a great play right there by rebate ball faked the threepointer got to his spot right to the Elbow where he wanted confident looking shot right there by the young fella waited for a league Bay to jump out and then found the shot at the elbow thats the first field goal made for New Hampshire since the 1121 mark of this second half and now for Boston College the Eagles Ill have to find a little more Magic in a building that sure has provided it so far two point win at the horn against Cornell late go ahead three by Matson against Detroit Mercy fourpoint win against Rhode Island this is what its been at this building for Boston College remember this was the opener Elite Bay beating the horn Applause remember though in that spot it was a tie game on the drive by a league Bay thank you to give Boston College the twopoint win and then against Detroit Mercy hear the Eagles trailed and it was medicine for the lead with 15 seconds left it was so theyve been in this situation before lets see with Coach Grant and the staff draw up Im gonna go on a whim and see theyre gonna run the same play they did before Kelly with the high pick and roll with Devin Applause kicking back to Zachary for his dominant right hand to get downhill and see if he can get to the rim and score or find other Shooters once he gets in the paint first they have the inbound the ball sin will inbound its Zachary McLaughlin Elite Bay and Kelly for Boston College down by one Applause Elite Bay pullup jumper little strong the offensive rebound though by McLaughlin thank you remember it was McLaughlin who pulled the rebound and eventually kicked out for matsons three in that win against Detroit Mercy and another huge offensive rebound here it was thats what you love about Devin doesnt need one play call for him but hes going to do all the little things to keep the team going great locker room presence great hard worker and man did that red shirt gear really benefit him Applause a Glock did 76 percent at the line this year foreign Applause and now this for the lead Applause Boston College up by one Eagles will bring in TJ bicker staff for defense for medicine remember UNH is out of timeouts down by one Applause into Woodyard harass me to bring it up on a seven second difference between The Possession and the game clock Applause Daniels against Zachary on the drive left hand though big rebound McLaughlin great defense right there by the Eagles knowing the ball is going to get to Daniels great team effort but how about that guy again doing the little things great rebound by McLaughlin and McLaughlin who just made two will go back to the line after two now massive rebounds that one on the offensive end and then this one on the defensive boards foreign Applause still a one point game its definitely going to want to make this Applause the roll but then thrown away but a foul its a lead Bay on the push Applause League Bay Applause looks like hes digging him a little nudge but I dont know if theres enough for them to go flying that far lets see watch number 10 for Boston College middle of your screen its right there its right in the back Applause Im not sure that he wasnt just trying to find his footing but I mean he clearly pushes him right there I mean he did and thats five on Prince alike yeah that was a good call right there by the official didnt see it from my vantage point but you were absolutely right once he extended that arm you have to call it it was nearly thrown away in a huge spot and remember because of the bonus UNH is going to go right to the line here down by one with 148 seconds to go and now for Boston College remember you have Langford whos fouled out a league Bay whos fouled out on top of not having Makai Ashton Lankford lets watch it one more time youll see it left side of your screen right there in the back of harassment yeah thats a tough one but he came back from missing six games limited Menace and Duke he gave a valiant effort this evening for the shorthanded Eagles Applause front end no both teams have struggled from the line today UNH 915 BC 13 for 22 Applause still a chance to tie no and a rebound Bickerstaff wow its been there for the taking foreign those are the shots you dream of in your backyard or your playground two shots to win the game and he missed them both this is UNH again weve talked about it lost five in a row including close ones of late Sacred Heart in Columbia at Boston College trying to snap a twogame losing streak it has been foreign offensive game that probably not going to tell the grandkids about but there is still a win to be found in a tight game late hey you said it gritty not pretty this is definitely gritty a little bit not pretty Applause two for Matson Eagles up three now do you foul here normally you should I would foul no foul yet Daniels 43 and the tie its good Applause no no and your age ties it with 13 left yeah its one of those things where you have to figure it out if youre not going to foul or foul you know some coaches dont like to do it because it gives the other team the opportunity to make a free throw and miss it but right there I in my opinion you gotta foul Daniels what a night 34 points yeah I guess Daniels was not ready to go home Eric well in a game that as we just said may not have been the finest offensively Clarence Daniels has certainly shined through in a major way no he has and you know its its one of those things where you could always say to foul or not to foul theres a lot of coaches that wont foul but thats what the thats the percentage and chances you take with that and again its kind of worth noting in that spot all of a sudden you go from up one to up three right theres no timeout taken there because youre trying to save a timeout for this very spot which the Eagles just used it so now 13 hes a chance for Boston College here in a tie game Applause I Music Applause think oh what a game here in Chestnut Hill your time and what a performance by Daniels unbelievable Music as you go into this here yeah and all the time is today is the first two minutes are crucial anyone that goes up four or five points usually win the game Applause sent off the handoff was looking back bickerstaffs way Zachary got inside offensive Bell Applause and thats the third on Zachary Applause all right theyre trying to see if he was going to restrictions the officials came together and I thought I saw John Gaffney maybe signal that he may have been in the restricted area and changed it to a block there theres the initial call that was clearly called a charge there against Zachary but then the officials came together so John Gaffney and Doug shows are going to go over and take a peek C lets take a look one more time and see was its Johnson was he in the restricted area it looks like his right foot was on the line and it is theyre going to change it so it is going to be a block great officiating right there for them to come together and help out each other you know such a bang bang play with these calls for these refs its so tough but and again you know you look the side ref thats John Gaffney here youre going to see appear in your screen hes got to look right at the drive so hes not looking at the feet and thats where you kind of officiate together and get the call right so that call goes against Trey Woodyard Applause which is his third foul Applause the teams still in the bonus and Zachary good at the line Applause these basketball games about inches you make or Miss by inches and offensive fouls or defensive foul by inches seventh time in ten games with 10 plus points for Zachary he has 12 foreign Johnson on the drive and he is fouled in there and uh Nick Johnson just deferred the screen the defense thinking setups that he was going to use the screen rejected it and had a straight line path to the basket I called that foulan Kelly thats his third for Boston College foreign Applause makes at the line tuna top Applause 66 a piece a minute into overtime a clocked in on a straight drive McLaughlin has been big down the stretch and thats what they have to do I said you have to attack Daniels with his four fouls he will basically let you score to stay in this game Applause Derry check out Woodyard passed up the three that floater was too strong its out for Woodyard it never hit the rim so no fresh timer inside Tootsie snow had been off sequence possession all the way through for New Hampshire yeah and right there New Hampshire turned down two wide open threes I think they shot fake too much gotta let those fly Zachary Applause Music down to 10 to shoot floats home its hard to remember the last time either team led by more than a possession but the Eagles are up four Applause by Zachary on the run and Bickerstaff is fouled it was just nowhere to go there but TJ Bickerstaff manages to Trail the foul yeah great sequence right there by Zachary first backing his Man Down giving that shot in the score and then with the deflection on the defensive taking his time back and down all fake contact got it to go and then here with the hands quick hands still in transition finds his big for running two free throws for TJ kicker staff 57 at the line this year Applause free throw struggles today both ways both teams just to shade over 60 at the line Thats Why They Call 3 free 7166 Boston College 72 lead here in overtime Applause Music Eagles have done a nice job to nine Daniels so far in this overtime period Im not sure hes got more than a touch so far and thats what Zachary has done just face guarded him Johnson theres nowhere to go but a foul Applause shot clock winding down four seconds got a great shot blocker there McLaughlin Kelly just has to back off let him go but thats a freshman play right there hell learn these are valuable minutes that hes playing right now in this overtime game I mean look at what Kelly 10 points a season High against Nebraska flying in a really tough environment down at Duke valuable minutes here officially deep going McLaughlin Applause thats now 16 points in the game for Johnson he is too shy of a career high back to a one possession game foreign Applause Applause Music did not get the bounce Applause Music Applause everything and that is a goaltend so count the basket and the foul and UNH can tie at the line wow what a play right there by Nick Johnson going downhill creating this contact getting the foul and McLaughlin going up for the block and inadvertently hit it and one a new careerhigh 19 points for Nick Johnson UNH has scored five in a row Johnson has all seven of the cats overtime points Applause Zachary had it stripped Jackson again theres been some tremendous defensive plays here in the overtime Johnsons got the odd hand right now Applause try to go inside to teach extra pass Warriors short but got it back Applause and then was trying to find Daniels and throw it away under a minute to go in overtime and Earl Grant will use the timeout 17 seconds to go 7171 deep into overtime Music starting to carry the load for the Wildcats it is a great drive right there off of pick and roll one dribble getting to the rim but also doing on the defensive end great defense right there on Zachary getting the deflection and giving you an ace opportunity to go ahead in overtime Johnson who missed the first five games of this season the only returning starter to this New Hampshire team which brought back just 16 of its points from last season 10 newcomers theyve lost five games in a row after winning the first two trying to snap the streak in a big way theyve scored the last five in overtime out of the Boston College timeout sent off a screen Applause can play it out for the lead 10second difference between The Possession and the game Applause Terry for three lets go its good seem scary BC down three 15 seconds to go Kelly on the drive kick to the corner medicine three is short and youll see rebound and then got fouled or actually they have gone out of bounds BC may get another chance here wow what a shot right there by unh I mean Terry goes early in the shot clock I think surprises everyone he absolutely did surprise me but Applause gotta have confidence to take that shot Zachary for three short rebound is down to Derry the hero at the end New Hampshire has upset Boston College Applause what a victory for unh
