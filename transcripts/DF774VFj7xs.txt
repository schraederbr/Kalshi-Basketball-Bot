30 of their misses and four of the top eight offensive rebounders in the SEC play for Florida Underway here in Durham and itll be the Gator with Boogie Fland the Arkansas transfer bringing them into the front court Alex Condan strong to the rim The follow no good but Ruben Chinduloos got it again And this is the strength of the Gator as Jay mentioned getting on the offensive glass Well they isolated Alex Condan for that right hand drive but youre right Dan Ruben Chinulu is the best rebounder in the SEC one of the top offensive rebounders in the country You really have to send five guys to the defensive glass if youre going to have any chance against Florida on the backboard You just saw the starting lineup for the Blue Devils It includes Nicholas Jimena getting his first start of the year Dame Sar who has been struggling recently will come off the bench Patrick Guna knocks down a three He did not attempt a single three last year That is his 12th attempt of this year his third make Ruben Chinulu has the assignment of guarding Cameron Boozer He brings a lot of power but Boozer could take him out on the perimeter I think youll expect to see that especially in the middle of the floor Heres Xavian Lee Three years at Princeton twotime all Ivy The step back three a little bit strong and Jimea with a terrific box out but Pondan comes up with a rebound has it knocked out of bounds Boy it only took a minute and 22 seconds to see how hotly contested every rebound and every play around the rim is going to be A really good vertical contest by Cameron Boozer that allowed Gunga to come from behind and knock that ball away but the vertical contest made the play Duke switching all four Theyre switching one through four right now Thats going to put Cameron Boozer on some perimeter players He just switched back to Condan Flynn gets a piece of the paint Tough pass though at the feet of Condan to turn it over That means they dont get a shot and they dont give their offensive rebounders a chance to go to work You saw Todd Golden there He coached the Gator to a national championship a year ago becoming the youngest national championship winning coach since Jim Valvano of the 1983 NC State Wolf Golden is 40 John Shs only 38 These are not only two of the best young coaches in the sport two of the best coaches each in his fourth season and each having tremendous success plan too strong Heres Caleb Foster off to a very nice start here in his junior season Behind the play an injured Blue Devil It is Nicholas Jimena Jamemena took a push after that rebound and just went down as Duke was bringing the ball up in transition a freshman from Los Angeles as mentioned tonight his first start had been coming off the bench the first eight games John Shier his head coach a huge fan of Jimemenas game and rolled that right ankle on the foot of Thomas how for Florida Xavian Lee has brought the assignment of guarding Isaiah Evans he cannot leave Evans can really hurt you from the threepoint line Hes got to make him a driver and cannot help offer Evans running him around A couple of screens from Gumba The love for Gumba wont go and its down to how the Gator did a great job of reacting to that and just a meeting at the summit up top This Florida front court very experienced very good and very big Very few teams have the size up front That is how who was a fourman last year but playing a lot more of the three this year at 69 with a little horn set Usually get they go to zoom action but they tried to get the right hand drives to both couch and conduct and with every other way that Cameron Boozer can hurt the opposing team Hes also about a 40 shooter from three this year He has just been dominant in really every area of the game and his passing has been so interesting to watch Hes Dukes leading assist guy and you bring two on him and hes going to find an open person Really the big guys on both sides are some of their best playmakers But wouldnt you agree I do agree Condom tries to answer Misses wide right on that three Foster swings it to Sar and its down to Lee and the Gator Lee having a very tough shooting start to his season Although had his best game against Providence in their last game made four threes scored 20 points Crossover by Hal in the hook shot will tie it up Well John Sh thought he dragged that foot but Hal showing his versatility He can put the ball on the deck Excellent defender You know last years team was guard oriented maybe the best guard core in the country shot makers and excellent defenders This years Florida team is more inside oriented Evans got free but left it short Lee doing everything he can to try to stay with him But boy Xavian Lee might get screened more tonight than he ever has if he keeps covering Evans keeps the dribble alive finds Lee with 10 on the shot clock Boozer on him Loves a step back Shimulu back to Lee pulls up and it wont stay down for him But he had a great game against Providence Really been struggling shooting the ball but at 20 against Providence and shot it very well Foster with Chinulu on him and that three will not count I dont believe a foul away from the ball before the shot to take us to our first time out of the game About 5 minutes in Jay and tied up at six Well Cameron Boozer you play off him play the music drive he can pull up and knock down that three against Chinulu and inside Thats where the strength of Florida is Thats where the Gators are going We took early in the season are good for us because its allowed our team to actually sigh and take a breath And if youre going to have issues that youve got to work through Jay I guess the earlier you find out about them the better No question Great screen by Malik Brown along the baseline cheering And by the way the three before the timeout did count The ruling was the shot was let go before the foul was committed So the Caleb Foster three is good Duke leads 9 to6 Nearly a turnover there by Condan And that Micah Handlockton is checked in in the middle for Chinulu And Urban Clavar number seven for Florida whos had a couple of great games recently Hes become instant offense off the bench for Todd Golden Black Jar has played great especially over his last four games Hes averaging 15 points a game over that stretch 19 points a game over his last two and shooting close to 50 from three He Hes the best shooter on this Florida roster Remember last year as you mentioned they were the the back court was sensational for them beginning with the Walter Clayton Jr The most outstanding player for the final four Elijah Martin Will Richard Denzel Aberdine as well So Clashars opportunities were few and far between getting more run this year This is him He splits the double lobs it up and Condan finishes Boy what a great split of that double team Just pushed the ball ahead with his left hand And when you help up theyre just going to throw it right to the rim to their big finishers How about this Jay The Blue Devils has have attempted seven shots All of them have been threes Heres Boozer going inside He lost it but its off of hand locked in although he doesnt think so Florida trying to make a decision right now whether they should challenge but Cameron Boozer just helped up a bit And that just opens up that lob to Alex Cond Just great basketball And a fantastic split of that double team by Irvine Clavar And the Gator have decided to use their challenge very early in this game So obviously theyve got to be pretty confident that that ball went out of bounds off Heres out of bounds Call is being challenged by Florida Lead official Roger Ayes with the information of Brian Okonnell and Tony Chiaza the other officials Again you get one challenge If youre right and they overturn it you get a second one And that handlock never touched it This one should go the Gators way He touched his arm but he never touched the ball Yeah thats about as obvious as it gets So this should be overturned shirt last year but they had some injuries in the front court in the middle of conference play and he gave up his red shirt Came back really with less than half a season remaining knowing that they might need him to get where they wanted to get and of course they got where they wanted to get Really good job by Florida to break that pressure and then a great seal of the help on that drive Panlock had just sealed all the help so nobody can get there to try to block it A steal by Glenn Numbers and he will miss the layup in transition and its Duke basketball Oh they had threeon one maybe four on one as now a block is called on Clavio John Sh have left the game retired over the last several years But when you see coaches like great inbound play and somebody miscommunicated on the Florida side An easy slam for Malik Brown Yeah just miscommunicated on a switch and left Malik Brown the screener on that play wide open But so many were talking about the coaches that have left the game but when you see coaches like Todd Golden and John Sh so young yet so accomplished the games in pretty darn good hands Golden is 40 Sh is 38 No way is Todd Golden 40 He get he still gets carded Long three wont go for Clashar Out saves it but into the hands of Brown Cam Boozer fouled on his way to the rim and heading to the line Boy when youre big guys can bring the ball up like that that just makes Cam Boozer that much more dangerous He can be a rip and run player in transition And when a guy of that size gets going downhill hes awfully difficult to stop Hes going to score get fouled or both And he can score in so many different ways Hes a good free throw shooter as well 76 so far on the season And because of how physical and skilled he is he gets to the line a lot Really one of the only things you can insist on is just try try desperately to get him away from his left shoulder going to that right hand try to make him finish with his left He can finish right or left but hes more proficient with his right Chinloo rips down the rebound and he has been a monster on the glass for the Gator this year in his last five games averaging better than 13 boards per contest Again the big front court with Hal playing at the three Clavar catch and release and the Gator have the lead Well coming off those screens especially screens set as big as Chinulu Handlock Locked in and Hal He gets his feet set He drills it You got to make him shoot it off the dribble which he can do Boozer to Boozer Now Cameron trying to break in Shinlu and he will Boy and youre strong when you can move a guy like Shinlu to that extent His strength and his footwork is so good He pivots so well Hand locked in couldnt hang on to the pass and here come the Blue Devils and Jmena by the way back in the game We should have mentioned that earlier after rolling that right ankle That is a very good sign for Duke that it wasnt as serious as it looked as his pass sails out of bounds and takes us to the under 12 media timeout We got a good one going and Cam Boozer is off to a good start for Duke Well Cameron Boozer is just a a difficult matchup because he can do so many music things and then you bring a double to him hes an excellent passer but with his footwork his strength and his skill he is a terms of efficiency productivity whatever word you want to use He is playing as well if not better than anybody else in the country so far Theres that zoom action out of the horn set Youll see a lot of that from Florida in this game Lee crafty there drawing the foul Hes got some craftiness to his game some shiftiness to his game The issue is stepping up from the Ivy League into the SEC How will his game translate I think it translates well You know from an analytic standpoint when you looked at what Xavon Lee did at Princeton in the Ivy League in Princetons games against top level competition his numbers got better rather than falling off So its been an adjustment Hes just not shot the ball well yet and hes had some turnover issues but the entire Florida team has You dont replace four guards like Florida had last year and everything remains the same That that guard core last year you know Walter Clayton Jr and Elijah Martin and Will Richard and Denzel Aberdine they dont make them like that very often It was an extraordinary back there Three of them drafted two in the NBA Chris and Lee having a good game in this last game against Providence He said I felt like that game was coming for a long time He was in a dark place just trying to figure it out He said Honestly I just had to get back to stop being so goal oriented and enjoy and take and appreciate the joy of the game So thats what led to me having a great game last time out And we were at shoot around today and he and his teammates certainly appear to be having a very fun experience at practice I think they know theyre really good Jay but I think they know theyre still trying to fit all mesh all of these pieces together still kind of figuring out who they are at this point Well I think its true for both Duke and and Florida but maybe a little bit more so for Florida I mean theyre set up front This is one of the best if not the best front court in the country Uh as their guards get more comfortable and get comfortable with what they want to do with those big guys because theyre playing three bigs in the lineup Last year was three guards Cam Boozer has checked back in Speaking of three bigs Boozer Malik Brown and Patrick Gunga in the lineup at the same time and John Sher kind of upsizing to deal with the size of Florida Meanwhile Floridas gone with three guards A lineup that was really good against Providence Foster shut off on the baseline and a foul committed by Boogie Plan And that will be his second Alex Condan did not play He got hit in the face against TCU He did not play in the game against Providence and that might have necessitated having Fland Lee and Clavar play together so much in the Providence game but it was a really effective lineup and I think youll see more of it tonight irrespective of Flands foul trouble he just got in So he sits down Hal returns Both teams playing very big lineups right now This like old school basketball Evans quiet so far Boozer for three his second of the game John Shy made an adjustment about 10 days ago or so and you saw it a lot against Arkansas Hes using Camboozer more in the middle of the floor in that middle third More difficult to help on him Condan kicks it out to Lee and a foul is called on Brown Cam Boozer when he catches the ball after that screening action Chinulu is not out on him because he doesnt want to get blown by on a drive and thats twice now that Boozer has risen up to shoot and that was after a dribble so he he was stationary So Chinulu once he picks that dribble up has to put more pressure on him Jay that foul on Malik Brown his second and now Florida turns it over One of the most important things for Todd Golden is cutting down on the turnovers They did that the last 36 minutes of the game against Providence That is five in 10 and a half minutes so far here tonight And that is too many for Todd Goldens liking Well this is the best rebounding team in the SEC but theyre last in the SEC in turnover margin And once you turn it over you cant get a shot You dont get a chance to rebound Boy thats a tough one And as Evans was kind of drifting towards the baseline in transition here come the Gator Tal left alone hits the three How good of a player is he So versatile Hes moved more from the four position to the three but he plays hard and hes so effective at both ends of the floor Excellent defender Hes got nine for the Gator Boozers got nine for the Blue Devils Evans with the layin to put Duke back on top And thats the counter he needs when hes being guarded that closely to take away his threes He needs to cut and drive And hes been a much more effective driver list this year as opposed to last year Hal again Not this time Long rebound bounces to Claire tough to run on Florida because you have to go away All five guys in black in this game have to rebound and its tough to get run outs after a defensive rebound cuz everybodys in So Floridas able to really do a good job in limiting transition because of their offensive rebounding strength And the whistle blew because the shot clock reset and it should not have So they have put it back to 11 and it is Florida balls Lee with a three and the rebound down to Foster Some of these misses are pretty wild A block by Hal Boozer comes up with it and a foul is called Handlocked and thought it should have be been a held ball but Carlos Boozer applauding as his son is fouled again Clavar on that initial action did a good job not fouling just to allow Hal to come from a weak side and knock that ball away The foul actually on Condan his first Not a shooting foul Night one of the ACC SEC challenge which was dominated by the SEC a season ago They won 14 of the 16 after it was a 77 tie two years ago in the inaugural challenge Young with Lee on open in the corner Foster rebound Cond The ball movement was great and Caleb Foster coming off perhaps his best game WHOA THOMAS H A little shot fake drive and a slam Evans in transition and Harris just rips it away from Handlockton Foster to the left hand and heading to the line Caught him with the body How about Thomas out He is already into Its hard to keep you away from that right hand He can go left but hes way better right He is averaging about 18 points eight rebounds and three assists per game Down to Chris inside that Florida huddle Todd Golden telling his team Dont panic if they start to press Well get back to the tempo that we want to play with I like the physicality Be careful on the boards When you grab the ball come down with it Dont be throwing your elbows We dont need added whistles Chris thank you Florida especially the the front court guys the big guys they all seem to like a very physical brand of basketball Well rightfully so because they are physically stronger than most front lines theyre going to play against One certainly one through four But to Chris Buddtons point you know when you bring a rebound down you want to chin it You know Micah Handlock who brought it down to his waist got it taken away So you certainly have to be strong with it when you bring it down But theyre going to get a lot of rebounds in this game Cloud Jar almost had it knocked away from behind by Foster Now Lee seven to shoot gets a screen Drive scoops it up too strong Condan down with a rebound but the layup never hit the rim So thats another turnover I think Lee thought he got hit going up but when Conan grabbed that offensive rebound just didnt have the awareness of where the clock was because of the crowd that he was in Onepoint lead for the Blue Devils as Foster walks it into the front court Duke undefeated at 80 Florida 5 and2 lost their opener on a neutral court to Arizona as Gunbug gets a very friendly bounce for his second three of the game The other loss for the Gator came a few days ago to TCU And then the next night they followed that up with a much better effort against Providence Duke has had a lot of onesided wins Their closest game their last one a ninepoint win over Arkansas in Chicago Duke doing a pretty good job of protecting the paint but Handogen in the post Thats a lot of bodies to be able to drive A lot of dribbling by Clownar Somehow he gets through traffic but he cannot finish it Once you get by your initial defender because that paint is crowded due to handlock and posting in there theres nowhere to go The cut by Gunga and it goes Not just Boozer right now Patrick Gungas having a big night Hes got eight Wide open Misses the three So when Alex Condan helps off Patrick Dumba cheering hes been open for a three and then a cut to the basket Hes been very alert when his man helps Duke deliberate in this possession Foster swings it back Cam Boozer misses the three Lee the rebound Steps back now drives and has it blocked out of bounds But because that low post is occupied that left Camboozer right in the middle of the lane and rather than get all the way to the rim Zavian Lee is going to have to stop and put up a little floater And Lee has gone to the bench Boogie Fland has returned with a couple of fouls And you lose a timeout as well Youve got to use a timeout initiate a timeout to call a challenge If youre correct you get the timeout back But so the Blue Devils lose the timeout and the challenge Condan looking inside for Chinulu Planned back into the game with two and a hold underneath on Foster Foster and Boozer had to switch and that put Caleb Foster down low in the post trying to guard Condan And when you get that switch you got to go right to Cond is aggressive Sets up Clar for a wide open look but he cant knock it down Duke a little fortunate there You cant overhelp on that drive Thats going to be a contested two if he puts the shot up But if you get caught in no mans land you give up an open three to Clash Foster and Kayen Boozer in the back court together Can Boozer gets back to his right hand lays it in and is fouled 80 run now for the Blue Devils First Chinulu has to take that shot in the chest off this little pocket pass knocked back and then the pivoting to get back to that right hand Just really impressive footwork by Cameron Boozer is keeping the defender off balance and its so difficult Its easy to say Hey keep your hands up stay in front But when youre trying to guard a guy that can pivot that well and a lane violation on the Gator so Boozer will get another free throw Condan stepped in early and itll cost him a point Its now a ninepoint lead for Duke cheering Sar a very good defender Length ranging quickness He is on plan right now Again how splits the defense lays it in Boy is he working hard Everything theyre running is to get him to his right hand and Duke putting good pressure on the ball So Fland and Lee have not been able to get much Hes got 13 of their 21 as Kaden Boozer answers at the other end Kayen Boozer has done a good job of taking care of the ball when hes been in the game Hes got one of the best assist turnover ratios in the league Shinyoos pass A foul underneath Sar called for the foul trying to deny the entry pass When you get caught in the post and youre undersized you really want to sit get in front and sit on his legs And thats exactly what Sar did But he just grabbed his jersey And thats what led to that foul call Without the jersey grab I think it would have been perhaps the same outcome Just the 15 foul on the Blue Devils Condan wants it again Hes got Foster on him now Foster fronting him Shinula Little push shot from 10 wont go and its into the hands of Gunga If you dont have a shooting threat up top you can just play off and clog that lane Thats exactly what Duke did Boozer to Boozer and another bucket for Cam Boozer Hes got 14 Well he doesnt surrender to the initial defensive action cheering Just that extra pivot to get underneath was spectacular Biggest lead of the night for the Blue Devils Flot cheering from three right now Theyre two for 12 cheering and have not been a good threepoint shooting team this season Clav Jar miss and a Florida foul ACC Yeah I mean the the the 142 wasnt just that In the 14 wins the SEC had they won by an average of 16 points cheering In the two ACC wins they won by an average of I think three Yeah And Clemson beat Kentucky Duke beat Auburn here in Cameron Indoor Stadium but there was no question the better league The SEC last year was in my view the best league theres ever been top to bottom Land flying in misses the layup out of bounds to Duke And Florida is shooting just 30 from the field and just 2 for13 from three They just cannot buy a bucket right now Everything has been contested and Duke has really put very good pressure on the ball and theyve walled up inside and really protected the paint well So Floridas got a number they might have what nine offensive rebounds but they havent been able to capitalize on those offensive rebounds and turn them into points Yeah nine offensive rebounds for two second chance points is almost unheard of as Gumba traveled cheering Big 238 here for the Gator to stay within range or maybe try to cut into this deficit a little bit Hal has been their goto guy Look at the spin and a goending call Or was it There was not and Tom Golden is hopping mad That hit the back Yeah But if its not called wide it cannot be looked at A bucket for Foster at the other end And it sure looked like that should have been a basket for Florida Shinlu oneonone with Gungbo And it is going against the Gator Lets get another look at that nongoalending call Oh yeah that wasnt even close N is a miss and a couple of points that should have been counted for the Gator But again if its not called live it cannot be reviewed If it is called live then you can uh they can have a look at it you can challenge it that sort of thing But if its not called its play on I think last year the truth is that would have been an automatic call because they could review every full call Boozer banging into the chest of Handlock down for the rebound and Boozer found him What a great job by hand The vertical contest just went straight up to make Boozer finish it over him And that is a mountain of a man right there Micah Handlocker having to go oneonone right in the middle of the floor where Camboozer is operating so effectively over the last several games Middle of the floor tends to eliminate help inside Handogen kicks it out to Lee Weak side rebound Condan Han Logan up no good Down to Boozer again The K Gator cannot buy one They are now one for their last 13 Those are contested but Floridas got to go off of those right away Taking time to gather and shot getting it work again Boozer and Hanlock Left hand this time And its a 15point lead He is just shredding oneonone cover And the crazies getting even crazier right now Loving cheering this last stretch by Duke to pull out to a 15point lead in the final minute of the half Getting down to a short clock here Long run for plan It will go Of all the shots to go in that one drops for Boogie freshman in a season full of impressive freshman And that last time out by the way was called by Todd Golden not John Sh My mistake Its Duke with about a 3second difference between the game clock and the shot clock Seven to shoot Gumba Evans gets it off Air ball Theyve got some time Hal ahead to Condan and he threw it out of bounds off of Gumba with a little bit of time left on the clock That was really the only play he could make Enough time for a catch and shoot or a controlled tip at the bucket But Thomas Hal because the clock was getting shorter decided to take the risk of throwing it to Condan long But at that angle difficult to corral and get a bucket cheering plan to inbound Condoo like it would have counted but he missed it And the lowest scoring first half of the year for the Gator Duke holds them to 24 points here They emphasize things like dont turn it over defend without fouling and force Boozer to his left hand And they had struggles Jay in all three of those areas in the first half Well its awfully difficult to force a great player in oneonone coverage to one side and you certainly want to do that but it was just one oneonone Boozer is a load to deal with In the NBA they used to say Dont let go to his left He got there anyway How about the pass from Gunga to Evans Patrick Gunga has at least two assists in every single game in which Duke has played this year When a cutter curls him he can just throw over the top That was a bounce pass but you have to put great pressure on him as a passer Turn him into a driver Florida comes into the game shooting just 44 from the field 28 from three as Evans gets inside again and itll be Florida ball tonight At the moment the Gator are shooting 28 and three of 17 from threepoint range Just a terrific pass but just not enough pressure to take away his vision so he could to deliver that If you pressure him he turns his back He cant make that pass Duke lost all five starters from its final four teams a year ago All of them were drafted They bring back five returning players most of whom have gone from bench players to starters And then they brought in four freshman as well One of the top classes in the nation highlighted of course by Cameron Boozer Its an embarrassment of riches to have Cooper flag one year and then Cam Boozer the next Boozer not this time How the onehanded rebound Florida needs Lee Fland and Clownar to start making shots And there is Lee knocking down a three Just a little brush strain in transition You go underneath and Lee had plenty of time He needs to get going Hes a good player Really good with that step back but hes had a ton of pressure on him for most of this game Boozer the kick Jamemena cant get by help Boozer initiating the contact with Chimulu Forced it up and Shinu wins this battle Cond needs some help and finds plan Now Hal tipped away by Jimemena but its a reachin foul Hal is desperately trying to get to that right hand Hes such an excellent righthand driver and that handoff action can be difficult to guard That little screen that Isaiah Evans tried to go under but kind of just rolled down into him and that gave Lee the space that he needed Lee and Fland shot 37 and 34 respectively from three last year Theyre both down in the mid20s this year So Todd Golden hoping obviously thats going to improve over the course of the season Now Fland will drive and score and some offensive life from the Florida back court And those were plays that Florida was not completing in that first half They did get some drives but that slot area gives you a little bit more space And its down to single digits early in the second Another miss from three by Boozer Condom oneonone with Booger into the paint back to the right up and in An excellent pivot back to his right hand and using the glass Florida starting to show a little bit of life 70 run Gator Little push off by Foster but it rattles out Cond in oneonone with Gumbbo to the left this time Boy how about that footwork Just a crab dribble inside and then I would think hes saying that their offense has not helped their defense But Florida I thought they ran by some opportunities in the first half A welldesigned play of the timeout Jamemena finds Brown for the slam Really have to communicate on those back screens and put pressure on the ball Condan is fouled on his way to the bucket And were going right back to the first media timeout here in the second half at at Madison Square Garden in New York City The first game Clemson and BYU In the second game Yukon against the East Florida Gator Cannot wait for that double header Uh great basketball and a chance to raise money for the V Foundation This is a week when we highlight the urgent need for cancer research and thanks to Principal Foundations generosity you can double your impact They are matching up to 1 million in donations during BWE If you are able please consider visiting borgdonate As you know Jay 100 of every donation goes directly to cancer research Florida one two two three quarter court press Takes a little bit of time off the clock now back in the two3 zone Just give a different look Disrupt the rhythm of the game Pretty big along that back line Foster Jimena and off the hand then foot of Evans out of bounds The Gator have held Isaiah Evans in check He is two for seven four points 0 for four from three Smart to put Chinulu out top where he can screen and then roll down into the low post cheering Lee got his man in the air Plenty of time to line up a three but he cant hit it Rebound Shinulu up and in But Condan takes up so much space Its hard to block out both he and Chinulu This is just a fabulous offensive rebounding team And as long as its not a long rebound its advantage Florida to get that board Lee hit the deck Evans is three but misses the three Malik Brown the offensive rebound Now wide open Shinyu races down to grab this one Everything he grabs is with two hands Hal musling his way into the paint and draws another foul But give Condan credit there for screening out the help so Hop could get all the way to the basket Florida does that as well as any team in the country Watch how he screens off two guys and opens up that lane And then Caleb Foster having to foul Thomas H cuz as he gets to the rim Third foul on Foster with multiple substitutions coming here for both teams The third annual ACC SEC mens college basketball challenge will finish up tomorrow night And here is a look at our ESPN double header A couple of great games sixth ranked Louisville How fun have the Cardinals been so far this year They will take on Arkansas and then itll be number 20 Auburn hosting NC State Well Pat Kelseys done an amazing job of resurrecting that Louisville program We saw them earlier this year against Kentucky and their guards are legit Ryan Conwell Michael Brown Jr Its ridiculous how good those guys are Brown is as good a freshman as there is in the country Very interesting game here Florida back within two after trailing by as many as 14 Over on ESPN 2 Tennessee and Syracuse in the battle in the ACC SEC challenge with the balls leading by one with four minutes to go as the Evans layin gives Duke a fourpoint lead Good curl off that screen Cloud Jar was locking and trailing At least he took the threepoint line away from Isaiah Evans Cond with Kayen Boozer on him got the pass then attracted a lot of Duke defenders and its knocked out of bounds Duke just converged on the ball Florida had the advantage and when Condan went up there were four black shirts around him cheering Left it short boy did everything right but didnt finish the layup and Condan screened off the help yet again but Hop just couldnt finish the play Hes been so good in this game but another opportunity near the rim where Florida just could not finish it Its almost like he lost the ball on the way up but did such a great job of screening off the weak side help Gumba hes hit a couple of threes tonight Now driving on Hanlocks the inside He has taken a big step forward from a season ago with the beautiful cut by Malik Brown But what a pass Gumbbos got three assists on the night Fland No Condan the rebound and fouled by Brown Boy thats a mans rebound by Alex Condan Boy the fight doesnt begin until a shot goes up in this game But just a beautiful cut right past Condan and then that pass was gorgeous cheering The foul on Brown his third So hes got three Caleb Foster also has three Fosters on the bench right now I think Floridas deciding whether or not they want to challenge that out of bounds call and theyre going to So they had a successful challenge earlier in the game in the first half which means you retain it and can use one more challenge And they want to use it right here Roger Ayes The previous play is under review for a hostile act Oh hostile act Not an out of bounds play Its whether a common foul should be upgraded to a flagrant one Man if we could challenge hostile acts Id be challenging you all the time up here in the booth Well that was a little hostile What did they see The right forearm I guess into the side of the of the face or the jaw Big play if Floridas able to convert cheering to give them some momentum in this second half two for Condan So its a fivepoint game and its still Florida ball One more look at what is now a flagrant one with that forearm going up It seems like that made the difference Brown stays in the game with three fouls The big lineup again for Florida Look inside Han didnt know Hul has it and lays it in Boy Sar was down on the court and didnt know or couldnt find the basketball right behind him and very opportunistically How picked it up Now Bland with a steal cheering The follow up and in And all of a sudden its a onepoint game by Thomas How quick to the ball and Boogie Fland with the steal He leads this team in steals A solid defender inside and run one assists in this game Hes the highest assist man for either team and again averaging better than two a game on the season He is showing a lot more game than he showed at times last year as a freshman He has become a big big part of this team Highload passer two ticked away by S And back come the Blue Devils returns the F again Great ball moving by the Gators and again it is Hal in the right place at the right time Thomas Hal is just everywhere in this to get a trip to the ACC championship That one two 34 court pressure and last time and this time they drop back to a two3 zone Florida outscoring Duke 212 in the second half Cameron Boozer has not scored yet in the second Good move Got it back draws a foul going to the line Todd Golden asking for a held ball on that play with Boozer and Handlockton Just pivots right around the defense Actually it was Condan in for that ball But Han Logan didnt do a bad job defensively Its just Boozers footwork is so good You initially stop him and hes able to pivot to get an angle and still get up a good shot Second on Condan and Boozer now three for four on the line on the night First point of the second half Thomas Hal the high score in the game Hes got 19 for the Gator H has been outstanding in this game He is all over the place And its interesting even though hes playing a lot more free hes still getting to the line Hes still getting offensive rebounds Hes still doing all of the things he did last year and even doing them better here this year Step back by Flam Just not a good shot Ran that leave and then settled for that step back three Florida had it down to one Duch got it back up to five with the ball Evans stolen away by plan He got tricked and its too far Evans try the tip Fosterss got it for the Blue Devils And an over and back the call Wild sequence How about the week that both of these teams both of these coaches have coming up We mentioned Floridas next game a week from tonight in New York against Yukon Dukes ne next game Saturday and theyre going to the end zone to take on Michigan State The Spartans are off to a great start this year Didnt shoot the ball well early but boy did they shoot the ball well in the Champions Classic and since then And Jeremy Fears Jr is playing as well as any point guard in the country Hes seeing a lot of physicality in this one and well see a lot of physicality in that one How change it gets beat has blocked has just been a wall inside Another feed but this one too tall for Sarah in transition Oh they could use a Clashar bucket and a switch Lee with a boozer on him and Hanlock sails one over the head of Clashar into the crazies Boy thats an unforced error and Hanlock had Chinulu where he could have thrown over the top He had a guard on him after that switch The 10th turnover committed by the Gator in this game And with the way they offensive rebound you know that was an unforced error It was just a reversal pass And thats what drives Todd Golden You turn the ball over like that you dont get a shot You dont get a chance for an offensive board Theyve got 16 offensive rebounds in this game And now Chandler is called for the foul That will be his third Duke is really isolating Cam Boozer right in the middle of the floor more of an elbow isolation where he can go oneonone on Ruben Chinulu Todd Golden did not like that foul call at all and he is giving a piece of his mind to Roger Ayes Golden told us earlier today two of his uncles went to Duke and as a kid he used to love watching some of those great Duke Blue Devil teams He had never been in this building before they walked in here to practice last night Coming up next more ACC SEC mens challenge college basketball And again it should be a great one Number 16 Carolina number 18 Kentucky Dave OBrien Dick Vital and Jay Williams on the call And thats going to be an up and down game The lead back to seven after the Gator headed down to one And now another steel Boozer Yes its all Cameron Boozer right now Just so smart to break contact and get around to knock that away with the right hand Bonjour cant get where he wanted to go Gave it cheering up Cow for three and his monster night continues So few of Floridas buckets have come off assists Theyve had to make so many individual plays in this game 19 made field goals only three assists Pal now has 22 Same as Boozer Open side pick and roll Foster shooting it very well this year but misses that three Lee looking to push Clashar on the wing screaming Oh got it And its a threepoint game Clavar is such a great shooter When he gets his feet set you really have to make him bounce it The junior from Slovenia a double figure score off the bench for the Gator this year Jamena into the paint Boozer for three Offensive rebound Darren Harris Brown wants to hand it off to Foster Good ball pressure though or off the ball pressure there by Lee to prevent it Harris lost it and commits a foul That foul probably saved the bucket Xavian Lee was going the other way 60 run The shots have been falling more Theyve been converting the second chance opportunities more And until about the last two minutes they did a good job putting the clamps on Cameron Boozer But that is J What a block by Isaiah Evans They were in a horn set Got a little fade screen up top and a great recovery by Evans That needed to be a shot fake by Clar Jay Thats nine blocks for Duke Patrick Gumbos got five of them Hes been a wall near the bucket Boozer The drive backing down Chinulu got it back and puts it in He is relentless So difficult to contain even on that lefthanded drive able to get back to that right hand I mean they dont come much stronger than Ruben Shinu and Boozers able to back him down Just goes right into his chest Got a switch So when Shinlu catches it up top theyre not guarding it Four to shoot Lee will have to create Lofts it up off the rim Shinu the rebound Good pass Lee wide open And underneath I think Well its definitely Duke Well see who Brian Okonnell is calling it on It is Gunga called for the foul That last possession is an example why Todd Golden wants a shot up without a turnover because theyre such a great offensive rebounding team They kick it out get an open three They missed it But so far Floridas best offense has been a missed shot in this game especially in the second half And they have been one of the best offensive rebounding teams in the nation this season Tonight theyve got 18 to 21 defensive rebounds for Duke So the Gator are getting almost 50 of their misses Boy that last play with Malik Brown knocking it away If you show him the ball his hands are so good Get so many deflections in front of BL now the switch back to house picked up his dribble finds BL deep one with the shot clock running down another offensive rebound hand locked in that time and theyve got a fresh 20 to work with here and Isaiah Evans did a good job of fighting him on that switch out tried for the up and under is fouled by Gumba who appears to be shaken up as well Well Gunga got hit by that off arm from Hal on that drive shooter on this instead of it being the offended player So Isaiah Evans is at the line and both sides make both So its a fivepoint game still Hul picks up his third foul There are two players on each team with three Nobody has yet picked up his four See if Florida after this 1 22 34 pressure drops back in that 23 zone again And they do Theres a lot of room in that middle Evans the drive the kick Boozer back to Evans Got to get a shot up soon He will and he wont go Offensive rebound Gumba Evans Gumba again And foul And what a great sequence from Patrick Gumba Patrick Guna has done a great job on both ends of the floor The initial rebound and then kicking it out for a wide open three Those can be daggers but then doesnt stop Gets another offensive rebound and gets fouled and goes to the foul line His defense his shot blocking his rim protection on one end has been outstanding And then his passing and his effort on the offensive end have been equally outstanding 10 points five rebounds five blocks and four assists tonight for Patrick Gang One of two Florida though still within range and better than five minutes to go Everything out on the perimeter and the shot clock now inside 10 trying to drive is locked away The 10th block of the night for the Blue Devils and Gungva there again as a help defender So youre driving right in basically to his chest He just discards Chinulu and able to get into the way of the driver and block that shot Thats just big time defense by Patrick Gumbbo 447 to go A timeout on the floor We are back in here on ESPN Not only five blocks for Gunga we mentioned Duke has 10 Jay Isaiah Evans has the other five Hes got five blocks tonight Only five on the shot clock Pman slips past Brown and slams it Well youre so worried about Boogie Flan coming off that handoff but hes not shot the ball well And a great read of the defense by Alex Condan on that keeper Florida has led for almost a minute and a half in this game Their last lead was 13 12 but again they are within range Boozer driving on Shiner Good defense Boozer left it short Flatable A really good defense by Ruben Chinulu on that drive to stop it with his chest The tough one shot that goes to make it a twopoint game Boogie Fland has stepped up offensively here in the second half Irvine Clar on Isaiah Evans Hes not going to leave him again Boozer oneonone with Chinulu Chinulu knocks it away Boozer finds Foster They still have time now Five on the shot clock Boozer misses the three Knocked out of bounds by Malik Brown But it will be Florida with 329 to go in what is now a twopoint game Jay the Gator have been a different group here in the second half much stronger going to the basket and making plays Florida has music fought back to make this a onepossession game Worried about Fland the keeper by Condan and Boogie oneonone with the fall away The second was much more of a complimentary player averaging around 11 minutes per game He is a starter this year Hes in double figures for the eighth time in nine games And scoring is only the beginning Jay of what hes done tonight Yeah Now hes taking compliments rather than being complimentary In his last five games coming into this one Patrick Dun was 23 of 30 from the field But hes done everything in this game His passing his defense blocking five shots but thats just part of the value hes shown on the defensive end And then 11 rebounds excuse me 11 points and five rebounds and hes had to battle against an outstanding front line cheering Rebounding is going to be a big factor this last 325 of regulation Chris Button has more As animated of a Florida huddle as theres been all game Don Golden came in there and said We just got to do the basics Rebound take care of the basketball get our shots up WE HAVE THEM PLAYING ON OUR FIELDS We got this An incredible block and save by Malik Brown Duke ball up two with three minutes to go So many baskets saving plays at the rim for Duke in this game And now Clavar pokes it away Last tied at 19 Floridas last lead 132 They could tie or take the lead on this trip Lamb takes a bump and hits Boy another crafty play by Boogie Bland and its all tied up Boy really smart not to blast off that ball screen Just get the defender on your hip lock him down and knock in the midrange Great play by Boogie Fl A 60 run for the Gator to tie it 10 to shoot Young met a Boozer Boozer 43 and Duke is back on top and John Sh will take a timeout An incredible offensive rebounding team Theyve had some good actions with Condan where he can really get in the way of the help defenders Two screens for plan whos had the hot hand recently here in the second half Hell try it again and score it again Boy its amazing how Chinulu and and Condan are able to just screen their defenders so they cant get there to put pressure on that shot Boy and Todd Golden is fiery right now on the Florida sideline trying to motivate his players on defense A minute and a half to go Boozer will drive it this time and score Boy he uses that off arm that off shoulder to create some space and drive the defender backwards and now is called for the foul So itll be one and one coming for Condan But he got that steal a little bit earlier in this second half but that time he had to try to go over the back of Condan But oneonone in the middle of the floor Condan decides not to come over because hes worried about a drop off to Gumba and finishing with that left hand cheering on the season 70 Condan has played in so many big games Had 19 points 10 rebounds against Miami a little bit earlier this season cheering from Perth Australia Australian rules football player water polo player as well growing up but looks like he made a good choice focusing on basketball and hes brought him back within one Back to the one two two pressure Little trap Foster gets it over With now one minute remaining in regulation theyre going back to this zone Chinyu in the middle Laying off of Gunga Hell step back Hell take it floor the ball with a chance to take the lead Glam got IT AND THE GATOR LEAD BY TWO Timeout Duke with 309 to go Boogie Fland with 309 seconds remaining Down by two Often times when Cameron Boozer takes the ball out on the side hell get a little slice cut Here it is The back Theyre not going to go for it Foster gets it back to him again Its Chinulu defending Help from Cla Evans for three They left Evans and he made him pay Shot clock turned off Florida with the ball down by one Pond flange Hes been the goto guy And with 2 and 12 seconds to go its Duke Bell Duke went to a twoman game late with Boozer and Evans And Evans after setting that screen just popped to the threepoint line Two on the ball Clapar could not get back in time And two on the ball here And Boogie Flan just loses control of the ball And with that one foul to give now Duke can inbound it and end it with for Isaiah Evans his first made three in eight attempts tonight and it could not have been more timely Malik Brown checks in for the Blue Devils As Jay said still no bonus Thats the six foul Duke will inbound And really what Florida needs here is a 5second call more than anything Duke is out of timeouts into Foster and an immediate foul by Plan Boy that went from two and a half down to one on that play I wonder if theyre going to have a look at it and maybe put some time back on Missed it Chinulu will call a timeout and its going to be Florida Bull down by one with 15 to go Thomas inbounding and itll be Malik Brown on the ball Both Chinulu and Condan are back guarded by Gumba and Camboozer And now theyve set the clock back to 15 And now it appears were ready to go Out being told he cannot run the baseline Hes got to stay in place Here we go DEFLECTED BROWN deflected and Duke wins it Last play
