to Stony Brook Big gap for their exams Theyre back on the court today Short clock now for Columbia They got to make something happen Nolan a guy that can do that but hes stripped Dor takes it away applause And here is Pippen Yeah one area Cals improved Greg Its been on the defensive end this year Theyre really stepping up that pressure Bears coming off the big win over Morgan State 97 to 50 Firing now Camden picking up where he left off Okay no surprises Greg I told you this young guy can shoot it and hes not afraid of range The deeper the better Hes really got incredible range on the floor Theres a look at the Colombia starting five Sulus the transfer from Richmond has been a welcome addition cheering like Cals defense early a lot of active hands You got a really good but John Camden I mean if you go underneath the screen like they just did thats just thats too late Youre not going to be able to recover Hell hell bury you 23 in the win over Morgan State Friday Shot clock to 10 for the Lions The dump to Ritter going TO THE BASKET HAMMERS IT Great play by Columbia Coverage a little late for Cal trying to rotate on the backside but nice job of rolling and finishing Kevin Hudby raving about Ritter says he never takes a play off and finishing there at the rim for the first Columbia bucket Carr the handles step through and blocked from behind Last touch Cal Yeah pretty good defense by Colombia But how about this move You talk about the roll the slide to the basket He got there early to help too late but I mean then heres a block on the other end Its two plays in a row Columbia on top of it Aims denied there Nolan powering down low Tough angle Dort there to help and comes up with it Ames caught Dort off guard Now Camden Ames spinning and draws a foul Hes so tough to guard in an open floor You put the ball in Day As hands in the middle of the floor no helpside defense youre really hardressed to contain him Mark Madson year three That excellent start at 11 and one They were 16th in the ACC preseason poll for whatever that is worth I laughter can tell you as a coach Ill tell you its worth nothing Absolutely nothing Yeah dont worry about preseason polls Uh how is your team playing now What have you done for me lately 11 and one Weve talked about it Best start in 65 years for the Bears And how about the way hes had to rebuild again create a new chemistry with this roster as Ames hits the second Well welcome to college basketball Seems like thats whats going around But you know why is Cal so good this year They got balance scoring Theyre extending the floor Theyre pressuring Theyre really stepping up their defense but theyre an unselfish team but theyre getting their hands on almost the ball on almost every possession Matson raves about the way they pass against the ball as well And on Q Pippen good fight Some talk of review here Now they could have reviewed it didnt get it done quick enough They might want to save that Nolan facing a double Works to Franklin up and under The follow not there for Ritter Yeah had to go to the backside They couldnt score it on the front side Not enough room Heres Bell whos also had the hot hand Timer to 15 Pippen up Fake cant get the friendly roll Zulus got inside position Cant finish in close He wanted a foul Bell probing Its Camden Rims out Nolan theyre pressuring the top gun of this Columbia team Kell does a good job on ball screens They pressure out make it tough for you Too much on that pass from Ritter out of play Well they they really did decrease the the court size and shrinks it a little bit And what do I mean by that Greg They they they trap you and they get they take away the next pass They leave the furthest guy alone but you dont often see him by the time it gets there Theres a shorter clock Theyre really improved their defensive schemes this year Conor Igo comes on now for Colombia a freshman from Brooklyn Pippen in the paint battling Not there cheering Yeah its just from not playing I mean he did everything but finish And sometimes when youre off rhythm you havent played in a couple games those shots you normally make are a little tougher Four minutes gone by first half Heres Nolan right down the lane Flips it up No good Dortons there Bears break out Aims in the corner Too strong Wanting to play fast Got to get it up the floor early Ritter goes to work Steps through Lefty hook is pure Yeah Lee Dor went for the steal there Gambled a little bit and then got burned Lee Dorts been a real mainstay defensively but he he just got a little bit too overaggressive on the gamble Mason Ritter all four points for Colombia He was 0 for five last time out against Stonybrook Kansas drops to Dor inside Hell draw the foul and we will take our first What theyre doing is they take the ball screen double it push you out switch back get back to their man Another ball screen takes place They push it send him back to the sideline they throw it now they leave the furthest guy alone Chris Bell covers out causes a turnover Theyre shrinking the size of the floor Mark Matson schemes this year really have been effective defensively But dont go to sleep As you said Craig on Columbia theyre holding Cal theyre holding Cal to 16 themselves A good defensive team Both both teams uh on the year holding their opponents to 40 And if you can hold teams of 40 or under you got a really good chance to win games Dort meanwhile no good on the first in at 72 from the year And that defense theyll need that late in the year right As exciting as the offensive numbers are And he goes 0 for two Does Jordan and theyre even playing good field goal free throw percentage laughter defense Kes 0 for three there or I think or one for four One for five now I dont know if you can call that defense Look at that Ardo Keith is coming has his pocket picked Its Daydays turn for two Yeah you see how aggressive Cal is Theyre theyre extending full court They want to extend the floor on Colombia make them handle the basketball try to keep them away from the basket because theyre so effective TT Carr in the game now Another pest defensively Watch his hands Hes had steals on the year Doubling the basketball I goes to work cheering Little scoop Rims out applause Heres Ames Step back the handle Devastating foul line pull up on that I love it Greg Mezll Devastating Thats a new one And I I think I agree with you That is a devastating move Just hard to guard the middle of the floor Not much you can do And Cal has the 84 edge now They are pestering Nolan Heavy Ritter a miscommunication They forced him into a couple of bad passes Well theres miscommunication caused by Cal But watch Cal and D Now you see it now you dont He just comes up with his slight hand hits his pocket and then you can see what does he do on the other end He gets you really on skates He just steps back pretty much you know knows what hes going to do and youre guarding him You you know you really have trouble because hes so good with the basketball Matson also raving about his leadership here coming over from UVA cheering Camden meanwhile off to the right Well fortunately for Colombia theyre playing pretty good defense Uh and Cal hasnt got off the board yet other than the turnovers and some shots but Colombia you know has had difficulty getting good looks They just theyve gotten near the basket but havent been able to finish against a bigger player in Lee Door to the rim Captain Sanders on now The NYU transfer I go battling on Camden Bullying ball all the way under the hoop and then stripped Well I I like this You know thats just mono on mono Thats John Camden with no help He stays vertical and then just goes up the last minute to get a hand on the ball and block it Heres Kellen Two3 defense Short clock 10 on the timer Ritter from three Back rim Good fight there from Franklin Able to save it And then Camden just couldnt slow his momentum Good hustle by Colombia And coach Huby really applauding his group He said theyre a scrappy group Theyll play together Theyll fight for possessions There was really nothing there Looked like it was going to be a turnover They dove and kept it alive Now they have a new possession So good hustle but Cal again playing just great defense Not giving the Columbia Lions a lot of easy looks Theyve had trouble getting clean looks to the rim Nolan Dorsy on now The Campbell transfer Well watch him defensively You think Cals defense has been good So far you got to watch this defense This is I mean Nolan Dorsey is their Cal Staff calls him their best defender TT car meanwhile dropping back in coverage looking for the INT instead Its a turnover Sam Hampton Sanders tries to spot Ritter down Well that was the right decision As I always say when you want to pass it to big guys try to give them something the chest level or higher Not not lower Big guy wasnt ready for the ball down low All day for Bell Good offensive fight there from Elich Shot clock to 13 Ames controlling Ames crossover Step back Three ball too strong OKeefe tried to drop it in the bucket there Nobody home Dorsy from three AND Nolan Dorsey has really stepped up his shooting Started the season very slowly Hes now hit three of his last four attempts I believe from three Largest lead for Cal at 114 OKeefe Elich all over it Ames now slows it down and puts it home Yeah good timeout by 80 points a game Good for third in the Ivy Yeah very efficient team Cal making them inefficient right now This is all about Cal Back door here to the basket Double clutch and hits Chris Bell Might have got fouled too Hes asking for the N one Didnt get it Good move by Chris Bell Now 11 straight from the Bears Sanders No one held in check thus far Good drive Cannot finish Miles Franklin Yeah you can see that Columbia is a little bit tight offensively Just not getting a lot of good looks Bell into the lane and looking again for a call Hell take the bucket Well Cal starting to pick things up offensively but they have not at all let down defensively Their pressure has been relentless Theres another one Another takeaway Its Bell cheering Columbia getting back and a steal of their own Franklin now comes up with it coast to coast for the jam That was a much needed basket by Columbia A little bit of defense of their own They stop that massive run Dorsy gets his own board Cant finish Rebound fought for by Richard Unweek And the Lions settle down here after that big surge from the Cow Bears Nolan controlling Cal everywhere defensively Greg Theyre just cheering pushing Columbia further and further out on the floor Sanders cheering now oneonone steps through with the left and theyve had a couple just dance off the rim Well hard to finish against Kale Theyre big inside Elish is a big guy Easily their biggest test of the season here for Columbia TT Carr swings to Ames Its best one Yeah I think when you can have guys that are used to to each other they just dont want to continue to have to come up with huge second half performances You start playing and getting into the ACC you bury yourself in the first half youre not going to come back So I I think the message has been sent and its been its been heard on both Some pressure here from Ames Good stuff from Franklin all the way through Yeah thats unusual that they got all the way there with no help but you know you may have to do that against this Cal team You may have to isolate and drive because theyre really good at playing helpside defense Lions have turned it over eight times so trying to find a different way through this Cal defense Bell threatening Take some contact He was looking for a whistle cheering to no avail Yeah I thought the defense did a good job standing straight up Nolan now no good Thats uncharacteristic of Nolan Hes usually putting that ball in the basket Just hurt himself What you do against good defense Nolan now 0 for three Ames blocked from behind Blair Thompson And that brings us to our next time out The memory of that game by the way Well get into that later Yeah we looked it up It did not No no dont dont dont put that on the air please and and Florida Back to live action here Yeah thanks a lot Greg for bringing that one back out of that one Little segue Oh that was at a That was a beatd down Firing here from three back rim on the Thompson try Yeah I just get the feeling if Columbia can just get one shot to go down maybe they can get go on a run but theyve struggled getting baskets Going back to Columbia those photos so cool before and after all those coaches working with Kyle Smith and then meet again with a variety of programs and and I mean you know and and yeah thats been something Kels done well theyve learned how to get to the line when theyre not shooting it well theyre even on rebounds 1313 thats Columbias calling card its other areas theyre struggling left alone and hes gone cold after that first make Dor meanwhile tries to battle that one back up and here come the Lions Columbia trying to weather this initial storm from Cal and see if they cant chip away A great comeback effort before falling to Stony Brook That went to overtime They were down 14 at one point Trouble here Shot clock to three and theres a whistle at the last second Yeah Mark Manson not happy about that Short of the Clark and gave up the foul They werent going to get a very good look there if they dont foul But now theyre going to call it a twoshot foul New rule by the way Greg youre getting in the after shooting or or even gathering to bring it up Uh players are learning how to use that NBA style to draw the foul and the free throws No good for Okeefee on the first A lot more liberal on the continuation Yeah No theyre going to coaches are coaching accordingly but boy just a lid on the basket here for Columbia They just cant seem to get it down And youre talking about 83 free throw shooting team but uh Cals playing such good defense they can afford to miss some shots Thats why theyve maintained this lead Lions four for 16 from the field 0 for three from distance all DAY TO THE BASKETBALL screaming DAY NIGHT HAMMER DOWN AND ONE Quick that cuts the fans out of their seats Greg Oh and one Whoa Over the top Here it is Theres the blow by Up up and away for Day Ames My goodness Fans are liking this replay The collective Oh after they replayed that one he caps off the threepoint play Thats a guard Thats the shortest player on the floor Look now who just skyed above everybody Chicago native getting some love there Always liked what he saw Of course hes from Chicago Nolan splitting door RACES THAT TRY cheering DORSY ON THE MOVE Pimping all alone and a whistle Oh I I you know Ive seen some pretty good dunks this year but I I think you go by and you go over the top I mean thats just poof And again the smallest guy he just And he was fouled on the play which made it even more of an amazing shot I mean he was fouled big time and still managed to complete the play Poster jam from Dayday Ames Day all day just not allowing Rumby to get any looks inside until that basket was scored That had to be the easiest look theyve had They have not had many of them Mason Ritter leading the charge for Colombia now Six points Ames Dorsey from the corner Thats one area Cal struggling now Two for 10 from beyond the arc Good drive here Thompson just lost the handle Yeah he was thinking about dunking it Kind of took his eyes off the prize That happens Ames pull up back in Tough pass there Sulis on the interior You ask why is day to aim so hard to guard Hes shooting almost 50 from three So if you dont get out to him hell knock it down If you get out to him and pressure him he can blow by Hes so good oneonone Cals a hard team to guard and Columbias finding that out Theyre just difficult Four and a half to play first half Yeah switching defenses Short clock now for Columbia Nolan steps into a three off the back rim Ritter and they get Sulis started Tries to spin on Ford and runs into a brick wall Yeah And thats part half the battle Uh you know Greg is you you think youve got an opening then youve got Lee Dort at the rim and just a tough guy to go up against Its really good when you can cement your defense with a post presence like Lee Dort 610 235 just imposing there on the block Its been a lowscoring game I mean really low scoring Pippen draws contact No call Theyre going to say that maybe Tippen initiated that but just there was certainly contact OKeefe Now good look inside Easy finish for E for Iago Well Ks playing a manto man but they have so many zone principles in their defense Wherever you are on the floor they got help side That was one of the rare times they got to the rim on Kell Camden with the left Thor hes fouled 2213 Day Ames getting the crowd Watch it in H Pavilion But you know what Chase Centers been pretty good for the Bears as the Bears got their win over UCLA in front of a nice crowd in the pro arena So you got to play those games sometimes in a bigger arena but uh thats going to be a good game Its too bad Once were in they cant kick us out Ben is going to be here for that Ill put a word in for that next year But you know you talk about Cal you know Greg despite being outrebounded and outshot from the floor they lead And why do they lead Theyve gotten 10 points off turnovers Their defense has been outstanding Uh and and thats been the difference in this game I mean theyre just playing extending the floor 94 ft and making it really tough on Columbia to get good looks And this is a team in Columbia that executes so well Very cheering close to a travel for Mason Ritter Pressure in the back foot I dont think it was close I think he took my three but uh didnt get the call Boy Cals defense tough Oh Dor gets the eraser out Theyre almost inviting you to go to the basket and and good defense and teams can do that They can pressure out And they did force the back door Whats Lee Dort say Get that out of here Lee Dort on the cleanup Nolan floater Ritter battling Third bite of the apple They cannot get it to go Theyre hurrying themselves Theyre not drawing fouls I mentioned this earlier I think theyre going to see how many opportunities theyve had They just hurried their shots They got to come away with at least not a basket a foul break Draw some contact and Cals giving them an opportunity here Bears havent scored a field goal in the last three and a half minutes Yeah when youre struggling the free throw line can be your best friend Get there draw some fouls Shot clock to five Carr on the move Puts on the brakes Rebound Columbia cheering Turnover Another one Their 11th Cals all over the floor Camden in rhythm Yeah Cals not shooting a great percentage from three Thank goodness for Colombia but their defense has been just unbelievable in terms of what theyre doing to Columbia taking them out of the rhythm John Cam just one for five now from beyond the arc No two play No good looks Shot clock to five Sanders layups have been few and far between for Columbia just struggling to get good looks and just you know forcing up some shots But Gs defense has had a lot to do with this A whistle before that steal You know its always funny I always get a kick out of Greg when when people say like you and me on the sidelines here like Oh so and sos really struggling Theyre really they cant buy a basket Well how about looking at the defense Sure You you know you dont often give credit enough to the other team Theres a reason why youre not making baskets Theres a reason why youve left the shot short Youve gotten your last couple shots blocked Youve got pressured and you dont see the floor So its the defense thats causing these turnovers and its really put pressure on Colombia Ames the front end of a one and one is good Hes already into double figures now with 11 You know youre Craig Huby I mean you know uh obviously um Kevin Hubdy brother if youre Kevin Huby youre saying to yourself uh you know were only down double digits It could be a lot worse when youre struggling to score But but Cal you know hasnt been able to score either I think they normally do So if they can knock this down to single digits by the time the halftime shows up theyll be pleased Youre spot on I will stay here If youre Colombia and youve shot six for 25 and youve committed 11 turnovers and youre still Yeah youre I mean because youve held a high power team to 20ome points but you got to score more than 13 Nolan sets his feet for three North air to tip the rebound And now Ames on the run steps through Bell Tough shot Rebound secured by Igo wanted to foul trying to draw contact Columbia still looking for an easy basket Uh Greg its been its been few and far between From the corner threepointer rattles in for Gerardo Keith Their best long range of the afternoon Good timeout by coach Huby to the basket music See if they could draw a foul or get a wideopen look Now you got some fullourt pressure by Columbia I like it 15sec difference shot and game clock here Yeah youre not going to get a quick shot in 15 So exhaust the shot clock made Columbia play Thats why they by the way thats why they pressured out They want to get Cal So they couldnt get a quick shot Now theyve got to take the shot clock down They will get the last shot Ames on the drive Bell steps into an open jumper and hes fouled Franklin contesting Yeah that was a kind of a silly foul because the shot was not going to go down and you know you already did a good job There it is The shot fake and now you just kind of brush foul Not a lot of contact But a foul is a foul Greg Its not whether its intentional or intended And you dont want to foul Chris Bell Why Cuz hes a 90 exactly 91 free throw shooter lethal Absolutely lights out from the free throw line Even we cant screw up this percentage laughter Maybe Lets see No music Lights off your jinx No theres no jinx You I never believed in jinxes When you shoot it you shoot it Nobody can talk you out of it So now youre Cal Youll extend the floor Youre going to try to get Colombia on a short clock Youre not necessarily looking for a turnover but you want to do what youve done all half long make Columbia get a tough shot and then dont give them an offensive rebound or put back Shot clock is off 13 seconds left for Colombia to work with Heres Kenny Noland scoreless thus far to Gabe to Ritter Big jump stop Lost the handle and coughs it up Well again hes thinking about the shot Greg I maintain that if he would gather it go up hell probably draw a foul Hes thinking about scoring it before he has possession of the floor Thats what you do against aggressive defense You just make you play faster than youd like to play Bears will call for time Theyve got 33 seconds left to get one last shot off Well thats enough time because you dont want to foul here Your coach youre telling your team hey whatever you do dont foul So Cal will get a chance to get it up the floor and get one look How about these guys These ACC leaders these guys can music play if you havent seen them And the Cal Bears are going to get a whole up close and personal look at this crew with conference play on tap Yeah how music about that You know what does Cal have on tap They only have uh Louisville music Notre Dame North Carolina at home and and and Duke Hows that Welcome to the ACC Their next four home games So uh but first things first lets lets you know you dont worry about your ACC Youre in your nonconference This is an important game for Cal Its an important game for Columbia 33 left here for the Bears Yeah you dont let them roll it up Its going to take place Heres the inbound into Camden They go back to Carr Carr racing at the horn No good Had a chance Good play Nice play Camden his first struggled since fading here and that rattles out Columbia nearly gives it away but theyll hang on to possession I like Cal battling in there I mean nothings come easy for Columbia That was a good defensive possession but they got to finish it with a block out Heres Cal I like the fullcourt pressure Greg Thats something that a year ago you didnt see uh with the depth Cal has Theyre extending the floor on people and making it very difficult I like extending the floor taking the shooters legs away and making teams try to attack you from way deep Heres the reigning Ivy League player of the week Kenny Nolan Can he get on track Miles Franklin now hard to the basket and draws a foul Well we just said how do you how do you get better looks And you know you you attack the rim They did that And that had to be part of Coach Hubs halftime uh analysis Look guys weve got to find a way to finish at the basket Weve hurried ourselves Weve turned it over and were not getting to the foul line Lets at least improve in those areas I like the way theyre starting this half Franklin the freshman from Vienna Virginia no good on the first Third free throw Just one for three now And we got to make But you know what When you dont get to the line youre not in rhythm So get to the line your your rhythm will get back to you But you got to shoot free throws to start getting them Good on the second Yeah lowscoring affair so far from both teams Both teams high powered 80 points plus for each team Theyre having trouble getting on the board Penton gave up the dribble Now he can go back to work Turns that corner down the lane Double clutch Dor in traffic and draws a foul Well thats the one luxury that Columbia doesnt have Lee Dort on the offensive glass Hes done a good job And wed like to see that ball in there And I think Lee Dor I love it when big guys want the ball I mean I used to tell our big guys fight for it Put your hands up Yell at your teammates I dont care Whatever it takes Show that your teammates you want the basketball And one way to win is go get the offensive rebounds if youre not seen it Control your own destiny right Absolutely Dort front rim on the first Matson raving about him during a shoot around this morning Said you love to see Lee Dor get going Hes high in his potential and what he can bring Hes their most improved player Theres no doubt in my mind I think many peoples mind he has really stepped his game up from a year ago Good on the second Three points now for Dort More pressure from the Bears Yeah theyre making different people bring it up and run their offense This is really good Good job defensively by the Bears I mean theyre way out on the floor OKeefe in trouble Should have been a five pound I thought OKeefe fading on the baseline Thats a tough shot Well youre going to have to make some of those Greg I got news for you Youre not going to get anything easy You might have to make some of those tougher deep shots Lowest point total for Columbia this year 54 points in a win over Boston So they are well below where they typically lived Dort thats tipped on the back door and well stay here Well its better defense for Columbia Theyre forcing back door cuts Theyre snapping their head Theyre denying the pass back out and putting a little more pressure on the ball making it tougher for Cal Heres Bell Has a wide open lane and able to bank it home Yeah he can get that shot pretty much anytime he wants Hes so tall and ranging to the rim Hes there 67 68 Uh he finishes really well around the basket Thompson left free from three Man Chris Bell knows he left his man just a little bit too much You can see Colombia is sneaky good if you give them openings They dont score 80 points a game to nothing and shoot it and get 48 from the floor Almost a little under 40 from three Just their second triple D battling does not get the roll for the foul Well thats what you have to do And I I like again Lee Nord commanding I mean commanding that he wants the basketball down on that block and he shows you why Not a lot teams can do when hes got the ball isolated on that really low low block In fact he had both feet in the paint Hes going to post up Get both feet in the paint not one Dor on the first here Macau still without the services of Rita Petritis No TJ Campbell Columbia likewise No Zen Eden Bedri or Avery Brown And those are their two returning guys other than Lee Dor So theyre missing two veteran guys And had a lot to do there They are Reus kind of their heart and soul guy He was so huge against UCLA They dont beat UCLA without leaders to try to and Matson loved the continuity they brought amongst all the new pieces The 13 newcomers They had a through line there to last year Hope to have them back so theyd have more answers on their status after the break Thompson Well you saw that play developing That was the setup That was the the old play the almost Princeton look where you come up you deny the wing and you one dribble at a dribble at when you dribble at you back And he found him right in strike Some Columbia fans scattered throughout Hosp and theyve gotten a bit energized here Camden to answer He struggled today Noland turns it over but then Ames cant hang on Well you know I I Im very familiar They need to get him back on and healthy Told the Chancer Chronicle wants to be a leader a voice of the team That was a bad idea from Sulis Rebuffed by Gordon Not in my house Lee Torch says not in my house And then above Wow I I I mean I I didnt see that I Lee Dor just wasnt having it I I mean this was supposed to be a dunk And Lee Dor says No Siri you are not going to get this in my home He put that ball in the transfer portal to get it out of here Oh my goodness Was that denied at the junction TO DORT ON BOTH ENDS YEAH that was a designed play Justin Pippen Perfect pass to Lee Dort OKeefe Good dish and Ritter knows how to rock the rim Yeah you cant celebrate if youre count A big play but you cant allow to Columbia to come right back down and score that easily But Justin Pippen I mean my goodness what a look to lead Door Just picture perfect pass Camden firing and hitting Greg John Camden has hit almost every big basket that Cal has needed especially on this home floor when theyve been down He has been their goto guy Shooter shoot Now two for seven P in a near rip and well say last touch off Colia cheering Nolan slow to get up My former friend and his his his coach Pete Newell but Bill Mcccleintoch leading rebounder helped his team to a national championship I mean basketball royalty Pippen a travel there Couldnt hang on to the pivot Yeah you know nice to see Bill Mcccleintoch his wife Claudia here there now in the Monterey Peninsula But he comes up here he comes to as many games as he can Just a loyal Cal guy and uh uh just you know talk about success He was part of such an important era in Cal basketball That banner is hanging here and its been a model inspiration for everybody That 5960 team 281 before they fell in the national championship got coached as well You want to talk about some pedigree he can he can coach Clock to seven for the Lions I go working on Camden Running out of real estate Oh makes something out of nothing I didnt see anything there I mean you know John Camdens just kind of playing oneonone Thought maybe hed get a little help but good patience by her inside 10point game Yeah good job by Chris Bell got bumped sold it a little bit and uh that was a good move I mean there was some contact Fishell didnt call the initial bump and then when Chris Bell took the fall Fishell made the obvious call Good job defensively though that playing playing hard Second foul there on Thompson as Pippen takes a seat He got TT power back in the game and hes been so good for the Bears Hes really played well his last couple electric Heres Camden Step back Oh that thats veteran basketball You get to where you want to go on the court You know youre 68 You just simply go over the top of your defender OKeefe and a late foul Yeah we we you know you talk about John Camden you know hes a good threepoint shooter but what you really underestimate is the visibility to get into the rim stop on a dime footwork and just go straight up And thats thats good basketball Now youre Cal you know youre trying to see if you can increase this uh you know but get get a stop in here cuz Columbia scored pretty easily last time Ritter now good look inside and I go again finishing in close Yeah good job by Iiggo to get the basket Bitter bigs like to feed bigs They know where they want it Thats a nice job Post to post Lions hanging around here again Down 10 from the corner Good follow there and Elix is on the scene Thats smart from Cal Opportunistic basketball You know youve got size You got one crack at the offensive glass Go for it Ritter tries to drop to Thompson Its Bell Camden fading Hes hot cheering He got away with a push off there but you know when youre when youre feeling it everythings going your way Great job by John Camden Some more defense into offense and then a reach I mean John Camden can do no wrong Here he is He gets guarded here He says You know what Get off of me Thats a little bit of help with the off hand Coach Humpdy saying You know you got to call that But you know whats interesting here is that uh the story of the game so far has really been the job that Cals done on Colombias best player He has really struggled and Kenny Nolan just to get off the Schneider here He has not found any type of rhythm Nolan 0 for seven Hes on the bench out right now Timer to six I go again gets in deep and is able to finish now Hes having his way here early in this second half And I like the no call They could have got been an offensive foul there but but goes around comes around John Camden says All right I didnt get to push off Im not going to expect one either Camden three for five in this second half Oh Bell down low Beautiful gun Well thats really applause and cheering again just straight basketball When youre getting pressured you attack the basket Chris Bell to the rim When in doubt go back door OKeefe a little daylight Hell take it making it difficult Theyre making it impossible Gerard OKeeffe with nine points to lead Colombias attack As you see Kenny Nolan usually the goto Well keeps a bright spot but uh Nolans really struggled against this Cal defense Good drive there Ames hanging and cheering hitting Hes got so many speeds He plays and then he jumps and he waits for you to come down Hell put her off the glass Great body control Theres Cals aggressive defense right here Cal really pressuring out on the floor Nothing easy Igo runs into a double OKeefe fading and the rebound all over at Nolan Dorsy Low pass there for Dorsy Good skip now to Carr Easy board for Franklin cheering Good look for Carr He was wide open down low and a foul there as got free Yeah you want to watch this back cut by Ames I mean he gets hit and just glides to the basket Hes so good going to the rim He plays at different speeds but hes got great body control Excellent hang time and Lee the junior from Nigeria off the mark I used to hate not only playing against but coaching against guys that they jump and then you jump and they wait for you to come down laughter Thats not fair Just thats unfair Its you know you its an advantage But thats what Day does He gets up in the air and hes just glides Oh for two from the free throw line The struggles continue there for Columbia now Two for six Just about halfway through this second half Elich back door Dorsy You know its really interesting to watch Greg because theyre giving Colombia a little bit of their own medicine Thats how Colombia plays and Cal doing it to perfection right now Franklin blocked and then cannot stay in bounds applause Well this is interesting I mean look at the back cut This is Princeton basketball Dribble at back door You dribble at your teammate Thats back door Its an automatic And now Pippen Very unselfish I mean Justin could have shot the ball He chose to get back into his offense help his teammates Making an extra pass thats going to theme here for the Bears through nonconference play Pippen all alone from three Knocks it down And Justin Pippen is back in the house You wonder if hes back in his rhythm Thats a Thats a great sign His first bucket of the afternoon missed the last two Cal playing with two point guards right now And then I go Yeah thats defense Thats Nolan Dorsy just doing what he does But how about Pip He said You know what Youre not going to guard me I might have been out for the last three games but I got my range here Hes steady steady Freddy And a quick 70 run from Cows Built a nice little cushion here 5335 Well and its nice to have two point guards on the floor and Justin Pippen and TT Carr That gives you a lot of ball handling Camden wants more Hes got it Theyre feeling it You You can sense that theyre not afraid to hit open guys and a whistle pressure there Yeah And and Greg thats what they did in their last game This started a game ago with Cal They just came out and just were playing where they were finding open guys and the and the guys they found was the most open and he just rewarded the passer rewarded his team and just made you just made you pay I mean Cal can shoot it Theyve got excellent threepoint shooting Bears up 21 now Their largest lead of the afternoon and another foul here as they are cranking up the intensity now on the defensive end Well you can see that Kenny Nolan who is a very good player having to play against not just one tough defender but two three I mean theyre putting all kinds of guys on Nolan trying to get it out of his hands Theyre still on him Just two guys on him at every juncture Sulus has returned as well Shocks off to seven Franklin out of time here gets it off at the buzzer and knocks it down DIFFICULT SHOT from Miles Franklin I dont know how he hit that and he almost didnt get it off You know Im Coach Huby I might call it time on ask the reps to count players how many players Kell has It seems like they have more than five Theres like seven guys it seems out there Nothing simple for the Lions on this day Back door again THE SCOOP IS THERE FOR TTO HOW ABOUT THE PATIENCE for Cal to play against pressure Thompson on the other end Hell rock the rim and one Well Cal celebrated it You know that last basket Mark Madson not happy Hes happy with their play but as a coach you just cant celebrate Look at the back cut Justin Pippen the perfect TT Carr Now you shouldnt get beat in transition coming back the other way Yeah a little bit celebratory and uh you know thats one thing theyre going to have to work work on a little bit Just its its human nature You want to celebrate your your scores but you got to get back in transition Heres Thompson to try and complete the threepoint play Free throws continue to be an Achilles heel for Colombia They get it right back though An easy steal And finally Kenny Nolan is on the board Nice little miscommunication right there A little relaxation from Cal I like Columbia continue to battle I mean theyre not going to go away floater there The follow for Elich and now Noland Hey Columbia make one more push Ritter inside and a whistle They call a foul Justin Pippen wants them to review whose ball it went off of but theyre calling a foul Youre not going to review that So uh Cal is still holding on They leave So you like that youre playing that game at home and and know whats most important Greg is coming off a win This game is more important than anything right now First two weeks there of that conference like the other teams coming up Duke down the list Cant think about that Got to deal with the present here No Im not even looking Duke and North Carolina Forget about those teams Thats make me not sleep at night 60 run for Colombia Pippen steps through with the left and makes it look simple Well that it did It was simple because hes able to use his off hand So many players dont go to their off hands He was so natural going to his left hand and thats when he had the opening A lot of players that use their right hand try to go across their body Uhuh He used the left got an easy shot off Ritter Nolan from three Rims out just not his afternoon for nine Yeah he had a somewhat open look but had to rush it again because Scals been playing that aggressively Theres prep for this Columbia team their rebounding efforts the way they play the game and theyve really slowed down their offensive attack Pip in for three How about confidence You know youve been out three four games three games and you wonder is your confidence back Its back Great move by Mark Matson bringing him back not only into this game but putting him in the starting lineup letting him get some reps under his belt before the opener in the ACC OKeefe not there Pippen has gotten it in gear here in the second half now Eight points after a scoreless first half So getting comfortable Yeah I think thats what you want to do You want to get your best players back in the rhythm and uh Justin Pippen is is playing at at his regular speed right now Looking like hes recovered Heres Dort battling Goes with the right That one a bit wild They wanted to draw the foul And now Nolan Franklin there for the rebound OKeefe from three He had some makes earlier Now hes gone cold as well Under five and a half to play Bears in the drivers seat in this nonconference finale Bell step back just dances off the rim Bell had a huge game last time 28 points six from downtown against Morgan State Theyve just spread it around They have you know thats a good news Greg is you might have 20 or 25 one game 28 in this case you know careerh highs uh but youre youre playing on a team that plays unselfishly So John Camden uh you know days they got guys that can score Dort and you dont worry about that if youre winning basketball games Scoring averages mean nothing I go its Noland gets that three to fall He was two Yeah And you know what Theres going to be games youre Kenny Nolan youre not going to youre just not going to go walk away and and and not get confidence back I mean he hes too good a player Hell bounce back Hes a veteran cheering Hes got tough mentality Uh but Kell Kells put their game plan in against him Thats what theyve done to shut him down Thompson the rip Sanders comes up with it Nolan in rhythm Back rim Good idea there by Sanders but well stay here Yeah you youre Kenny Nolan You know the way you can play and when you spot up I mean this is an automatic He has shot this way 40 plus percent By the way Kenny Nolan has been 36 for 36 100 on the year Leads the country Thats how good he is I go draws the foul Couple of bigs in this Columbia team not afraid to bang down low No and that thats what their team does but Cal has taken that away I mean sometimes you got to give credit to your opponents And as good as Columbia is and as good as theyve played this year uh this is clear that Cal has been their toughest opponent and and not only on paper is Cal toughest opponent but the way that Cals played it Forget about how theyre supposed to be Cals put their maybe one of their best defensive efforts on the floor If Cal will play at this defensive pace uh buy or beware Greg teams are going to have trouble against the Bears Second one good for Igo Nearing the fourminute mark now Aiming to finish nonconference play 12 and one best start in decades HS somehow squeezes through and finishes You know hell take whatever you give him or dont give him Hell find a way Hell step through hell step back And whatever it is he is a perfect guy to whose hands you want to put the ball into the end of the shot clock Sulas finding Sanders Sanders little flip and gets it to go for the NYU transfer Well I like that I mean thats thats a good looking play Was coached by HubDs brotherinlaw David Klatsky NYU So some familiarity there before he made the move to the Upper West Side Now part of the Florida staff Shot clock to five Its Ames with two from three Expected that to go down the way Hes been filling it up at the end of the shot clock and hes been shooting 50 from three 49 to be exact I go steps through and one better Whenever you launch your podcast I think it should be Ben Bronze selected by measure Yeah Well we had it for that for that weekend I can tell you that Sulus with a takeaway Rare miscue there Just the fifth turnover for Cal Theres been 15 of them for Columbia Its been a good sign Just playing defense The kick here to Thompson Too long Columbia ramping up that pressure A stumble but theyre able to advance And they go upstairs to Dort Its swatted away Excellent help from Sulus He had the big fella Sulus put both hands up Sported it Franklin Tough drive And Dort and a whistle Lee Dor he will run the court Well you know what Think about that Greg What you just said Oh I love a little snowman I love it But Lee Dor you made a great point He Hes at the alleyoop at I mean hes looking for the the oop doesnt get it runs down the floor makes a play and grades lurking Sanders instead Ames under two to play and a whistle Well Cal can take some I think some ownership now cheering Whats been two games back to back where they have been not good defensively theyve been dominant defensively Thats exactly where you want to be with ACC play about to ramp up Oh youre going to have days when you shoot it but what about the days you dont shoot it and bury it Oh 50 from three Doesnt lie Does a great They might have just as well won that game If they had another couple minutes to play in that game they might have been undefeated despite having to rebuild Brought some core talent back And this is a really really strong group that Mark Matson has assembled Tie up and quickly a timeout called by the Bears as Pippen was on the floor I go thought at least a jump ball instead Hes got a special team this year Greg and if they can get those key pieces Petritis and Campbell back said hed screaming know more on their status after some time off here for the holidays Itll only bolster what theyre bringing to the court as a foul there with Bell controlling Yeah they may get Justin Pippen out of this game Wouldnt be a bad move Lets see You just dont want anything to happen to Justin He just he got back or you know what with little less time on the clock I think Cal will kind of pull it back now You you the games not in question You the last thing you want is an injury or somebody going for a ball or turning an ankle You thats the last thing you want What a rare miss Look at that Coming up short but the back tap here and the Bears can control as we fall under one minute to go Yeah they can just pull it out Yeah theyll play smart I think you you know the game is kind of at hand So for Cal suffocating defensive effort in that first half really slowed down a Columbia team that scores around 80 206 at the break Both teams found their form a bit in the second half but Cal did enough to hold off any thoughts of because of what you said Greg The suffocating is a great adjective They just played relentlessly They took away floor space and it was suffocating There werent many areas youre talking about Coach Hyd was a great offensive coach Its been everywhere hes been Analytics his teams have been I mean efficient You talk about a team thats shooting we mentioned this already almost 40 from three 48 from the floor I mean they just havent had many good looks Thats a credit to Cal Absolutely And theyve held Kenny Nolan to his season low Camden does the job there from the free throw line 70 to 54 Franklin floater And Camdens there for the rebound Camden cheering going to finish with 17 points after a slow start from the outside Ames meanwhile attacking never stops and a little slow there to get up after he takes some contact Comes up hopping a bit Yeah thats why you just both guys last 30 seconds You dont want to chance it I mean I was surprised he went in for that layup I thought they were going to pull him out but you know its hard to stop playing but you can see the contact in the fall Um you know its hard to sometimes you get injured too Greg when you stop playing So you got to continue to play cheering Uh they kind of flexing a little bit there Theyll have some time off but I think Cal wants to stay in their rhythm They want to play their guys because the next game is going to be their biggest game of the year Period And as you mentioned a bit of a breather there not till December 30th So a layoff there with Christmas coming up Miles Franklin committed the foul Hes done for the day with his fifth as Ames get on the first Ill be surprised if if you dont see this crowd almost double or triple in that ACC opener Youre 121 Youre going to the ACL opener Theres day getting a welldeserved break but youre going to have a chance to play a nationally ranked team at home where youve been perfect Havent lost a game Uh thats going to be quite an atmosphere 19 points for Ames Yes Buzz starting to spread throughout college basketball on this Cow Bears team as they are set to move to 121 their best start in decades coming off of a 14 and 19 season a year ago Theyre only two wins away from equaling all of last years win total They went six and 14 and theyre in the mention of of teams you know whatever on the bubble top top 40 net ranking but receiving votes this week coming in Yeah Im less concerned I think Mark Matson staff and team less concerned about where you are now Where do you want to be at the end of the year And and you know how does your team progress Are you improving Are you beating people Uh you know hows your road record you get some wins in the road you maintain your dominance at home If you do those things youre going to be an NCAA team and and uh experience has taught me that So continue to do those things and good things will happen Just 18 seconds left as Colombia will get one more look I go from NBA range and Dort there for the rebound Well last time out they shot a blistering 60 in the first half They wait for the second half 64 on this day as they run away from Columbia 74 to 56 and Cal improves to 121 This one in the books Greg
