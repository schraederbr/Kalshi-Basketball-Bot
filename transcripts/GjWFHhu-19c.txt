all year Florida States a team that generates turnovers so first thing for Tech is theyre going to have to take care of the ball something theyve struggled to do here this season Florida State wins the tip in their gos Virginia Tech and the Maroons thats a seminal Team 13 and seven on the year Watkins one of the accs leading scores top five in points per game and getting to the free throw line as well handles the rock on the right side and Johnson is matched up against Watkins heres one of the best bigs in the Accu and layup rattles out doesnt miss many of those the accs leader and field goal percentage a little bit of a defensive breakdown that time for Virginia Tech they were very fortunate to that you and missed that one heres the one they call Mighty Mouse Ben Hammond the 511 freshman from Fairfax nice kick three ball not there for Johnson Tyler Johnson ball fat inside turnover Hammond lightning quick Ali thats a good way you get things started Toby loau that was a great play by Hammond to avoid the double team and if you can dribble past the double team with that kind of speed youve created an advantage situation and L is exactly the guy to take advantage heres B Bowen has really improved his jump shot here this season on the attack that one rattles home for the sophomore Im not sure if youre Toby laow you want to be jumping out on B Bowen like that I know he can shoot the three but hes very adeptive driving past you you got to contain him out on the perimeter much of the story for Florida State this season Dan other than Jamir Watkins and Malik euan who else can step up and provide some scoring punch for leard Hamilton Squad here is L the athleticism through the roof how about that spin move now the spin move was something but somebody hit the ball on the way up he is stronger than he looks so L while four early for the hookies they lead by two on the road seminal team who lost to Stanford in their last match up Virginia Tech fell to Clemson heres youan double team comes into that short Corner looking to relieve that press pressure on the attack with the left hand that one rattles out couple shots early for you and dont fall lot of dribbling by youan on that particular possession and thats not normally the way Florida State likes to play they like to pass the ball to go side to side and then shoot ball rotation a Virginia Tech Team traditionally under Mike young who really passes the ball well how about that one the feed to the strong Johnson Tyler Johnson The Freshman lays it in and one on its not just passing the ball that Virginia Tech does well they like their guys to move without the ball and thats just an excellent job by Tyler Johnson to come from the top everybody from Florida state had their backs turned and he was able to get all the way to the basket this kid has really played well over the last few games Dan The Floridian back in his home state the Orlando native averaging over 10 points per game in his last three cont test pretty good start for Virginia Tech have you been impressed with the way theyve come out ready to play in this one but they been done a nice job defensively except for that very first play and they got lucky that Florida State missed the easy layup theres B Bowen over to Davis another outstanding freshman two on the shot clock got to get something up Thomas desperation heave off to the right never hit the never hit the rim thats a shot clock violation another great defensive possession for the hokes the hokes are handling the Florida state screen and roll very well and thats going to be a key to the game Virginia Tech is not the kind of defense that gets out and attacks you tries to create steals they play sort of a helping recover defense Jaden shoot on the drive turns fad fires off to the right offensive rebound for potit heres L he can shoot the three that one too strong rebounds B Bowen and the sophomore will push it in transition turns good recovery defense by the Hoke he getting back youan wants the ball inside against L heres double team comes loses it turn what a defensive Applause play and it on the bush yoyos to shoot three ball in the air that ones good a 102 start for the hes timeout taken by Florida State Mike Youngs team ready to play here dribblers and number two theyve done a nice job helping one another out and Tyler Johnson so far has totally contained jir Watkins you and I were talking before the game Dan about how with FL to say gets into transition right forces those turnovers they have a lot more success offensively as Watkins drives he cant convert on the half court offense but thats not the way Florida State wants to play offense one pass and then a drive to the basket they want to move the defense around Watkins who scored 17 straight in double figures himit and the NOS icy to start now Florida state that their whole game is based on causing turnovers they got a four side offensive rebound stick back there for Tyler Johnson off the Miss threepoint shot from Jaden shot and again who its Tyler Johnson hes had a great start one of the best offensive rebounders in the ACC you see him go to work there on the glass hokes by 10 122 early heres dayquon Davis Chandler Jackson whos missed the last two contests got hurt against Georgia Tech a couple of weeks ago did not play on the west coast trip and NOS felt like they really missed his leadership two on the shot clock Watkins at the buzzer that was will clip the front iron rebound cleared by lall in the hopus its a perfect example of what Virginia Tech has been able to do on defense keep their guys in front of them on the dribble and help one another out hmon drive kick shoot looking for an angle back to Hammond Hammond inserted into the starting lineup a couple of games ago has provided some ball security some steadiness handling the rock low not there offensive rebound almost collected there from Patrick wler with the NS clear now Davis working inside against the big seven footer double team comes nice feed Yan gets position flips it up no left and short thats two for Yan Point Blank Range Misses Johnson hot hand early no off to the right rebound Jackson I dont know that that was the shot Mike young was looking for thats an offensive foul oh a blocking foul it is a blocking foul oh thats this is what Florida State wants to do you get the long Miss and that was a blocking fou shoot never got in position thats what Florida State wants to do get out in transition and when you take early threepoint shots that is early in the shot clock and you miss them you get long rebounds and transition opportunities Virginia Tech does not want to do that and Jackson made the basket they actually gave him the bucket F going against shoot he had started his shooting motion when the contact occurred and thats one of the reasons it was a blocking foul he had already started uh and the defensive player shoot wasnt in position before he planted his foot prior to going off the ground well Jackson have 13 points in a game against pit prior to another strong contest against Georgia Tech and then he pulled his groin miss a couple of weeks one of Florida States best on ball Defenders and the only veteran in fsus lineup thats played for three seasons under letter Hamilton so that two game losing streak Monaco insided losing some leadership as that shots off to the left rebound to the Nolls Deng the transfer from Hampton to Hol the transfer from South Dakota turns inside passed up a shot and kicked it out pick and roll Malo ball movement for Florida State great recovery defense from the hokes h no put back not there wesler foul called oh thatll be on the big man Patrick wesler the sevenfooter from North Carolina and thats going to be a two shot foul because P was tipping the ball so that he was into shooting motion one of the one of the things that has to happen for Florida State to be able to get out and run is Virginia Tech has to miss some shots and they have here the last couple of possessions and H misses that one thatll give us a chance to set up Saturday afternoon where we have another ACC mens basketball triple header Florida State BC starting us off at two Eastern followed by the Commonwealth clash between uba and Virginia Tech SMU Stanford they cap the night hold missed them both and you talked about Chandler Jackson Leonard Hammer told us Jackson is his energy guy jaon lost one game in his career in high school Christian Brothers Academy cant just be dribbling the ball around against Florida state theyre going to come trap you seols have done a nice job of getting to the paint over the last couple of possessions Watkins tough jumper had to that one go down Watkins can really score young was in pretty good position that was an off balance shot but thats what really good players do jir Watkins who in 31 career ACC games has finished in double figures in 30 of Rex Steiner turning and facing now to Young H 10 on the shot clock young attacks kicks a good threepoint shooter in the corner that was Hammond couldnt connect excuse me Burnham Ben Burnham the senior from Charleston Dan calls his own number for three that rattles Applause out heres Rodney Brown has been getting extended playing time over the last couple of games into the corner for three Jaden young knocks down the Music triple young has not shot the ball well from three in conference games maluk on the layup no oh Florida State missing a lot of shots at The Rim Early in this one transition three buried by re Steiner now I said before that Mike young didnt like a transition three that they took its not taking the transition three its whos taking it and Rex Steiner is a guy who Mike young approves of him taking them and Jackson that ball knocked out of bounds itll stay with Florida State well Virginia back one of the best three the word that I got is that thats a new suit that lonard got he looks very fresh dont you D almost as good as you sitting here next to me that ball burnam active hands knocks it out of bounds good defense take a look at the kicks huh how do you grade them theyre white oh come on no fresh clean you could use any adjective of course theyre clean guys they have shoe contracts they wear them one Applause time yes in the little sense they are clean probably Applause new Florida State team that you saw on the screen earlier on that graphic leads the ACC in blocks and in steals per game FS their offense a lot but in the half court Virginia Tech has stifled them so far that was just a poor play by y he he had position and didnt hold it yeah confident stroke from Young that rattles out trying to find you and inside heavy pass and able to retain it the NOS huan cut into the basket Tang that will roll off the rim hell go to the line for Two Shots after the foul Florida State their offense has looked much better when theyve been in attack and here Yan that time handles the double team because he saw it coming and Virginia Tech failed to drop down and help out on the inside if youre going to double somebodys got to get that guy in the low post and the hookies didnt do it that time n sophomore Jerry Deng from Rochester New York knocks down that first free throw Rochester New York also Dan the home of the Kodak company for the first ever photograph was did Im sure Jerry knows that you know should have asked him that before the Kodak moment for the Hampton transfer one of Florida States best threepoint Shooters on the year knocks down a pair of free throws he doesnt get to the line very much hes a threepoint shooter finesse kind of guy this what Florida state does to you they really attack you on defense youve got to handle the ball very well you got to be very strong with the ball see they take they take away passing Lanes rck Steiner doesnt want to dribble it around thats not the Virginia Tech offense they want to pass the ball but the seminal make that hard on the attack W around lay and that was pretty huh Rodney Brown well thats a heck of a shot right there that was pretty good defense by the S hes been solid for his head coach over the last couple of games its flash for the hokes put a lot on his plate he played some point guard as well Davis turning with the left hand good contest theres young Jaden flips it to Rodney on that left wing guarded by Thomas rolls will switch everything one through five Burnham turning has the match up he likes gave it up Rex Steiner hoki so patient in their half court offense three ball risen fire short rebound Deng NOS want to run push to head hold heres Deng Thomas between the legs dribble Den had an ocean didnt shoot it ball on the deck Now One V one little jump shot hook shot no good defense from the hookes is Young Deng had a mismatch in there hes got a couple of inches but again hes a threepoint guy hes not really a back to the basket guy a Virginia tag team that has played better of late mik young talking about how his team for the most part has hung into these tough games Clemson over the weekend another example the hes cut the lead to four Midway through the second half before Clemson pulled away to win that one by 15 that ball out of bounds couple substitutions but Mike young trying to figure things out right a team that protects the ball traditionally shoots the three ball well theyre unselfish they pass it and this season some of those Tendencies have changed for Hokes team that is last in the ACC in turnovers for hes got so many new guys and I mean if youre a team that relies on ball movement and player movement you rely on guys playing together you build that over a couple of years with the each other and they just havent had that opportunity but thats basketball in this day and age is one of the youngest teams in the ACC Corner triple Noe Florida State gang rebounds that one Davis comes away with it h team that really focuses on trying to get everybody involved noes after a scrum Bowen threw some contact tough Finish Well Leal tried to make a pass he shouldnt have made and that gave four State an opportunity there is loal rebounds Florida State good defense from Yan Bo they really get out and go dont they hoki create a turnover two on one slapped out of bounds itll stay with the visitors from bloxburg under eight media timeout Virginia tack up nine on the road as theyve been able to set their defense Florida state looks a little discombobulated theyre only shooting 25 and thats because theyve played against the set defense just about every time down and also it hasnt helped that Florida state has had five layups and missed four of them just four points in the paint for Florida State a lot of that having to do with BTs defense Applause ham eight assists in a game earlier this year against Miami has done a nice job generating offense for Virginia attack a team thats protected the ball tonight seven on the clock heres shoot the transfer from duke three ball quick trigger short long rebound Watkins has Applause it now Davis pulls up jumper too strong rebound hogies they do a good job on the glass Ive really been impressed with Tyler Johnson hes had a great start thats a trout see but thats what Florida state does to you think okay I have an opening and then they they close it off right away and the only thats the second turnover for the hokes and the benefit to the hokes is Florida State didnt get a fast break opportunity out of it and there are Hoke fans right now going out you jinx us they start protecting the basketball and look what happens its been a good start though for Virginia Tech up nine on the road here in Tallahasse and old team whos been good at the Tucker Center again this season Watkins thats another tough attempt rattles out another great defensive job Watkins has two point yan yan hasnt scored Hammond chases the ball down here near the sideline good ball movement kick out three in the air bottoms you get that kind of ball movement the defense starts to Chase and somebodys going to be open and the hokes have knocked down their threes tonight shudu leads the team in those threepoint field goals oh Davis was tripped up well Florida state is going to get after pressure and Hammond does a great job getting past the pressure at half court but then a couple of really good passes Johnson to the wall to shoot the defense just cant catch up and of course you get that shot and there have been times this year when the Hokies havent made that shot but in this first half theyve shot the three pretty well Mike young talks a lot about about passing up a good shot to get a great shot right against this Florida State Defense that can be very difficult to do with the way they extend their pressure so far so good for the hokes Bowen that was a deep three it was straight away without in it wa without any passes its hard to get that rebound Hamilton hold oh KNE to back where that came from Christian need to getting extended playing time the 611 Canadian for all the good things Hammond has done in ACC play scoring is not one of them hes only got five field goals in ACC play in fact hes only two for his last 21 counting tonight but hes done a nice job getting the ball moving shoot against Thomas now Hammond Works inside penetrates good ball fake Hammond has a clean look off to the right no good L rebound Second Chance hokes three ball too strong great effort there from Shoot Virginia Tech team playing with a ton of energy here in this first half will go Florida States away however thats pretty good defensive work by Florida State though to make shoot move shoot is a catch and shoot guy more than anything else and made him move and dribble and so that three was missed Watkins Jackson ball Bowen driving need to missed the dunk well we talked about missing the layups and now theyve missed the dunk that was an uncontested one had is struggle near the rim here tonight had some looks L out called for the charge uhoh that is just his first personal foul well hes driving to the basket but he never leaves his feet to go into a shooting motion hes dribbling the ball and so nice job by Watkins to get himself set up inside a theme for Florida state has been Watkins and Yan both accumulating fouls as of late and finding themselves in foul trouble turnover by the noes yet another one in the half DG Applause flushed Ben Burnham oh baby and again Florida State doing too much dribbling against this Virginia Tech defense Jackson hangs got caught in no mans land great defense again from the hokes now to re Steiner hang behind that screen three ball no that was Rodney Brown hes actually a 50 shooter in ACC play and that was an open one Oki havent missed many of those tonight Thomas tenu turning facing that one not there Applause re Steiner sophomore from aworth Georgia uses the screen from Applause po eight on the clock Rex Steiner young ball taken away pocket picked by the big man KN to hop step lay up oh thats pretty nice from The Freshman from Ontario get the turnover get an easy basket its a 611 big man in the open court the ability to evade a smaller guard how about it short jumper backboard no rebound tapped out poti great effort Rex Steiner pulls up his midrange jumper is good Ginia Tech has also done a really good job in the last couple of possessions on the offensive boards no doubt about it one of the best teams in the ACC on the offensive glass here this season its been a common theme for them even in the losses theyve done a nice job on the boards need to Thomas three ball that one no Florida State 0 for five from Beyond The Arc but theyre not a great threepoint shooting team they only get about 24 of their points from out there their team thats got to attack in train transition and take the ball inside Rodney Brown no on the three thats not Virginia Tech basketball Bowen left his feet was able to find a teammate now Watkins three ball launch that one short rebound hokes Jaden young Mike young young would like to see some ball movement and player movement the Florida State Defense is making the Virginia Tech pass team they tur him into dribblers that three ball is knocked down Jaden Youngs having himself a first half couple of threepointers and hes a guy again shooting under 30 in ACC play coming in but hes looked very comfortable tonight oh my need to Ill advised shot hokes by 17 Applause potit oh foul from Music behind how about Virginia Tech leading by 17 a hoki team and potit thats the first time really hes touched the ball on the offensive end tonight elij potit the 69 graduate senior started his career at Rice knocks down the free throw 25 Dan is the season low for Florida State in a game for a first half so far on the year theyve got 13 right now its been a struggle for the nolles again they have not been able to use their defense to get out in transition and when they have had the setup in the half court offense theyve just been impatient the ball hasnt moved the way normally you see Leonard Hamiltons teams move the ball shooting 19 here in this first half its a 122 run from the h iies to open this thing up Davis 10 on the clock Watkins attacks goes down throws it away turnover heres young Hammond at that free throw line area hell Retreat on the attack Hammond lost it D trying to pick it up turnover for Virginia Tech he got in there out of control you cant do that against this Florida State team wide open three Watkins that one not going to fall you it lay up first points of the game from Malik Music Yan very good play by Florida State to stay after it again an early shot but Yan was able to get the rebound what do you want to see here from the hopes to end it well I mean theyve got to move the ball timeout taken by Virginia t were going to Quick a take a quick breather be right back Music Music 132 seconds for Virginia Tech theyve got the ball taking a timeout it is a use it or lose it what do they try to draw up W what they what theyre trying to do here is theyve had a couple of possessions recently where theres been too much dribbling and theyve lost the ball because of the dribbling if youre going to dribble against Florida State you got to be going somewhere you got to be trying to create something move the players move the ball and youre trying to get the last shot now its seven young five jayen young 4 three he going to fire away from Deep bed in banked it in oh Dan boner its been that kind of half for the hes they Le by 20 I dont think thats what Mike Young Drew up but accustom to seeing Florida State have well Florida State averages almost nine steals a game they have two they average almost six blocks a game they have one get a block that time thats Pos first basket of the game yeah potit just drops it in on the floater its his first field goal attempt of the game 3715 and a foul thats his first fou of the game got his moneys worth there and you know you dont want your big guy to commit a foul 5050 ft from the 50 ft from the basket got four points and three rebounds what adjustments do you want to see from Florida State here in this half I think they have to be a little more patient on offense youve got to get better ball movement and you got to get the ball inside everyone had an ocean to get inside that it ripped away nlls do recover Thomas thats not the shot theyre looking for the offensive rebound and then losing you got to take that ball right back up where you got to kick it out Hammond theres a block theres the block shot and thats what your risk when you drive the ball all the way against Florida State bbo in top five in the league in blocks per game this season another turnover Florida State well Davis had you on alone inside and didnt see him and what happens is when your big guys work hard and get open inside they dont get the ball they tend to get frustrated shoot Watkins picks his pocket NOS want to run in transition Watkins stripped itll go out of bounds great recovery defense there from Johnson I think I think Johnson didnt realize that he could have stepped back in bounds and picked up the ball the only time youre not allowed to do that is if you intentionally go out of bounds and I think he could have stepped back in and picked up the ball he didnt realize it freshman did a nice job though of preventing Florida State an easy bucket now the nolles will have to work in the half court theyve struggled so far here tonight Watkins musling his way in no tap back is there for bbo and when Watkins draws that much attention on the inside somebody is going to have offensive rebounding opportunities nice job by Bow leard H and credited B bow and is improving his jump shot especially from Beyond The Arc this season the athleticism there for the sophomore reclassified and came to Florida State as a 17yearold one season ago continuing to develop potit has one bucket here in this half that hello Toby Lal and when you when you draw the defense just like down on the other end here you draw the defense somebodys available for an offensive rebound and that was spectacular the has a near 50in vertical Bowen there it is that improved threepoint jump shot spot up shooter thats the first three made for Florida State well bow shoots 46 from out there in conference play and that was a contest to three Johnson did a pretty nice job running at him I thought the Florida state guards cannot dribble the ball so much they got to move it and is nine of Florida States 20 points in the game pull up jumper fading away to twoo strong B and getting active in the second half for the seminal Davis Watkins three count it backto back triples Florida state within 16 and lets see if that success on offense generates a little bit more pressure by the Florida State Defense lots of times you know scores couple of score a couple of baskets and suddenly you play harder on the defensive end Applause Ohs looking for energy shoot open three Nope off to the right ball goes out of bounds itll stay with the hokes all right Dan boner you like highflying dunks we got one for you this is created here because Watkins goes over to help out doesnt really help out but doesnt block out laow and laow comes in and just dunks over everybody M didnt pick up basketball till he was 16 years old a native of London told me his favorite soccer team was Manchester United I think Tottenham Arsenal Chelsea fans just grimaced as Watkins drives Banks it in you take a bad shot and that was a bad shot by Johnson you cant force things when you force things the other it gives Florida State an opportunity to get out and go 80 Run for the nolles to try and get in a touching distance of the hes before this First Media timeout in the second half nice Cut shoot had it deflected will they call a foul they Applause do Mike young actually asking for them to check if it was goal tending as Music well here in this half Florida State made six total shots from the floor in the first half they made made four of them here in the second half and they four for their last four they scored 15 points in 20 minutes and here they scored 10 in less than five Jaden shoot a good free throw shooter at 78 on the year doesnt get there a ton only attempts 19 and 20 the transfer from duke finally healthy well you dont expect a guy named shoot to be driving the ball to the basket here Virginia Tech trying to change the tempo just a little bit applying some pressure to Florida State Jackson back in there for the NES Lal against Watkins you Davis wrap out turnover was intended for yan yan I think had the chance to drop down in the low post and stop so when they threw him the ball he was covered had he been in the low post it would have been a different store heres shoot Dan who needs to get it going for Virginia Tech now in this half well they just need to I mean they had how many guys eight guys score in the first half they have to do it by committing potit no l how did he get that ball to put back hes fouled he snagged that onehanded well again nobody blocked him out this is a situation where everybodys looking at the ball nobodys looking he got that onehanded he took it away from Yan but I mean if Toby lawall is in the area you got to turn your head you got to look you got to block that guy out now laal is not a great free throw shooter under 70 right around 65 in confidence Applause play that one rattles out our coverage of ACC gymnastics continues this Sunday afternoon as number eight Cal squares off against 21st ranked NC State at Reynolds Coliseum in R coverage beginning at four Eastern one Applause Pacific well able to knock that one down but see if youre Florida State and youre going to amount of comeback Arya its unlikely that the comeback is going to look like a 20 to nothing run youre going to make a little run and then junor Tech can score a few points and thats thats fine but you cant do things like this you cant turn it over Lal on the attack blocking foul Davis cant believe it well thats the kind of a charging foul that has disappeared from our game you have to have your legal guarding position established before the Airborne player plants the last foot prior to leaving the floor and clearly that was not the case and Davis better be careful here hes looking up at the screen and hes gesturing toward toward the referees about the replay and you got to be real careful youre not supposed to be able to do that last thing they need is a technical Applause foul wild back at the line that one rattles out up so you look up at the screen and you start gesturing toward the referee youre asking for Applause trouble its been a frustrating night so far for Florida State the Hokies have come to play L while this is another it ends up being a good foul anyway SOI struggled against Clemson from the line Watkins physical Drive no foul called but stepping out of bounds Johnsons heel was on the in line now Watkins the last couple of times hes trying to do it by himself you know that time he went into a big crowd Florida stayed fortunate to keep the ball now Watkins has had a very good statistical season and Florida State would really be in trouble without him but he cant do everything himself other guys have to get involved Watkins double team came to Dan He fires a three short rebound loal low head of steam towards the basket theyre letting them play wow that was that was a one on four thats thats not a good idea ever dang from the other Corner that one no a foul called on this side of the court its going to be on Tyler Johnson pushing off I think that was H that went flying out of the picture that is Johnsons first foul the teams second here of the half while po are going to get a breather now Mike young is doing a great job using his players Off the Bench Virginia Tech Team amongst the leaders in the ACC and bench points especially in conference play count it and one thats holds hell go to the line for the bonus thats a really good job by Florida State to find hold inside and if youre Rex Steiner youre too late just get away I mean just I mean theres nothing you can do just get away dont give the referee the chance to blow the whistle thats one of the few times that Florida state has been able to catch the Virginia Tech defense out of position oh free throw got the home bounce andever the threepoint play what were seeing now Florida State still chipping away and there was 20 points at Applause halftime going to pick up the defense R Steiner young guarded by Jackson young takes Florida States guard to the rim kick out now brown six on the shot clock asking for a screen its set gets the switch against Malo Brown contested shot blocked Florida State basketball at its finest Hull now looking to lead the break attacks that one no he was fouled and itll go to the line for two more Brown had an opportunity to pass it to Jaden young who was open for a threepointer young you just cant see him off to the right of your screen but hes wide open young elects to go up against maluk and maluk is 6 11 thats a bad Applause idea knocks down the first free throw hes got four in this game Aon oo at seven against Stanford in the ns last contest brought in to be a veteran a steady presence for Florida St in their back Court Virginia Tech shooting only two for 10 in this have three for six from the free throw line to 12point lead yeah Florida States held Virginia Tech without a field goal from the floor in over four minutes near steel there Florida sa ratcheting up the pressure the hes need a Applause bucket FSU chipping away on its home court trimmed it to 12 young against alir Malo Rex Steiner Rising fire three yes sir thats a big shot for rein thats a huge shot boy the H he needed that to call in the Seas lead back to 15 C Baseline Drive flips dang attacks slays it in the seminal missed a couple of those in the first half and now I mean the hes are having a tough time getting the ball in back talked about the Hokey turnover struggles they did a nice job against Clemson in their last matchup only 10 of them in that game relatively speaking only six so far here tonight now seven Jackson attacks eurostep lays it in transition for Florida State as close as theyve been in a while hokey lead down to 11 you cannot make lazy passes against this Florida State team Mike young has talked about winning basketball for the hopes can you make the plays necessary to win games down the stretch well the NS have energy on their home court outscoring Virginia tacked by nine here in the second half there within 11 third this will be the fourth and fifth free throw of this half so its its been a totally different game for Florida State Jackson first free throw rattles home and you talk about Dan to come back how its not going to come in a wave of a 20 run but free throws also stop the clock as you try and get those bonus ones at the line Virginia Tech has missed some opportunities at the line Virginia Tech theyre in a situation now where theyre taking some tough shots that last shot by Rex Stein was really you know a tough floater with all those long arms in there this Florida State team the closest theyve been in single digits since late in the first Applause half GRE Steiner hit a big shot moments ago when the hes needed a basket Virginia Tech in need of another one here the first thing you need is a good shot Burnham takes Deng inside turning angling thats a tough one there no Lal offensive rebound kick out Brown wants to three calls his own number that one no rebound NOS if you have to step in like that you need to pass the ball again Jaden young whos made three threes was all alone what a leap by wall I mean head is at The Rim my goodness he just jumped over everybody Mike young called him the most athletic player hes ever coached re Steiner on his pivot foot finds loal the veteran against the youngster on the attack floater no offensive rebound Lal sticks it back no hes going to the line well the wall is really doing some work on the offensive boards now however he needs to convert from the free throw line and he has not done that effectively here in the second half hes only one for four he has turned it up on the glass no doubt and that energy level the hogies want to snap a three game skid they might be on the backs of the outstanding 68 junr from England who started his career at VCU want to remind you tomorrow 10 Eastern after our womens basketball double header the nothing but net crew break down the night in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every womens game and look ahead the best matchups on the schedule for the weekend weve got you covered all season right here on acc Network and the ESPN Appia Tech leaving a lot of at the free throw line specifically lals leaving it there Ls leaving it there L now two of six after he went two of eight against Clemson over the weekend has struggled with the three WIS dang three ball oh missed everything now dangs a threepoint shooter youll take that shot 4636 Brown Yo stat B the glass note rebound Malo again that is an incredibly tough shot heres Hol with Watkins set to check in on the next dead ball Davis B Bowen great deflection there for burn both Yan and Watkins come back into the game for Music FSU just look at the discrepancies between the first half and the second half W Florida state is getting better shots and theyre getting better shots because their defense is generating easier opportunities and theyve made a couple of Threes well this is the longest pause here for substitut I think that Ive ever seen Thomas in for Jerry day lets see if they get Yan involved the seminal thats why PO is back in the game try to go over the top B Bowen Out jumped a pair of hookies to get it Davis with three got to get something going hes tripped up foul calls thats a tough break for the hokes they played great defense for 28 seconds you got to play it for 30 and this is a situation where Davis just takes advantage steps in between and who did they call that foul on was it l or was it on Hammond it looks like I think to 11 could have been either one but again Davis thats what you have to do you have to be aggressive one more foul for the hes and NOS are at the BNS and theyre a very good free throw shooting team Thomas finger roll lays it in it rattles H NOS with hit eight Applause again its the Florida State Defense that has given them a chance Jia attack one for their last 12 the NOS Defense Forces almost a near turnover back into shos hands potit patient foul calls hes going to the line but shoot is not their primary ball handler and they really got away with one with him trying to handle it out there and this is a situation where Florida State doesnt care if they fou you those big guys are all going to go after the the block shot and theyre going to put Virginia Tech on the line and the hokes the pressure is on them to Applause convert on the year potit 74 big man has four points three rebounds knocks down the first this is what youre looking at we talked about the Florida State Defense really tightening up and Virginia Tech has paid the price and its not just I mean they havent turned the ball over that much but theyre just really having a hard time getting things going because of that pressure and they miss another free throw no doubt theyve left the door open for Florida State Watkins will go to the line thats a blocking foul on shoot and thats seven on the Hoke so a one and one and how impressive by Florida State they got that Miss off the free throw line and they were down the court really fast and again Virginia Tech just didnt recover in time and shoot against Watkins is a mismatch much in favor of Florida State nobody in the ACC goes to the line more times than jir Watkins yeah but he hadnt been there tonight Im sure he has not and he missed the free throw and so Virginia Tech now catches the play ball to the hokes rushes to the balles from Shoot crosses the timeline Johnson against Davis potit against Watkins double team comes po great work good footwork and he lays it in po has really good hands on the inside he caught that one in traffic thats a place where Virginia Tech might be able to go B bow and wide open for three and he knocks it down you give him that much time and space now were going to get a foul against Thomas and again thats a foul youll take youre trying to pressure Virginia Tech and this is situation where nobodys guarding Bowen and he has all day to line that one up he got 12 to lead florid State at 20 set his career high a couple of games ago its come a long way for FSU now in his second season Johnson against Watkins ball dribbled off Watkins leg out of bounds itll stay with the hopes Tyler Johnson is played very well but you dont want Tyler Johnson handling the ball against pressure mentioned the foul trouble for Virginia Tech there with the Nolls being in the bonus one more foul on FSU and Virginia Tech te will also be shooting in the Bon what a great job by Bowen to recover he had fallen down but he got right back into play now the turnover leads to an easy bucket its not what Virginia attack wanted its not going to show up anywhere in the stat sheet but Bowen made that play and the energy continues to amp up at the top Hammond kick shoot Johnson ball fake attack Johnson to the rim ball fake kick out Hammond steps back three ball in the air yes sir its a big shot for the one they call Mighty Applause Mouse Dave Jackson Virginia Tech strength coach coins Hamond that the smallest guy on the court but so quick so jacked a warrior in the weight room he was also shooting 19 from three in conference play prior to that shot a foul on the floor there and an old back in the bonus ninepoint Advantage for the ois Hammond 19 and the other thing theyve been doing theyve been driving the ball to the basket and theyve been getting to the free throw line B Bowens led the charge for FSU hes now got 12 points eight rebounds as he gets closer to another double double his third of his career Davis was fouled before he went to break so this is a one and one and he misses that one so the NOS have now missed a couple front ends of one and on you if that ball goes high in the air laow is getting its all his hes nearing a double double himself hes got 11 rebounds and eight points Kobe laah Rex Steiner into the hands of Johnson on the attack kick shoot at the elbow deflected recovers five on the clock got to get something up against Yan turns faces fires yes thats a big basket Jaden shoot burying the three that is his third here tonight hes got 11 the lead back into double figures here for the hogus if youre Flor to State you keep chipping away Applause b b finds some space and dunks it home Watkins is really having a hard time getting around Johnson but that time nobody was around B Bowen and he was able to pick up the ball Tyler Johnson is Task usually for Virginia Tech especially of late with taking the opposing teams best player at the guard position done a nice job on Watkins tonight Rex Steiner under six to play looking for a good shot La three ball yes sir oh Toby Lal big time three now he shoots over 50 from out there in conference play now he steals it on the attack foul and coun Toby laow a boost of energy for the hokes here on the road wow that was some play some sequence by laow he makes the three and then he I mean hes as I said hes stronger than he looks but he just powered that one to the basket and how he ended up getting that ball and being able to break away at half court was really amazing hes very athletic hes got his fourth double double of the season five games in a row in double figures as well hes had some incredible performances this season the double double against NC State stands out as one that time the free throw good and everything counts now here to try and end this game for the Hops Jackson good defense again from Virginia T has to flush it out Watkins contested jumper wow thats good defense and better offense that is some play right there Watkins has nine po oh turnover thats a bad one Johnson couldnt hang on it was thrown to his feet well this is what Watkins does this is why hes one of the best players in the conference that is really good defense and speaking of Defense the Florida State Defense I mean every time Virginia Tech caught the ball they fumbled it around it was just a matter of time till they threw it out of bounds now theyve got to dig in on the defensive end Davis finds himself open for three and he knocks it down all three of those for the Freshman Florida State closes the Gap to 11 Applause they just switch everything and their big guys can stay with smaller Applause guys Malo trying to go for the ball a while kept the dribble alive somehow Reiners got to be ready to shoot that one re Steiner on Jackson ball on the deck two one out the buzzer fading off the rim no offensive rebound John Applause but Virginia Tech looks frantic out there on offense you just have to take a deep breath leth offensive rebound for the hopus shoot threw it away well youre not going to throw it over the head of B Bowen Jackson Alo Malo throws it down NOS back within single digits I mean it just looked like shoot thought the ball BS a hot potato he had to get rid of the thing about the effort from the Music luk theyre shooting 36 so their shooting hasnt dropped off that much theyve turned the ball over and Florida state has just been really much more effective on the offensive end and those have definitely played better here in the second half theyre outscoring Virginia Tech 37 26 here in this second stand that theyre on a 70 run got to give the Hoke some credit theyve been able to hit some timely shots to save off some big runs from FSU thats whats allowed them to be up nine here with about 348 left to play and now this is closing time something Hokies have struggled with here this season a young basketball team learning how to win its been better from a playbyplay performance over the last couple games can they CL it here tonight maluk fouls L hell go to the line want to remind you that our coverage of ACC gymnastics continues this Sunday afternoon as number eight Cal squares off against number 21 NC State at Reynolds coverage begins at 4 Eastern one Pacific so here we are back at the free throw line one one thats a big free throw for Lal now every moment matters here for the hes down the stretch Mike young said look the intentions are good were playing hard the kids want to make plays we just havent been able to string together enough winning basketball to be able to come out on the positive end of one of these well the Hokies have certainly played hard tonight they they they havent theyve sort of been panicky a few times but Florida State Defense just swarms you miss that one Johnson able to chase down another offensive rebound loose ball picked up by the hes and theyre going to call a foul those were looking to try and tie it up for the jump ball and that time that time shoot is was very strong with the basketball see youre just you just youre not going to throw it over the top of these guys theyre all 6 10 and they jump really well and you just have to hang on to that ball and be strong with it shoot as you mentioned the guy who rarely goes to the free throw line its two for two though tonight has 11 points important contributions from Jaden here for Mike young tonight that free throw will go down caught the front iron M sh has made some big baskets hes made all his field goals have been threes got a couple of assists injury play career that kept him out last year couldnt play for Duke in the regular season didnt play nearly didnt play for nearly two years yeah and if shoot and other hokeys have looked a little discombobulated tonight against this Florida State Defense that is not uncommon Davis Florida state does that to a lot of people but theyve the Hokies have done a great job hanging in there and being tough Applause has been easy for Mike young this season right you lose sha padulla to all Miss is a foul on Yan Lin kid goes to Miami niichel goes to Vanderbilt yeah you can try and put some pieces together and they have gotten some nice pieces but its not easy to put in this transfer portal nil era of trying to find teams that have cohesive play and have been together for many years well thats the story of college basketball and the teams that have done it successfully you can know who they are theyre the ones who are at the top of the rankings now Applause but Yuan that was a very bad foul by Yuan Yan is a guy whos known as somebody whos quick enough to stay in front of a guard and that time he just didnt move his feet and when you reach from behind the officials are going to call that a foul every time wow another offensive rebound for Virginia Tack and Lal hyped up as he sticks it back in what a night for Toby Lal they just they just cant keep him off the offensive board 17 and 12 for the VCU transfer Jackson three ball off to the left Second Chance coming for B Bowen he flips it no rebound Virginia Applause Tech well great response by the hokes they theyve scored six in a row stretch the lead back to 15 able to make plays finding ways to get the big rebounds right make the extra pass dont commit a foul hit the big timely shot thats been missing in the last couple of contests really for much of the Season cherry on top potit flushes it what a great pass by low you know he was trapped inside and before he forced it up he took a look and here he found his teammate cutting along the Baseline very spirited shoot around today for Virginia Tech as Davis able to knock down a three timeout from Florida State theyll try and set something up but Mike Youngs hokes are less than two minutes away from finding their first win in for nolles have done better in the second half good offensive half for the nolles but Virginia Tech timely shots late looks like theyre going to ice this one away well you dont have to make all your shots but you got to be tough and make the shots you need to and Virginia Tech what a response oo big time block L couldnt believe there was no foul down here to our right b b Bowen see numerous NES on the deck Taylor B Bowen at midcourt he was shot to the face and he is bleeding he was trying to trap Hammond and Hammond scooted through and I think he just tripped and fell I I the ball went past him and I didnt look I didnt really see what happened but thats some block by Watkins that was indeed in a phenomenal block from jir Watkins B Bowen slow to get up went crushing and crashing to the wood I I think he fell on his head hes trying to trap oh he he ran into Thomas Justin Thomas his head collided with Thomass shoulder I hope hes okay 14 points for him here tonight nine rebounds there one a few bright spots for Florida State in a game in which offensively just the first half really shut the noes completely down for making a comeback in this one well and now what youre left with if youre Florida State youre down 14 you have a minute 43 youre going to foul to try to get back in the game and this I mean its a twoot foul now because were in double bonus for both teams but Tyler Johnson in ACC plays only a 50 free throw Applause shoot knocks down the first Johnson with a solid six points and six rebounds overall on the season hes at 78 but this is an ACC game so he makes one of two he held true to that average timely offensive rebounds for Johnson when the hes had to have it Virginia tack up 15 Jack you cant take a lot of time if you state fires thats a three they needed and another timeout here by Leonard Hamilton were going to quickly step aside well be back 30 seconds Hoke hes up 12 Music and now for tonights player the game brought to you by healthcaregov it is how can it be anyone other than Toby l my goodness third double double in his last five games 17 and 12 timely buckets for Virginia Tech tonight he really had a stretch in that second half where he took over on the glass and put the nles away wow he has six offensive rebounds most of those coming in the second half and those six offensive rebounds I thought were critical in a situation where Virginia Tech was having problem score Music and now whats going on Watkins is over at the bench like is being taped up hes bleeding to be the Music case what a hokey team who has struggled on the road the last couple of seasons including this one Mike young said weve got to be better away from Castle Virginia Tech so good at home but you see the numbers on the road this would be a much needed Victory away from Blacksburg well theyre close but the the victory isnt in the bag yet no doubt 125 to play first thing you have to do is get the ball in bounds and Florida State makes that extremely difficult Virginia attack led by his many he is 22 early in this second half the nos cut it down to six and Virginia Tech s has moved it back up to double digits now at 12o advantage and Hammond will go to the line and Hammonds pretty good free throw shooter but thats thats if youre Florida state that is the only strategy that you can employ you try to get the turnover and then if you cant get it then you foul as quickly as possible I think theyre looking to see who the foul who committed the foul or are they looking at a clock thing might be a combination of both Dan Music Bon theres no question about the guy who needs to go to the free throw line man SMU and Cal fans were thinking perfect therell be no issue getting to our game now well hold on it was a clock issue well were being told that the clock froze so Leonard Hamilton would like the clock to freeze and Virginia Tech wants the clock to move faster but so now the officials have to figure out how much time should really be there you know Mike young is out at Mid Court talking to his players Jus pfield is telling him no you cant do that you know if you want to talk to your team have your team come over to the bench youre not supposed to be out at Mid court now lonard Hamilton is going to call his guys over Im actually surprised that it took the coaches so long to get the guys over all right so here the clock on the right in the right hand it freezes at 23 so now they got to figure out how much time elapsed and theyve determined it was 4 seconds so those 4 seconds might be critical Hamond gets the roll and now if youre Florida State you dont need to take a three but the only way I think youre going to make up this margin if youre going to foul is you have to trade three for two or now you dont you know you can you can get two youre trying to chop into the lead and if you get a three I think you take it Watkins couldnt get the two rebound Virginia attch yous got to foul right away Hammond oh boy he just speeds right by everyone Watkins blocked it up against the backboard but gold end the call well that might be enough and this this is a Virginia Tech just really toughed this out in the second half no doubt about it as Dangs three will go down that is some shot right there turns the deficit to 12 Virginia Tech hes got a road game at Virginia and then SMU and then at Notre Dame those are the next three the Hokies who actually play five of their next seven on the road Mike young just trying to get things back on track this season 3 and six in the ACC pois to go to four Six has him in the season I think the hes were hoping for theyve had a lot of adversity off seon moving into the season a young roster but a win like this you never know right away from home then you play a Virginia team on the road at the jpj that should be a heated rivalry as well boy theyve had some great great battles over the last few years especially for at least tonight the H are going to feel good going back missed free throws and disappointment for Florida State continues itll be a threegame losing streak as Thomas cant connect from Beyond The Arc offensive rebound no will try another one Jackson steps into it no then a free rebound three chances for the noes as H lays it in 10point Advantage leard Hilton timeout and and Virginia Tech they havent played a perfect basketball game tonight by any mean but they have been tough enough when they needed to be and even on that situation they gave up a basket off an offensive rebound but there were so many rebounds that their defense was good enough that it your your friend here is the block and they got a lot of time to expire there Davis has fouled out of this one for Florida State talked about Virginia Tech what Im coming for Florida State it felt like a stretch that they had some opportunities at wins right some at home at Boston College Notre Dame its going to be disappointing after that things start to pick up you get wake Clemson Miami well Boston College always plays very well at home they bunch of tough guys theyve had tough time this season the general they play very well at home and then you have to play Wake Forest on the road and Wake Forest has really had a good season now that tough loss to Duke but the deakes are another one of those teams that play really really well at home so theres theres only a 310 of a second difference between the shot clock and the game clock the Hokies dont even have to shoot this Music one little over 30 seconds left oh still fouling here down 10 and theyre fing Tyler Johnson who we mentioned in ACC play a 50 free throw shooter and tonight hes two out of five from the line he just missed two Johnson had an outstanding game earlier this season a cow double double 11 points 12 rebounds and here tonight against Florida State just some timely boards as you see what is upcoming for the hopes and a chance there for Virginia Tech to get some wins on their schedule too d three ball front iron stay with FSU last Touch by the hes it was l in shoot here tonight 17 for L shoot had 14 Jaden young with nine big points and it was a big first half Virginia Tack and they ride that Florida St continues make some baskets late its an eightpoint deficit Thomas nearly steals it that she calling for a review I had a problem with the clock and now they fixed it 168 you just hold it there and the reason I say that is theres 16 seconds left in the game and theres no 5 seconds for closely guarded in the back court and Virginia Tech has three timeouts so technically now Florida States not going to let them do that theyre going to foul but technically you just throw the ball to shoot for example because hes a great free throw shooter and let him hang on to it and as you approach 10 seconds you call a timeout and if you call a timeout you get another 10 seconds shoot continues his strong night his career high 17 against NC State hes got Music 15 sophomore from Yorkville Illinois Jackson Watkins Baseline Drive hop step and a kick Thomas three off to the left rebound a while a beast on the boards here tonight and Virginia Tech snaps a three game skid Mike Youngs 400th career Victory congrats to coach the Hoke win by 10 damp on him
