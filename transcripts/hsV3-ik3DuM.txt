by 36 points so trying to Rebound in every facet of the game here tonight against the pit Panthers and we are set for the opening tip we underway and the Panthers take Applause it hand off here for Carlton Carrington well call him bub for the rest of the night he will be referred to as bub or little Bub little Bub kick into the corner the shot on the way and too strong by Austin only makes about 31 pit having a lot of trouble making shots period arent they they absolutely are and you hear the booze already as Judah Minch touches the basketball a little something against Judah here on this floor already with the zoo be a kick here in the opening seconds just getting underway Syracuse was badly outrebounded by North Carolina over the weekend 5330 and talking with red ay the head coach he he felt like they had to get out of the gate quickly they didnt do that against Carolina they got punched right in the face and he said that they didnt respond its the first time this season that they didnt really come out with that same level of competitive fire that they played with all season long a start a good start is important for the oranges here tonight there Bell has been shooting it well gets it off to Mintz Mintz averaging 19 a game got up in the air got it downstairs for the Slam by Malik Brown great recognition by Jud de as he gets into the painted area seeing three yellow jerseys around him knowing he was going to have Malik ground open under the basket among the starters for the pit Panthers one of the sevenfooters g o Diaz Graham his brother Jorge also up around 7even Ft slamming on the braks here is low The 63 Freshman shot Off the Mark by Diaz Graham his first effort tonight and youve got a starting freshman back court for the third straight game for the Panthers as ishma leot will come off the bench again after missing the Louisville game with an injury Bell will swing it Starling a pull up pop and nothing but net and youve got the of course sophomore back court for the orange so its not as though this is a truly experienced group on either side but the one guy with experience is the guy with the basketball Blake Henson the Panthers need him to get going through well hes the top scorer for the pit Panthers one of the top scorers in the conference number four overall at 18 a game also five rebounds and could be deadly Beyond a threepoint line getting inside Hinson the 67 senior for his first bucket and they wait for the first field goal not first points because free throws dont matter to the zoo they throw the confetti after the first field goal tell you what foul shots May matter a lot in this game they did in the first meeting which Syracuse won 81 73 and pit missed 11 of 24 foul shots and pit did a great job here getting the basketball in the hands of Henson but more importantly allowing Henson to see it go through early and of course the confetti flies from the zoo Im not sure if you want the zoo throwing confetti though that could be uh dangerous to many of the animals yes dont feed the animals whatever you do especially paper exactly mence thought about the three hell take the midrange he cant hit it Hinson with the rebound and here comes the pit Panthers talented Jaylen L The 63 Freshman on of Missouri City Texas hes a coachs son and thats going to be a nice tip up and in by Diaz gra on follow and the Panthers lead the ACC with over 13 offensive rebounds per game however they have not had that level of rebounding in conference play Bell yes sir a threepointer on the M thats a mistake a short close out against Chris Bell he can knock down to three ball and he has a little something to say to the uh front row the big money seats over here on his way back down the floor thats been done before in this building between these two schools oh we got a lot of history between these two schools and well show you some of that tonight if youve missed it a swing by Carrington all the way to Hinson got it with a triple five early points for Hinson great ball mve but thats what Jeff capable talked to his team about theyve struggled to shoot the basketball in the first half against North Carolina and against Duke in their last two home games a much better start here tonight Blake Henson number two for pit Panthers foul here so this will go the other way with 1635 to go in the first Applause half ball movement and Bell just able to raise up Austin with his hand down and then you see the great ball movement for the Panthers Jaylen low attacking the Baseline finding Carrington Carrington with the extra pass to Henson was able to knock down to three and weve got a 77 game which the number seven of course is always going to be important with this matchup maybe one of the best players to ever put on a Syracuse uniform War the number seven in the NBA H stops that forced it up there Diaz GR comes up with it Austin down the lane will lay it in took the hit hell be at the line for a threepoint play offensive rebound once again for the Panthers turns into Second Chance points the second time Diaz Graham is able to come up with the offensive board this time he drops the dime to Austin cutting down the paint who was able to finish through the contact an opportunity for the n one 67 Austin slicing in hell be at the line where he 77 Jeff cable about to go to the bench ishma leet 63 Jr to report in its actually their leading rebounder and hes their smallest guy that they play listed as 62 but hes not sure hes that tall when you think about the other guards who are with low Carrington are even taller but Leed is the leading rebounder 58 for the Panthers and that was one of the concerns for Jeff Cap this summer was did they have a dominant rebounder they do not but theyve done it as a committee one of the reasons why they lead the AC and rebounding but they need that to happen in conference play well they do have 611 feder Rico feder Rico in the game he just committed his first foul so back to Syracuse heuse mins 19 points per game and batted away tight defense but Syracuse will have it when we come back 1555 to go just under away pit and Syracuse big one for both of them tonight year Jerry mamero was there Jerry said coming in here to the Pete always brings back great memories because Syracuse was the first team to win in this building when it opened up it was Syracuse it was Jerry mcnamer and Carmelo Anthony Hakeem war that group together was the first team to ever come in here and beat the Panthers in this building and and it was an overtime game der Max said the score was like 49 to 48 he said it was a rock fight a rock fight they they got it done but great memories in this building between these two schools mince off the window cant hit it a lot of great finishes here here or at the Dome between the two leg shredding everybody and the reverse what a beautiful shot there ishma leet the junior for two great job by Leed attacking the painted area Taylor swishes in a twopointer confident shot by Justin Taylor had to shot the basketball nearly as well as the shooter that he is a very good shooter but has done everything else for the orange good sign for him to see it go down early throws it away OB is that exactly what what uh Jeff C talked to us about how great Malik Brown was knocking the basketball away when theyre trying to feed the center coming up with deflections Brown as well as Judah Min are tied for the lead the ACC at steals per game Starling over the shoulder and boy it hung on that iron forever but would not drop and Coach Gable was very very impressed by that shot wont go for hon another offensive rebound and a whistle and a foul says Ted Valentine 11 to n to Panthers isma legett driving it to the rim the nice side around Jud to be able to finish on the reverse layup and on the other end the help allows Justin Taylor to be able to line it up and knock it down another assist for Judah minz and its been better shooting on this floor than weve seen in the past two games for the Panthers and their opponent to start it off indeed Zach Austin gives it up hon off the fake another fake finds the open man fed Rico cant dunk it P Rico looked back to see where the defender was instead of just going up and dunking that allowing Justin Taylor to affect his shot tough drive and a tougher shot by Judah minz Judah minz will not be denied he gets down hill as well as anyone in the league leads ACC with 137 free throw attempts so hes going to stay in attack mode the entire game gets to the line he can be very creative doing it Carrington cant hit the mark Judah 33 against LSU had 28 against Cornell so hes had some big scoring games had 21 rather quietly over the weekend against Carolina yeah everything it was so loud as to what Carolina was doing in that building you and I were there its hard to notice anything that happened with the or syracus is at every starter score so far loose ball in the Baseline but here copelan comes out of it he had 16 against Carolina heres Taylor again he thought he got fouled on the play but no whistle of course hes going to hear that from the zoo you come into this building youre always going to have to contend with the Oakland Zoo and they are locked in early car to the swing hson lets fly another a loose ball into the lane PTO Rico again the effort to save it there by Malik Brown with 1304 left in the first half red ay year number one as the head coach at Syracuse he started 116 games for Jim beheim and the early 90s was Jims assistant and now in year one replacing the only head coach Syracuse had known for 47 years and red oy told us prior to the game his turnaround in his career came in this building well forgive me not in this building at Pittsburgh didnt play here at in this building at the time but had a big game at Pitt that really changed the trajectory of his career during his Junior season a double double 31 points 10 assists for red Kyle cuff coming off the bench spins in two pit getting a little chilly here in keeping with the weather outside temperatures are in the Applause teens low to drive it and kick Austin swings it like it couldnt be more open took a dribble and sinks it and leged got himself together didnt catch it cleanly but had more than enough time as you said couldnt have been more open had the time to Rhythm dribble and rais up for the three ball hes off to a nice start scoring it the Junior from Maryland its a good sign for pit because he was two for 10 the first time these schools met ke outside under 12 minutes to go in the opening half JJ Starling looking to make a move on Leed and threw it away the defense locked him up that time and he turned it over its celebrated by the bench as tim2 Jason cap Milan Brown the assistant coaches celebrate the defensive stop as this m Leed celebrates the wide openen three at the top of the Applause key a strong initiative from Jeff cable the Pittsburgh Basketball family has been about fighting ALS of course Jeff capable II was lost to Als in November of 2017 and its been a issue for Jeff and one of the guys who has teamed up with Jeff capable on the committee to fight ALS is our own Mark Spears whose father Curtis has been battling ALS for Seven Seasons as we said a picture of Mark and his father father Curtis holding his Hall of Fame ring when Mark was inducted into the Hall of Fame and of course Jeff cable and Mark together of course with a number of other people doing the job in battling ALS seven years a a long time thats incredible it absolutely is and you know Mark talked about how Brave his father has been to fight the fight for as long as he has man that was 6 62 over 270 lb now weighs less than 100 lb he continues the battle a wonderful picture there great photo of those two by the way Syracuse picked up a point during the break they made that two by Taylor a three which it should have been and that one swish in by low looked like he had had planned for about 20 seconds yeah he knew where he was going exactly with that one and jayen low better have a good one today because his dad Marlon was supposed to leave Houston this morning at 720 local time didnt leave until after 1130 am so a late start for him so made the a big effort to be here for his sons game Jaylen better have a good one cuff can hit pit is open up a threepoint little six nothing run here and on the line Carringtons going to turn it over 1714 see jayen low getting into his bag Peter Cary with a tough assignment trying to guard low on the perimeter right there that battle was won by The Freshman guard his pops theres pops Marlin looking along checking it out Ill tell you what it took most of us a long time to travel yesterday and today the block by Carrington as he stuffed smz heres Leed beating everyone to the other end hell draw the foul almost made the shot too draws the foul on Benny Williams yeah you talked about the travel not just you and I being delayed but also the orange Syracuse had a trouble getting in didnt get in until late as we see Carrington with the block shot and then the lead pass out to leet who picks up the foul as the opportunity oh theres going to be a caller on the floor ccus battling bad weather thats nothing nothing new but its the other guys bad weather that slowed the orange down last night Obi now we see Syracuse in the zone They had played a lot of Zone throughout this season but went to it in the N game but as one very confident shooter tonight ishma leot the junior just sticking it well he was a proven scorer at Rhode Island before coming to the pit Panthers he absolutely was and Obi he missed the only win that the Panthers have in ACC play right now which they win at Louisville so you know ish lean wants to get a win under his belt cuff will get that one to go nice feathery touch most of his shots the majority are threepointers he has outstanding range yeah he absolutely does showing that he can provide that shooting stroke and Syracuse often times struggles to be able to get those threes to go from Beyond The Arc so dividing that Diaz graah with a Miss fire talk about getting up there Carrington going sky W heres the jumper by low that wont drop another offensive rebound Jeff getting involved in the mix and takes the hit and the foul against Syracuse two offensive rebounds on that possession alone and Benny Wes is going to pick up his second foul G Diz Grant unable to knock that one down but look at Bob Carrington going way up high for the first offensive rebound and then Jeffers getting involved for another one as Williams sits with those two fouls early for him seems though he just checked into the game unable to get going its five team fouls for Syracuse with 920 to go in the half low trying to make a move Hinson hson didnt catch that cleanly that was going up Diaz Graham on the back down couldnt find anybody finally does off the fake carington too strong another loose ball comes free to the orange Syracuse last year 17 wins swished in nice touch there by Starling no NCA tournament for the last two years for the orange tring to change that around under the new coach red ay and this one a very important game on the road in the conference for Syracuse tonight and thatll go against the pit Panthers OB I never got a chance to ask you you and I did the game on Saturday and Ive never asked you whats it like calling a game with your armor mod Syracuse Orange with no Jim beheim on the sideline was that your first one first time youve done that yes and its very strange and it goes back to when you were a student at new house at Syracuse University you were calling games then thats right incredibly intimidated by Jim as like a 20yearold kid but not to see him on that sideline it took all day to figure out what am I looking at I can only imagine hon the Panthers as in their previous two games here on this floor against North Carolina and against Duke have gotten a number of good looks from three to start this game started out a little bit cold thus far B up top for Judah minz Judah looking for room to operate in the paint and a whistle and a foued exactly 8 minutes left in the half they came on the air talking about both of these teams difficulty shooting the threepoint shot it is true but pit has made four out of 10 from threepoint distance and they cling to a onepoint lead as we have a timeout hit on top pennis two seconds hell get a shot off on the way got it he hit it he hit the shot Syracuse wins it I know that voice theres only one guy with the pipes to make that call that is the notorious d o thats my partner Dave OBrien on the call and that thats Jim baham look at that and Tyler renis with a magical moment right on this floor hard to believe that was 10 years ago partner it was 10 years ago was the first year of Syracuse in the ACC they started that season 25 and0 and we talked with of course red archery and Jerry mcnamer we talked them about their most important memories as a coach and they both mentioned that moment Tyler inis with that big shot right in front of you here on this floor its incredible the memories they have I know I certainly do thats a tough shot in traffic by Copeland gets it to go Copeland was ACC player of the week after a strong performance a career high performance against Pittsburgh in that that first win so hes looking to have success here once again comes up with the steal knocking that free hon got down and dirty for it heres Austin outside the three shot clock down to six here for pit Henson with the touch a Fall Away left that one short he got off to a quick start he has chilled out a little bit and a foul committed right here so hell pick it up is first 2120 Syracuse I should mention I was alongside another great partner that night when Andis hit that magical shot that was Doris Burke and it was a night very much like tonight in Pittsburgh it was wintry incredibly cold it was really snowing that night and we had a game I think the very next day at Villanova which we wind up driving to DB and OB thats the 18 right there great deal of fun Ill tell you and swished in by Chris Bell on the pullup pop Syracuse extending the lead to three and its been a lowscoring affair thus far for both these teams but we were kind of expecting this to be more of a battle coach both these coaches have talked about how their teams need to be tougher both physically and mentally throughout this game no basket there foul before that on the entry to guo Diaz Graham and they get Starling for the personal with 635 to go in the opening half and pit to inbound from the Music Baseline pit including that 8173 loss at Syracuse on December 30 now one and four in the conference also beaten by Clemson North Carolina and Duke both head coaches have taken on North Carolina and consider the tar Hills the class of the ACC right now but Duke right in there speaking again right in there ref with the basket yeah both Co head coaches have taken on both North Carolina and Duke thus far and it was split they were talking about you know hey whats the difference between those two teams but right now its really been the physical toughness and maturity of North Carolina thats kind of taken them over the top where they may give them an edge as the best team in the ACC but its close because of the way Duke can shoot the basketball they have said you know Duke had a Unreal first half here against Pittsburgh they had an unreal second half against Syracuse you called that game they were eight for eight in the second half from three it was unbelievable oh yeah I mean so they both have seen the strengths and weaknesses of both those teams Jeff C talked to us about how physical and tough North Carolina was when they came into this building playing defense the Tar Heels and they are deep theyre getting a lot of bench over the top from Malik Brown heres Applause starling off his feet heres Mintz shot clock down to three and thrown away and a deflection with 550 to go and Syracuse the inbound got to get it up two seconds to shoot it copelen sees it fires and hits it he knocks back a three thats a big b it by Copeland Jeff CER told us Copeland hadnt hit a three on the season it didnt seem like he had until he played against Pittsburgh and then of course all of a sudden he knocks on a fourpoint play in that game and his confidence has been Scot High ever since like its putting it shoulder down got too far underneath jumper on the way for Carrington no both teams getting a little bit cold after pretty quick starts Copeland on the Baseline Jeff really bottling him up he knocked it out so itll be Su ball 510 in the half and Kyle cuff back on now for sergus only 33 on the shot clock Copeland recognizing it raises up over top of leg is able to knock down three ball then let the crowd here know yo thats good mention that last game it against pit 22 and n look at the 13 of 15 from the free throw line that is ultra aggressive as Judah Miss knocks down the three ball right in front of the Panthers bench and Syracuse now extending the lead to Applause seven Copeland five so far tonight on the drive low has that one knocked away and actually lost it was off him last so this ties the largest lead tonight at seven points Applause fit advancing the NCAA tournament last year last season for the first time and since 2014 got to the second round of the NCAA tournament and thats part of the reason why the expectations were so high for Jeff capable in this Panther team this season but a lot of experience lost from this team a year ago tied up in the corner a reach and theyve got a foul on the play much younger group for Jeff capable this year as you go back and look at a season from a year ago 24 and 12 a 14 and six record in the ACC and the 14 ACC wins the most in program history Jeff capable was named the ACC coach of the year because of their exploits a season to go six team foul so both sides with six br will kick it out cup and just a little short got a good look pit trying to cut into this deficit on the spin move inside Jeffers will finish that nice cut by Jeffers to be able to get to the basket and finish it off he had a career high 10 rebounds in that game against Syracuse so will Jeffers doing a great job of giving Jeff capable minutes off the bench Copeland finds the lane little finger roll no Austin high up for the Applause rebound think its going to push it no whistle and wind up throwing it away Copeland big fast break and the Slam by Chris Bell and a timeout with 326 left in the half Syracuse with the big dunk both coaches talked about they need to take care of the basketball cannot allow other teams to get out and transition like this Seans point hits it now two for eight from the field now the AP top 10 at the moment Yukon Purdue Kansas North Carolina up to number four Duke up to number seven out of the ACC amazing to me that Kansas didnt move when you consider the fact they went lost at UCF again think they didnt move at all but good to see North Carolina in the top five but also great to hear Seth greber talking about staying a lot of bgs I can see Seth with hair back in the day dancing to bgs I kind of feel like oh you know he was a BG Saturday Night Live all the way bell bottoms and everything Carrington slamming on the brakes Hinson wants the launch he stays chilly on tip of the corner itll go the other way Syracuse ball here with three minutes left in the half and Qs trying to build on this lead of 31 24 Seven offensive rebounds already for the Panthers but they havent been able to convert many of them into Second Chance points quader Copeland very much the star the first goore round for Syracuse against pits now the Panthers using their Zone against the orange got to be able to identify where cuff is especially when youre guarding Syracuse hes the one dangerous guy open shooter boy did they move it beautifully for Bell and he drills it forgive me one of the two dangerous guys I didnt see Bell he was blocked out over there on the side on the floor but we know he could be a knock down threepoints here 25 against Colgate 20 against LSU 19 against Cornell he can get it done Kon calling out of play Federico Federico up to set the screen he gets downstairs and the pass just does doesnt get there its going to be off of Syracuse Bell by the way with 10 points hes hit his last four shots so the Bell is tolling here tonight in Pittsburgh PA were going to have a shot clock violation because that pass from Bob Carrington to feder Rico actually hit the rim so we get a shot clock reset to 20 as though as an offensive rebound low back Carrington will take the shot too strong comes out High Jud Min being very cautious with it Syracuse up by 10 on the road carry with a turnaround too strong a big rebound by Jeff yeah absolutely was going up high to get it and jeffris in the game to be able to provide defensive rebounding and some on tackle draw a foul he went in with authority his outside stuff is not fall falling so he decided to go to the 10 thats the way you get going you get to the free throw line when you get to the free throw line you get an opportunity to work on your shooting form get your confidence going back in the right direction some big games 27 against Clemson at 29 against West Virginia we have two more great college basketball matchups tomorrow night number eight Kentucky hosting Mississippi State at 7 Eastern from rup Arena and the prime time West Coast game has number 12 Arizona hosting USC at 1000 Eastern 7 Pacific on ESPN Kentucky with a tough loss over the weekend one of the other top 10 teams to lose last week conference pra bring something completely different however when youre going up against Mard tell you what in that conference the SEC kuys Conference you better keep an eye on Auburn and its shocking to me that its taken so long for many people to recognize Bruce Pearl has done a great job at Auburn for the last five seasons so Im not sure why they were so undervalued to start the year but like you I think theyre really good they are really deep and really talented got up to number 13 in the pole the whistle stops the clock at 107 so carry will pick up the personal and ay going back to his bench he bring styling back on we seeing Jeff cable play lineup that includes the three guards with low legged and Carrington on the floor so sue his two freshman point guards with the veteran transfer and leg it and Jaylen low 79 at the stripe well have another one coming and pit ter terms of field goals has gone about 2 and A2 minutes since theyve hit one at the foul line again 36 26 he makes one and two something to keep an eye on we mentioned the Panthers 11 of 24 from the free throw line and that loss at Syracuse earlier this year in a game that they held an 11point lead in the second half turnovers and Miss free throws did them in inside the final minute before halftime cant get it in transition Carrington wants the Fire In and Out Boy that was in the cylinder and a whistle Bob Carrington wondering what else can he do just putting his hands on his forehead but its still a confident shot especially for a freshman the youngest player in the ACC getting out on the break pulling up in transition but he will not be deterred youre talking about a confident young man and again if you have a triple double to start off your career the first ever game in college basketball Id be pretty confident too and youre setting the bar pretty high uh you absolutely are setting the bar very high only the second freshman the second player in ACC history to ever do it their first ever game to go alongside Dennis Scott who did it for the rambling wck of Georgia Tech feder Rico now 17 for 41 at the foul line 10point lead Syracuse trying to go into that locker room with a head of steam heres Copeland straight on and he is hit in the active shooting a three and Jeff cable can only turn away after seeing cop get fouled on another threepointer he brought up a three where copelen was able to make it and got fouled as a turning point in the game that they played on December 30th and you see Leed out contesting gets the hand but also does not allow Copeland to be able to land safely contact after that as well opland 74 at the line another look yeah see it really wasnt as much of the hand as it was not allowing him to land safely and thats three they got him three attempts at the line another one Applause coming on near hea the 611 brim protector into the game for circus he missed two of them 37 to 26 Syracuse back in the zone for what most likely will be this final possession for the only two seconds separating the shot clock and the game clock carington off to lean leged shot clock winding down and he gives it up mince mince went Airborne maybe had a little more time to do something with that but in the end Syracuse shoots their way to a 37 of 26 half time lead a little bit of conversation between Copeland and leet going off the floor but Syracuse with a strong first half here on the road looking for their first absolutely come back if they can get some shots to fall from be on the AR you figure if thats going to happen theyre going to jump on the back of number two there pit Panthers Blake Henson just two for n shooting in the first half six points came in averaging 18 and five rebounds hes got to get going he really does have to get going for the Panthers as does Bob Carrington has to get going as well as him mcram does a great job hedging the screen and roll knocks the ball away from Starling both players headed this direction my God Jim barar was was ready to take the charge over here on the sideline its good because I found a nice spot under the table theres Starlet and swishes that one in from threepoint distance Syracuse getting going again from Beyond the three leading 40 to 26 there largest lead tonight and Obie this is a talented Syracuse team its a team that is struggling to find this way at times because theyve got a lot of new pieces and of course a different style playing more manto man than they have in I would say probably the last 47 years but red archery has a talented group that when they get going and theyre sharing the basketball you see they can be successful Judah men with the ball the 64 sophomore and hell be fouled commit the foul here with 1902 to go yeah theyre going to get Malik Brown on the offensive foul on that one but on the previous possession you see Judah Mintz with the nice find to Starling whos wide open is able to knock down the three ball Judah Min sharing the basketball extremely well diming up his Applause teammates carington trying to make a move they get it back up top for Henson for Carrington a shot will not go sevenfooter will tip it and a second effort Austin gives it up and its switched in by Henson offensive rebounding is the best time to shoot the three ball the Panthers had eight offensive rebounds in the first half that they only turned into four Second Chance points but Henson gets three on there to make it pay Applause off Taylor bouncing for minz wants the paint swatted away and a whistle a foul we say in the back of the head by Diaz Graham hell pick up the personal and Obi I clearly didnt do enough research before this game to find out what it was that Judah men did to this crowd because they clearly do not like him here every time he touches the basketball theres a a chant of Boo from the Oakland Zoo sometimes when he doesnt even touch it exactly hes to the line here that by the way three fouls on gu mod Diaz Graham so hes in trouble here and Mintz at the line 79 gets to the the line a lot and makes that one so the big guys is going to have to step out and another big guy coming on Federico Federico at 611 replacing the sevenfooter when you say he gets to the line a lot more than any other player in the ACC almost plus 40 ahead of Amando Bott whos second in the ACC in free throw attempts D to MZ stays at the line 4229 the orange Austin with the tip and one to the foul two and hell be at the line well never do you want to miss a wide open layup however if youre able to get the tip in and the opportunity for the and one its worth it Austin driving the Baseline the nice skip step to be able to Avid Defenders misses it but the quick second jump allows him to get the contact from Malik Brown the put back the two points and opportunity for three at the line so Bell stepping out and so is Malik Brown who just picked up his third and Zack Austin to the stripe a 77 foul shooter and one of the three pit bigs well he plays big ranking in the top 15 in the ACC in Block shots yeah Elite blocking shots the first person since Shane Bader 20 years ago to have backto back Seasons with 60 threepoint field goals made and 60 block shots Starling kns giving the lane car cant finish it hes back in the game with three fouls pit trying to cut in that would have helped a lot feder Rico keeps it going another offensive rebound look at into way down barely got to the iron on that one but he had time to take a dribble a couple more steps in to be able to shoot that at a more reasonable rank great look for carry dribble down nothing Applause there heres Starling only 24 beyond the three Copeland in heavy traffic somehow got it back now flips it up there and catches a lot of iron and down he goes in a fou here against pit and its just a small thing but federo feder Rico unable to gather that rebound and when he doesnt get the basketball Copeland does does and forces fedo to foul him once again great ball Movement by the oranges Copeland is able to attack the basket cant get it to go but as the shot goes up you see Federico has the basketball in his hands just unable to grab it and then compounds the mistake with the Applause foul mince looking to penetrate working on Carrington Taylor finds an opening to his right but no they shut him down Carrington in transition Sweeping in hes denied so Syracuse turns the trick on the other end that was a great defensive play by JJ Starling getting back defensively and being able to deny the opportunity from Carrington without fouling you talked about Starling being on the floor three fouls for him and playing through that great job defensively without coming up with a foul on that possession and not putting Carrington at the line so pit with already three team fouls forgive me only one foul on Starling thre on Applause car Carri getting a lot of minutes here tonight yeah he was a guy that really wasnt much in the rotation wasnt that pretty that was very pretty about Copeland attacking the basket and theres something about P here Copeland and hit hes confident playing against these Panthers starting to pick up the pace here and Carri will commit the foul trying to slow down William jeffris thats Syracuse on top of pit 4432 judan coming in 19 points a game were talking about why he gets booed here at the Pete every time he touches it OB you know when you and I do a game its interactive we like to involve the fans indeed so Ive probably got 30 text messages on my phone from the time I said I didnt do enough research to wonder why they are booting booing Judah Min however Judah Min graduated from my high school oakill academy hes the oak Hiller lump I didnt remember the fact that Judah was committed to Pittsburgh and then decommitted right before the signing date reopened his Comm his his Recruitment and signed with Syracuse late that year that is the reason why he is being booed by the zoo shout out to Judas pops C for being the first to text me and let me know although many many others chimed in to remind me well he has nine points against pit so far tonight they get trying to get in and another big Stop Syracuse has done a couple of times on the last few possessions well Syracuse defense has been St especially defending the rim when the Panthers have been trying to attack off the bounce good balance for Syracuse Bell with 10 Mintz with nine Copeland is eight and Starling with seven shot clock at seven Copeland for Taylor shot clock down to two starlings got to get it up in the air did get to the iron Copeland went for the save and back over to the pit Panthers they need a run nice move with the left hand up and in by low Jaylen low The 63 Freshman Jeff capable wanting the pressure up a little further to see if they can speed up the orange and get us some Applause turnovers Williams handing off for Starling again the shot clock comes into play at five on the drive and that ones going to be swatted out of the sky by Austin Zack Austin 67 we talked about his shot blocking capability to to me attacking the B basket as you mentioned the shot blocking ability of and thats going to be an offensive foul on to the men so that wont even be a block itll be the turnover offensive on mince yes Henson steps in to take the charge red ay down on the Baseline not happy about that call fourth team foul low with a pullup got it to go back to back buckets from jayen low now attacking the basket and you see the Panthers with the pressure Syracuse looking for an answer heres Taylor shot yes sir he drills the triple the second three from Justin Taylor in this game coming talking about the fact that he hadnt shot the basketball well but it seems like everyone from Syracuse has had a little more confidence against these Panthers in the building here tonight low to the paint not this time Williams mishandled it loose ball Syracuse had an opportunity there Cen comes away with it and a tie up possession arrow will take it to the opposite end but if you see that picture alone this is getting chippy and the officials now as they start to get after it look to separate players not the first time tonight weve seen this no and the and the guys that are involved we saw having a conversation at halftime on the way to the locker room ishma leet and qu Copeland these two guys have words for each other after the halftime buzzer sounded and you see both of them in the mix of this scrm right here but we had a overhead look of that of that shot where Copeland was the one orange Jersey on the floor in the midst of five different yellow jerseys for the Panthers but Copeland had the basketball and this is what Jeff Capel was talking about they had to be tougher and you see the toughness from this was ker Copeland the toughest guy on the floor getting after the basketball going after it even though he was amongst four other yellow jerseys yeah that time it was Hinson and copelan exchanging words that was an amazing shot because quader copelan looked like he was about to be consumed by Panthers that never be fun could not be a lot of fun but here with 1337 to go the officials going to the monitor I think this is one of the areas where the veteran Ted Valentine really excels calming down teams he does an excellent job with his Crews of trying to you know take the starch out of it I agree Bill Covington Ramy Steins got a great veteran group on here tonight OB in all honesty in this game with these two teams the the way this has been played I would love for them to come away from this and say its just been a warning to all teams nothing extra because even though tempers Applause flare its going to be difficult to determine oh and we already saw the technical foul Ted Ted Valentin and I believe its actually going to be on Benny Williams I believe Benny Williams will be the one that gets that technical foul so it wont be what I wish for but hopefully does it escalate into too many players being penalized because of this and theyre looking on a monitor for anything additional here so this could take a little while to sort out its been pretty chippy and theyve been going back and forth theres been some verbal altercations as we mentioned tonight but I mean you go back I mean we talked about this this is a rivalry youre talking about going way back to the Big East and you see Henson standing over top of p copen as Benny Williams pushing Henson from the beginning that gets it inside it then leget actually grabs Williams to get him out of the mix low has something to say as temperatures rise but I I think were okay if we walk away with this saying hey Benny Williams gets the technical foul right we keep moving on you take your free throws and we just keep playing basketball I dont think I think the the offense was Cory when Ted Valentine was wrapping up a player thats when Benny Williams was Hinson Benny Williams kind of came in and gave him a shove yes I I I believe thats where the penalty is Im just hoping it doesnt escalate beyond that mhm so we know this Ted Valentine did rule a technical pretty quickly once they started separating players and from the angle we saw it was in the direction of Benny Williams so most likely that will be the call the question becomes will there be anyone else penalized as Bill Covington will go speak Tedy Valentine will actually call in both coaches to have a conversation and let them know whats going on good work by the officials to get to it before it really get out of Music hand so were hearing definitely a technical fou on the pan toson anduse theyre going to get Williams and Henson and Im okay with that simply because Henson was the one standing over top of Co Applause posession so no shots here because the technicals will off set there was a jump ball and a possession arrow remember that possession arrow to Pittsburgh gotcha thank you to Bill Covington T Valentine both coming over communicating with us letting us know and I Im good with this even though I didnt want want to see anyone else getting technical fouls Henson was standing over top of Copeland and so therefore I do believe that those two getting involved the offsetting technical fouls I think is the right call gotcha so pit with a basketball and trailing 47 to 36 hon with a long jumper hes had a tough night shooting it and they really needed him well see if he catches fire late but right now its going Syracuses way on top 47 to 36 hon two for8 from threepoint L 3 for2 over over all and if you include this one its been six consecutive tough shooting nights for Henson with this game involved after coming off a great shooting for the G five games previous where he was smoking hot shot clock to five mince getting a look at it off the fake leans in cant hit it Pits got an opening here trying to cut into this deficit Carrington off for Applause Hinson Leed working on Copeland Hinson again hell drive it going in strong no so even the layups but a great job by the orange St vertical not fouling when hon attacked the basket just showing High hand Syracuse time and time again here in the second half getting very deep in that shot clock sitting at nine now Starling pulls up sinks it very confident looking shot he is great in the midrange you see JJ stalling its the second time weve seen him go off the bouns get to the midrange and raise up and as you mentioned he is very confident knocking that Applause down G mod Diaz Graham sevenfooter getting ready to report in another one glances away right to leg it hell go in strong not there again so right now pit cant buy one from distance or Music inside VZ lost it for a moment Austin with the rejection that comes free to Williams and he will flush it and a timeout Pittsburgh so its Syracuse coming out of that scrum and the two technicals that offset with extra fire Yeah Austin comes up with a huge BL however the Panthers can get the basketball and Benny Williams gets the Highlight in the correct manner especially on the road coming in getting off to a great start but more importantly they have been the aggressor in this game theyve been the tougher team and that was one of the concerns from Jeff capable and his inexperienced group he wont call them young hell call them inexperienced to this point because hes got a lot of new guys playing in this system pit had cut it to eight points and Syracuse on a Mini S nothing run to answer Gus will flip it here for low low finds an opening left it short came right back to him for a second chance another offensive rebound we talked about the Panthers average 13 offensive rebounds a game theyre up to 12 right now but they just havent been able to put them in the second chance points and buob Carrington still without a field goal in this game so another missed opportunity off offensive rebound youre talking about a guys very important scoring wise for pit I know hes only a freshman but 14 points a game OB hes the only freshman in the country averaging 14 or more points per game five or more rebounds and four and a half plus assists thats how important he is up in the lane that wont drop the sevenfooter gets his hands on it approaching the 10minute mark here at the Pete which is pretty darn quiet at the moment they havent given a lot of reason but thatll go down on the tough move there by low and thats really been the only success over the last few minutes for the Panthers is low getting into the painted area and making a play hes in double figures now four of eight from the field Williams yes sir thats a triple Jeff capable said that he was going to look at me when Benny Williams made a three because Benny Williams plays great I glance acoss I see I catch eye contact with Jeff cable Benny Williams has something against the Panthers he plays great against them knock down Jumper by jeffris the 67 Jr who started 16 games as a sophomore but missed all of last season to a foot injury Syracuse has had answers all night long here at the peak Starling to the Baseline mince mince headed stripped and draws the foul small play by Jud thez not Music waiting so 923 to go Syracuse by 14 over pit knock back the pit Panthers eight different men have scored for Syracuse and on their home floor OB the Panthers have struggled to shoot the basketball its perplexing to Jeff capable as to why this is has been the case but if you think about the North Carolina game the Duke game and now this one against Syracuse they are combined 19 of 76 from Beyond the threepoint Arc this is a team that averages 96 made threepoint field goals a game so theyre at the top of the ACC in number of Threes made per game but they just have not been able to get it going on their home floor and their one ACC win they made 12 threes at Louisville so thats the the the interesting part where je cable just cant figure out how theyre not shooting the basketball at home Elite Brown back on for red ay and Syracuse Min with another one coming and Coach cable talked about he wanted to see his team be more tough offensively in this game looking for shots hitting shots just hasnt happened yet it has not happened yet and also they only have eight assists to go along with seven turnovers where Syracuse who averages close to 13 turnovers a game only has six they go on with their 12 assists Jaylen L The Freshman now hes had a solid night he absolutely has hes put together a good game thus far just hasnt been able to get much help from the guys in Carrington and Henson that Pittsburgh needs to be scores Williams on Henson thats a nice looking shot and that makes it 5842 Williams is seven points three for three Henson going in strong count that hell be at the line and maybe thats the answer get Henson on the Block allow him to be the post presence for the Panthers when youve got both of the Diaz Grand Brothers on the floor both can shoot it from Beyond a threepoint Arc which gives Blake Henson the opportunity to be able to post and you see Blake Henson four of 15 from the field two of nine from three Jeff cable at his wits end trying to find a way to get his star going whos the fourth leading score in the AC threepoint play for Blake they need a lot more of that over these last8 and 12 minutes from him Min swooping in against the sevenfooters both guo and Jorge as mentioned on the floor for the same time for the pit Panthers and a tie up and so Syracuse will have it on a possession arrow these are Jorges first minutes in the game was looking forward to getting a three in transition on that possession but give the Orange Credit for getting out and covering not allowing him to have the open look forcing the Applause turnover defense defense defense up Syracuse working around the perimeter shot clock to 10 JJ styling styling with a spin yes sir and now Syracuse is just starting to make tough shots JJ Starling going off the bounce we saw Benny Williams do it on an earlier possession and the orange are feeling confident about their offense here in the peak went for the steel its knocked out of play by Syracuse so the Panthers will have it when we come back Benny Williams has 32 points in conference play 22 of them have come against the Panthers he likes playing against pit JJ staring getting in his bag off the bounce the turnaround jumper everything going for the from the field to go along with two rebounds and JJ Starling has done the job but hes been one of the many horns that have been successful here tonight Syracuse with three men in low double figures hes got 11 mence has 11 and Chris Bell 10 but Syracuse spreading around the scoring rebound tipped out of the hands of Jorge Diaz Graham with 725 left been a lot of games kind of like this between these two School certainly were in the Heyday of the Big East when pit circus went toetotoe lows scoring games but very exciting finishes in a lot of them low with a bounce feed that ones off the side of the backboard jge known to be the shooter of the two and going to be a timeout here for Syracuse as mint will get one with 706 to go so well be back in 30 Syracuse on top 60 to Music 45 its your igniter well help get that fixed then your oven issues done open is the video get Music yeah man an app to fix my oven yep an app to fix your oven thats correct introducing front door download today to video chat an expert and coming up next well take you to Gallagher IBA Arena in Stillwater Oklahoma Hunter Dickinson and number three Kansas taking on Oklahoma State and the Big 12 that is right after this one is finished low racing and laying it up and in J the lows put together a strong performance here hes the only offense really for the Panthers here in this second half 14 points for for him coming into the game averaging 54 was been his starting the lineup for the last three yeah this is a career high for him he needed two or three more tonight lets see if they have run out of time still six and a half to go on the drive low again and takes the foul hell be at the stripe well we talked about Marlin low jaylens dad showing up for the game today a 4Hour delay out of Houston trying to get here came directly to the arena from the airport to see his son play and Jaylen has rewarded pops with a strong performance right here and now an opportunity with a career high to make it a 10point game and hes been the reason why the Panthers have been able to stay within striking this I would say the only reason coachs son both of his high school and aaou teams and he comports himself that way he absolutely does and youre talking about a high IQ young man especially basketball IQ on the floor you see how much trust Jeff capable has in him as a freshman Min off for Williams theres a three coming left that short rebounded away Williams came right back and got that Mal Brown inside to grab the loose ball shot clock down eigh mince tiptoeing through Benny Williams and a whistle that was with 39 on the shot clock and that will go against G mod Diaz Graham number four Jeff capable understanding how big of a possession that was was dejected by the offensive rebound and once again by the foul with 3 seconds on the shot clock but remains positive understanding that his team has put themselves back in position to be able to come back in this game CH resets to 20 mince in close no gets the loose ball hell swing here for Starling and hell back it away another offensive rebound the Panthers have now had to be on this end of the floor for over a minute defensively five to shoot for the orange Starling with a pull up pop and hits another Applause one pure confidence it absolutely is especially in his midrange you see he picks a spot on the floor he gets there and raises up over top of Defenders and knocks it down with confidence Syracuse is had an answer every step of the way low again cant hit it so Mintz will take his time and run a little more clock with Syracuse up by a dozen on the Applause road got it free to copelan a whirling derish no left it short Carrington to push the tempo Carrington fumbles it and a tie up possession errow will keep it right here for pit for 21 to go and another big coming on the 611 Federico fed Rico for pit you notice here in a critical stage of the game how rarely we are talking about Blake Henson 18 points a game for pit but not much of a factor at all tonight as well as Bob Carrington 14 points per game and scoreless tonight oh again with the kick shot on the way and thatll B Fire by Music Austin four minutes to go pit getting some looks but cant cash in two threw it away low here he comes and he hits it and got fouled as well tremendous body command there to make the shot with 343 to go so pit still in it because of him yeah jayen low keeping the Panthers in it off the turnover turning defense and the offense the steal the finish the foul and weve got a 10point game it can be less when we return not been able to you know benefit off of the offensive rebounding 14 offensive rebounds in this game theyve only turned into 10 second chance points however they have an opportunity now to free throw line for loow to have the 16th point off of eight Syracuse turnovers so that is one area where the Panthers have been able to exploit the orange in this game Al L looking for his 20th point tonight previously his high was 12 against Florida G Coast out of Missouri City Texas and connects to give him 20 and theyre inside 10 youll see different pressure from the Panthers now after Jeff capable had the chance in the timeout and Ill take my chances with Benny Williams having to handle the basketball first Jaylen love got it across for Applause Starling Syracuse has been very patient quite conservative here in the second half with a basketball is quader copelan shot clock down to two Min and hes foued on the Play What a bailout was 09 on the shot clock its the second time in the game that pit has committed a highly ill advised foul and two the Min with less than four on the shot clock goes and its actually William Jeffers jum who gets there and gets a hand on his arm but you see how late it is thats one you want to make it difficult for minz to get that shot off at the end of the shot clock he sinks number one hes 79 at the line back up to 10 and you send one to accs best in the free throw line to make it a double digit lead once again weve talked multiple times about how often Judah minz gets to the free throw line and he is five of five on the night thus far as this game goes down the wire hell have the ball in his hands we can see him there much Music Applause more Syracuse leading 6453 Judah with 13 also nine rebounds in the game hes done more than score in this game and give him credit for playing a very good floor game and defensively as wellon that barely got to the iron just has not been his night he in the double figures hes had some rebounds but he needed a much bigger even but often times you see Blake Hinton take those four shots again its okay for him to shoot the three but if that ones not there swing and see if you can get something else he cant make it all up at once Min again mod Diaz Graham out to guard him and that ones going to be thrown away with 237 left Copeland just tapping his chest thing thats my fault mince drops the dime off Copeland just unable to Coral that one that would have been a dunk normally if he gets his hands on the basketball and Judah M of course is all point guards hating turnover so immediately just jumping up and down cringing as he sees that go out of bounds low turnover game though only eight for pit nine for Syracuse to this point in the game two and a half minutes to go and on Q heres one Starling on the attack draws the foul as hes hit by carington with 227 to go on carington his second and really just unforced but it goes back to Jeff C TOA pregame Malik Brown is one of the best of getting his hands on the basketball so good that he is actually tied with his team made Judah men at 219 for the lead in the ACC for steals its uncanny you know how many deflections he gets yeah and again its something that you know when you see the numbers youre like okay the guy is great with his anticipation with his hands because hes leading ACC and steals but Jeff cable made sure to bring it up to us they actually had to run different offense in the first game to keep the basketball from getting in the five mans hands because Malik Brown is so good and knocking it away L working on a 20point game cant spin that one in one and done back over to the orange Music 6553 mince will be tied up and hell be held by jeffris he commits the personal with 204 to go and thatll be number one on him so minz back to his favorite spot had a good game individually against North Carolina it didnt go highly noticed he had 21 points thats because Carolina ran away and hid and won by 36 points on Saturday the largest loss for Syracuse since entering the ACC 10 seasons ago but its been a great response from the orange here tonight on the road a MZ finally missing one hes seven for eight heres low way downt too strong but getting back into a game when youre down by three not necessarily A Forte of the pit Panthers is it no it really really is not and again when youre shooting the basketball this poorly from Beyond the threepoint Arc now five of 24 from Beyond The Ark third straight game where the Panthers have struggled to shoot the three here on their home floor Harington The Talented freshman tough night old forend shooting overall and Syracuse just putting this ball game away styling from the corner and Starling has been big for the orange in this game coming out on the road and looking like the orange will get Adrien As first ACC Road win of the Season fed Rico fed Rico backing in and on the line will turn it over Syracuse with their biggest lead tonight yeah I guess I shouldnt say of the season of his career this will be his first ACC row win of his career and Adrien alry off to a really good start difficult to replace a legend of course but red is doing a great job thus far this year Syracuse most likely moves on to 12 and 5 overall evening out their ACC record at 3 and three and a big game coming up with the Miami Hurricanes coming to the Dome this Saturday just feels like it comes in a very important spot for Syracuse it absolutely does just that again after that loss at North Carolina and on a short turnaround Saturday to Tuesday coach arery able to get his team regrouped coming back in with that competitive fire here on the road tonight Kansas and Oklahoma State are coming up from Still Water a whistle here and the points at 394 to play so more college basketball coming up here on ESPN Tonight Syracuse has been putting this game on ice here in the final stages of the second half feder Rico feder Rico 611 Jr from Helsinki Finland will complete a threepoint play but not enough of that for the pit Panthers here tonight and this is a game that got to eight points in the second half pit got the lead down to eight had some momentum on their side here on their home floor but just unable to make the plays especially on the defensive end to be able to get back and get any closer in this game to Syracuse to pick up their third win in the ACC and improved to three and three in the conference and 12 and five overall as they come to Pittsburgh which has seen so many battles between these two School the slam dunk by feder Rico to a little too late for Pittsburgh and Syracuse gets a big win in their season 6958 will be the final score and a win for red ay on the road his first quad one win this season strong response from the orange after a
