maroon we are underway with a win today it would be the best start in conference play for this pit team since 2011 now nationally relevant for the first time in more than a decade and they want to keep it going here at home in blue Florida State and maroon we are underway Applause had her buckle up its Florida state that starts with the mass basketball despite a nonconference to forget this Seminoles team four and four in ACC play coming off a good win at mon Tuesday really well 328 not so much here they turn it over on the opening possession this atmosphere we talked about a pit being back it is rocking in here now Jeff Capel has got this thing going and it is loud and they are ready to roll starting five first of a threegame home stand for the Panthers Applause side with Nelly Cummings Applause blocked there back to back turnovers for Florida City Applause theres not something folks Hamilton talked about when we saw him last night at practice he said look we have to take care of the ball on the road and we talked about the discrepancy uh in age and experience on this team on the road this Florida State team must do a good job taking care of the ball against five seconds to shoot Elliott finds Federico Federico two possessions two turnovers for Florida State and two possessions two buckets get long to get the home for home for to it deep Cleveland silences him with a much needed three hes been the goto guy all season yeah he has been playing great for them I think the biggest thing hes done is hes taken uh Caleb Mills off the ball and his shot making ability in particular is shooting uh so much improvement and hes an said in Dungey he will be playing at the next level somewhere for a paycheck founding strong Applause Jeff Capel what a job he has done they were picked to finish 14 to the ACC preseason ball currently tied for seconds Joe linardi our bracketologist at ESPN has them in the NCAA tournament field and you say those things to Jeff Capel and he says were far from finished we need to keep doing what has gotten to us to this point they are locked in its just a different energy and weve talked about this theres shoot rounds in their practices they got a lock in I think a lot of that has to do with the experience that he has on this roster but make no mistake about it nobody I dont think thought they would be sitting in this position right now Im fake and it leads to a three Craig Elliott buries it great use of the ball fake that time and then right into one dribble pullup jumper beautiful offense Applause foreign hit handling the switches right there now you can see Florida state will switch one through five on any boss green downscreen Applause pushing into miles uh the term threading the needle is overrated Nelly Cummings will rip the pass of the year Im not sure how he got this one through transition offense and Nelly Cummings with the pinpoint passing and the dunk it is rocking and pit big stage for the first time in a while this is a fan base that is woken up they are loud and proud first game of a threegame home sand as they try and continue to bolster the NCAA tournament resume and Jeff Capel was very blunt he said look winning well do that then he knew that coming into this season Applause Music this fan base has rewarded them and its created this place again very loud in here Florida State an extremely young team for Leonard Hamilton theyve certainly had their ups and downs this season but four and four in the ACC they feel like this could be a big opportunity on the road to show that they could finish in the top half of this league Cleveland Coast to Coast through draft to finish thank you so completely no call by The Ref and I like what Cleveland did he initiated that contact trying to get to the free throw line but Pitt did a pretty good job Walling up not fouling in that situation 10 on the timer goes to work Applause theres a three count it push the foul it could be a fourpoint play for Greg Elliott simple basketball jamarius Burton we talked about it his playmaking affiliates to Elliott four to three textbook basketball by Penn I think the biggest thing the theme that speaking with all these coaches I think its a team that is connected theyre sharing the ball you have four starters in double digits on any given night any one of these guys can go off and score and its been a huge reason you know five transfers of the starting lineup look at that average age 22 and a half years old tough situations you can lean on that experience and the maturity you cant coach experience and Coach Hamilton mentioned that uh he said look thats the thing were going to have to battle against this pit team their experience we asked them about the keys that was his first thing he said to his book they are going to be a team thats not going to get rattled we talked about it when they went down versus Virginia uh he could have folded their experience here in them back and they came back and eventually won that game so thats something that the luxury that folks capable and staff have and Leonard Hamiltons team look at that age Gap more than a two and a half year difference between the Pittsburgh starting lineup and the Florida State starting lineup and Leonard Hamilton said Im a guy who has tried to build a program of getting old and staying home to this years team a lot younger than he wanted to be I think therell be one thing as you can see his guys have gotten better we talked about Matthew Cleveland a guy that will play for a paycheck when he leaves Florida State uh although some may look at that as a negative and hes playing guys a lot more minutes system and those guys have benefited from that and theyve gotten better and the big reason why and they stand four and four right now in the ACC so its one thing to go and get a bunch of old guys like it did in the transfer portal theyre playing together so well right on two Blake Henson gives it a hit a joint lead early how was his coaching staff got this team thats coming from all different places to gel so well I think thats the key their staff as we take a look at Caleb Mills knocking down a three which is going to be key for Florida State theyre going to have to make some threes uh with the exception of green really I think other guys are going to have to do that thats a good sign but Jeff Capel talked about his staff two former head coaches on there and obviously his brother as well too theyve done a nice job finding the right fit for what they want to do they dont want to just take transfers they want guys that are going to buy into doing exactly what it was step back three green got it back to back threes for Florida State and theyre right back in it one of the best Shooters not just in the ACC but in college Jeff Capel they were going over that in shoot around they said look if you are not connected to Green he is going to make you pay that one right there a step back and it was deep Music answers right back Applause Applause over to Cleveland Applause beautiful bounce pass Worley off the window and in for two take note young players morally thats a beautiful cut without the ball and excellent Patience by Cleveland moving without the ball thats something that coach ham and staff has been working with these youngsters uh the younger players with uh thats beautiful execution that time by Worley rejected by males swatted and from behind up to Green he didnt see it and thats a travel foreign Defender falls asleep for a second nice basket cut I think the key thing with that though Matthew Cleveland had his head up and makes a beautiful pass all he had to do is catch go up and finish Applause the strength for this Panthers team this season has been balanced scoring all five starters already on the scoresheet Music in the hottest and that one rings out has already made two threes today though Applause green step back left it short Santos in grabs the rebound Applause so Bandy pulls the trigger rattles in and out no good hes been a really bright spot Off the Bench for this team Nike subandy they could use a spark right now Florida State right back in it it was a 10point lead now down to one Caleb Mills connects on his second three Florida State shot their way right back into this game well its been impressive how theyve done it though theyre spacing and ball movement I think thats been key to them getting some high quality looks Music comments shooting over four and misses it Applause Mills on the drive this time fires Florida State in front theyve erased a 10point lead in three minutes and 30 seconds and thats all set up because hes had to come out and close out because he knocked down two threes now you run out out a nice bit of hesitation and then finish at the basket Pittsburgh at a scoring drought of nearly three minutes Cummings tries to end it cant connect and Florida State on a 132 scoring run male Zoom transition gets his own rebound misses the layup third opportunity Corin cant make it missed opportunity there for the Seminoles Pittsburgh running and gunning chaotic sequence and nobody can find the bottom of the cup Applause foreign Saddles it down and scores Florida State on a 152 scoring run and thats excellent identification that time by Florida State they had to match up they want it with green ice them on the Baseline that time let them go to work and thats a beautiful step back jumper it has missed their last six shots of scoring drought of three minutes and 30 seconds now all right its amazing intensive three with the shot clock winding down hit really out of rhythm offensively the biggest thing the ball is not moving for a pit Handler Jackson and Florida state is on fire time out Jeff Capel its a 172 run for the Seminoles over the last five minutes and theyve grabbed the lead here in Pittsburgh the Florida state has gone on a 172 run and I think the big thing for a pit during that stretch not much ball movement thats something that coach people talked about of a credit Florida state theyre spacing on offense and then defensively of their switches they were able to Forfeit into some contested shots look at that shooting 80 percent from three and defensively theyve been excellent Pittsburgh get a scoring ground of four minutes and 10 seconds Applause and Florida State uncharacteristically in League Play theyve struggled defending the threepoint line teams shooting 40 percent from three theyve turned on the full court grass out of the Pittsburgh timeout the Panthers have turned it over leads to a three hits it again Chandler Jackson and Florida State now on a 202 run right there just careless with pit and the out of bounds underneath that really was not much pressure and they just threw it away Florida state is shooting five of six from three they are red hot from Deep on the road and right here again just a miscue on the inbounds thats not much pressure and then heads up play Baba Miller thats a big uh making a triple Drive kick out and another high quality look for Florida State and thats really been the story during this stretch where theyve been able to extend this lead to eight coming up after us double header continues on Tobacco Road NC State take it on North Carolina in the dean Dome thats right after us right here on acc Network Applause on double doubles in that game Armando Bay Cod attempted to break Billy Cunninghams North Carolina I mean thats just amazing the career that Armando bacon has had double double machine and the most dominant players weve seen in quite some time Miller the Frenchman from Spain getting in on the ACT seems like Pittsburgh cant get a stop right now Florida State scoring at will theyve made their last four Music open three Cummings cant hit it offensive rebound keeps it alive Burton on the drive right to the rim the blowby lets grown man move right there spring its just a big boy move right traffic Miller showing off the range back to back baskets for the star freshman the during shoot around in practice last night we saw coach Hamilton working with him he said look hes got a really good looking shot Applause foul bird eight in a row Florida state has been gold who would have thought theyd meet again in the ACC there they are right next to each other Amazing Story and two talented uh young men playing for their respective teams but that International experience Jay really invaluable for both these young men I mean a lot of times those UA teams theyre playing against the older teams theyre playing against guys that are men so again they come over here with invaluable International experience and both these guys uh key pieces for Pitt and Florida State both born and raised in Spain and speak with them both this week I said whats the biggest similarity between Europe and coming over here and playing ACC basketball and they said the fans the European soccer fans are like ACC fans theyre screaming and yelling the whole game so this atmosphere it doesnt rattle The Freshman theyre used to it I mean thats High Praise I played in Italy I didnt Spain and also played in France I can tell you right now future fans are very passionate its like religion its High Praise for the ACC bands but Miller called for an offensive foul fourth turnover for Florida State in his first half so thats the similarity you spending time in Europe whats the biggest difference between the European game and the college basketball game well I think this right here the defensive intensity I think is a little bit more you can play zone over there guys can stand underneath the basket its a lot more mantoman kind of grind it out I think that was probably the biggest thing for me and then the bigs theyre very skilled over there youll have guys that are traditional Sinners that would be here in the states those guys are playing like wings and guards um look at a player like Baba Miller hes six foot eleven and hell step out and shoot the three like hes a shooting guard one today one of five Florida State players to make a three thats the story the seminal six of seven from three five different players getting in on the action deep and thats so key of spreading the wealth out again Ill go back to that earlier autistically were talking about both these teams do a pretty good job balancing their scoring attack Applause double digit S as well Applause theres Caleb Mills seven seconds to shoot in attack mode step back three missed it Pittsburgh desperately needed to stop Florida state has been red hot offensively in this first half Nelly Cummings draws the foul Applause Music thats interesting because Florida state will switch one through five and what theyre doing now is is whenever they get that time they got cohort off well theyre gonna just isolate theyre gonna break off their offense and let the guard that switches or gets switched out on by a big by Florida state theyre going to let them operate and I like that but they have to make the right read out of that Applause again Cummings working against Corin th creates the space just cant connect Applause six minutes left to this first half wave off the three foul off the ball Applause and the rep right now and I like that thats a veteran move its starting to get physical right here yeah thats a pretty good elbow the referee calls both guys together warns both attention and so thats it Im taking control of this right now I dont want to hear it anymore guys with John had each other and thats a great job of officiating getting this thing under control right away do not let it go any further inside the Matthew Cleveland he rises and hits a ninepoint lead for Florida State on the road and thats what makes Cleveland difficult his ability to shoot weve seen that the improved uh shot but then you put a smaller guy on and theyll throw him down low in the post and theyll just raise right up over him thats excellent spacing and offense Again by Florida State Applause offensive rebound Burton power dribble lays it up and in first team player Applause in Off the Mark trying to answer five minutes remaining in his first half Burton trying to take over quick trigger there and he missed it two of their last 13 foreign Applause man strength we talked about it uh Burtons strength thats just a big time offensive rebound putback but then look at the spacing uh by Florida State they give Cleveland room to operate no they have the matchup they want but the key is that is spacing and then hes able to just work on the low block Applause Leonard Hamilton not happy about it its been a very physical first half Applause you know Pittsburgh already in the bonus now as Florida States committed seven fouls for our double header youll be in studio with the nothing but neck crew seven Eastern Time right after the North Carolina NC State game right here on acc Network as they take you through what is sure to be a wild Saturday in the ACC you never know what is going to happen is a perfect example right here its been red hot so good to start ACC play here at home and yet Florida State theyve been shot out of a cannon they Trail by 10 10 totally flipped this game around another off the ball foul this time a call against Blake hits him the officials right now as you said Malcolm have taken over the game and theyre trying to lessen the physicality and you talked about it it started off really physical and now the players are going to have to adjust the refs are calling that theyre going to clean it up so now again all players need to adjust to how the officials are calling this one Florida State shooting 60 percent in this first half Applause and gets it to go Matthew Cleveland and Florida States making tough shots on the road difference between a good player and a Next Level paycheck player is that right there its good shots thats not bad defense uh by pitch thats just the guy thats got it going right now and hes hitting contested shots Applause Cleveland is feeling it comes into this game with eight straight double doubles well on his way there again Applause trailing by seven as Matthew Cleveland starting to take over this game scoring on all three levels but Matthew Cleveland showing off the whole game early Florida stayed up a lot about Leonard Hamilton the coach but hes lived a Hall of Fame life when you talk to him to hear in his own words the life he has lived the experiences the stories its remarkable and uh Ill Echo what you said uh yes uh Hall of Fame coach the numbers dont lie but an even better person and human being and the lives that hes impacted he talked about adopting his brothers and his sister but of the countless lives that hes impacted with these young men at Florida State and Beyond really remarkable what he has been able to do and going back to his playing days where he was the first black player in the history of the UT Martin program something that he said at the time he didnt even know he was like look I was just trying to set an example for my family uh Frank college is a possibility and that I didnt want to let them down and certainly afterwards now as he reflects on it certainly a blessed and thankful that he was able to do that and bring others along including his family members his team right now playing inspired at this first half there there it is the throwback to the UT Martin days we asked him what type of player he was you see the Hops on display there but you see the knee pads and that sums up what type of player he was hes like listen I was a gritty Defender and a guy that both mind distribute the knee pad says that says it up with a lot of Twitter and Applause gonna have no right on cue a turnover leads to a three got it Darren Green a turnover and a three in Florida States up by 10 and thats the story of the game right now Florida state is close to 70 from the threepoint line on the other end hit below 20 uh its been the defense of Florida state that has created the offense and they have capitalized Applause come shot clock winding down down to one and thats a shot clock violation Leonard Hamilton right on cue we were talking about how he was a defensive minded player his teams taking on that identity today and thats just careless right there again thats not necessarily a forced uh turnover thats just uh unforced turnover right there he just threw that one away lack of concentration on the other end though that previous possession of Florida States length thats something Jeff Caper talked about we have to be prepared to run our offense against their switches but they try to take you out of your offense Cleveland fouled hell head to the line now this first half Pittsburgh gets a 10point lead early 155 now if the state is up by 10 a 20point swing and the Applause Ive been impressed Worley him also Cleveland but theyve made some nice reads yes weve talked about their defense but this is the progression I had them earlier in the season against Florida uh it was a work in progress I think the biggest change when we speak spoke with Coach Hamilton and Stan uh moving Caleb Mills off the ball and putting Cleveland and Worley more in that point allowing Mills to get to more of his scoring guard position and that has been huge for them full court pressure on Pittsburgh has suffered a 22 swing here up and now down 12 with 90 seconds to go with his first half Applause shooting two of 11 from three under 10 on the timer this time they get a clean look off Burton misfires will stay its way why have they struggled offensively well a couple of things uh Florida States length theyve done a nice job as weve seen being active in the passing lanes and I think the ball has stuck early on in the game the ball was moving left to right and they were getting high percentage shots they went away from that in this really latent second half and Florida state has capitalized on that lack of ball movement bills fires a three a rare Miss from deep in this first half the Seminoles shooting 70 percent from three before that Mills Miss Cummings hes fouled from three so well get three foul shots and try and cut it to single digits here and although Pitt is going to get three foul shots thats really been how their offense has gotten ones high ball screen not much movement and uh Cummings are shooting a deep contested three now they got bailed out because of the foul but certainly I know thats going to be an adjustment in something that coach Capel talks to his guys about going into the half they have to get better ball movement and higher percentage Cummings a 97 foul shooter just missed there he comes into the game 2829 thats the type of afternoon its been for Pittsburgh and credit though Florida State again theyre unique because theyre one of the few teams in college basketball theyll switch in there mantoman one through five and other teams that do it yeah they may do it but they dont have fives that are mobile enough to slide uh with the guards and wings and Florida State though thats been a staple of theirs of their ability to switch and then take you out of your offensive flow Music Humane free throws from Cummings but Pittsburgh still without lets get in nearly five minutes at the end of this first half Florida state has taken advantage a 10 point lead Applause s it up Cleveland foul Greg Elliott was out of position all he could do was bump into Cleveland Jay thats a beautiful set play they added a wrinkle uh we saw Pitt working on defending this play but the wrinkle of it is youll take a look at it this is supposed to be for Cleveland coming off the flare screen but he breaks it off and now he goes towards the basket for a lob and Pitt had no choice but to follow him right there so a nice little wrinkle added to that Florida State play and now you could pretty much hold for the last shot here but the shot clock reset to 20 after the foul Worley goes to work Cross Court pass finds Mills has to Eve shot clock violation and theres a little time left for a bit to try and do something here Applause today elects are going down time trailing by 10 Leonard Hamiltons team red hot for the three shooting 58 from deep in that first half the defense Florida States defense has taken Pitt uh completely out of their offensive hello held them below 20 from the threepoint line theyve created offense with turnovers Leonard Hamilton must be pleased with how his team performed into first half they go in up 10 points now what a first half this place was rocking the Oakland Zoo had Pittsburgh up by 10 and now Florida State leads by 1020 Point swing in the first half fun second half to come till then youll be in the studio with Kelsey Riggs and Company Applause welcome into this ACC Network halftime report alongside also recognition of what they want to do on the offensive side whats incredible to me this is a really young team thats not had a lot of confidence but not a lot of success this season you get down by 10 on the road and answer the way they did 3414 run to end the first half incredible and Coach Hamilton said the majority he said look were not where we want to be but Ive been impressed with how our team has a grownup and matured during this stretch I think other side Jeff Capel talked about this their team is at their best when the ball is moving left to right they need to get back to how they started off the game dribble Drive kicks get a couple of passes something we saw in shoot around uh this morning of them going through their offense running multiple passes they need to get back to that in the second half how was your food lion game summary we are back underway in this second half classic case of threepoint shooting too Florida State seven of twelve Pittsburgh just two of 12 Greg Elliott Applause trying to for another second half comeback Applause to them about the ball movement and spacing thats a great first opening possession for Ben to start to second half Worley trying to answer cant finish in the rim what a state Florida State bomb underneath their own refund going on the big question for this Seminoles team is can you sustain it for 40 minutes even on Tuesday night in the win at Notre Dame and went into a period where you let the Irish come back a little bit in that game and thats maturity thats holding a lead and picks with on the roads and its a very good pit team three seconds on the shot clock passing out of the double team Cleveland hoyson cant hit really good defensive pressure and intensity for Pittsburgh to start this second half nothing but the back to back s gets to get the Oakland Zoo back in it Al is an attack mode try its a turnover Here Comes Pitt the other way kick to the corner hits it at three missed it fouls Zone shot another chance Cummings he cant connect finally Darren Green has it for the Knowles up ahead and Worley skying and scoring excellent transition offense all set up by Green heads up play back to though the backtoback looks for Pitt you cant ask for better looks if youre Jeff Capel wide open looks off of great ball movement Applause Music 14 from three Applause Burtons much better in the midrange than from Deep today Im going to say it again he is a playing like a firstteam allleague but his his Patrol and ability to get into the paint and then score or create for his teammates big reason why Pitt has had the success theyve had thus far in ACC play Burton averaging 19 points a game for the big round individual defense though right here but on the other end green with the heads up play in transition pinpoint passing Buckhead and uh and uh transition defense that time and thats a heads up play easy deuce everything going through Bergen right now finds Henson and this time he hits it and missed three from that same spot that time connects and cuts the lead in half you cannot make a better pass off of dribble Drive Burton with the beautiful Cross Court pass for a three thank you Applause rocks the rim dictionary pick and roll right there look it up definition of how you run the pick and roll thats how you do it its all set up though you have to respect Greens jumper he carried the defense with him and then hit the roller textbook pick and roll offense by Florida State Burton in attack mode Federico Federico cleans up the spill thank you Federico better Applause Music Hills makes it five and why that drive happens is because Florida State shot the ball so well so now the pit wings are staying home uh on the shooters thats allowing Mills and Cleveland to operate off the bounce start shooting the ball well from The Brimmer currently getting a touch on every possession passing out of the double team somebodys upset Applause its been rips down the rain too much on it down Applause foreign looked off the defender in transitioned Nelly Cummings and then hit the big Federico Federico Applause deep three thrifted he misses it Applause Pittsburgh coming alive offensively theyve made four of their last five trailed by 10 at halftime now for the tie Pinson hits it foreign Zoo Comes Alive as Blake Henson ties it at 45 ripped away its in the trailer for the lead got it again Applause time now Florida steady well there is no doubt about it Pitt basketball is back this place is rocking Federico Federico with the Run and then the three ball the bench is loving it right now Pitt has recaptured the lead Music Applause to Land Point Florida state halftime lead mountain of Huckabee howd they do it uh theyre veteran leader uh Burton for me uh timarius Burton has been the key for this uh second half surgeons you look at the difference in the Gale of two halves 73 uh front of the four uh in the second half and Burton has had his hand in on pretty much every single play with the scoring for himself or setting his teammates up for high quality looks has gotten to Crim ball Jeff Capel told us but this thing is rocking theyve become a part of the game they have helped us win games against Virginia and North Carolina and here again trailing by 10 crowd involved now a threepoint lead Applause so Blake Hensons hitting threes too over three in the first half hes three for three in the second half well step aside again hustle on full display they arent feeling it right now leading by three Music Applause Music now the previous three seasons Jeff capels pit team has been stuck on six ACC wins theyve already got six conference wins this season were just in the middle of January they feel like they can double that win total this year yeah and patience rewarded and uh Jeff Capel credited uh his staff as well too he said look theyve done a great job of mining obviously the portal but then also the development of guys like Burton foreign Applause Music experience and he said look the importance of having those guys in here has been keyed in this Resurgence he said the message from the coaching staff to this years team was be a good teammate and the rest will take care of itself went into the transfer portal and got guys that just wanted to win they have done a lot of that on an eightnothing scoring run here to grab the lead trailed by 10 at halftime burden with a timer winding down the South Applause Music Portland and thats Cam foreign the freshmans fourth foul so hell have to come out of this game as we remind you the ACC best fans and we want to see your experience from your perspective go on social media use the hashtag all the devotion you might just see your host right here on acc Network Music second half an offensive hes up the ball is swinging left or right theyre getting multiple passes and again were going to go back to what we saw in shoot around this morning Jeff Capel emphasized when they were going through their dummy offense multiple passes but we do not want to one of the shots against this Florida State team and theyve come out in the second half executed better offensively ten nothing hit run to grab control of this game trailed by as many as 12 now leading by five father Miller travels the Florida state cant seem to stop the bleeding here Pitt is doing defensively to Florida State what they did to them in the first half theyre taking Florida State out of their offense and theyre creating some turnovers Music Applause Florida State now can they cash in on the other end and they cant thats a deep three from the parking lot Darren Greene Jr and Boyd in Florida State need that and thats a breakdown in this Garden report again uh green hes a guy if you dont pick him up as soon as he steps over half court and youre not there uh he is going to make you pay he is that good of the shooter and answers right Applause Pittsburgh outscoring Florida state 239 in the second half green backtoback baskets for him as he tries to keep Florida State in it Im gonna say it again that dude is one of the better Shooters not just in the ACC but in college basketball we saw coach Capel going through their scouting report he said look forget about it if youre not there on the catch that guy is going to make you pay and heres Cleveland hes capable of going Coast to Coast left to go too quickly travel there well Darren Green we talked about it over 41 this time showing off the midrange step back trying to get Florida State back up on time Music great game going on as Pittsburgh just as a twopoint lead against Florida State wanted to take a moment to talk about somebody off the court recognize Florida State sports information director Chuck Walsh for the last 23 years Chuck has been the backbone of everything behind the scenes with Seminoles hoops and this week Chuck well deservingly was named the US basketball Riders associations Catholic Quinn award a huge honor they pick one S ID a year out of the entire country and this year its Chuck extremely well deserved well deserved one of the best in the business not only at his job but one of the best people all these SIDS do a great job but were really happy for Chuck coach ham I had some funny stories about chocolate theyve been together one and again he said so much he does not only for uh coach ham and his staff but for all these young men of that played for Florida State so again correct congratulations coach Hamilton Chuck Walsh theyve been together for 21 years it was funny talking to Chuck this week I go what does this mean to you he goes Im just happy that Florida state gets the recognition because you look at the other ACC schools that sports information directors won this award its North Carolina in Louisville he goes were one of the blue Bob buds you know theyve got the hashtag newbloods and thats exactly what this team embodies looking for the lead here got it guess who daring daring Cruz again and thats a double strain of poor communication by Pitt oh again you have to communicate with green a coming off of screen you either have to switch it or give help but you cannot let him come off that clean again Im going to say it again one of the best parachuters in college basketball Applause right back in run Applause Adler Jackson fouled on his way up and this right here Jay again you have to communicate Greens setting up for a double screen he goes in between again great design played by Florida State instead of coming off the screen to curl he goes in between the double screens and then the two bigs come together and close it and you must communicate if youre pit they have to do a better job not allowing green to come out free throw green had the last eight points for Florida State he will stay tied at 54 even though both teams have led by 10 or more in this game at one point Santos coughed it up Jackson trying to give a ride back up Ahead Green Jackson running the floor fouled and hell go right back to the foul line where he just left Applause Music Applause right on cue foreign Applause Applause weve seen both teams take control of this game at different points Florida state had the 10point halftime lead after trailing by 10 155 to start this game now Penn has countered back whats going to separate these two teams in the final nine minutes I think the guy with the ball right now Burton has been huge three or four passes and then the ball moving left to right their offense has been better Applause on the other end Florida state theyre going to have to try to get back and get some a transition buckets before this Deacon get set up Applause both teams shooting pretty well right now Pittsburghs made five of their last seven Florida state has made three in a row and six of their last eight Tom s house into the game for the first time today for the seminals number 12 in Maroon not a deep bench this year for Leonard Hamilton usually rides this program on going 1012 deep not s this year theyve been dealt so many injuries and its really incredible that theyre four and four in League Play and leading on the road against a really good pit team its a credit to Leonard Hamilton and his staff I saw him again earlier against Florida it was they did not look like the same team they figured it out made some changes a move of Keller Mills off the ball but I think the progression of Laurie and Cleveland have to have good backboard play and theyve gotten it from their two young players see everything theyre missing they have not made any excuses though they keep battling right now in a dog fight on the road twopoint game under eight minutes to play Pittsburgh trying to get their best started conference play since 2011 Burton fade away criminals at home thats a Next Level move Applause into a fade away jumper Applause Mills great find inside Deontay green the Finish but thats offset up by Caleb Mills and weve seen that now multiple times in this game Florida States bigs have set screens and then rolled hard to the basket and get a reward youre right thats a nice fine by Caleb Mills over here kick to the corner Elliot cant connect from Deep cant ask for a better look but Burton again drawing so much attention this kind of unselfish kicks it out and Elliot has a pretty wide open look from the corner just missed it Mills going right back to green underneath and he delivers again those two guys connecting on backtoback possessions Florida State leads by four and two beautiful passes by Mills one a roll thats a nice little bounce Bass thank you Burton setting up another great look from three but same result Way Off the Mark Applause Mills feeds the green again this time swiped Away by Burton a little bit Florida State ball underneath their own hoop when we come back the Seminoles leading by four back to back buckets from The Freshman Deontay Greene weve got a fun finish coming in Pittsburgh Music weve got a fun finish coming between Florida State and Pittsburgh and boy Malcolm how can be if there was ever a game of runs its been this one its been back and forth pick comes out a blazing in that first half then Florida State comes running right back pit retakes the lead and then the boys a Florida State to come back and retake the lead really has been impressive it seems like when Pittsburgh grabbed the lead for the second time in the second run the crowds into it its a young inexperienced Florida State team you felt like okay Pittsburghs gonna go on and win and yet Florida state has punched right back leaning by four Cleveland fires and hits Its a sixpoint lead thanks to Matthew Cleveland we talked about his double doubles uh hes a guy that is one of the better rebounding of guards in the country but his offensive Improvement in particular that area right there his shot something that uh the staff has really worked hard with on him Applause Applause Applause puts it up to his season average of 16 points break to Nile Federico swatted after McLeods hands on the alleyoop floor Lee gets it right back for Florida State and is fouled this right here nice wall fake four close out and to me he has been a X Factor guy and then on the defensive end right here breaking up would look like theyre easy dues for Florida State Jay a guy we havent talked about a lot I know weve talked a lot about Cleveland but the guy with the ball right now Rory I felt like I feel like hes played a solid four game not four a Florida State I am Leonard Hamilton hes made some really good reads and an excellent defense Music quarterly from three cant connect Applause her and in attack mode draws the foul going right at Jalen Worley Applause and thats just a guy we talked about a close to 20 points per game in conference play knowing when to go and then when to create for others he is so strong Applause I thought Burton was going up for two the officials say the foul was on the floor contact before he started the shooting motion Applause was out of bounds take another look and Jeff Cape was talking about how he feels like he was pushed out of bounds and he is uh livid thats a huge change a human giving the board to State cable feels like they got wrong twice on that same possession Florida state with the ball threepoint lead and blows out on the road against a really good pit team seconds to shoot green the hot hand fouled shooting three Applause so Darren Green Jr three free throws coming would we come back Music Applause the home fans here not happy with the Whistle the last couple of minutes either as their head coach Jeff Campbell down by three Music ACC Network basketball is presented by Food Lion the official grocer of the ACC Music stretch we come here in Pittsburgh the Panthers head coach Jeff Capel fired up giving the officiating crew an earful after the last couple of possessions he felt they got a bad whistle on Malcolm Huck could beat Jay alter with you four minutes remaining in regulation weve got a one possession game in Pittsburgh they have been in this situation before where they have been battling back in the second half both against North Carolina and Virginia theyve cut a halftime lead of 10 down to three now how can they finish well I think the experience obviously this is where the experience of this team we talked about it uh comes in to play Burton I think the biggest thing though they got to make some shots theyve had some clean looks uh in this game from Beyond Beyond off some uh excellent ball movement and dribble drives but right now theyre stuck at 27 from the threepoint line I think theyre gonna have to knock down some shots and then on the other end of Darren Green thats a breakdown on that last before the timeout theres certain guys you dont help off of this guy at the line right here if theres a dribble drive and youre guarding him you let somebody else go help if not youre going to either have a poor closeout and your foul put them on the Frito line or hes going to make you pay with a wide open look found shooting three and he makes all of them up to 19 to lead Florida State close out on the road sixpoint lead all right four threes in the second half gives it up to Nelly Cummings Applause three the rebound and lost it second chance for Pittsburgh now yeah and thats again the setup though Florida state theyre switching uh so what they need to do what they were doing earlier put Burton and the boss green see if you can get him matched up with the Florida state big Pittsburgh just six of 23 from three theyve had a lot more success going inside Cummings hits this one though and its a big all right Pittsburgh Applause and well take it with him one possession game in the ACC with 317 to play Music Studio update coming up next here on acc Network NC State taking on Armando baycott and North Carolina and North Carolina looking for their third straight Conference win for the first time this season well have that game for you next guys Applause thank you Kelsey ACC double header and every Saturday in this conference delivers weve got a great game down the stretch one possession Florida State leading by three Nelly Cummings hit a three to make a make threepoint game before he took that shot he was just one of ten and yet Applause goes to threequarter court pressure trying to slow a Florida State down get him deep into the shot clock dialed in defensively out of the timeout Pittsburgh Applause in attempt mode and he and hes trying to find Greg Elliott in the corner but its Florida State ball excellent defense by Florida State there so long excellent use of being in the passing Lanes with their length youve got a deflection and then were able to get the turnover off hit great feed inside core and rejected at The Rim Federico delivers again good of a rim protector has he been this season for Pittsburgh Drive the window puts the lead down to one Jeff keeper stays with the threequarter four presser whats this doing slowing down Florida State and then again trying to get them deep into the shot clock two minutes to go one point game Applause Greens been Applause three team buries it Darren Greene Jr Im going to say it again the difference between a good player and Next Level guy hitting contested shots thats a big time step back contested three by Green Hanson trying to answer rejected and commits the foul on Mills Applause my goodness Darren Green I mean this is not bad uh defense right here this is a guy we talked about it one of the better threepoint Shooters not just in the ACC but in college and then the block the defense by Cleveland whos played a allaround excellent game of Fort Leonard Hamilton and Florida State green has 22 hes made five threes in this game Florida State clinging to a fourpoint lead on the road can they close it out Pittsburgh desperate for a stop Mills in attack mode into traffic lost the handle and its pit ball Applause Caleb Mills yeah thats pretty good hands by Burton and yeah in that situation right there looks like its off of so its going to be Pittsburgh basketballs the officials confirm the call or in the process of confirming it I think this will be a relatively easy review for them that was a big possession for Pittsburgh they had zero fouls to give played tight defense and got the stop lets see from this angle right here again yeah thats clearly off of Mills thats off Mills yeah thats thats not even and he knew it too he was trying to save the ball theres really from both angles its not even close uh it definitely looks like uh this is going to be a pitfall now again they cant reverse and call a foul in this situation correct but certainly uh from this angle it looks like every angle weve seen thats going I dont know whats taking so long so they might probably theyre looking at the time time theyre looking at how much time and from this angle right here yeah so they might take some time Applause off the clock looks like there probably should be a minute 17 left Music 118 on the clock pit ball Panthers have twotimeouts Leonard Hamilton has two timeouts as well right now Pits best offense has been Burton put him in a high ball screen with cohern Florida States continuing to switch and then theyre just theyre just breaking off isolating and then letting Burton go to work and make a read Theyre going to do it again right here and yeah again Florida State switches now let Burton go to work for three cant connect Cleveland the rebound Applause under a minute to go Florida State leading by four and Jeff Capel saying dont foul did you like that call yeah I think again theres time but certainly you need a stop on this of possession right there Applause I want to State though the smartest running clock contested free no good it gets the stop they needed Cummings in transition Music offensive fouls a call take care Applause they cant get another look I mean look he is trying to back up now hes certainly outside the restricted zone so thats not an issue right here and hes got his head down that can go either way in that situation its a players control and he certainly was out of control in that situation you got to come to a jump stop jumper or be more under control oh thats a pretty good Ball by the Reps control yeah he was out of control and I think youre right thats the key uh word in this player control did he have control he did not he basically thats right into him pretty good transition D that time by Caleb Mills full court press from Pittsburgh Florida state has two timeouts comes in immediately Caleb Mills will head to the foul line shooting one and one tomorrow foreign shooter on the season and Hinson that is his fifth foul so his night is done thats a critical threepoint shooter off floor for Jeff Capel Applause right on the start of this game uh the experience and Coach Hamilton talked about it and said look if were going to win on the road were gonna have to play with some boys immaturity foreign to go along with the two sophomore guards well Worley and Cleveland I felt like they controlled the pace and tempo of this game when it matters and they were able to come up with some plays Pittsburgh needs a bucket in a hurry 20 seconds left Cross Court pass Cummings has to fire missed it and its Florida State ball with under 14 seconds left at regulation foreign TS Applause its the guy you dont want to foul Aaron Greene Jr hes at the hot hand all day and hes 89 from the foul line on the season Applause and then you need a closer and this guy at the line Darren Green some of the shots hes hit in this game of the threes his ability to hit contested shots I mean its really you just gotta tip your ATT to him because in some of these situations not bad dude but he just hit some tough contested twos and then deep threes guys draped over them thats the type of game its been for Pittsburgh out of rhythm on the final possession the three Off the Mark in Florida State comes into Pittsburgh and wins after a disaster of a noncon the Seminoles are five and four in ACC play Leonard Hamilton has his team believing boys maturity and then Darren Green Im gonna say it again but one of the better Shooters not just in the ACC but in college basketball he some tough shots in the second half to go along with Matthew Cleveland His Four game it was an impressive team win by Florida State and Leonard Hamiltons group look how wide open the top ten is in the ACC thats the best way to explain it right now of Clemson in the drivers seat but youre absolutely right a flip a coin for any one of these teams it is just that deep and that good of an ACC is going to be an impressive a finish to this ACC regular season what a road win for Florida State the Seminoles trailed by 10 early on the road and it did not face them Darren Greene Jr led the way he had 24 and the Knowles leave Pittsburgh with an upset win 7164 for our terrific crew Malcolm Huckabee Im Jay alter saying so long lets get you into the studio with Kelsey Riggs Music
