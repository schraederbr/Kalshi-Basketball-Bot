here now first team selection what does he bring to the table in here too Ill tell you baby T special hes the straw that stirs the drink for Coach Cates came back for a sophomore campaign hoping to put the wolf pack on his shoulders and lead him to the NCAA tournament this year a second ever meeting Austin P at NC State and we tip things off here at PNC Arena all the hands of the new point guard jarquel Joyner the Ole Miss transfer well talk a lot about that tonight he is special one of my favorite players uh early on in the season three transfers two returners and Kevin Keith starting lineup theres doosan with my horses down low and hes fouled early by Elijah Hutchins Everett he can do some damage down low he can step out hit the midrange you know last year they didnt have that presence inside where they could throw the ball for a bucket this year they have multiple opportunities Kevin Keith subscribe to Sean MO horchus is a bull in a Chinas shop hes assertive hes aggressive for the sixth tier head coach and an opening bucket for to play Beyond Smith okay he can do it all you know what a great freshman year he had hes coming back his sophomore year theres things that he wants to work on and uh be a little bit better playmaker get other people involved everybody knows he can score Smith met with multiple NBA teams this offseason they talked about point guard play leadership things he wants to work on in year two and that happens you know with a little maturity thats something that youll see theres a great freshman last year Elijah Hutchins effort into the body of more horseshoots for the land hes their goto 611 Letterman scoring rebounding last year and he got a bucket early on keep an eye out for that possible flop thatll be a new call in college basketball but nothing called and starting five for Kevin Keith who noted Smith and Joyner the guard positions off balance look for Cameron Copeland hes part of the Austin Peay starting five the governors with Sean Robinson a transfer guard leading the way and Smith wanted to foul there on the airball Cameron Copeland he switched numbers from 24 to 41 but he returns into starting attack you never know why somebody would switch numbers you get that number dont you get comfortable with it well of course your numbers hang in the Raptors here in Raleigh so you speak from experience huh talk to Kevin Keiths pregame so many new faces what do you want to see he said Team Basketball maybe overstated but with so many new faces thats hard to find in the first five minutes yeah theres no question you want to be able to pass the ball get everybody involved and thats one thing I think youll see from this guard deal youre gonna see one of the best guards out there he goes Zach Park and the slam for check Barnes heres another new guy that can really step out and strike the bar hes got a beautiful shot really nice pickup in the transfer portal for uh coach Keats in the Wolfpack Clark is a transfer from LaSalle hes an explorer fittingly at the South comes down from Pennsylvania scored 10 points at a double double and the exhibition win over Lees McRae the different competition tonight I tell you what he shoots the ball it looks like its going in even when he misses it always looks good theres an open threepointer foreign for the boards here Marcel thought he had it called NC State basketball how about the presence of Jack Fox early yeah Jack Clark gets into passing Lane creates his own offense and flushes it home Mark is 22 years old one of three 22 year olds in the NC State portal that came in for Kevin Keith he wanted age in the transport you cant overstate Evan how important that is when you have guys with maturity and theres 53 Fox can shoot it out there the Kirby and Smiths going to create a lot of people crowding them and uh Smiths going to be the one whos really going to be the beneficiary of that because he can knock it down sniffing 96 threepointers the most by a freshman since JJ Redick at 15 years prior Mr true freshman Papa Roy the point guard for Austin Peay returning starters for the governors and an early turnover now thats the style of basketball Kevin Keith wants to see theres no question join her on the defensive end is as good a defensive point guards youre going to see hes strong hes the one thing coach Keith said about Joyner is hes so vocal and thats something they didnt have last year so joyners really been the one guy that I think has stepped up in preseason and really shown that hes going to be a Difference Maker so winter handles the point in this office Mr quavion Smith show last year theres an all ECC freshman look at the horses going to work and hes crypto to stay here yeah dushans a tough guy hes going to give them solid minutes theyve got DJ Burns they drag transfer that will come in has got great offensive ability so theyve got a lot of nice older pieces that they can work with down to six even double hardships praise space beautiful player great team by Joyner Lucian took it up with the left hand hes big and strong and creates his own space inside look at his drive by Perkins nice dish and Hutchins everard who scored 15 a game last year for Austin Peay a real nice touch with a little jump rope hes got a real big body in that 611 he can get that shot nice start from defense he stayed two or three from downtown were shooting it well Joyner is a veteran you know Ole Miss transfer hes been in a lot of SEC games so this is nothing new for him Joiner shot 35 from three last year tough driving and the tongue thats Sean to Rogue duragordan thats an awful lot of Queens thats a nice cut back door nice pass ScoobyDooby dear where are you for Gilbert Gordon the foul here was sentenced to gray four minutes in NC State leading by six and Nate James for Austin P looking to make some adjustments when we come back own every mile at the Hyundai getaway sales of our first look at Austin Peay head coach Nate James in his second year for the governors great connection to this area a former Duke Blue Devil as a player national champion and spent 13 years on the staff winner coaches chefski now he returns to Rally here tonight no question Nate was a great player at Duke but then went on and was uh coach Ks longtime assistant so the knowledge that he has that he brings to Austin T is just incredible Nate played in nine different countries overseas as a player he loves to build that professional mentality with his rosters got that National Championship too thats something special banners certainly mean a lot in this neck of the woods here in Raleigh North Carolina tonight NC State was a transfer ridden roster and DJ burns the winter badge gets his first truck to tell you what a nice Soft Touch by the big guy but Smith with the nice dime inside now the defensive pressure from Joyner thats an over and down thats where Joyner does and uh I mentioned a little earlier offensively hes solid hes a great leader but its his defense that does it beautiful look and soft touch the big guys got great feet great hands nice soft touch can really score on the offensive end Burns was the big South player of the year last season for Winthrop twotime conference Champion an illegal screened on burns for Eternal he got him yeah he just hip checked him a little bit needs to be a little smarter now the question for burns this year his offense is Elite how will his defense translate well hes gonna he needs getting a little bit better condition and thats something that coach Keats will monitor youre not going to see him play long stretches of games but hes too talented offensively to keep him out of the game you know defensively you may see NC State play some Zone uh when hes in the game theres the mismatch Hutchins Everett missed the three and burns like a teddy bear wrestling away thats a big body out in transition to Smith cant hit the three tell you Smith didnt knock that down but what a great look of head pass by George and more ball pressure Marcel knocks it out so whens her cleaveon Smiths hitting threepointers thats a nice balance for the software theres no question you know baby T can really score no doubt about it its going to be all the other things that he brings to the table this here thats going to make this pack team different wavy on Eighth in the conference in scoring last year as a true freshman threepointers was his strength we know to nearly 100 triples now a steal CDT is loose idiot timeout Austin B etty theyll take the timeout turquavion Smith taking over five points in the blink of an eye for NC State look at the wolf pack sophomore shining tonight Applause foreign Smith is a freshman 23 of his 35 games in double figures Theory since was seven points in the first six minutes he can score he scores in bunches scores fast and he scores so many different ways theres a real special player on the offensive end to charge eight to ten shootings back tonight Austin P needs to settle down and turn the ball over they need to just settle down get into the offense and the Wolf Pack doing a real good job with the defensive pressure four early turnovers for the governors whos Fauntleroy works for health questions Everett backing down Burns for the clock at four and he traveled five turnovers how do the governors handle this pressure of NC State well it stopped you know they may want to get a high ball screen or something theres so much pressure on the uh point guard sometimes if you can alleviate that pressure with coming up setting a pick but the Wolfpack doing a great job turning up the heat last years starting point guard Carlos Paez hell come off the bench for Austin Peay tonight number one in the black look at that baseball pass to Marcel and he draws a foul on Sean Duru Gordon Marcels any question this year as a case study from Virginia quite a ton of minutes but not a big impactful offensive player how would that develop in your fine you know hes so solid he does so many things well for the pack I mean defensively always gets the toughest assignment he needs to be more consistent he needs to take his offensive game up another level if the Packs gonna really be able to make a run and uh do something special this year theres a special talent Smith sending it out to Marcel a fight for the board stays with NC State Joyner pops a three that was his first Miss of the night but another rebound look at this tussle for the boards yeah alderone comes up with it NC State hitting the glass hard six rebounds early now Elijah Perkins The Freshman point guard the heaviest block Ed yeah thats not what Austin P wants we want to get settled down they dont want to go oneonone and Smith has gone for the foul okay theres a lot of excitement the first game of the year for these players coaches the fans and uh NC state has really answered the Bell early on Calderon a thousand points in his high school tenure part of a young roster for Austin team eight softboards three freshmen for Coach Nate James Fauntleroy thats a tough look burns the board State shooting 62 percent a wide open look here it continues thats a three nice knock down by Casey Marcel but the pass the penetration from Joyner and then the Wolf Cross Court thats beautiful basketball and the amount of open looks in the Florence and the NC states capital everybodys sharing the ball and uh getting after it its a balance of pick in the pocket and earning those fouls as Joyner heads to the bench a good little start to his career at NC State knocking down shots hes got uh four assists off to a great start this is tenno spurt holding Austin Peay scoreless for three and a half minutes a Governors team that had a tough year at the end of the season eight and ten in the ovc and switched conferences this year in the Atlantic Sun the likes of Liberty in Queens University conference reliable you have to keep your note card with you to keep track of whos where these days between the conference realignment transfer border I mean its game has changed finally gets an offensive rebound and they get stripped underneath and gets called for the travel but I know you know coach James wants them just to kind of settle down get a little more Rhythm you know this is what happens you go on the road first game of the year you got Jitters um he didnt want to be down 226 early but a lot of that has to do with the NC State pressure theyre uh putting on the Austin Peay Kevin Keith Coast has been Freon pass the sophomore to Reidsville North Carolina enters Jay Burns operating in the post the fade away that is soft thats just a feathery touch from the big fella and again you know thats something that last year NC State they couldnt throw the ball inside and get a bucket theyve got guys inside that can really you know score and this will send us to break early NC State on a hot streak 67 from the field up by its pens tonight with TJ burns the Winthrop transfer going to work in Raleigh holding Rock sorry its an aging roster and jarkel Joyner Jack Barnes who shot maherchiefs DJ Burns joined the party when they graduate 45 points of scoring and replace it with nearly identical amount thats a nice presence for NC State no doubt about it you know its one thing to get a transfer and youre seeing all these schools now go out in the transfer portal but when you can go get four guys like this that have been there these are grad transfers theyve been in battles and Wars those are the kind of guys that you really can depend on you know youre not taking a chance on a guy you know these guys can play someone like myself pursuing a masters right now grad schools tough Its No Easy Task let me tell you school was tough for me elementary was tough for me yeah glad to have you here Chris corciani Im Eva mudgevich from Raleigh North Carolina nice penetration and burns there to clean it up unfortunate a nice roast strong move to the bucket but couldnt finish Austin P three of ten shooting but six turnovers early Smith putting on a tripling display I cant hit yeah thats one that coach Keats doesnt want inside the starting point guard for Austin P last year Carlos Paez out of Venezuela and burns two for two but Ill tell you what hes got a feather I mean when he releases it looks so nice DJ Burns was the 10th player in Winthrop school history to have a thousand points in three seasons thats hard to do yeah you dont see many guys with the touch uh that he has the footwork hes got great hands is just going to be an offensive Force really reminds me of Zach Randolph an oldtime NBA player they used to call the Junkyard Dog he does bring some toughness to NC State one of four grad transfers in the portal Hawk down to six Hutchins Everett blocked by Burns theres two Zach Randolph defense leads to an open three Burns plays on defense back not gonna run the cord back and forth dont cherry pick on D lady that was steal get back and a foul on Paez to foul on the floor Music all things considered a spot quiet yeah great strip my baby T goes down gives it up thats one where Breon probably should have went ahead and tried to finish but pies got underneath could have been dangerous for Smith there two steals for turquadion Smith who Subs out 10 minutes in his first breather its Raquel Joyner hell reenter at the point guard position Music you know whats really nice for Coach Keats hes got pass Joyner and Smith all interchangeable nice pass to Ross hes not very close on his first three Ernest Ross only played 14 games last year getting The Kinks out early hes got a huge upside Evan you know athletically I mean he can run and jump hes very physical he just needs to take his game up another level and Kevin Keith says we got to put that a little closer to the basket his reaction tells it all exactly he doesnt mind his team shooting though this is 172 run Now set this off in fueled by defense forcing five turnovers no touch easy tonight for Elijah Hutchins Everett the allfreshmen stand out in the ovc and theres the second bucket hey that was a nice touch thats a first good open look they got listen to this round of applause for DJ Burns heading to the bench were in a crowd really liked the way he got after it you know he played great on both ends of the board made some nice stops on the defensive ending had a couple buckets on the offense then you see the boards of NC State students tonight theyre excited for college basketball here in Raleigh its a great time of the year the first game all the excitement and optimism and Ernest Ross joins the party so he fakes the three after the Miss and he drives for two yeah hes got a big upside you know you see a drive like that very athletic great slasher and that hes worked extremely hard in the off season he wants minutes out there and uh bounce back from an ankle injury to the kick ball on Jack Clark you know the NC State pressure though defensively very impressive yeah no doubt thats been the difference of the game so far in the first 12 minutes is it NC States really suffocating Austin P not let him do anything NC States created a lot of easy buckets because of their defense Austin P only committed 12 turnovers a game last year seven in this first 12 minutes look at this lob the Hutchins effort nice spin move and Ross commits the foul thats his first its a real nice entry pass inside theres no weak side help by the pack goes up on the ham there got him on my hand not the high five you want no not that one hey you know with Austin P right now theyve got six eleven six nine and theyve got a really big front line youre not going to see too many front lines as big as awesome hey Austin P wants its first Power five wins since 2011 in Knoxville Tennessee Governors made the NCAA tournament in 2015 so recent history Hutchins effort up to eight points you know for coach they you know its going to take him a while to get in players and hes gonna have to hit the portal but you know the knowledge that he must have just being around Coach K all those years its you know its not going to be surprising if he gets it going there Nate James is also high energy on the bench too watching him interact with his team former Duke player learned a ton under coach Mike shazewski his teammates were incredible Carlos Boozer Mike Dunleavy Jay Williams a lot of Talent on those two teams in the old 2000s hence the national championship certainly doesnt hurt by the way this is the 40th anniversary season for NC State of its last title in 83 coming up for the spring yeah that was a special year never thought uh youd see that the cardiac pack and now you see North Carolina is one of the national champion favorites preseason all ACC with a ton of votes and the number one team coming to the country yeah theyve got four out of five starters back from a great run last year like you know the ACC is going to be loaded from top to bottom to be a great great fun year NC State picked 10th for the conference looking to bounce back yeah I saw that and I think theyre better than Tech you know I dont think theyre in the top third but you know I think theyre certainly better than half the teams in the conference and shot clock violation if you play defense like that NC State could be pretty good Casey morsel in this defense playing well for NC State Music Applause being a student and enjoying some home atmosphere tonight NC State playing a PNC Arena we have four home games early DJ Burns finding a nice new home here in Raleigh the grand strange thread of the win for a training conference player of the years looked impressive tonight with eight quick points no doubt about it came in his six minutes have been impressive for rebounds got six points and a very nice idea you know when youre a newcomer you want to make an impression right away and DJ certainly has this is the first day of class for many of these students theyre excited theyve been battling and fighting and lifting weights and running Sprints theyre finally happy to get out there against another team charcoal Joyner one of those new additions out of Ole Miss on a switch with Elijah Hutchins Everett gets to his spot the hat is a pretty throw thats his game his midrange game is as good as anything he does great off the dribble gets inside uses his big strong body to create space and hits the Fatal watch its really impressed with this game and to go back to curtain chords you met him bring it and said hey you see my banner up there that was pretty good I didnt say that I can tell you that no they asked him how was coach Watkins formal introduction yeah Levi said he met this guy and he said no sir super nice guy here you go with Casey oh give it up I tell you that Evan the thing Im most impressed with the two things one is the defensive efforts but also the way NC States chair in the basketball I mean everybodys getting involved theyre really making the conscious effort of hitting the open man and thats thats something thats going to go a long way with this team this offense running like the Gonzaga Bulldogs the nations leader in assists last year nine dimes on 14 buckets on this shot on the iso ball Music Kevin Keith could not have scripted a better start for his wolf pack as Joyner joins the party he has seven youre gonna love him that kid can really play that back court was Smith and uh Joyner thats got to be as good a backboard as any in the ACC they both handle the ball they both can score and they they both defend I think some folks in Chapel Hill may have a thing or two to say about that theres a jumper for guy Fauntleroy I dont know what youre saying theres some great players in the uh ACC great back courts but theyve got to be up there with any two the thing that Joyner really brings to the table is the leadership in the vet the veteran leadership pick your names like alondis Williams of Wake Forest Paolo bonquero Duke last year some of the greats maybe these two could join them Orchards kicks it out and Marcel hell be given a lot of open threes this year shot under 30 percent last season yeah theres going to be a lot of shots hes going to have to knock down he said hes going to have opportunity because Smiths going to draw so much attention and the amount of near misses for Austin P a little frustrating tonight for Coach Nate James yeah finally he did the hard work getting there he just couldnt knock it down I Fauntleroy out of Front St George County Maryland Joyner goes lefthanded for the N1 oh boy that is a beauty right there Abracadabra kind of took him off the dribble I didnt I thought he was in a tough place like a great magician make him look one way finish the other oh thats a beautiful finish thought he was in trouble late there and then he kind of scooped it up with his left hand thats just uh thats David Copperfield action going in his his bags dark Hill Joyner from Oxford Mississippi of course we know to the Ole Miss but Cal State Bakersfield the road runners to the rebels to the wolf pack yup tell you credit Levi Watkins a great player here at NC State that came back one of the new additions our coach keeps his staff that was his recruit and Coach take me through that an entire new coaching staff under Kevin keates yup revamped it reloaded thats a hard transition from one year exactly for a head coach thats tough you got new coaches new players but the thing that Levi did immediately was bring Joyner and whenever you can bring a player of that caliber thats worth your weight and going Austin P continues to shoot 31 percent and stepping out of bounds a turnover for Elijah Perkins you know coach James cant be happy theres just no rhythm theres nothing thats really flowing for Austin P and again his first game but NC States really turning up the heat on the defense advantage Music on Smith reenters the game he has seven points he quickly has nine Ill tell you he slashes to the bucket and hes such a great athlete he can finish at The Rim hes so fast he makes fast people look not so fat I know one thing Id hate to guard him when I was playing I always like guarding the slow guy I would never want to guard the turbian out there look for Drew Gordon and pinks at home a nice shot went off the long foot but was able to bank it in that Dirk Nowitzki look just outside the paint Sean Jim regarding a Missouri transfer big Edition for Austin Peay this fall Governors have a tough week coming up South Florida Albany a couple ACC foes in the nonconference Allen transitioned through well horses flying around and hes fouled well take the time out NC State up 25 here in the first half welcome back to college basketball well thats the thing about claims in 25 points for the newcomers tonight very productive in the debuts of these four NC State players no doubt about it theyre off to a good start thats what you want you know youre excited first game of the year and uh they came out signing and thanks coach Keith got to be really impressed with uh the way theyve played counter that with all the turnovers scores doubledigit mistakes for us to be tonight I realize its a Michael cost right youre playing 17 minutes of basketball but if this can translate to 17 games you never know what you can get yeah you need to find consistency youre going to play better teams better players but you know tonight theyre off the Good Start you know last year they struggled in these type of games and uh this year thus far theyre taking care of business Music gilro Gordon slips it inside is giving up very little easy looks tonight down to 10 Robinsons height for the ball in the post and a nice jumper thats okorugu okro Music it was a nice shot I think like you mentioned they havent had a lot of open looks credited NC State but there they did and knocked it down freshman out of Bronx New York Music the interesting lineup That Keats has in here hes got three guards which uh that was tipped so no travel but Smith does give it away three guards and a couple bigs its an interesting lineup one that we might see a lot this year zero threepointers tonight now the lone steps back and a late whistle so we have a flopping foul so this is the new rule in college basketball here if you are called for the Flop it is a one free throw flagrant foul does not count against your personal fouls but the refs will now review this and check if there is a flop well I wish they had that rule when I was playing playing against some of the teams we played against they were flopping left and right but uh I think its a great rule to have in basketball itll really create more offensive movement without people and doing all these type of things so so heres the explanation the call is confirmed and its one free throw possession stays the same it doesnt change hands with with the fountain and this will explain it perfectly you get one warning then that class B technical foul which is the one free throw I like it I think its uh something thats going to be good and you know go out and play ball you know people dont they dont like the flopping so is that a flop then call it looking for a family yeah I think you got foul though he was a former player youve been in those moments right I think that if youre youre flopping and you dont give out but they did make the call I mean theres going to be a lot of judgment kind of calls here and there uh hopefully its not something I could use but I think that the player knows the potential for the call to happen thats a good thing because now the player is aware of what might happen yeah quavion Smith back to the free throw on his 12 points with that made bucket double figures with ease for the sophomore point guard he almost has as many points as Austin key here with two minutes to play Roy on the switch Music on cam Copeland he wants a foul and knocks it in nothing nothing easy for Austin P you know they took the shot clock down the very few and then hit a tough shot open the transfer from college at Charleston transferred the friendly balance in Raleigh okay thats as pretty a shot as youre going to see when he releases it its just beautiful this ball was all over the place fakaroy lobs a foul here Im a hardships wait an offensive okay no it is the foul Im a horse first free throws dushan a bit curious why he was called there look like and looked like Duchamp was just trying to get out of the way there he went up and almost flushed it right down on him these attempts are only the third and fourth free throws to Austin P tonight its been a physical game I tell you NC States done a great job of a pressure in the ball without foul thousand you see some teams pressure and theyre playing hard but theyll fouling 70 feet from the bucket puts the team in the bonus so youve got to play smart basketball while youre Flushing John Robinson the San Jose State transport theres one or two keep an eye out tonight if a team the opponent misses a first free throw this crowd was absolutely Bonkers to try to miss two in a row free food is on the line that changes the game for a college student its full pressure by fataloy and hes off of the foul on Joyner I tell you finding Roy was like Joyner youve been on B hounding me on this side that was some great defense that he applied on Joyner NC State University 44 from the free throw line and now with a bonus for the rest of the final minute of this first half you know its interesting nowadays with the transport portal is you know how theres so many new faces and how they gel and the one thing that coach Keats told us before the game was these guys really like one another that they had the opportunity to go to the Bahamas and then they had all summer working out he said this team is is close which is really difficult when you have all these new transfers and all these new players coming in or Brad transfers combining for nearly 30 points in this first half and you lost me at Bahamas I spent a week playing two games down Nassau on a bad trip team bonding in the summer steps back and a nice tip and theres Robinson climbing the ladder okay Robinson went up and got after it very athletic player but uh great effort there getting his hand on it and getting the tip 10 second difference shot in game clock Burns in the post a big man on a mission I mean Ive already seen when he catches the ball he takes a dribble he almost creates enough space so we can turn with the baby hook this is a beautiful offensive game a perfect shooting night and burns debut with a Winthrop transfer Copeland with six thats a bit strong the shooting woes continue for us to be Joyner called offensive and this pie is sliding in yeah Im not so sure about that but uh when youre up 4921 a lot of those close calls go uh remember the new emphasis in college basketball back pedaling is considered holding ground I love to play The Devils Advocate with you of course absolutely that shackle strong at halftime to close things down NC State transfer driven and the seniors are stepping up tonight Joyner right there with 12 points DJ burns with eight Off the Bench a balanced scoring night or 17 thats tough tough for them but you know a lot of these kids that go to Austin P and some of the mid Majors thats what they want they want to be able to play in the big Arenas against the big teams and uh youre gonna get that right away lets not forget the biggest moment coming up for the governors tomorrow election day and again across the United States Josh monk our producer with a great bug to remind us at halftime get out and vote if you can tomorrow absolutely fight my vote for all ACC right now its turquavion Smith great lob Deshawn Robinson Ill tell you Robinson really got up by the rim he was about two feet Above the Rim to lay it in Sean Robinson is a jumper Ole Miss San Jose State now Austin V in his third score in four years Marcel hits his first three you know thats what for more of baby T with the penetration everybody collapsed and kicks it to Marcel and he knocks it down beautiful thing another three for Copeland in transition rain and buckets in the second half I dont know what Nate James said at halftime but they came out its two nice sets and two buckets Austin Peay huevion Smith asked to pass more this summer but he shoots it looks pretty good okay he scores in so many different ways thats the thing he can beat you off the dribble he can knock down the shot slasher just has an unbelievable ability to get to the basket and score when he wants to eighth in the conference and scoring last year thatll only continue to rise in year two Robinson oneonone I was really deep too when he missed it how does Jacobian Smith develop as a pastor you had a thousand assists in your career when youre going to the bucket like that he may never no its more a mindset you know hes got to uh hes always been a scorer in high school in the first year had a great uh freshman campaign but thats something that comes over time and the NBA Scouts have told him listen we want to see can you make the other four better here you see him just slashing its just so easy for him even his eyes on that play though hes looking off the defender and finds a way to school yeah its just an ability that you cant teach that thats just the godgiven ability and he is so talented but when the NBA Scouts say listen we want to see you make the other four players with you better thats what hes going to focus on because thats his ultimate goal as NC State forces another Austin P turnover thats 12 tonight Smith there was the fourtime Freshman of the week in the conference that may be the next step for him becoming a pastor and a leader for this program theres no doubt you know his sophomore year hes got one year under his belt he knows he can score he now wants to win in order for the Wolfpack to go to the next level hes gonna have to do a lot of things a lot of scoring a lot of passing it was bad talent that can do Elijah Hutchins ever cleans up the board he has eight points and two rebounds tonight we were Gordon is blocked Joyner lays it off to Clark Music goes off NC State okay Clark didnt knock it down but just a nice play by Joyner thats the kind of thing that you really want to see out of your point guard he just penetrated down set the table for park because he knows Clark as a point guard you have to know who can shoot and who cant he knows that Clark is a shooter youre going to see him finding them a lot Music Austin peays shooting just 40 percent searching for offense in the second half Sean Robinson Stripped by Smith traquavion lays it ahead beautiful Play Beauty very unselfish thats one that Smith could have taken down theres NC State pressure creating another terminal 14 giveaways for Austin Peay Music beautiful play Here by uh to Kirby and he could have taken it but you know what Im gonna help out my back court mate get it give him an easy 30 combined points between those guards love to see it and with the with the loss of Darion sebran from last years team meeting that guard oriented scoring bucket Smith bank at home but hes strong theres a difference hes not real big but hes strong when he goes in there gets banged and is able to finish how many guys can take that kind of bump and score Smith put on 10 pounds of weight in the offseason strength coach Pat Murphy beefing him up Pat Murphys as good as there is hes gotten all these guys a lot bigger and stronger and he had one opportunity for Austin B great drive for guy Fauntleroy who showed some strength on that finish Music theres a nice strong but strong drive up and over for the bucket Fauntleroy starts it and Smith finishes oh thats just beautiful Hang Time not only does it get banged on the shot he just hangs in the air and says hey look how strong I am you ever play air hockey I love it down in downtown relax floats like hes on an airplane floor it just Glides around the pool my girlfriend beats me every time I love it you got to win those battles right exactly you need to do keep them happy right a good kick out to Clark thats great teamsmanship I know its been jumping thats just good basketball Evan right there again unselfish basketball is always a positive thing a traveling violation night one turnover woes for Austin Peay tonight thats 15 giveaways taking the first 24 minutes there cant be a lot that coach teaches me about on the defensive end the pressure the rebounding on the offense again everybodys sharing the ball you know thats a film that you want to watch more than once after the game as a coach all leading up to Friday when the fighting camels come to town theres a scrap of the paint and itll stay here DJ Burns knocked down Kevin Keats in year six one of the difference making rostery goes to the transfer portal so far so good in the first 25 minutes Smith has fouled on the three youll head to the freethrow line no thats the one shot hes capable of making it but you dont mind that shot from baby teeth late in the shot clock early in the shot clock thats probably one that coach Keats doesnt want him to take but he got Bail it out there getting foul Music Smith was a 70 free throw shooter last year misses the first and Sir quavon looks to fill some big shoes in terms of returning scoring look at the history in the last seven years not having that returning leading scorer backtoback years an opportunity for Smith to take those reins this year yeah theres no doubt about it you know its hard when youve got one guy leading you one year you know but having him come back when he decided to come back for a sophomore year and didnt go to the NBA I mean what a what a great uh thing that was for Coach Petes in the wolf pack and now hes hes here he wants to win here lets talk to him not all about him he wants to make an impact and once have a legacy on this program the caveat to that graphic Darion C Ron though the team in scoring in the regular season but Smith and ACC play put up 18 points yeah very few players the average 16 during the year in all games that had 18 most players go down in ACC but Smith went up with his scoring production DJ burns with a big rebound look at Smith Palms fort in transition Marcel through the middle of it good strong move what was nice about that under control kind of took his time when at his Pace used his strength to score nice move from Elijah Hutchins ever now he has to get back defensively as the wolf pack shooting 65 percent hes a pure point guard he is fun to watch under control finds the open man for the slam no easier looking than that time out on the court Tennessee State riding a 70 run early in the second half the wheels just keep on turning for Kevin Feast Club this squads rolling tonight Applause Music on a national title at Duke he spent 12 years with Coach Mike and here this week reunited with the Duke head coach they practiced on Duke stamp whos leading into this game yeah how cool is that to have Coach K there in practice where he went to school who do you love hearing stories like that where a players plays there coaches there then comes back is able to use the gym to work out just a just a really good story even assistant coach Brett Carey grew up with UNC Asheville under coach Eddie beat Embark exactly thats right spoke to him before the game and great connection to the state of North Carolina I told him I said tell coach biedenbach that I was ripping on him because Eddies a good friend of mine great player at NC State back in the 60s and uh great coach at Asheville really some good solid teams theres a steal for Austin Peay The Freshman point guard Perkins drives in Im a horse which rises above got numbers its been a fastpaced game for Kevin Keats Club its Way Beyond Smith drawns second team foul in Austin Peay and well take another quick media timeout NC State continues a hot start on opening night well have plenty of basketball when we come back stay with us here for the Journey of dushan mahorsich from Lewis College to Mobley Community to Illinois State to Utah and now on his grad here to NC State covering all three of the four corners of the country in a adventurous fiveyear Journey hes been all over the place Ill tell you about a guy like that is has to be able to go into programs adapt and hes not scared you know he brings a certain toughness to this club that coach keeps really he said this kid is tough hes not backing down from anyone and hes doing his threeyearold from Belgrade Serbia brings toughness as a Miss for more cell from three but a tough night for deep two of five for Casey hyper looks he may get all season but the amount of scores NC state has around him hes a capable score he just needs to have a little more confidence know that you know thats a shot he can make and like you said hes going to get a lot of good looks higher spins with seven nice look oh dunk thats a great look by piezy put it down on the floor got into the lane and saw the uh breaking awesome p player for the flush offensive foul here on Breon pass and nothing makes me smile better than a Princeton backdoor cut for a dog there you go thats beautiful the flush what a great athlete just finishes at The Rim passed a space let Robinson go to work yeah you dont see that in basketball as much I was talking to the awesome p coaches before the game and they said the one thing about Piazza said hes tough hes a Venezuelan kid and he doesnt back down from anyone you saw right there put his face right in uh Brian passes elbow and said you know what Im not backing down Im ready to Flyers is a sports broadcasting major theres some Olympic sports in the spring for his Club be taking our job in a couple of years on that mess that wont be hard Ill tell you that I dont for me shes Way Beyond Smith brings this crowd to life say again he could score in so many different ways plays with such great confidence I mean its amazing to watch him out there 22 quiet points for turquoivion tonight Hutchins effort bangs into mahorsich Smith Music look at this threepointer from distance with the foul Ill tell you he is so much fun to watch he floats out there he just kind of finds his way hes like a surgeon and then he rises up and hits a deep three boom step back three boom theres three and then and let me give you three more with the chance to make it a fourpoint play Ill tell you hes a surgeon out there and hes really fun to watch 96 threepointers as a freshman he has three more tonight two pretty ones back to back the thing that makes Smith I mean hes so confident feels that he that he or every night and most nights he is but his confidence is one of the things that Im so impressed with also up this point total to 26 in the blink of an eye his career best is 34 in Chapel Hill back in January call Agent Zero action blocks okay Ernest lost he got up off the floor and sent that one back again great athlete just a huge upside here you see the penetration and Ross says not today think of the elite shop Locker at Manny Bates who grad transfer to move on from the program he replacing with some great size and Ross by the way Ross a great clothing store too I know those are having some trouble with finances these days but hard to miss Old Navy Ross JCPenney youre always dressed to the nines whatever your shoppings working by the way your honors to the courts as Paez is fouled hell head to the free throw line for three free throws yeah by the way you got to get built shirts those skin tight formfitting shirts they make you look really good have you seen my gut I know youre heading down to Miami this week so you can get all dressed up to the nines and going down there with my wife because theres a hurricane down there Im originally from Miami and uh gotta go down there and take care of some things and hopefully the hurricane doesnt uh hit us again its after November one the hurricanes are supposed to be well gone Ill certainly send our best wishes to the folks down in South Beach and that whole side of the coast Carlos Paez playing at his 90th career game grew up in Venezuela moved to Kansas for his high school career from nagwanagua Venezuela if you read that said how do you pronounce that name hes hometown checks out with 26 points a trio of wolf pack players come in including DJ Burns foreign I see between Zach Randolph and DJ Burns DJ smiles a lot yeah he does hes hes a big fun kid that really enjoys playing sets a screen from a horses She Bangs it in well hes a tough guy inside when he gets it down low hes just big and strong theyve got three guys like that the blue Sean and DJ and then uh EB luanza here we go off to the races up ahead to Joiner if to finish okay hes a great athlete hes fast and strong he just exploded he was about 20 feet from the basket got to the rim and one dribble and well take the time out NC State playing with athleticism and depth tonight they all get started with Way Beyond Smith look at this young man go to work in the second half NC State doubling up Austin B to their standout sophomore the N1 are pretty to break Applause Music for the 14th time in turquoise period not just 20 points three efficient night yeah did it on uh 13 shots so far nine of 13 you get smooth and just quiet a quiet 26 second ever meeting between these clubs was back to 2009 NC State with Tracy Smith hitting a big threepointer late both pack alltime 252 against members of the asun as Robinson slams it down okay Robinson he gets way Above the Rim nice speed and tell you what hes a good looking player the San Jose State transfer very athletic could be a big presence come conference play time in the asun remember last for the controversy of Bellarmine being in a conference final but ineligible with that D2 transfer rule LaSalle transfer misses a three Burns cleans it up navigates he has not missed all night he turns that shoulder and he creates plenty of space in that little jump book thats really effective Music 10 points in the NC State debut for DJ Burns a number of guys tonight have come out from the very beginning and had nice uh debuts you see Burns that are holding serve in the middle of the lane foreign Calderon cant hit Burns just muscles the ball to the ground just push them away hes a big one my Orchards gets space thats a nice finish yeah nice finish nice speed by plug you know finish with the left hand in there okay Duchamp plays with great energy and emotion the weather is gonna start or come off the bench uh hes gonna have a nice year this year high is gets the friendly bounce thats the guy you have to worry about is the guy with the ball he was in the lane and all the Defenders just skirted and he Baez was able to finish with the left hand Carlos pies played for the u18 Venezuela national team coming out of high school with Sharif Mitchell Creighton and demerius Washington of Kansas state two high prospects Joiner misses a rare three lookupaya is running the point veteran point guard 90 career starts Music youre never as good as your best game ever as bad as your worst game I think thats the challenge for these two well I think a lot you know go alone a lot from this game they tell you theyve had some nice plays they havent put together a sequence both on the offensive defense again but they have had some nice plays back doors dunks so theres some positives that Nate James can take from this James who spent a decade as a Duke Coach and won a national title as a player he returns to Raleigh this weekend a tough sledding heading to Purdue on Friday you know that the hopes of all that is for his team to start learning about one another to come together play in hostile environments then they go back and play conference ball gear up for December 29th against queens and North Florida to start the year exactly you know so theyre theyll take their lumps um yeah get paid to do it you know they get some little payouts on these games and uh but its good for these kids to have the opportunity to play in these type of settings hey James talks about the overall development of his student athletes not just the oneanddone trans but he wants to build from the ground up so insert eight sophomores in his first two years well you know his mentor has done a pretty good job over in Durham over the years so certainly is going to try to leave from that Legacy DJ Burns tried to play volleyball with himself he hasnt missed a shot why wouldnt you shoot it thats technically a miss too so its five and six now maybe the shortest shot of his life I thought it was a pass that he was trying to hit with him he could always review those things after the game and update the stack crew exactly lets keep them batting a thousand Music looks up with five Chucks up a deep three and this scrum goes to Smith Chucks it ahead Marcel spins great space does a great job the one thing about Casey in these situations always under control he goes at his Pace hit him with a nice head fake and then was able to lay it in this game reminds me a lot of Corey mcgetty former Lady LA Clippers back in the early 2000s oh look up look up what up loose ball scrum look at that are you kidding me to have that he knew he had him early then he lost the ball but they have the whereabout to make that pass is incredible thats again thats the maturity that coach Gates wants to see its one thing to have five assists but the behind the back 360 spin for the passports you were a point guard in College of the pros how do you pull that off Ill tell you what you got to know where you are at all times and he certainly did look at this lock and rice glue to home hes a pure point guard Joy Nerf is someone that NC State hasnt had for many years he makes everybody else a little bit better out there right there you saw him with a nice feed a true facilitator for this offense oh give it up oh here you go theres the tongue 90 points in the first 33 minutes okay Coach Keats is going to love the pressure but hes going to love the fact that theyre sharing the sugar everybodys getting involved well if it came for offense it came to the right place here in Raleigh its her quavion Smith with 26 his teams got plenty more to replace 44 points from NC State scoring last year in 30 quadruple header of grad transfers and 48 in the debut of these four new planes well I tell you they didnt waste any time to make a positive impact for the wolf packing coach tooth they all come out and uh really been impressive you know join her to me uh really I set the tone on the defensive end DJ Burns just got a really nice offensive uh efficiency and you know theres a lot to build on Im sure coach Keats has been very pleased Music look at this pressure defensively and Robinson comes up short but Ernest Ross took the worst of that one Music I think he might have got poked in the eye Music looked like there was a scrum for the ball out comes head coach Kevin Keats to check on his forward Music sometimes you get that little finger on the eye and it uh more irritating than anything looks like coach Keats is over there telling him a joke or something got a big smile on his face thats Sometimes the best thing you can do as a coach thats with the light yeah was funny we were talking the coach Keith earlier before the game and he mentioned us both that you know this is the healthiest ball Club he has had day one which is really positive you know in the Years pastors injuries and really sets you back hes been able to really work hard in practice Focus you know the competition has been great and you know when youre healthy you can do those type of things so its good to be healthy to start the year certainly helps with the balance of scoring seven players have got on the board tonight Casey Marcel white left open he said two threepointers tonight something to watch all year long how can he score the dime certainly helps but the foul on the floor thats a blocking foul nice pass to Evie Dewan I tell you EBs a player that was really thrown into the fire last year a little stepped up and had some really good moments you know this year theres a number of bigs that are competing for time but you know Edies one of those guys last year that um you know wasnt expected to play much and he had some very good moments for uh to watch that evidence if you wanted 27 starts with the Manny Bates injury in the opening two minutes yeah open the year last year here at home were on the call for that one as well hows this NC State team going to respond and All Conference forward outs whatever look at that lob Robinson there to clean it up okay Robinson is way Above the Rim hes not just dunking it his head is looking down on it but theyve had some really nice plays in the second half so you know again I think theres some positives they can build off of Robinson plays on pogo sticks he can explode if theres a foul on fights oh Music penetration gets up so high the tickets are made for bouncing thats what figures I can do that on the eight foot goals Im actually way Above the Rim just like Robinson but looks like looks fun to be able to do that you were talking about that pregame too having your hands all Knocked Up hitting the rim and my dad was my high school coach and Id come back and my wrist from bleeding and my dad said what in the heck are you doing I said Im dunking on the eight foot goals before he he didnt like that at all because NC State knocks down its ninth threepointer of the night to pay a Clark shot Evan every time he releases it even if it doesnt make it you feel like its going in just a beautiful beautiful shot Park a double figure scorer at LaSalle last year for the Explorers out of the A10 you had mentioned earlier Casey Marcel is one of those guys thats going to be the beneficiary of all the attention that terbians going to get in Clarks another you know hes going to get some open looks The Supporting Cast behind for Cleveland Smith tonights been really good four and double figures behind this talented sophomore now our first look at Nathan Moore The Wallace State Community College transfer turns it away vote a lot of contact letting the play in the second half and Im surprised there were no whistles there if it goes out of bounds it could have been when its 9342 you let some of that go from time it feels like an Umpire calling a bunch of strikes on the corner plays the game theyve got tackled at half court then there was a collision underneath the bucket but who said basketballs a noncontact support Music Freon pass who was an AllState football standout at Reidsville kicks it outside whats up Browns kind of player that theyre gonna need out there you got your dynamic duo with Joyner and Smith but you know Brianna is going to be counted on for some solid minutes this year probably hit the bottom of the bucket and then got smashed like a PB and J transition for pass who commits the offensive yeah thats one I know Bruno which is the head back he had more cell take the fish off but theyre the kind of things I mean you cant have a perfect game coach Gates had a perfect first half right cant have a perfect game theres things that hell watch sit down you know thats what coaching is you look at the game film you make adjustments what do you want to see then in the in a quoteunquote blowout second half with five minutes left how you evaluate these minutes you just want to stay focused you know you dont want to get to the point where youre doing things that arent going to help you in the future you know you want to stay sound Im gonna ignore the foul for a second and just marvel at the dewottum line okay he got up off the ground fortunately its like a magnet Music okay hes capable of doing that again hell be the third big inside and theres gonna be games were gonna need him in there for the fouls and uh you know last year we got some positive minutes a chicken biscuit is on the line with this free throw yep yeah for 426 I think a lot of the crowd is here just to see this throw line proud did not like that no free biscuits right now and DJ burns with shot in the boosters there he wanted it he knows the tradition Ernest Ross with a Nifty step through and another offensive foul yeah theyre the kind of things that you know coach keeps and he wants to see under control dont let the scorer dictate the way youre playing now because a lot of these guys are out here competing the minutes going forward in the season so play smart play the right way under control how about Nathan Moore in five minutes three charges I dont earn you some playing time some Ace on competition that that is laying your body on the line and doing what it takes you know thats like uh creating three turnovers only eight turnovers friends who stayed tonight youve done a great job of defensively hounding the ball and on offensive side really taking care of it you know when youre taking care of that ball youre allowing the defense not to have any easy buckets its you know its a vital stat whoever turns it over less is gonna usually end up with a W final four minutes of the second half as Pious draws a foul I tell you Paez has had a wonderful second half really good uh passes from some assists and well take the media time out four minutes to play stick around folks Im gonna make Chris porciani laughs DJ Burns learning the New Traditions here at MCC and if an opponent misses two free throws the entire student section and crowd gets a free chicken biscuit but unfortunately for DJ and crew they could not hes over there having a good time he had a big first game and hes rooting on wanted everybody to get the free biscuits is that a part of the broadcast group too absolutely Ive got to take it Im gonna season ticket holder I got a ticket all I have to do is bring it in and look at that Wing from Young kjt did that name sounds smart thats the son of the head coach Kevin Keith Ill tell you his good friends with my son Hugo hes a great kid really good high school player but hes a great kid no biscuits tonight and Carlos Pie has his eyes not yet not yet now in this mans eyes Im curious does he watches sun does he watch the team theres got to be some excitement for his Collegiate debut you do a little bit of both Im sure a coach is uh over there hoping that he gets one up and and knocks it in he hit a real nice shot in uh the preseason game along with LJ Thomas the Freshman checking and some new faces and Chase Graham the rally native comes in tell you when youre up so big you know you let everybody everybody out there is working hard so its nice to see the pressure by Austin P defensively as Keiths catches with 10 KJ drives in contact the other way really good coach keeps on the fence give it to him moving in yeah nice strong drive by uh youll be the judge at home KJ oh hes moving thats a bucket thats Antoine just happens to be good friends with my son so Im pulling hard for him now Kevin says get back on defense get back on defense exactly through his freshman son check it in at Cary North Carolina spent his whole High School career here in Raleigh with his dad taking the job from UNC Wilmington six years ago hes been around the program hes practiced with them and its good to see him out there Ernest Ross runs the break interesting a lot of contact and Thomas comes out with it and gives it away Music the lob whoop not the Clintons final four minutes tonight you allowed the ball to him anywhere around the rim he will dunk it you just cant Lobster him out of bounds sounds like a squirrel on the ESPN APO show Lop Jam a lot of creativity with Robinson down there substitutes a plenty here late in the basketball game including Jordan Snell the two freshman from Panther Creek High School here and his his father his coach now the director of basketball operation so Alex Nunnally checks in another Kerry native good minutes you know usually WalkOns get the last uh 30 45 seconds these guys are getting uh three four minutes final three minutes for a walkon heavy lineup for Coach Kevin Keats open shooter oh thats great good ball movement the reaction Priceless on Jordan Snells first triple yeah Thomas Jr made a nice look to the corner and Snell knocked it down for his first career bucket by the way NC State knocked on the door of 100 points NC States sitting in a little Zone youre going to see a little bit of Zone this year from NC State that foul with two seconds on the clock and thats something historically coach Keats has been do you remember your first basket of NC State no I remember my first assist so Charles Shackleford with a thousand plus assists in her career course some fun fun times and there we go they went to chicken again here called spiders mine is in his career by the way is an excellent free throw shooter 89 at Austin Peay not the guy to choose if you want a free biscuit you know we call a guy like that hes Dependable you want a guy like that on the strike all throughout the game he knocks down too so not getting any chicken three biscuits if hes on the line nine points for bios tonight Thomas the step back rare Miss for NC State 62 percent shooting leaking ahead and a foul not only tripped up Jalen where in Translation and a round of applause for none of them generally you wouldnt want to follow somebody out of control but the crowd has more important things on their mind chicken Austin peayston great from the free throw line tonight Music no wonder if he has any idea whats going on are these fans that crazy theyre happy I missed the free throw lets step aside partner listen to this free throw Music for the home faith you would have thought the game ended on that great Point still two minutes two minutes left NC State on the verge of its 28th home opening win in the last 29 years and a three for Chase Brown ah Chase knocked it down another guy thats been on the team a long time worked extremely hard great practice player loose ball scrum scooped up by Bates we hit the final minute 45 of this game Music this will stay here Austin peace hits just one threepointer tonight how about the defensive intensity of NC State yeah they played great pleasure defense theyve rotated well theyve challenged the shooters its not a lot on the defensive end but they havent gone extremely well Fauntleroy slips in after more tight angle where the bunnies have been tough to come by tonight this is incredible to watch you would think theyre rooting for Austin dude a home crowd has turned on the wolf back here and you would think its 9996 its on the line hey guys Jacob Roberts checks in for Austin P first minutes for the sophomore to Memphis hey thus far everything has gone well for the wolf pack other than free from two two missed free throws 18 of 20 Austin P tonight very efficient heres OJ Thomas a talented fourstar freshman he turned it over is that NBA carry you dont get away with it the college lights oh my goodness NBA carried NBA did take four or five steps kind of do whatever you want to do final minute here on the opening night of college basketball and an air ball Jake for some of the head coach number 13 in white yeah Chase Graham takes it that way and hes fouled he stayed far away from the bonus so theyll take it out there hadnt been a lot of fouls in this game not many free throws not many fouls thats the thing I said earlier Im impressed NC State with all that pressure they did a good job of not fouling Betty of WalkOns checking in and young freshmen Chase Graham a little ISO ball wanted 100 points for that triple hes going to sit back in the 23 Zone Music as Roberts misses the jumper foreign coach couldnt benefit his team to 100 and the crowd begging for a foul in the final seven seconds Roberts drives in no turnover Austin P 21 turnovers tonight at NC State yeah theres a lot to clean up uh you know credit NC State but Austin P they just didnt handle the pressure from the very beginning a wire to wire victory NC State dominates 9950 as Kevin peaceful of dominant with turplay Beyond Smith and crew they start 10 with an impressive home win okay hes got it got to feel good for Coach Gates get that first Victory but also look very impressive the new guy really shine tonight its a very good start for the World Cup hey home opening win friends who stayed in the last 29 years thanks to that young man
