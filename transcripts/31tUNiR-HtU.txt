I think the other guys on the roster has to help him but you got to free him up early you need him in attack mode almost forcing some shots with the way hes shooting the basketball right now Ted Valentine Pat Driscoll Eric Lewis are officials Miami in the home black and pink trim Virginia in the road white Matthew Cleveland Off the Mark and the rebound ripped down by Jacob coffee now one advantage Virginia has early here Miami started a smaller lineup theyve had a ton of lineup changes and right now theyre starting Brandon Johnson at the five heres DayDay Ames got his own Miss T Murray bounces it in and he is making just his fourth start of the Season again due to those injuries to Saunders and roie and you mentioned all of the jumbling of the Miami lineups this is their ninth different starting lineup tonight great thing shot by tan Murray getting the first one to go in getting a confident bounce Cleveland has been a top five scorer in the ACC since League Play began hes only gotten better as the season has unfolded well be before you can lay off of him and expect him to drive but now hes shooting 40 from the threepoint line you got to get up closed out and contest that shot giving him a driving lane and 67 with his athleticism hes scoring at a high level right now Murray taking it to the cup and has both buckets early for Virginia Murray a guy that is the most tenured player on the Virginia roster has stuck it out over the course of his career seeing more playing time than less playing time and tonight makes his four start of the Season Bea puts in a three talented freshman playing out of position so you see the half court offense theyre not running a ton of ball screens with them therere a lot of both teams are running a similar move blocker type action phas screens a lot of pin Downs trying to get offense without having to create so much on their own Here Comes ston McCrae and as you mentioned Bea being relied upon to run the offense for Miami when really hes a pure scorer yes thats what hes recruited for one of the better scorers in high school and this will help him grow and mature in his game having to facilitate run a team Nigel pack still out for Miami hes been out since the middle of December no timetable for his return and it has forced other guys like Bea to play a little bit out of position is Murray is Off the Mark and its going back to Miami gotten a lot of good looks for Virginia if youre Miami you have to do a better job of protecting the paint because if you give up layups youre going to give up threes because of the rotation this was a huge loss for a Miami team that albeit was struggling before Nigel Packs injury but to have him go out as a preseason first team allc conference player massive impact on this team I mean he just you know this team struggles they dont have a point guard right now right and well well get it to the Freshman point guard Devon hogo Chuka he struggles from three and and so hes a freshman that they were going to redir so not having Nigel pack out here just put so much pressure on everyone else and are having a hard time settling down because theyre playing hard enough to get themselves in games and then now theyre struggling with confidence when they when you start losing games like this well we saw that in their overtime loss to KY 9894 highly competitive game for my Miami had chances to win it could not pull it out against the Bears less than 10 to shoot for Virginia Sharma with five deep three from MCN and Blake Buchanan making his first start since mid December wins it back the good thing for Miami is we talked about some of their struggles Virginia doesnt play at a pace thats going to run away from you so if you just compete and defend their Pace will allow you to stay in the game but you got a rebound theyve given up two offensive rebounds early common mistake that teams make when youre playing against Virginia in this pace and their defensive prowess is that you cant take quick bad shots both teams in the midst of two and 12 minutes SC here and both programs obviously miss both of these guys but it really continues a trend that were seeing particularly in this conference was is a Changing of the Guard at the very top it it its bound to happen we had Legends and directly responsible for the time of frame were in right now age all those things factor in but you hate to lose Le in the game and weve done that with K and Roy and lost some Hall of fam which is well 60 Miami scoring run over the last three minutes again Virginia tonight without two of their top three scores who steps up to help McNeely with three on the shot clock its bu Cannon rolling to the rim with a twohand jam right now the way the ball the ball is getting to the the rim of dribble penetration will allow Virginia to get easy shots similar to that they dont get that theyll get a three weeks odd great feed inside to ston McCrae from The Freshman Divine UGA chuku who again as you referenced before our last break intended to red shirt this year yes and that point go we got a sneaky matchup here I think is critical because both teams struggle with point guard play and who wins that matchup between OG chuku and DayDay AES Kyrie huy just into the game with a Nifty floater with the left hand not known as a scorer but he turns over that left shoulder and shoots that hook off the glass dont he doesnt dribble just great job there with the quick hook oh its a Virginia team thats lost six of it last seven including a buzzer beater to SMU a heartbreaking loss for this whos team as McNeely puts in a jumper when youre guarding the Gen you know they theyre going back to that mover blocker offense a ton of movement pin Downs flare screens youve got to youre chasing the entire time youve got to be committed defensively Cleveland Off the Mark in the rebound coffee during many of these losses for Virginia Randol it hasnt necessarily been lack of offense but lack of defense and that was certainly the case in their loss to Notre Dame challenged by interim head coach Ron Sanchez to give more effort defensively theyre still only giving up you know 60 sure Four Points a game obviously coming from Tony Bennett you want you always complained about defense thats coach talk I think their biggest was on the offensive end of the floor when you struggle you only score 61 you put so much pressure defensively theyre doing a great job Virginia getting controlling the tempo and Pace the way theyve always done and they dont have a guy theyve had guys that could close games for them when they going to keep you in close games and thats what theyre Music missing ranking last in the ACC in points per game last in field goal percent AG the interesting thing about the defensive side is this is a team that is ranked inside the top six in the country many years in a row this year theyre still in the top 25 but not quite at that same level that weve seen and thats why I said the offense is the issue because theyre not generating enough points theres no one out there on the floor making the game easy for others its just not coming easy for them theyve always had elite point guard play Reese bman most recently and they dont have that guy right right now and Jaylen warley came in from Florida state was supposed to be that big point guard being able to get in the paint create for others and obviously when Tony Bennett decided to step away then he too decided that he wanted to get in the Porter and move on and left a massive hole in the lineup for Virginia and I think its one of the bigger issues of why they struggled full court pressure here from Music Miami and youll see by committee handling the ball too I know dating game start at the point but youll see MCN youll see T Murray a lot of guys will be involved in ball handling MCN coming off the screen and knocking one in from downtown this why I think this game will go back and forth I think the defensive issues that Miami has youre going to have to defend the movement the screening the physicality of Virginia Miami just has multiple guys that they can give the basketball to to score kid Under Pressure had the pass picked off by Murray uku W it back in the names bringing it up the floor for Virginia L kid checked into the game theyre going to double him when he gets the ball in the post hes an effective scorer with both hands in the paint soon as he checked in the first time he touches it they go to double MCs hot backto back threes and he has scored in double figures in seven of their last eight games including 14 against Notre Dame over the Music weekend Lin kid fighting in the paint with Robinson and an offensive foul will go against Miami mcne is heating up averages two thre the game hes already got that coming off the screen you dont get out cash come off again youre trailing it cash offense has been a staple for Virginia for the last 15 years he get the fade screen there comes back with a pin down MCN knows where his shots coming from there and when youre guarding this team you dont know if hes going to continue off the other side youre chasing youve got to figure out a way how you want to defend that if you want to go off the top screen on the fade did you stop and force them to run across if you do youre trailing on the other side its simple but its really effective offense and McNeilly knows you can win a National Championship here running this offense well he too has been tasked with a bit of a different role this year actually initiating offense for Virginia after all they lost from last year five of their top seven scores including a couple of NBA players he have to I mean he put too much pressure on DayDay games hes still a relatively young player and I think its its helped mcnean with his offense made him more effective off the dribble hes not just a catch and shoot guy anymore how different is that though going from being a guy that you know maybe gets five or six shots a game to being a guy where your coach says hey look go hunt shots even if youre missing those shots well its a great thing if you when the coach tells you to shoot more I dont think any players ever said oh coach I dont want to shoot anymore but no its its this team needs him to be really aggressive hes an efficient shooter like we said hes second in the ACC and percentage in maids and I think the one thing he needs to add to that is he needs to attack to the basket draw fouls get to the free throw line a bit more when youre shooting the ball that well sometimes just shot did you ever have a coach tell you Randolph just keep shooting absolutely never stop shooting stop shooting stop shooting what was that telling me to shoot no no no I I I always had a model if I walked in the gym I was open so thats a good motto to have there you go here is aim for three and puts it in and Virginia all of a sudden on a 90 run responding to Miamis 60 run Miamis got to take something away a lot of trailing on these down screens theyre sticking the screens got to do a better job of get through so they can contest some of these jump shots already four made threes in the first 10 minutes of the game for the hoos and that definitely favors Virginia and we heard coach Courtney talk about that you know that we got to defend the threepoint line Virginias really good when theyre making threes Betha missed him with the left hand right now theyre switching five Miami is lets to see if they can identify the mitm now theyve allowed Miami to get back in their matchups MCN catch and shoot and puts it in from the corner his third triple and mcney in double figures already Midway through the first half cant let a shooter get hot hes knocked down three threes someones got to step up Applause defensively see now hes faking you dont know if hes coming off he tried to cut the screen he fad to the corner again hes a veteran in this offense you just got to commit the Locking and TR being there on the catch you just got to fight through screens if youre dancing and youre unsure hes going to light you up and hes off to a fast start here in the first half had four threes in the lost to Notre Dame over the weekend you talked about it when this Virginia team has been able to make shots from outside they have been a much more competitive and fluent offense mcne again and Matthew Cleveland unable to save it and so itll be Virginia basketball great job there by TJ pow turning down to three to give McNeely another shot Ron Sanchezs team seeking their first true Road win of the Season O and five as he brings mcne to the bench for a breather now itll be interesting to see who Virginia runs its offense through with McNeely on the bench but its still in the move of blocker the pin downs and fade screens the offense isnt going to change Sharma under five to shoot coffee he had a nice game against Notre Dame probably his best game in ACC play very talented freshman and again when you know when freshman these young guys they get to February things start slowing down for him he understands where his points and shots are going to come from within his offense there you saw him flash knocked down a 15t jump shot and Miamis got to be careful because theyre getting punched in the mouth right now isnt getting up pressuring they try to protect the paint by trapping and keeping the ball out of the paint and offensively here theyre going to run their offense hes trying to get the ball inside to Kofi five to shoot for Sharma and a stepped out of bounds on the catch well its still early theres no need to panic but again you know after that performance against SMU you needed to come out and say listen whos on board and whos not and you got to come out compete play with each other and theyre responding I I think their their energy is good you just worry because if they struggled in the past this team would just let it go and they just would shut down and defensively thats just about competing in Pride and at some point whether youre here or youre somewhere else you got to show what youre about and you often tell guys in situations like this youre putting this on tape this is about you as much as it is about Coach Courtney and his staff and everybody taking their their shared responsibility as well late in the clock for Ames one to shoot step back jumper is good for the transfer from Kansas State Cleveland off the bounce counted in the foul you see experience right there I I think Matthew Cleveland identifies hes coming off with his right hand one but theyre not really hedging and showing theyre just standing there then theyre rotating back he knows if I just drive it hard I can turn the corner takes the contact and finishes off the glass he has 30 or more in two of his last three games including 30 points eight boards three assists no turnovers in the OT loss to Cal he was phenomenal against C I think this is the end of the floor where hes starting to take a step you know when you talk about wanting to be a pro offensively hes doing all the right things this this this is the end of the floor where he has to show leadership to a bunch of transfers and young guys that are playing right now Liam mcney fresh back onto the floor had to take a late shot clock three Buchanan for his second put back of the night now Miamis back to the small lineup with Johnson at the five and he usually starts at the four theres a opportunity for the Virginia front Court to take advantage of the on the offensive glass State McCrae lost it defended by McNeely its another careless turnover here for Miami just added to this run theyre sixth of the first half coffee good hesitation sent to Hurricanes flying and lays it in they wanted to get a timeout there wont get it Cleveland trying to take advantage and cannot and now coffee will call timeout we will step aside for 30 seconds a 10point lead for Virginia in the midst of a 20 to5 run 13 hours of college hoops on ESPN on Music Saturday what do you think will it be a friendly return for Coach no no I dont think it will Music be Arkansas just picked up their first win in SEC play against a very good Georgia team who is ranked in the top 25 before losing a handful and another offensive rebound for Virginia they already have seven Second Chance points tonight oh thats set back by Cleveland and now Miami on the Run oh thats rejected by Applause Murray Cleveland off the glass thought they come double Matthew Cleveland there on a post against the smaller back court of UVA he likes that match up right now Murray back door feed and paid off by mcney pady pass by Murray Miamis going to have to switch or go with a bigger lineup right now theyre getting pounded on the glass theres no Rim protection got to keep Virginia out of the paint Cleveland goes to the paint hard with one hand hello constantly in attack mode and you you know hes going right but hes just quicker than you think hes just catching and going been able to bend the corner and get to the rim two or three times here already in the first half has the last couple of buckets for the canes Murray bumps late in the timer again for to shoot Murray takes it all the way to the cup no communication or defensive end by Miami are they switching are they showing Johnson and Cleveland got to communicate there its just too easy on the offensive end right now for Virginia Murray is already nearly doubled his season average in scoring still three minutes left in the first half Cleveland eyeing the clock got his own Miss and floated it too hard with the left hand what happens when you play my of Virginia theyre going to force you to defend on this to guard on this end of the floor 10 20 seconds 25 seconds youre going to use a shot clock theyre never going to rush the tendency is you want to speed the the game up and you take quick shots and fast shots so this is when you get yourself in trouble and Buchanan has had his way in the paint so far tonight again making his first start since the December 22nd and he has experiened starting in this league spent a lot of time starting a year ago hes a versatile offensive player already six points four rebounds no quitting this guy right spot for Miami turns the corner and rocks the rim Matthew Cleveland and Here Blake M Canon says youre too small get to the rim with ease Virginia up early ability improving his shot off the bounce could always catch and shoot its moving off the ball its always been a strong suit and he is hot here in the first half with 11 first half points well weve talked about offense being a struggle for this team right last in the league in both field goal percentage and scoring certainly thats been even more the case on the road where they have yet to win this year great start for Ron Sanchezs team but theyre forcing turnovers here I think another unforced turnover there for Miami you know you dont beat my Virginia by driving the basketball over dribbling two or three dribbles help is coming they tend to overh help and then on the other end theyre just moving the basketball getting good shots Murray knocks down another three that is the sixth of the half for Virginia now with their largest lead of the night and what youre seeing is Virginias offense creates opportunities a lot of movement screening you see them pressuring the basketball here Miami is running their offense at half court one pass a lot of dribbling no ones making a game easy for anyone inside to kid who missed the game against Cal over the weekend nice move in the post to snap a 70 Music run hes got to play more get the ball inside I think the double teams coming this is just too easy Buchanan with an eight early points on four of four from the floor all of them have been dunks or layups you wont get anything easier than that and got to be concerned for the Hurricanes because when theyve been in situations like this in the past they have not competed at the level that you would have liked to see and the double team will come in the next time ly kid touches it Schwarz in and out with the three kid the rebound and the put back is good backto back buckets for the Virginia Tech transfer lot of time left no need to panic I know were still in the first half but this is the end of the floor Miami has to start setting the tone wide openen three Murray no Schwarz the rebound and Miami can play for the last shot if they want great job by Matthew Cleveland just seeing the shot clock again the younger players Miami didnt see the shot clock great job by Matthew Cleveland identifying situation timeout called by Bill Courtney we will take it with him back in 30 seconds for the conclusion of the first half in Coral Gables Music Thursday two more great womens basketball matchups for you F Johnson and number seven LSU host Reagan beers and 13th ranked Oklahoma 7 Eastern on ESPN 2 then at 830 Eastern Audi Crooks in Iowa State take on number 11 Kansas State should be another great night of womens college basketball Bill Courtneys team trying to end the half with a mini run down 13 10 seconds to go and fouls to give for Virginia shortening the clock Miami has to work with 7 Seconds Miamis going to run the same play but Virginia has another foul to give and there it is from Sharma next one puts Miami on the foul line for one and one coaching staff reminding their players they dont have another foul to give Music clearing out the side for Matthew Cleveland with one bway is good for Cleveland to beat the horn and he has 10 bringing Miami back to within 11 after trailing by as many as 15 great job there thatll be difficult to beat for anyone meanwhile limited Miami to just 29 Points and those eight turnover overs that Miami had in the first half all felt like big ones led to 13 Virginia points and some of them were careless turnovers and that in the offensive rebounds have been the biggest difference in this first half seven Second Chance points in the first half for Virginia wont get any there and here comes Matthew Cleveland let all hurricanes with 10 in the first half and see I dont think thats a good possession there you know because when you come down Virginias going to bring it up and then theyre going to get get their offense and youre going to have to guard for 20 seconds you want to speed them up you want to get back in the game just Trip Away you cant have one pass and one shot against this te force force Virginia to guard move the ball multiple sides and someone needs to make a play for someone else right now everyone gets the balls just trying to score inside to Brandon Johnson back out to Cleveland maneuvering into the paint draws a foul on Murray Murray did a good job guarding him off the bounce he knows he want to get to that right hand once he gets to that mid post hes going to turn and shoot his fade away or jumping to you force officials to blow the whistle gets rewarded with two free throws talked in the first half about Murrays excellent rather Clevelands Excellence particularly in League Play and we asked Bill Courtney about that shift and he said his maturity in his everyday approach has taken a jump a massive one I think hes taken a lot of Pride and and taking the onus this isnt his fault whats happened but you know hes coming into his senior year he was expecting to have a really good year and hes you can see put the work in to improve his jump shot and now hes have hes being tested from a leadership standpoint and hes stepping up you know from what the coaching staff beli hes doing a much better job with that right now at times I think hes doing too much but thats just the competitive in him five to shoot for mcney back to Murray and the floater is good how about Tane Murray making his fourth start of the season now with 12 points just getting to a spots there I think its just too easy if theyre not getting threes when they come off the fade screens or the pin Downs their ability to get to the paint off the dribble has been surprised well we knew tonight that Virginia was going to have to have other players step up down Elijah Saunders down Andrew roie two of their top three scores out with injury and it has not all been on the shoulders of mcne no because theyre running their offense and its just the next man up mentality the way Virginias attack attacking you is just thats the next man up Miami right now was relying on individuals to make plays Virginia standing within themselves offensively and the ball is just finding the open guy thats the third foul on the Freshman Jacob Coffey so now Anthony Robinsons going to come on they dont know when Andrew roie will come back he played hurt in the loss to Notre Dame tried to gut it out but it was obvious he was not at 100 meanwhile Saunders is in a boot neither participated in the shoot around today they hope to get both back soon sers was playing so well I thought he was that best player certainly one of the more improved players too and he brings a level of toughness versatility I just thought he was playing at such a high level good rejection there by Robinson fresh in Off the Bench Johnson doubled two to shoot for ston McCrae beats the buzzer with a fadeaway triple over the outstretched arms of the 611 Blake Buchanon great job being in front of the bench I dont think he knew the shot clock bench was yelling for him to get it up sometimes you need a shot like that to go in to get you going its always better to be lucky than good sometimes Music Ames Off the Mark Buchanan another offensive rebound second chance for Virginia Murray pays it off it feels like every time theyve got an offensive rebound they punished them with an open three 10 Second Chance points in the game for the hoos and tane Murray has stepped up in a big way averaging three points per game has 15 to lead all Virginia scores and Cleveland is a scorer when he drives in there hes looking a score to get it up on the glass and hes drawing the foul but someone else has to step up and create Music offense just a great unselfish pass there by MCN a touch pass and T Murray steps into the starting lineup and he is delivering himself meanwhile four offensive rebounds for Blake Buchanan tonight and these are the things that hes done in the past I think the what they missed early was that Kofi just brings a physicality even though hes a freshman hes just a little bit big bigger a little bit more physical his ability on the short rows hes inserted to the lineup but Blake beanan is very good piece and I think a very talented player also he brings a lot of Versatility and length shot blocking ability to this Virginia lineup Applause Robinson doubled ston McCrae trying to win it back and its Johnson coming away with it for the Hurricanes Cleveland takes it to the Music cup really good defense there by Miami tur it into offense theyre starting to switch with the smaller lineup as we talked about they switching trusting link kid to guard on the perimeter Oh What A Hammer by The Freshman Anthony Robinson who red shirted last season and has gotten more playing time as of late its one of the issues with that move blocker there as double team for Len kid comes makes it difficult for Bigs to get in the flow of the game CU every time he touches it inside theyre going to double strong take by Bea who you are very impressed by by his athleticism his natural ability on display there the talent is there I mean hes a very talented player just playing a little bit out of position you want him attacking the rim Robinson went for the poster again was fouled by Bethea Robinson there they step up he right after Christmas its just difficult for the players and everyones staff and theyre just great guys great staffs you wont find better people on either staff and these staffs have been a a much part of big part of their success these programs have had no question in the 2022 23 season the Cavs and the Hurricanes finished in a tie for first place in the ACC yeah both of these interim head coaches were on the STS at the time and so so obviously big discussion amongst these fan bases and really amongst the ACC whats next for both of these programs names have been thrown out as successors to both of these interim head coaches a lot of thats still to be ironed out of course right now theyre just focused on winning games and developing the talent that they have right now but where coach Lena has left this Miami program and the same could be said for Tony Bennett the future is bright for both teams well be right back in Coral Gables be at their respective programs next year but nonetheless Rand off where these programs are at maybe barring this season the foundation is laid for somebody to come in next year and return these teams to National prence in todays Times it doesnt take a long time but youre talking about programs have been spoiled Matthew Cleveland has been spoiling the Miami faithful with Incredible performance after incredible performance during the ACC slate hes got it back to five in Coral Gables and theyre feeding off their offensive end to the floor theyre attens picking up defensively now look where the ball is pressuring the basketball out out near half court Ames with three sharmas got to go offensive rebound fighting for it panan tapped into the hands of Cleveland really good defensive possession there by Miami active saw second third and fourth efforts on the the defensive end to the floor and those are the shots that you dont want just quick does a great job yeah finding a team Johnson and its a one possession game and a timeout taken by Ron Applause Sanchez all of a sudden some life inside the stadium in Coral Gables just a great job there ction getting getting a pass getting out not many better getting up up and away than Matthew Cleveland there thats just a great find ly kid anticipating the double team coming he knows when he gets it theyre coming great job looking over finding the teammate there but its the defensive end of the floor where Miami is stepping up right now thats gotten them back in this game this team has lack confidence when theyve struggled at times theyve struggled early theyve caved it in but not tonight theyve come out theyve competed here dug themselves in a big hole in the first half down by 11 theyve come out the second half and theyre competing cut this lead to a one possession game right now and this allows them to set their defense now they get to set their pressure they go manto man they can run and jump they go Zone pressure back as they sending their defense now manto man full court look out for a one pass and running trap right now Music Miami on a 60 run over the last minute and a Music half mcney bumped and sold it on the foul by UGA chuku and that is number two on the Freshman from Sugarland Texas Mak a great job there just a little overzealous there by the freshman he bumps mcne in the head and hes going to sell that as he should you give him an a for that oh absolutely any sign of contact to the face you go down Im surprised he didnt tell the officials to look at it but look at the way theyre running their offense theres a big difference now a lot of dribbling dra another foul on the drive that will go against Brandon Johnson fourth on Miami both teams with four fouls still a lot of time left to play here in Coral Gables interestingly though because Ron Sanchez had to burn two timeouts quickly Virginia has just one left for the next 13 Music minutes let see if Miami can continue to pressure Kofi inside Tob Cannon who has been excellent 106 six boards hasnt missed a shot both of these bigs on the floor good passers good Stealers they do a really good job in a high low kid doubled kick to UGA Applause chuku thats a great possession there by ly kid really unselfish no the double teams coming I think they need to play through him in the half court when Matthew Cleveland isnt able to attack and finish play through him you get a a chance of get an open look and UGA chuku with a hard foul there his third I think the officials are going to take a look at this he comes down there and its not intended anything but I think theyre going to take a look at it didnt seem on that replay to make any play on the ball no and now Eric Lewis and Pat Driscoll are going to take a peak and I dont think it was a violent foul but to your point by the letter of the rule doesnt make a play on the ball and wraps him up now the one thing that benefits him is that Buchanan was not an Airborne shooter and they will take a look at this in detail as we take a break UGA chuku with his third foul meanwhile Blake Buchanan having an excellent night in his first start since mid December Music welcome back to Coral Gables where Virginia continues to lead by five they reviewed this last foul by The Freshman Divine UGA chukwu on Blake Buchanan it remains a common foul two shots for Blake Buchanan there was nothing exive I think its the right call because he originally went up he just walled up but he knew he was taking a Music foul first Miss of the night of any kind for Buchanan five for five from the floor hes been a monster on the glass seven rebounds for a guy that has been called back into action into the starting lineup due to the injuries to Saunders and roie two possession Game 12 minutes to go in Coral Gables Virginia looking for its first true Road win of the Season Miami trying to snap an 18 game conference losing streak Huga chuku draws a foul and the Freshman is headed to the line theyre starting to make the adjustment and realize Virginias not hedging theyre just showing and theyre recovering to the defender so as they continue to press the ball screen theyre turning the corner now theyre starting to get to the paint and put pressure on the Virginia Defense on the interior good job by the Freshman settling down too well you talked about it early in this game he was meant to red shirt yes you know that was part of the plan that Jim Lena laid out for him when he signed got in started to gain some weight got into the weight program and then because of the injuries and players leaving he was called into action you find yourself in a difficult situation it wasnt expected and for him its great he gets this experience he gets to play a lot of minutes but what I like to see about him is that hes picking up defensively now hes trying to do the the dirty dirty work on the defensive end of the floor cuts it back to four Miami Trail by as many as 15 in the first half see now theyre not punishing him on those screens because theyre switching you see Lin kid outside but the guards got to hold up inside Murray left open puts in a three and his hot shooting continues he has 18 on seven for 10 just a great pass and Skip Music there a blocking foul on Ames its a great find there and Matthew Cleveland got buried inside T Murray makes a play common rule by most teams when you look weak side that weak side defenders feet in the paint and you skip it to that corner hes either going to shoot the three or have really good chance of driving a close out got chuko with five Schwarz deep three put an in from the logo over the top of Sharma great shot there by schz but again great play by The Freshman OG chuku turns the corner finds his teammate on the shake lift up there hes starting to make plays on both ends of the floor now theyre switching everything and its giving Virginia problem they cant get into their all their actions and sets right now Murray to Buchanan met at the rim by kid and a foul is called that is the second on the former hokei just a great job of again using the shot clock theyre going to make you defend SW with the step back shot clock running out thats the second three Miami has made late in the shot clock Applause one more foul for each team and theyre in the bonus the rest of the way one timeout left for Ron Sanchez Miami still with three timeouts and Virginia just continuing to maintain the ever so slight buffer right now at six theyre going to force Miami to these are the shots you got to be careful of Mii you know for Miami one pass one shot and then you comeing on this end and you see theyre sh settling things down theyre going to make you guard and run their offense unless they get a Mitch Match or an easy basket thats the only thing thats going to make them try to score quick McNeely like that match up and is s down of bounds by Johnson who wisely wins it back putting it off the back of mcney great job by Johnson going to get it late blocks comes in down in bounds before he steps out throws it off in Dilly great great defensive effort there no quit in Miami and we thought they fall down a lot early and you question their defensive intiating the pass but you cant question it here tonight Schwarz off the side of the rim good rebounding effort by kid draws a foul on Buchanan and that is number seven on Virginia K usually starts the game and hes coming in off the bench and hes been really effective you dont score a ton of points against Virginia because theyre going to W inside hes made some really good plays hes caught it inside when a double team come comes hes finding teammates on a dive hes skipping it getting it off the offensive glass its always a good sign when your bigs knock down free throws as well as this Miami team is second in the ACC shooting 77 and kid nearly a 79 free throw shooter you dont see that very of you so no you started Im just following up when you laid down dont put that on me watch out Murray takes it to the cup a season High 20 for Tay Murray what a game averaging three points per game this season the senior has stepped up in a big way for Virginia hes saying Roy who coach no worries Schwarz St three again puts it in schaltz is knocked down back to back threes here only shooting 31 on the year he hasnt hesitated on the last two threes and they look really good coming out of his Applause hand look at the defensive pressure on the basketball now what he doing the Virginias offense Kofi saved it got bumped and it is Schwarz with the foul and that puts Virginia into the bonus I love the effort by both teams it shows you they are playing with the level of Pride throw the records out it means something to him all the distractions and everything that both programs have had its great to see these guys competing and a correction on that foul it does not go against Schwarz it goes against brand and Johnson his second and it sends Jacob Kofi to the line well this Friday star studed NBA double header features nicolea yic and the Nuggets heading to Philly to take on Tyrese Maxi in the Sixers then Stephen the Warriors host KD Devin Booker and the Suns NBA Countdown tips off our coverage at 7 Eastern Anthony Robinson check T back in the game for Kofi and Virginias playing with the big lineup inside and you need that with Lin kid hes starting to get things going and get active here becoming a bigger part of Miamis offense keeping the bigger bodies on them UGA chuk kuu almost lost the Music handle Matthew Cleveland sitting on 18 for now headed back to the foul line it will be his fourth trip tonight got to keep him off that right hand he turns that corner you got to send him back left if youre trailing you give him that with his size and athleticism all you can do is foul him that is the fourth foul on the Kansas State transfer DayDay ases well we talked about how hot Cleveland has been he cant miss no matter the kind of shot hes taking I mean you throw it behind your back corner three right now we told you hes shooting 40 from three behind the back thats impressive thats impressive thats a shot I dont want to have to make if a horse game is on the line no Im just going to give you the letter Im going to accept it he cuts it back to four theyre taking away those pin downs and fade screens Now by switching everything and its now is going to force Ming you got to make plays off the dribble now mcney thats a three got lost and lack of communication with swalz he doesnt get out to cover the three and when you switching everything on the weak side you dont need to switch the off screen action first points of the half for mcne a three and Virginia has nine in the game hes the one guy you cant lose they lost him here and hes making him pay Wahoos up seven see knockoff Cooper flag and Duke who have won an ACC best 14 in a row I would feel more comfortable if that game was in a Dean Smith Center to say that uh I I think Duke is one of the top four defensive teams in the country and I definitely think theyre the best in the EC defensively and as long as they they they have this unit to get together them defending the way they are I think theyll be tough to beat I I think a bigger question will be over under two losses in the ACC led by not just one freshman they have three freshman in the starting lineup yes for du Cooper flag is he having the best freshman season youve seen in recent memory I I cant think of another guy that thats having one and thats impacting the game on both ends of the floor hes not just doing it with his offensive skill set hes doing it defensively and and also in a leadership role for that group hes been really fun to watch Matthew Clevelands been fun to watch another 20 piece sends it down the floor that was last Touch by Anthony Robinson so itll stay here 25 on the shot clock for Miami in search of their first ACC victory since February 3rd 2024 were approaching a calendar year and the Virginia started that losing streak pretty sure theyve heard about it from coach Courtney we need to end it against this team and theyve come out theyve competed luga chuku looking for kid the double comes Schwarz hes hit a couple of those in the second half left it short on that one no panicking there by ly kid double team coming he knows its coming does a really good job of using his Escape dribble finding a teammate even though its an empty possession I think they need to continue to play through him in a half court Murray going right at Cleveland puts his head down rebound bu Canon whose night keeps getting better 15 and eight for the sophomore and five offensive rebounds for be Canon there just really done a good job of playing off the guards oh they needed that from kid rims out I think that was a mistake there they expecting a double team and you can see he went middle spent back spent Baseline to finish and just unable to knock it down Music Music bu Canons first Miss from the floor leaves the door open here for Miami can cut it back to a twopossession game Ugo chuku draws a foul and the Freshman is headed back to the line uku was a little frustrated I think the previous possession down the floor when he drove it Baseline and Anthony knocked it out of bounds he thought he was foul in reminding Teddy Valentine you missed me the last time Laughter baby 10th foul on Virginia Two Shots the rest of the way for Miami third foul on Tane Murray one thing youd like to see from Miami is theyre doing a good job of attacking but you got to look to make plays for your teammates Virginia is 18 assists on 25 field goals Miami is starting to get it going as well theyre starting to pick it up creating for teammates as well but could do a little bit more of that as they try to claw back into this game were getting into it the last five minutes here and see if they get this intensity back on the defensive end to the floor had it as close as three in this half but Virginias made timely shots and timely stops to keep the buffer inside Buchanan revers no Kofi couldnt keep the handle you push the tempo but if you dont have a good shot now you get into your half court offense you dont need to take quick shots that are bad shots against this Virginia team Cleveland into the chest of Murray counted in the foul hes so difficult to guard because hes constantly t attack F coming off here drives back to the left hand now gets the angle jumps into the chest of Murray forces the official to make the call Chance at an an one and that is four on Murray Cleveland cuts it back to four and for now Ron Sanchez keeps Murray on the floor FL he has been a huge part of this teams offense tonight 20 points on eight of 12 a season high now theres no point guard technically on the floor mcne running a point right now and Ames is on the bench with four fouls now they can switch a lot will they communicate enough on the defensive end MCN quick trigger taking advantage of the Freshman there got lost on that will AC he thought he was coming back off the screen he changed his sides of the floor and over chuku was late cannot be laid on Isaac mcney one of the best Shooters in the ACC good feed inside the kid with the response and a timeout taken by Miamis Bill Courtney great job here you lose a shooter off the screen you go over the top he stays on the Baseline knocks down another three got a five point tank Murray was inserted in the starting lineup tonight hes responded with a career high scoring 20 points here and knocking down threes cuts to the rim hes doing it all hes telling Co Sanchez Roy who coach no worries I got this hes had himself a heck of a night lets see if the Wahoos can finish it off Whos down two of their top three scorers in Saunders and roie who you just referenced yet theyve shot 53 tonight thanks in large part to these two gentlemen well theyve coming in every smed with 35 points and lake meanon has done really well in the offensive glass I mean he hes approaching a double double with one more rebound so he got to starting lineup I mean its theyve been really productive with the opportunity and they need to be aggressive you know you just didnt need to rely on Isaac mcil with the attention that hes going to draw we were wondering who was going to step up and both of these guys have theyve been inserted into the lineup Murray turn around step back now that allows MCN like that to be a closer theyve done enough to get you in the game to have a lead now were in the last four minutes of the game you can can say hey Isaac take us home Brandon Johnson fake the three double clutch in the paint set back by Buchanan who fell on the Baseline and itll be Miami basketball thats a great move there turns the corner pivot shows you the footwork shoots the 15ot fade away its nice this time he didnt below a kiss to the crowd I thought Johnson got away with a Trav down there I thought he was shuffling his feet amongst when he was Music spinning great effort just to get the extra possession here see if Miami can take advantage of it kid Baseline doubled finds Johnson for the twoand jam and Miami stays within Striking Distance down five and three minutes to go on Coral Gables thats where the experience comes in link kid knows Virginia may come in double so we a quick spin Baseline and when the double arrives hes facing the defense finds the teammates keeps Miami in this game foul on Miami that is the fourth on Divine Ugo chuku both teams in the bonus the rest of the way one timeout for Virginia two for the canes and mcne will go to the line a 75 free throw Applause shooter well weve got a basketball triple header Saturday on the ACC Network Florida State and Boston College kick us off followed by the Commonwealth clash between Virginia Tech and Virginia and then Rand chis well have you for the night cap SMU hosting Stanford in Dallas Max R know is fun to watch isnt he he is I think hes the most gifted offensive sevenfooter in college basketball and somebody will spend a first round draft picked on Applause him that is the first turnover of the second half for Miami gives it back to Virginia yeah they pulled the chair on L kid there hes hold your ground hold your ground he goes to back up to feel your body you pull the chair just back away and he slipped and Music traveled were in the guts of the game right now for Miami you got to get stops now its not enough time just over two minutes got to start stringing together stop MCN three bang and blows a c to the crowd and Coral Gables Big Shot there you got to make sure you lock and chase him run him off the threepoint line too many times hes been able to shake Applause Music loose comes off another screen youre late he knocks it down blows a kiss to the Miami faithful hes having fun tonight 26 with six made threes hes 50 from downtown I mean hes coming in shoot 42 Its shooting like that from three he knows what he is and like I said whats help this game is now hes starting to attack you off the dribble hes starting to cut better off the ball and and also with his added point guard responsibilities hes just letting the game come to him in the groove right now certainly his best game in his career against the canes in a game that Virginia felt they had to have theyve lost six of the last seven as Cleveland tries to keep the canes in it allow them to get in the offense and run their offense which I thought they did early so this the type of pressure you need to extend earlier in the game now as is back in extra ball handling and theyll get right back into their move blocker action here Ames playing with four fouls as is tan Murray mcne thought about it inside Kofi and the foul on Johnson Two Shots coming Ron Sanchez the last possession told copi to make sure he cut didnt cut fast enough now the Freshman understands why if I cut to the basket Ill get the ball still a lot of time left you just got to if youre Miami you got to now you got a attacker this isnt a great position to be in against Virginia because their defense is built on help rotating early and Kofi misses a free throw surprisingly 79 free throw shooter we see some good shooting bigs from the free throw line you dont usually see that got a rebound here if youre Miami if its a Miss from Kofi they have struggled to keep Virginia off the glass Kofi makes the second ninepoint game 126 to go do you have to start hunting threes yet if youre Miami well you will if you dont get stops right now you still you dont have to take the first available shot you just decide to go quickly you got to go and attack you going to have to make the shots you got to make the play for someone else or yourself Johnson I believe was fouled there by Murray and if so thats his fifth it will go against McNeely instead and that is number four on the Junior and that will send Brandon Johnson to the line they went small with their lineup they played with two bigs most of the the game and theyre doing their offensive defensive substitutions right now Johnson a 69 free throw shooter misses the first coach Sanchez walked over to us and just said hes improved yes he has talking about Jacob Kofi tells you how much confidence he has he puts a freshman big back in on the offensive possession to help with the Press break Cleveland with the steel and the lay in Sixpoint game thats what you need to do here you need to get a couple of steals and turnovers like this inside of the Freshman Kofi who will bring it up the Music floor and a whistle in there somewhere will go against Matthew Cleveland off the ball but youre under a minute now so the clocks are eny you dont get the pressure you dont get the Trap you got to foul you got to string this game along you cant allow Virginia to use the entire clock Applause banan not a great free throw shooter 54 this year two possession lead for Virginia looking for their first true Road win of the Season big make there from Buchanan now defensive end to the floor virginas with their smaller lineup Kofi at the five and four guards allowing him to switch everything if needed Hugo chuku right to the cup pass Kofi took only a handful of seconds off the clock there now its a fivepoint game the n man and man try to create a turnover there you dont have to foul right away get a good trap charma barely got that ball in now trying to get it across half court still havent gotten it over yet now that was awfully close Bill Courtney woned a 10sec violation and now the foul does come from Schwarz good defensive effort there by Miami nearly got a 10sec count soon as they got it across half court you foul this is a good foul charma hasnt played a ton hes a good free throw shoot hes only shot eight on the season Applause Music that is only the eighth made free throw of the season for Sharma hes only taken nine yeah not a familiar place from the former Canadian national player of the year but he makes them both he comes in with the reputation of being a shooter in plays a lot of behind the threepoint line so he doesnt get a ton of attempts Cleveland had a j loose and Pat Driscoll comes in and says it went off Cleveland now they are going to take a look at this but the call on the floor is Virginia basketball I dont know if its Virginias basketball or not but Ron Sanchez is yelling and screaming for it heres another look at it yes thats just a great Swipe by mcneel it is and thats just a staple in the packline defense trying to dribble through theyre always going to dig and recover thats one of the reasons why Virginia has always been one of the better defensive teams not only the ACC and college basketball as they get rewarded with another Miami turnover and Miami had done a really good job in the second half of taking care of the basketball and thats only their second turnover these guys have competed both programs have been through a lot you know its just unfortunate what you had to go through but theyve shown well today they they both competed and we knew one of the streaks had to end and put 30 seconds away from maybe Virginia ending their Road streak and Miamis got to continue to fight Ron Sanchez wanted a timeout didnt get it itll stay with Virginia they have one timeout left and again awfully close to a 5second violation yeah hes yelling now hes putting MCN there so MCN knows with the ball in his hands hes got to have a four count and then call a timeout last thing you need to do is turn have a turnover here with no time on the clock so youll see mcne inbounded if someone doesnt get open mcne gets it in quickly to Kofi and a foul on Brandon Johnson that is number four on the East Carolina trans what a luxury to have a big 610 freshman that you can put in and help out for press break and Ron Sanchez told us were going to have everybody involved in bringing the ball up the floor because he says I dont want to put that pressure on any one player to get us in the offense and most teams dont have a center thats up pressing you 94 ft Ron s explaining to Blake Buchanon that he didnt want him to go to the free throw line until the second free throw Kofi makes them both Buchanan comes back on ninepoint game here Miamis got to go quickly yeah now you need threes Cleveland hoist can hit rebound Virginia and the whoos are going to come away with their first true Road win of the season in Coral Gables when Virginia gets 40 in the first half and then 40 in the second they have struggled offensively but not here tonight its really efficient sharing the basketball shooting the basketball well from three theyve always taken care of it and got good quality shots and theyve earned this Victory here in cor Gables they will return home on February 1st to take on instate rival Virginia Tech in the battle for the Commonwealth and this one will taste sweet theyve been close in a handful over the last seven games losing six of those including a buzzer beater loss at the hands of SMU and you just got the sense from being around Ron Sanchez at the shoo around today being around his team there was a hunger in spite of not having Saunders and roie two of their top three scores its its next man up and this group was confident that they could come in here and get the win and they did credit to these guys theyre fighting theyre still fighting big win for Virginia now one away from getting back to 500 on the season and the first true Road win of the year for Ron Sanchezs Virginia Cavaliers with
