that theyre putting pressure on the other team Virginia always noted for the defensive pressure Tony Bennetts guys are able to apply but theyre combining that so far with offensive pressure as well in year 14 for Tony Bennett up 11 spots in the polls this week they are 40 and theyre here at home against UMES off to a 23 start coming off the win against Maris and Virginia controls into the arms of Kihei Clark and away we go from jpj it is such a veteran group Virginia of course brought back 91 percent of its scoring the most in the country they also bring Ben vanderplas Off the Bench hes been really good for the whos so far shot clock winding down a double on Gardner carving out space and thats a great shot earlier and thats great a great Patience by Virginia UMES comes out they play very hard a nice tight mantoman and for one of the few times this year Jayden Gardner isnt an undersized big guy who is is 12 Nate Pollard coming off a careerhigh 20 points he and DeSean Phillip Five For You NES the names to know going to work on the inside thats Pollard hes wearing number 12 today not his normal 22 and off his Miss its Reese Beekman back the other way Gardner just eight points per game so far the first four games and hes got four points early on the Zion Styles is only six feet three they list them at 199 pounds I dont know that hes about that big and Gardner you know he just hes got five inches and 30 pounds on him Beekman picks off the pass the whos run Franklin short from the corner and shendrick draws a foul on the rebounding action Applause and you dont normally see Virginia push the ball up the court like that theyve done more of that this year and why are they getting to the freethrow line thats exactly the reason why they are attacking and even though that shot was Miss Cedric does a great job running the court getting himself in great position to get to the freethrow line Shedrick had a big game Friday against Baylor 17 points six of six shooting you said he has been at the free throw line a lot and rebounding will be Paramount in this matchup UMES their two tallest starters both six foot five and they only have a little bit more size that comes off the bench of the front Court lots of times its hard to chase those little guys around and we expect to see the University of Maryland Eastern Shore apply some pressure try to create some easy opportunities Stiles met at the rim by Shedrick be hard to get the ball all the way to the basket Cedric is an excellent shot blocker Applause his arms seem to get longer every year sort of An Inspector Gadget kind of guy Clark alive start the first two minutes Applause on the Hawks havent really gotten anywhere close to the basket yet Music operate here with Amadou fofana their point guard sending it off to the wing for Chase Davis sophomore from Maryland and off his miss the whos right back with it well the hawksar team that produces 35 percent of the points from Beyond The Arc so theyre going to take some threes and theyre going to have to make some throughs Shedrick couldnt Corral the pass and its turnover he got a little bit of a hurry you got to catch that ball first but this going to the basket hes got Beekman and Beekman is an outstanding shot blocker I think Beekman actually got that and then that leads to this down on the other end the Cavaliers moving up very quickly Fender and ability to buy the block shots is probably the most the least important part of his defensive game fofana scores the first UMES points the transfer from Canisius fifth year senior originally from the Bronx and last year the Hawks had a little bit of a problem handling the ball and so get getting a graduate transfer point guard in has really helped settle their offense down Clark off a screen now the rebound yanked down by Styles yeah head coach Jason Crafton said we want to be more than just a defensive program thats what theyve been his first few years at the helm got to protect the ball to do that are they really particularly uh once the calendar turned 2022 they had a hard time hanging on to the basketball and its hard to win when youre giving the ball to the other guys here we go but this is a this is a team of Fighters theyre theyre not gonna roll over Styles know Franklin climbs for the rebound so Jason Crafton said to us today to shoot around he wants to muck it up a little bit and agitate Virginia Gardner continues the fast start hes got a half does it well they need to do something to agitate Jayden Applause thank you the end of the 10 points for the Cavaliers have come in the paint so far the handle for Philip he kept it alive for Styles shot clock below 10 now for UMES Kyle splits the double and draws a foul Applause 102 start for Virginia led by Jaden Gardner here in Charlottesville Music hes got six already tonight he has shown great patience he gets positioned Maneuvers that bigger body around smaller players in here he just uses quickness and one of the things I think thats impressive about the Cavaliers start is look at this last year and of course it was a fewer number of shots but last year he averaged almost 13 shots a game this year only five in fact he was the number seven in the ACC and field goal attempts they relied on him heavily for offense and yet theyre playing well offensively and they havent had to rely on him so far with the midrange jump shot hes got all four for UMES yeah we spotlighted those numbers out the top about how good the Virginia offense has been four games in and theyve done it without Gardner coming anywhere close to the player he was offensively last year he may be rushing a little bit but they just havent needed that kind of production he hasnt had to carry the load and I think that bodes very well for Virginia in terms of their flexibility the lobgoers arrived for Shedrick we mentioned Jason craft at his fourth year as the head coach last year 11 wins for this program the year before that they didnt play at all coming off the the covid shortened season so this is just their second year back to basketball yeah its how hard would it be to have your basketball season canceled and he told us that before last year and I dont know who rates these things but he said his team was rated the worst team in division one and yet they came out in 111 games and so obviously you want to win more than 11 but they were very pleased with the progress they made last year two yeah Ill tell you who Sports Illustrated did and he remembers it and hes of course coaches pleased about it coaches remember stuff like that man has always been very good taking the ball to the basket his first points tonight out for Phillip he has shot a well from three so far this season better than earlier in his career in the long rebound to beatmann vanderplas an early candidate for Sixth Man of the Year in the ACC Beekman off the side screen now vanderpost is an outstanding passion hes got the size Advantage with five to shoot the Ohio transfer a step back is good so he can pass it and he can stroke it well youre talking about the size Advantage hes going up against fofana at 61 and hes six eight but he has to take you know the defense was pretty good he had to take a following great stash as well for Ben vanderplas well not only stash but the hair and the you know the bandana hes hes doing the Retro 70s look here but this is really a nice step back jump shot and those very good defense by fofana to not allow vanderplas to back but that gives you an ideal versatility of vanderplas Francisco coffaro checks in Isaac McNeely into the game as well for the Cavaliers and Tony Bennett so now we see the Hawks dropping back into a 23 Zone the pressure theyve played mantoman theyre trying to do something to disrupt Virginia it looks like theyre tied a trap out of this Zone were gonna get a foul on the inside I think its away from the ball on Nate Pollard their grad student big man we spotlighted early its his first he goes to the bench Troy hubstad big bodied sophomore transfer comes in to replace him well he got a feel for Pollard hes six feet five and hes banging against cafero inside seven foot one Poppy men for three and thats when Beekman has improved so much throughout his college career and Im telling you you just look at the history of what Tony Bennett has and his staff has been able to really developed obviously it helps when the guys have talent but weve seen so many people develop so much over the course of their careers here Beekman has put on a defensive clinic so far in these first seven minutes we talked about how blocking shots was a part of this defensive game but not the best part the steals that may be the best part hes got great hands and great instincts how good was he down the stretch against Illinois on Sunday was named tournament MVP and ACC player of the week from Franklin and a high ball screen from Cafaro oh good pass from vanderplas for Franklin the ball movement you mentioned from the transfer but thats the kind of passing thats almost like a bill mazarovski pass you know the old second base they called him no touch when theyre trying to make a double play the balls out of his hands almost before it gets there once the ends are always the ends her absolutely Philip amiss swatted out and kept Alive by Don Chevelle Nugent who resets things for you NES anytime he user can talk about Bill mazurovski its a requirement of detox yeah its been a good night so far Beekman off the turnover again and then take it away on a pass intended for Franklin good extra pass to the quarter and the three not there for unes and Glenn Anderson Applause and the Hawks are going to have to make a high percentage of those shots they dont its gonna be a long night Beekman oh a quick First Step nearly jammed it but back to UMES maybe that first step was a little too quick he sort of got out of rhythm and couldnt get up there to Duncan hes going to hear about that from his teammates he stays right in front of Nugent back out humpstead not known as a threepoint shooter Applause its a 100 run for Virginia the last three and a half minutes Applause vanderplas with Philip bottom an excellent Defender plas going to work and it rolled off and fill up the rebound and coffaro picks up a foul on the rebounding action well arba top five in the country and overall as an offense Ken Pond says its a top five offense in the land but part of the problem last year was that Armond Franklin really struggled to shoot the three and you know he was well aware of that Franklin said you know I havent having trouble doing what they brought me in here to do but its his first year adjusting to a new program he worked very hard and so not only is he playing better but beekmans been really good from Beyond The Arc we showed you Vander plas there hes able to shoot the ball theyve got a lot of options from out there Ive got more depth this year as well those are the two big things that stand out about Virginia this year better shooting and more depth Ryan Dunn is into the game and right in front of him Don Chevelle Nugent knocks down a triple you know theyve had some open threes that theyve missed and done locked arms and this is a bouncy athletic kind of guy a Nugent I think just surprised him squeeze that one off very quickly they call him Tuka Tuka Nugent first point scored by someone not named Amadou fofana and now UMES with the takeaway Anderson Cross Court another three in the air and this one bounces off the back iron and kept alive and last touched by Dunn good hustle on the Baseline by Nugent well I think actually that ball was going out of bounds and Nugent got it and when he threw it back in I think it bounced off Dunns foot and Dunn was standing out of bounds now see duns out of bounds and the ball and the ball hits him in the foot and the balls off its out of bounds based on the first thing it touches out of bounds and it happened to be the foot end of the 14 field goal attempts have come from Beyond the threepoint line for unes McNeely Target I mean healys reputation is as a shooter Applause Twitter was in our PN 100 part of this great recruiting class of First Years for the Cavaliers Music Music and this is just a situation where theyre able to get past the perimeter defense and Pollard we mentioned he is six feet five but hes been an undersized inside guy his entire career so hes used to playing against bigger guys and thats just really good power right there to get it up through those bodies and Tony done and not waiting around he goes right back to the bench gets Beekman gets Franklin and he Yanks The Freshman done in McNeely part of the problem is youre not going to play for Tony Bennett unless you guard unless you get the defensive Concepts correct not along the sideline it does stay with Virginia right in front of him can you make a couple of baskets you suddenly have some more confidence the Hawks are out playing very hard on the defense nearly created another turn over there is what they try to do you set it off the top they will pressure you they were one of the best teams last year in the country defensively with the frequency that they forced turnovers Sandra plus and Gardner playing together in this lineup for Virginia heres Gardner going to work through the traffic couldnt score around Phillip Davis thought about it Pollard has always played with a chip on his shoulders head coach told us today its the glass for two and styles hes noted invested and that time beatman went flying Styles has shot the ball from three very well this year and Stouts just let him fly by made to midrange jump shot really a nice play Styles who had 18 in the opener at Old Dominion Virginias been quiet the last four and a half minutes and Beekman turns it over looking for Gardner Pollard with a nice pass and Philip couldnt finish and then a reachin foul on Zion Styles as UMES had a chance to get within a half dozen I think there was more defensive pressure there than the Hawks anticipated nice job by Kihei Clark to get back and contest that layup without fouling its on Virginia right at the moment they started out very well they were shooting they werent turning it over now theyve turned it over a couple times theyre up to five turnovers in the game and what was working early hasnt worked as the drought continues for Virginia its an 80 run for unes Terrier they need to try to utilize utilize static contested too but an offensive rebound and putback Shedrick with a chance at three much needed for Virginia to slow down the Maryland Eastern Shore run here in the first half Music treat yourself this Virginia team leads the country in free throws made per game in free throw attempts per game and thats not the way its been traditionally Through The Years here Music in particular and they theyre able to attack and particularly when you throw the ball inside and when youre aggressive on offense youre going to draw fouls and you know I mean weve only played four games its very early in the season so all these numbers tend to be a little skewed but 317th in the country last year is not a skewed stat but its always its better to be one than 317 I would say general rule of thumb yes general rule of thumb Shedrick stamps a threepoint play it was the second foul by the way on Zion Styles one of the unes starters 11 point lead for Virginia and styles is somebody they rely on for offense so that hurts him he sits Pollard goes to work got Shedrick in the air just enough to score hes got all those little moves down on the inside the power dribble the fake your head shakes your pivots very important as a six foot five big its a six foot five when youre playing in the post against the 611 guys Shedrick draws another foul and hes going back to the line hes making a living at the line thats what hes done early on this season and thats two on for fun and now hey tomorrows rivalry weekend college football matchups right here on acc Network and the ESPN app 74 Wake Forest again seven and four Duke and the Tobacco Road Series thats 3 30 Eastern and then eight Eastern series that goes back to 1950 Pitt and Miami just trying to get Bowl eligible yeah so a couple fouls as well as you said on faux flata and Shedrick at the stripe again well its just so important if you have a big guy who can shoot free throws look at free throws everybody can shoot him but you know if you have a big guy who can make free throws because big guys are going to get fouled a lot when you throw the ball in there Shedrick five foot five today hes now 22 of 26 at the line so far this season Bovada Holloway hes a very confident jump shooter but he gets whistled for a flop here and those are the kind of flops that the officials are really looking for you know you shoot the ball and you fall down he does a nice job he falls backwards and you know the official looking at it is there theres very contacted theres no contact there and he falls down now there is a difference between falling down and flopping well there is a difference between falling down and flopping and thats what the officials are out there to decide and this year of course theres no warning for flop they blow the whistle at the most appropriate point to stop the game and then its a technical Class B technical foul now that class B technical foul doesnt count against anybodys totals not an individual total not team totals so still just the two personals on Amadou fofana Kihei Clark couldnt capitalize on that one free throw for Virginia so 10 point game just under six and a half to go in this first half here in Charlottesville now key head Clark traditionally is a great freethrow shooter hes been throughout his career but Cedrics not from the line I might have let him go off the turnover Shedrick for Gardner at The Rim that is a really good pass by your big guy in transition avoiding the charging call and dumping it off to his teammate under the basket thats really good by Cedric yourself a great first half here tonight Applause additional hard hedge from a Virginia big and now back up top we intend to shoot for Chase Davis and um from Pollard and Davis with a tough long two Applause Clark with the entry for Gardner going to war on the inside that is some pass by Kihei Clark perfectly timed with Gardner he threw that ball before Gardner was really in position to catch it 10 points for Jaden Gardner just like that a 70 run for the Cavaliers Pollard cant stop it Davis kept it alive shot clock did not reset shoot Pollard extra pass Anderson off the shot big comes up empty and a shot clock violation you know this this crowd here John Paul Jones Arena I think they get as excited about a shot talk violation sometimes as they do about a dunk Music its the one place in the country with the highest understanding of what that official signal is and it has been and it should be that way Gardner moves it around now back to Clark good high low coffaro just couldnt handle it and a Virginia turnover I think Gardner surprised him with the pass I think cafara was trying to get in position for a rebound Davis rolls it home attacking the rim and Maryland Eastern Shore continues to hang around that that is one thing that has always been something that Virginia has tried to avoid you you can if you cant set your defense its hard to play the kind of Defense Virginia wants to play so simply cannot afford to turn it over see thats what kaffara thought Gardner was going to do the last time and coffaro was headed for the rebound Gardner surprised him this time Gardner thinks okay I wont surprise you Ill just shoot him but Virginias defense is really good when its set and if you turn it over its hard to set your defense nice move by Troy hopstead the sophomore junior college transfer to use the pivot to fake to Faro out Applause three and a half to go in this first half here John Paul Jones Arena Music Applause the Faro sets the screen for Clark off the rejection navigate and he will go to the freethrow line get up high there by Cohen Thompson well Virginia has led by as many as 16 but Maryland Eastern Shore continues to hang around 12 point game late first half nice footwork from Troy huffstead Music treat yourself to something sexy Bennetts not happy hes got so much experience over there 90 of his scorings back 90 percent of his minutes back I think the thing that has been bothered is guys are making very simple mistakes on the defensive end and theyve turned the ball over on the offensive end and those are the kind of mistakes you dont expect this veteran team to make not in this system and then sometimes Mike its hard you get up at the start of a game 204 and you you subconsciously relax a little bit and this University of Maryland Eastern Shore team theyre not going anywhere theyve got theyve got six guys on this team from New York City there tough kids theyre gonna keep playing Applause they watched uh their meac mate North Carolina Central hanging here against Virginia in the opening game of the season and they think they can do it too banging into vanderplas to follow a Miss vanderpost rips it away from huffston but you gotta like Andersons optimism hes five feet seven and he just went right in there a bowling ball through the lane under three to go in this first half Music got 14 another great pass but Gardner was ready to catch that ball hes going to the basket hes anticipating that pass that is a great catch once again a real guys combination between those two for Jaden Gardner with 14 all here in the first half Thompson stepped on the Center Court line Applause tomorrow 2 30 Eastern the ACC huddle will get you set for another afternoon of football at 6 30 a complete wrapup of those games and they will set the stage for Prime Time Ted Miami at eight oclock after the game they wrap it up with a full post game show all available here on accn and the ESPN app everybody else shot clock I believe did not start no they had reset it to 30 he dropped to 20 weve got this straightened out here Music The Possession changed so it should have been reset to third a full third yes Tommy Morrissey presiding over the time keeping and theyre saying come on Music come on so theyre gonna say It was supposed to be 20 and itll start with 18 on the timer as Kihei Clark triggers it in for Beekman Applause Music Gardner everything going right for James Garner well Gardner is has a really good game close to the basket obviously and hes always had a pretty good midrange game hes not a threepoint guy and so somewhat surprising that he had really struggled with his midrange shot the first four games so far and was only playing 19 minutes a game coming into today Applause Franklin was calling for it Clark for Gardner quickly up with it two more for Jayden Gardner Applause 66 they listen to 233 pounds he just gets some space in the lane feels that pressure and just gets it up there I mean thats a Its called Power mover and its interesting the Cavaliers theyre not theyre not running at Breakneck speed Mike but theyre getting the ball up to court quickly theyre initiating their offense quickly and theyre getting really good opportunity and Gardner has a rattle out the bid for a threepoint play but still the 18 points you just saw on 9 of 11 shooting here in this first half hes done it in 13 minutes Pollard going to work on evanderplas for Davis and vanderplas commits the foul reaching around thats his first and you dont really need to reach around Davis out there in the corner to you to reach around Pollard out there in the corner but vanderplas did a really nice job they threw the ball into Pollard and unlike what Pollard was able to do against Cafaro he gave defense and vanderpost just stood there and thats thats what you have to do defensively when you have that kind of a height advantage that close to the basket oh Applause Clark on Davis spinning and a foul on the floor on Kihei Clark thats his first Music ACC pm with Pac Trey Taylor they talk football they talk basketball all the latest from around the conference weekdays for Eastern right here on accn and the ESPN app Newtons pass too hot to handle for hopsted and a turnover the ninth one this half by UMES everything Gardner slipped it so comfortable with that Baseline jump shot and vanderplas couldnt clean it up Music Applause again good opportunities moving the ball up to court and initiating the offense quickly first half Davis backs it out and now DeSean Phillip he is scoreless in this half last year All Conference third team in the Mia Nugent floater comes up empty and Virginia forces a second shot clock violation for the most part teams teams laying at shot clock everybody gets in a little rush now this Virginia team they seem to be very comfortable playing at the end of the shot clock but its a hard thing to do you feel the pressure of the time time right now dictating about three seconds or so separating game and shot clock at the end of this first half Vander plas draws a reaching foul uh Cohen Thompson why the Grimace you didnt need it you dont need that right there Van Der Blossom is not going to hurt you with 10 seconds left on the shot clock from the top of the key and its back to the back and hes back to the basket so what you do now he cant hurt you from the freethrow line misses on the front end of a one and one so he got away with one there sure did umbs with the chance for the final shot Phillip driving on Franklin got it to go day shot Phillips first points in this first half send us to the break here in Charlottesville Virginia Gardner the story eight een points to Pace the Cavaliers on nine of 12 shooting in his best performance already this season 4020 and Armon Franklin he only made one field goal and that was one threepoint basket but again when you have Gardner doing all that damage inside and Cedric has nine points as well and you just saw Reese Speakman seven points four rebounds thats great four steals as well in that first half and a blocked shot thrown in there too business as usual for Beekman I am Stiles down to three just the second made three primarily at Eastern Shore they were one for nine from three in the first half my Styles came in shooting almost 60 percent from Beyond The Arc and Beekman got caught up in traffic inside and couldnt get back to him Applause Clark off the screen back for beefman tend to shoot now Franklin Applause Clark Gardner threw the contact trials are found and Mike thats what I was talking about was being able to play at the end of the shot clock not forcing anything that was really a nice job they moved the ball not worried about the shot clock Runner down they get it to Kihei Clark and he doesnt try to make some kind of crazy shot he just penetrates into the lane and finds Gardner thats just outstanding play anytime but particularly at the end of the shot clock it feels like if youre not a program that operates that way using so much of the shot clock that youre not going to be comfortable that way classic of that is that Elite eight game they had against Purdue and you know most people would have tried to heave one from half court but hey Clark just controlled the ball and got it to Mama Dee de Akita to tie the game Gardner splits at the strike giant styles with five points for UMES he did just pick up his third foul though guy whos playing well this year second year starter originally from Long Island he is bouncy and he gets to the freethrow line a lot Music Gardners got him bottom of your screen fofana that connects Styles kept it alive its a great Hustle Applause Cedric is an outstanding shot blocker and he had time to measure that one Applause the blocks for Kaden Shedrick Applause Franklin around the screen under flash to now Clark Gardner has it rolled off and he will go to the loud for two Applause Cedric does such a nice job he takes one big step and then goes straight up in the air and he doesnt like follow through really hard with his arm he blocks that ball with his wrist you know you dont have to throw it into the third row its much better when you can get it and recover it foreign Applause Music from what youve seen so far is Virginia a better defensive team this year than last year I I dont know the answer to that question I think its still really too early uh this is a team thats still putting things together and I think to evaluate the team defensively you got to wait until they figure out what their rotation is obviously you know they held Baylor and Illinois to season low and points and theres some those are two really good teams kept a lot by Styles in midcore we know the Virginia history defensively Clark is fouled by Chase Davis Music so the answer to your question is uh you know 04 points but its still I think Tony Bennett wants to be better than that yeah you know its if theyre going to score 80 points a game that means theyre playing a little bit faster pace and so its going to be hard to be much better than that but this is a team that you watch them and they certainly look like they have a tremendous amount of defensive potential I said over the weekend that the last few years we havent been where weve needed to be defensively and the way he always puts it is can we win games with our defense and he didnt feel like they could last year Kihei Clark as you said an excellent free throw shooter hes good on both the lead is 19 first two minutes second half for Virginia Music fofana matched up with Clark tough shot and fobata hits thats just a great offensive play yeah I mean Kihei Clark did everything you could do you just tip your cap to that guy and go play offense Justin Crafton told us today that ahmadu folklada still hasnt played his best game yet five or six games in now to his unes career after transferring in from Canisius but as you said in the first half they feel like hes going to be an important piece in the meact this year its just so important that you can give that shot fake take that dribble step in and make that midrange jump shot that was against the Zone uh the Hawks changing defenses again Music Shedrick Picks It Off on the push Speakman the lob for Franklin so what do we have here Mike the high flying Virginia Cavaliers I guess so and the transition Cavaliers as Cohen Thompson known as a shooter the senior from Memphis steps out and hits now almost all of his field goal makes and field goal attempts are from three and Cedric has to be aware of that Music Clark another line what a perfect pass and Shedrick finishing through all sorts of contact at The Rim Applause Thompson Moves In for styles to the corner now popana has Shedrick on it Davis flashes tough shot Franklin draped all over Music Clark thinking about a third lob instead Gardner spins to the Baseline hes got 22 if you cant do a lot you do a bounce pass you get another assist this has been a keyhead Clark bounce pass Clinic Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause below 10 for Styles trying to take Gardner off the bounce and Gardner bumps him and commits in his second foul well yeah Virginia is playing Above the Rim here in the second half Franklin from Beekman and Shedrick up top as well through all sorts of contact from Kihei Clark Music one of three teams ranked in the top ten in the ACC Carolina is first Duke is eighth theyre both out in Portland what do you make Dan to the top of the ACC well I think the the top of the ACC is very good and I think these teams are ranked deservedly so Im not sure that they should come out with polls before like the end of December but since we do I think those are very appropriate rankings Virginia really earned theirs two wins over a very very good teams ranked teams out in Las Vegas and North Carolina you know theyve played some close games but they havent lost and theyre very talented we got to see them against James Madison and we were really impressed if Ive learned anything about you it said we dont necessarily need the top 25 in November and we dont necessarily though we love him we need Joe linardi in December uh Joe Leonardis my hero and so anytime we can have Joe lunardi thats fine but you know this November and December used to be a time where coaches figured out their teams and of course that uh when I say November and December basically uh you know a thousand years ago this today the day after Thanksgiving was the day the season started so you didnt really have very much in November but the preconference season is the time when the coaches are trying to figure out what they what they have what they can do players trying to get accustomed to their roles but you know the way they they this net uh it if they want to have make sure every game counts the same well thats fine except I think it puts way too much emphasis on the nonconference part of the schedule its like a foul by the way on Ben vanderplas who now commits his third on a driving named Pollard oh God hey tomorrow 2 30 Eastern the ACC Auto crew gets you set for the afternoon Slayton then at 6 30 they wrap it all up and get you ready for Prime Time on acc Network 8 oclock pit Miami and a post game show to follow Jordan Cornett running the point also available on the ESPN app so when the season started at that point you guys were still here on the grounds for Thanksgiving and yeah you were cooking right well after a couple years we did that we decided we were going to have our own Thanksgiving and so thats a long time ago but uh yeah we did thats where I figured out how to do a turkey its still doing it the same way yep my mom sent me instructions and 50 years later I have those same instructions that I follow in her same handwritten note Applause its a little yellowed now but I was gonna leave that out alongside Cavalier royalty Dan botter like Monaco our entire crew with you early on in this second half I am really impressed with the energy that the Hawks use when they play I mean theres no quit in them theyve had a couple of opportunities to fold up their tents Virginias made a couple of runs at them and obviously theyre behind in the game but theyre still playing Shedrick was fouled on the floor there yeah its a team thats coming off a pretty good win at home against Marist on Tuesday 7059 Jason Crafton the head coach said afterward its not just a great win for them but a great win for their league as well the meac they were picked sixth out of eight in the meac but theyre a veteran group Clark walks with it and a traveling violation when you look at the lineup out there on the court right now that you know everybody was just sort of standing around you know tayne Murrays in the ball game and again Tony Bennetts looking to see what kind of minutes he can get off his bench from various guys so a lot of people get a chance in a game like this for from New Zealand because almost got a block on profana and then Murray clears it Applause well you got to be if youre on an offensive player you should be aware Beekman is all the time he got my vote last year for ACC defensive player of the year it was only a sophomore its for Clark bounces for Gardner and that connection stays strong again it bounce past Factory eight assists now for Kihei Clark and 24 points for Jaden Garden Music Applause far ahead of the field youre just trying really hard not to bounce it off your foot this is everyones steady approach I think everybody was you know really excited about some spectacular dunk all he wanted to do was make sure he got to the basket and scored two points seeing that pick off and slam a few times this year from Shedrick corner kick out fopada passed up the look kept it moving for Philip who cant connect from three Virginia doing a nice job getting back to those threepoint Shooters and theyre forcing UMES to run so much time off the clock that they really dont have time to like pump fake and drive to the inside oh binkmann moves it for Murray Off the Mark offensive rebound Gardner goes right back up with two more and thats 56 for Jaden Gardner and what a great job by Cedric he couldnt get the rebound himself but he tipped it out and allowed Gardner to snare it only one says Jaden Gardner scored more points in a Virginia uniform than he has tonight and 29 last year against Fairley Dickinson jump off there from Phillip and he comes up limping and oh this is concerning for UMES one of their best players Deshawn Phillip the senior from Baltimore all conference goes to the bench grabbing his right leg well check on him when we come back to jpj Music Applause being the Deshawn Phillip getting that right leg attended to he reached right for that Thera gun perhaps indicating some sort of cramping going on we told you hes one of their key guys and umbs is also without key Von Voyles whos a senior guard in their best outside shooter team captain whos been out so far for medical reasons and Jason Crafton told us today theyre pretty close to getting him back he returned to being fully cleared about a week ago and there you look hes in his fourth season at UMES and of course lost one of those uh due to kovid but he his team sort of has his personality hes a battler and these guys they havent quit theyre behind in the game but they have played very hard the former head coach of his alma mater niacc College in New York in the D2 ranks spent a couple of years at Villanova for Jay Wright as his video coordinator in the early 2000s spent some time on staff at Navy as well with associate head coach there in Annapolis 11 and a half to have to win this second half beliers by 22 looking to get to 50 before the ACC Big Ten challenge next week Davis connects Murray the rebound getting some second half run really good block out by Murray now basically the Hawks have played the plaything here in the second half Marie bounces for the Freshman Orion Dunn this line jumper you like the look of Ryan though he looks like a player to me and he looks like once he gets in the weight room and you know Mike Curtis is the strength and conditioning coach here and he is as good a strength and conditioning coaches there is in the country and if the guys pay attention to what Mike tells him to do then theyre really going to develop Styles tough shot thief in the rebound and Mike Curtis deserves so much credit for all the success at this program scoop at home he was off balance there and I think he felt like he had to get that up so he didnt get a travel called Music but the Cavaliers sound a little bit stagnant here on offense Murray commits a foul on Davis the way that the Hawks want to play they want to spread you out and drive you and theyve got guys who are really aggressive trying to take the ball to the basket its not an easy thing theres Mike Curtis sitting down there at the end of the bench you enjoyed your chat with him and shoot around yeah I always like talking to Mike he is uh hes a very intelligent articulate guy whos telling me about how hes working on his Doctorate uh you know about using technology to improve performance and hes just a very thoughtful very smart guy very very good at what he does finish at the rim and thats what were talking about these guys theyre looking to take the ball hard to the basket unless you move your feet and get in front of them theyre going to get all the way to the boat all the way to the goal bucket for the sophomore who last year was on the meac all rookie team Chase Davis two in Maroon vanderplas kicks Murray hoyce way too strong and thats the other thing the Cavaliers theyve shot the ball from three very well so far this year but in those last couple of possessions theyve had some open ones that theyve missed and youre not going to make them all and for the game theyve only made two two of nine from long range Pollard couldnt finish in close he goes Tumbling With vanderplas and Pollard is slow to get up hollered behind the play five on four for Virginia as Pollard just now crosses mid Court now vendor plus fell on top of him to take me a while to get up yeah Music does not seem comfortable six to shoot Kihei Clark got a switch volvana cant stand Clark scores hey Clark scoots it home they did a really nice job cutting off his passing Lanes they decided okay if youre going to say if youre going to get a point here you got to score yourself hes done such a good job Distributing the ball sometimes thats the best way to play a guy like that but Clark made him pay for it first made bucket for Kihei Clark whos got eight assists in this game is so good in the first half against Illinois on Sunday s fires from deep and Franklin hangs onto it with Nugent pestering him coming up on eight to go here in Charlottesville trying to find dander Plus on the inside but nice defense in there by fofana Clark navigating the screen vanderplas moves it extra pass Franklin Nugent attacks got strep on Murray and it does stay with Maryland Eastern Shore on the other side well Kihei Clark has been Distributing so well and now his first made basket of this game a Nifty one Past folkata Music ah humbug my signal is totally ghosting me switch to Verizon the weekend of college basketball on both the mens and womens side some scores from around the ACC North Carolina right now over on ESPN out in Portland is locked in a good one against a very tough Iowa State team Iowa State team is a hardnosed defensive team Clemson and Iowa thats a low scoring one in the first half Florida State struggling again that thats a good win for Duke and Notre Dame loses the saint Bonaventure offensive foul is called on unes yeah Jeremy roach was really big for Duke in that game today of course Jeremy roach thats their thats their veteran guy they got a lot of young people and theyre going to rely on him and for as old as Caroline is as old as Virginia is Duke is very young as theyve often been through the last handful of years done off the bounce The Freshman backs it out for Clark Applause vanderplas over for McNeely hasnt played a whole lot in this game back winding down out of Clark hes got to get it up but Kihei Clark does and comes up short its a shot clock violation on the Cavaliers I mean you and me has just did a great job attacking there at the end of the shot clock not allowing keyhead Clark to make a play they basically triple teamed him its been a defensive identity for Jason Crafton said the next step is a program told us this today is to not just be known for their defensive work whats really good to be a good defensive team but eventually the ball has to go in the basket you got the shot clock at five another tough shot for fofana whos not scared away from those well hes not scared away from those at that time I thought Dunn did a great job pressuring the ball done hes about like six feet six with really long arms its hard to get the ball over him yeah they got him at six foot eight six foot eight okay Cafaro tapped it out toward done and then held in by Davis in transition and he is fouled by McNeely and Chase Davis will go to the line Music second foul on the Freshman from Polka West Virginia team mascot the dots the polka dots oh no I kid you not so what does uh what does a DOT mascot look like pretty much like an m m okay as you would expect a rivalry weekend college football tomorrow right here on acc Network and the ESPN app its wake and Duke starting it off at 3 30 Eastern then eight oclock Easter hit and Miami down in Florida with the Keynes trying to get bull eligible split at the line for Davis its 18 to go here in the second half 6 18 to go here in the second half Maryland Eastern Shore down by 20 and theyre still really getting after Virginia on the defensive end takes 10 seconds for Virginia to break that pressure which limits the amount of time you have here in the half court the inside the threepoint Arc disposition until right now with eight on the timer Clark is blocked by huffstead baseball pass on the head ahead for Davis attacks vanderplas swiped it away not only did he swipe it away but somehow he was able to not fall down out of bounds hes a how patient he just stood there and waited until he found an open player heres done off the screen down offensive rebound to McNeely and a fresh 20 that Kihei Clark will use Applause lets go Music done drives good idea looking for Clark cutting on the Baseline you know Im not sure that it is that good of an idea Kihei Clark what hes going to catch it down on the Baseline hes the smallest guy out there and run into the same problem youre saying his last position absolutely thats one you got to take if you take it that hard you got to shoot the ball youre gonna draw some Defenders even if you miss you have an opportunity for an offensive rebound Faro is just moving hubstad around and cafara the rebound again though kaffaro with the pivots by upstead he leaves his feet hes got to stay on his feet hes seven feet tall what are they gonna do Music sets some vicious screens hes just a walking Jersey Barrier like always from the ball goes on Amadou fofana thats his third Music 4 43 to go Virginia trying to get to 50 before they head off to Michigan on Tuesday theyll be Saturday against Florida State nice round of applause for Chase Coleman as he checks in and replaces Clark has had a really good game for the Cavaliers sis for Kihei Clark a couple of steals blocked a shot as well this is an interesting backcourt they have in the game now McNeely Coleman and Murray and McNeely had to roll off the rib Cafaro battles for it and that is a tough too and thats what confaro does he just didnt stop fighting you know he had a hard time catching the ball in the first half but he managed to secure that one that is quintessential Poppy as they call him Music Applause five on the timer Phillip says why not and the rebound vendor Plus Applause Music Coleman comes back to get it Applause good push from Anderson and that rolls off offensive rebound styles neither offense has been particularly sharp here in the second half a lot of missed opportunities so weve only had 15 combined made baskets the Cavaliers were very sharp offensively in the first half they were making their shots I missed a lot of open opportunities here in the second half including oh of seven from three two of 12 from three for the game Commander blast kept it alive Murray is found by Chase Davis number three to go its Charlottesville and Virginia looking to get to five ado how do you size up the road ahead for Tony Bennetts team well I think that you know Michigan at Michigan thats always a a good a tough game and then Florida States struggling but I mean they can still get after you defensively James Madison beat Virginia last year and Houston Houston is you know their number two team in the country they are really really good and remember they smack the Cavaliers around last year Music and then December 20th against Miami so you get two conference games in December and the Hurricanes the hurricanes have a lot of talent got Isaiah Wong back brought in some transfers again for Jim larenaga inside of three to go the bottom line is its not an easy Road and youre still trying to put your lineups together you know Gardner had a great game today Kihei Clark passed the ball very well they didnt shoot the ball very well from three and thats something theyve been able to do shot by Zion styles Applause umbs meanwhile they play home against Lehigh on Wednesday as styles with a stop we told him he is a high flyer well have a trip to Duke as well two weeks from tomorrow before they ramp up and dive into me and pledge Applause Music Applause Music oh McNeely step back oh thats smooth oh wow now when you can shoot the ball like that most coaches can find you a spot but this is a very odd lineup for Virginia one that you probably wont see very much so lots of like with these Virginia First Years thats a bob uh Murray Applause another look at the Styles Jam what are you talking about Styles Virginias done a pretty good job taking care of the basketball not giving up easy baskets but Styles got that one under a full head of steam this is a team with veteran guys Don does a nice job altering that shot of styles again Dunn has all the skills to be a really good defensive player and that guy came in with a reputation as somebody who could stroke it that first one goes down then suddenly that basket gets bigger and bigger and you got two freshmen playing theyre both in the rotation and youve got two freshmen red shirting and theyre really talented as well Music Applause short from three McNeely the rebound I mean we watched Isaac trout whos one of those guys Redshirt we watched how quickly he releases his shot at the shoot around today that guys gonna be outstanding here Applause foreign Applause final 20 seconds Applause Styles hes going out with a bang he wanted to foul as well Applause and thatll do it here in Charlottesville swings it turns Shore and Tony Bennetts team ranked fifth in the country is 50 well Tony Bennett I think you know its like a coachs dream you win the game you win the game comfortably he saw a lot of things that he liked but he also saw a lot of things that need Improvement and Tony Bennetts a guy who likes to go back to work so its all
