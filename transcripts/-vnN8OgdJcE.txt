lot of fun Boston College has lost two in a row after a defeat at home against Syracuse on Saturday so a day off for both and now back on the floor and here we go Boston College wins the opening tip theyll start with the basketball Elijah strong at the top to Chad venning and now it goes to Donald Han Jr Joshua beetle in the paint to venning backing down his man and puts it in thats where I think Boston College has the advantage in this game is on the interior Notre Dame not a team with a lot of size but Chad Benning is very skilled loves to get to that jump hook Boston College is going to have to take advantage of that interior Tay Davis down the floor gets both men to miss and then puts it in for the right block great control there I thought he was going to go straight up with that but great shot pick to get both Defenders off their feet Tay Davis the seat and Hall transfer is extremely talented not necessarily a great threepoint shooter but you saw right there the athleticism around the rim take a look at BC starting five Joshua Beetle now eight straight starts for the golden eagles and now strong with three seconds to shoot theres a miss and the rebound to Marcus buron pretty obvious right away what Boston College is going to try to do get that basketball inside lets take a look at Notre Dame starting lineup and theyve used this starting five for most of the season with the exception being when Marcus Burton was out for eight games with that knee injury now Eagles down the floor and Beetle off the glass in the left Josh Beetle the transfer from Clemson has played really well at times this year and thats what Boston College is going to have to do here on the road when they can get stops and get out on the break and score before Notre Dame can set up defensively theyll have some success ke ji gets it out to Matt Aloo the Princeton transfer for his Grandad year and now ji the Miss from the right block Austin College doing a good job early no threepoint attempts yet for Notre Dame a team that relies heavily on shooting the ball well from behind the arc Chad Benning in the paint again that time comes up short and Beetle has it ripped away by Applause Alo Marcus Burton preseason all ACC first team elction stops and puts it in obviously a great shot fake there by Marcus Burton when he got in the lane but how quick was that first step that was just a a great oneonone offensive move just beat the defender getting downhill to his right hand such an athletic guard you said it earlier David when he went down with the injury in November in their Vegas tournament there was concern about how long could Burton be out the fact that he only missed eight games 39 days speaks to the athleticism this kid has as he steps in the passing Lane and gets a steel Alo hands it off to J misses there and Alo somehow grabs the rebound between two Eagle Defenders made the right decision I thought for a second he was going to try to go up at wisely dribbled the ball back out get a reset Burton this time the miss Music Beetle tries to hit venning they almost lose it but Donald H comes up with it now hell take a long three from the top and that wont go Donald H Jr is a capable threepoint shooter shooting about 33 on the year but that is not his strength coach ear Grant is okay with him being aggressive offensively to try to get himself going a little bit cuz he has to score in order for the Eagles to win Burton has to score for Notre to win comes up short there missing the three from the left Applause wing now hand back to work for Boston College tries to get in the lane ji knocks it away from him and Burtons got it great truberry coachs son will send it back out to Marcus who sets up the offense that time lost it to Boston College and hand back down the floor SL little sloppy here by both teams early offensively neither one of these teams we see a tough Bank Shot there by Dion Brown both of these teams coming into this game in ACC play were giving up over 50 field goal defense but so far in this game both teams seem to be locked in being very active with their hands forcing early turnovers oh Tay Davis says hello to Boston College and that reaction from his teammates on the bench right there says it all great job faking the handoff when he took off right there I didnt know if he was going to be able to finish that but what a finish by Tay Davis goodness just got down the lane and quickly found that he had an easy Applause dunk maybe that gets some momentum going for Notre Dame and now ji fouled underneath by Dion Brown and it brings us to a Timeout on the floor Mah shury has been touting the athletic ability of Tay Davis with the hammer at the rim with authority Irish out the festivities tonight hes almost every game for Notre Dame here at purcel Pavilion as Jai hits the first free throw do you think Digger still has that sweater I hope so that was a classic great sweater and I hope he does have now but to your point Notre Dame obviously returned a lot of their key players from a year ago but their key players last year you SE Notre Dame got a little two three Zone here coming out of the timeout were freshman Marcus Burton was a freshman raen shury was a freshman obviously not with a year under their belt more experience but theyre still young so trying to put it all together theyve been so close lost a heartbreaker here about 10 days AG go to North Carolina at home gave up a fourpoint play about 5 Seconds To Go lost by one at North Carol state so theyre right there just havent been able to get over the hump yeah almost 86 of the team scoring back from a year ago thats the most of any ACC team so when you think about all the teams in college basketball and how these rosters have completely turned over year to year because of the portal and nil and all this stuff Notre Dame is in a fortunate position that they have most of those guys back but as you said still a very young team its team on the other side the Eagles in Boston College they are a completely different team from a season ago when they won 20 games heres Han from the wing drills a three that one looked a lot more comfortable there for Donald H Jr just much more in Rhythm that time on the catch and shoot we mentioned it earlier shoots about 34 on the season so capable just not a high volume shooter but that one looked pretty good leaving his hand you meant to say that right of course leaving his hand yeah no okay good just making sure now H Junior along the Baseline over Alo he got The Right Touch did you want me to say pun intended I felt like it was just too obvious it was right there I dont know the way you sold it it sounded so smooth I didnt know if you meant to or Music not clever man d page Ive always known that youre the first person to ever tell me that so thank you AO to the top and now Burton down the lane and he draws a foul LCA Tes picks up the foul take a look at Earl Grant season number four with BC but interesting in talking to coach Grant because you talk about the turnover of their roster as compared to Notre Dame its almost a completely new team and its a young team so he said you know Im in year four but in some ways it feels like year one because hes doing so much teaching with the new roster this year well I thought he said something today at shoot around that fits the landscape of college basketball right now better than anything Ive heard you no longer build a program you develop teams because your team is going to be so different on a yearly basis that the program building is almost a term of the past I thought that was really interesting but hes right and hes done a a pretty good job so far this year I mean I know theyve struggled C play 9 and seven had a great win earlier this year against a very good Boise State team but you said it Donald Dan Jr is really the only returner from a year ago so just a completely new team trying to get him to Jael in a short period of time Bren Shrewsberry end the shot clock misses the three tipped around groper sends it back to Alo and he knocks down the triple best time to shoot a three off an offensive rebound great rebound there by Julian rooper and Matt alako if hes going to get his feet set the Princeton transfer is just not going to Miss shot 50 40 and 90 last year at Princeton 50 from the field 40 from three 90 from the free throw line and its almost on track to do it again this year ball just kept alive just a great find there by rer and youre Donald H J there you got to get your hand up on 41 and make him put the ball on the floor so theyre looking at the shot clock cuz its showing 28 so the officials trying to work on getting that fixed Bert Smith Ted Valentine AJ Desai are officiating crew tonight they was putting some time back on the clock so well see how much they do ro Grant was all over that went right over to Ted Valentine right as the ball was inbounded said hold on 1237 remains here in this first half Music Luca Taves coming around the screen out of the top Payne trying to throw it inside and its taken away by Notre D Notre Dame read that the whole way Fred Payne had pass on his mind the entire time just telegraphed what he was going to do on that play but good defensive possession there for the Irish oh nice pass by Alo and pointing it in is Nikita constant ovsky and great wrap around bounce pass from Alo Notre Dame has switched it up a little bit defensively here switching a lot more at the top theyll switch one through three they prefer not to switch with their fours and fives depending on the Personnel line up but very comfortable switching and sir mohamd in the game capable of guard four positions as well turnaround jump shot good for Jaden Hastings red shirt freshman out of Orlando sir Mohammad hasnt played a ton yet this year puts it up there wont go now go the other way when we return but Mohammad had a good game against Duke well see what hes got in store tonight noted at 13 here early on Monday but they are fired up in South Bend everywhere I have been over the last couple days thats the only thing that any anybodys talking about it should be an incredible game in Notre Dame Ohio State for the national time doesnt get much better than that who you going with right now I dont know I dont know if I can say that in this building but I have a feeling that Ohio State might be winning all right Ill let you take the fall for that cuz you definitely not going to get out of here alive after saying that I know and now theres a Miss from Joshua Beetle and the rebound goes to the Irish be a great story obviously what Marcus Freeman and the Fighting Irish have done this year absolutely incredible and now sir Mohamad the basket and the foul and a free throw coming Music up Sir Muhammad the son of former Kentucky Wildcat great Nazi muhammd had a great successful long career in the NBA won a couple of rings with San Antonio Spurs Ser had a great game the other day ad Duke hit a couple of Threes early in the first half very versatile player athletic step out and knock it down mohamd comes up short on the free Music throw now McFarland into a double team and they whirl it around Chad has Kelly with 10 to shoot Kelly off Target from the Baseline the rebound to Burton that pretty good possession defensively for Notre Dame Boston colge was doing a good job of whipping that ball around keeping it moving but Notre Dame was right there on every catch forced a tough little Baseline Runner constantini trying to hit Burton but that pass too close to him and out of his fingertips to Beetle fourth turnover by the Irish Music now on the corner a three try off Target from Roger McFarland and Burton quickly back down the floor for Notre day Boston College had success on the first couple of possessions getting the ball inside Chad Benning getting ready back to check back into the game but these last couple of trips have settled for more perimeter based shots see if ear Grant urges his team to get the ball back inside they are a capable threepoint shooting team theyre not they dont rely on it very heavily we see another Notre Dame turnover the Boston College is at their best when theyre attacking getting to the rim just like Joshua Beetle right here and this is there and tipped back out open three for Payne and he knocks it down Fred Payne the softmore from Grambling Louisiana his first bucket of the game and Boston College now into the lead Fred pay not a high volume shooter only shoots about two threes per game but their best shooter percentage wise at over 41 and again best time to shooter threes off an offensive rebound good job there by the Eagles of keeping that one alive Burton tries to answer and does and Joshua Beetle just went up and through on that little dribble handoff and Marcus Burton got just enough space there to knock that one down Marcus Burton five early points couple of rebounds and steals for Notre Dame Irish made for of their last five field goals Chaz Kelly with a nice move Mo Music Applause Music inside and now a foul were going the other way but first heres Saturdays ACC Network basketball triple header Virginia Tech hosts wake for us to start us off to Eastern that Notre Dame in Syracuse square off at four finally Cal takes on NC State good slate on Saturday here as Nikita constantini picks up the foul and thats already two against the Monmouth Music transfer try trying to navigate into the paint but now whirls it out Boston College has found something here with this high in Middle ball Applause screen and now Kelly a three thats off Target rebound at to Applause locko offensive foul against the Irish its kevi got tangled up with Beetle and hes called for the foul and it brings us to a Timeout on the floor 7 51 to go first half not at an especially when youre coming in off the highway you can see the golden dome you know youre arriving at Notre Dame in Indiana here inside purcel Pavilion at the joy Center noted up at 18 its ACC battle between two teams at 1 and four the conference play but need a win Ela strong down low Chad Benning turns around on giant scores yeah when Chad Benning gets back to that left shoulder that right hand on the jump H it is very very difficult to stop just a deliberate middle ball screen to get him on the roll and throw it inside good execution there by Orrs team coming out of that Music timeout now whistle underneath BC needed a good offensive possession nine of their 20 points have come off of Notre Dame turnovers in the first half as loo picks up the foul Earl Grant said that was going to be one of the keys to this game is to embrace longer possessions against not a youre able to get a good one there t Davis trying to get to the paint landed awkwardly a bit there as venning called for the foul know Tay Davis when he faces up he is almost impossible to stop hes got such a good handle and hes so athletic and quick that when he faces up as soon as you put your hand on him its going to be a foul we obviously sell the dunk the start of this game little hobble there may have taken a knee to the thigh or a knee to the knee there appears to be okay staying in the game spins into the lane the kick out to Shrewsberry good close out there by Dion Brown on a terrific shooter in bra Shrewsberry three seconds to shoot and AO misses yeah good defensive possession there by the Eagles theyre doing a great job of getting out on the shooters Earl Grant said today that was the thing he used most worried about so we got to stop the threes venning at an open three misses now trying to crash the board but a foul on the floor Chad venning went after that as soon as he let it go he almost like he knew it wasnt going to go in Applause and Tay Davis I believe came up with the rebound Kei did excuse me but theyre going to get the foul call on Matt alako I believe on the hold on the blockout they give it to J that was his second personal and now hand from the Baseline no J grabs the rebound and Notre Dame not a team thats got a lot of depth in the front court so can help afford to have ji get into foul trouble and now wo with three to strong in the rebound Applause Brown strong strong going to work skip pass now brown into the paint tried to flip it out but AO there to take it away ran into three Irish Defenders and now burden for three from the corner in the Miss Notre Dame worked really hard today and shoot around on trapping the post anytime Chad venning or Elijah strong catches it theyre going to send somebody after him and strong strong did a good job of kicking it out right there a good job by Notre Dame closing out on the shooter now strong is fouled Penning trying to get it to him underneath Music not quite sure who they got that foul on there but officials going to take a look at the monitor make sure they get the correct number here thats on Kev ji thats his third yeah that would be huge two officials at the scores table to work this one out theyre going to give it to Burton so thats the first against Marcus Burton and a break for the Irish and now Elijah strong at the Music line ACC PM with Mark Packer weekdays for Eastern right here on accn and the ESPN app my partner was guest earlier on acc PN talking with Mark about things going on in the conference and Cooper Flags incredible game on Saturday against these Irish well theres been some surprises and some not so much surprises so far this season not so much of a surprise Cooper flag is the best player in the ACC and the country big surprise though I think is the Louisville Cardinals second place great win at Pittsburgh on Saturday Pat Kels done an unbelievable job in year one getting that program back to where it needs to be and the better Louisville is the better the AC see you so great to see the Cardinals playing well yeah theyve been fantastic end the shot clock here Davis didnt get the shot away violation against the Applause Irish you see the game that Cooper flag had against Notre Dame the 42 points in Dukes win Notre Dame actually played pretty well in that game and just talking to the Notre Dame coaching staff they felt like there were a lot of positives to come out of that game but just couldnt stop nobody could stop Cooper flag but he was in incredible on Saturday he absolutely was and his complete dominance in that game got got to the free throw line 17 times see a careless turnover here by Joshua Beetle I just dont know how you stop him he can shoot threes hes got a great midrange game he can post up he can face up he brings the ball up the court probably as much as anybody on their team he just he he really is almost an Unstoppable force on offense unless you run two or three guys at him you had Auburn now the number one team in the country but keep in mind Janai broom yeah arguably the second best player in the country went down with looked like a pretty severe anle spray over the weekend its going to be out for a few weeks so that is definitely something to keep an eye on Duke looks awfully scary right now certainly even with auburn as the number one team Beetle picked up the Music foul BC on a 6 nothing scoring run finding Irish trying to end that here Burton stops on the elbow puts it up cannot get it to go knocked out of bounds itll stay with Notre Dame you know Marcus Burton you obviously he had a great game his first game back against North Carolina came off the bench had 22 points hes been playing well but theres still just going to be a little bit of rust I mean missing eight games doesnt sound like a big deal but thats a third of your SE or 25 of your season basically so not only did he not get to play the games he had to rehab his knee and couldnt do a whole lot oh theres J for the putback slam second time today somebody for the Fighting Irish has come out of nowhere with a highlight reel dunk back to my point theres just going to be some Rust to shake off for Marcus Burton and its going to take some time and his teammates have to get used to playing with him again as well now jump ball is called and possession arrow will send it the other way keeva just untouched going to the rim just a great athletic play somebody for Boston College is going to have to check him next time not let that be so easy kic JY a guy that Micah Shrewsberry really trusts was with him at Penn State now here at Notre Dame with him and Davis the bucket and a foul I cannot say enough about how great Tay Davis has been so far in this game just his his quickness and his ability to get to the rim and just one or two dribbles here you see the face up ability and that 67 68 gets to the rim with one dribble from the threepoint line absorbs the contact and is able to finish see why Michael shuberry was so high on him getting him out of the portal from seat Hall and Indianapolis product went to Warren Central High School Warren Central kid Micah Shrewsberry from just outside Indianapolis obviously shrew baring knows this state quite well I coached at Butler with Brad Stevens whos at Purdue with Matt Painter spent so many years in the state obviously had great success at Penn State for a couple of years taking them to the NCAA tournament spent six years with the Celtics on Brad Steven staff now in year two at Notre Dame heres a three for the wing in hand with the nice touch and again Notre Dame was going to trap the post they sent Marcus Burton who was guarding the passer there was just miscommunication on the back side of the rotation once the ball got kicked out two guys ran to one Davis going for the dunk and its denied by venning tremendous block from Chad venning but this time G open misses and its off of venning out of bounds itll bring us to a Timeout on the floor dont get in Chad bennings way I dont think Chad Benning wanted to see another highlight reel dunk from Tay Davis just a great job timing it an unbelievable block Austin College playing some defense around the rim area look at the ACC now 18 teams in this league Boston College was picked to finish at the bottom of the league just because of how new their roster is Notre Dame was picked to finish 10th these two teams when they get together though theres usually a lot of close games been another one here Applause tonight theres sir muhamad from the wing for three that wont go grabs his own board underneath the ho puts it back nobody even just went to try to get sir Muhammad out of the way he he saw he just had a clear Lane to the basket off of the offensive rebound just said hey nobody else wants to go get this ball I will but one of the few times so far in this game Notre Dame has gotten out on the break tried to beat this Boston College defense before it set up now Payne for three and Fred Payne has knocked down two of those in the first half again not a high volume shooter as far as number of Threes per game but a very good shooter percentage wise Burton is fouled by Taves second on Luca Taves The Music Freshman no good job there by Donald Han Jr just got in the lane just enough to draw Bren shry good recognition on the kick out Fred Payne shooting the ball well here early but on the other end Boston College is going to have to make Marcus Burton go to his left hand every time hes been successful getting in the lane so far in this game its been to his right hand every time his dominant hand know from a scouting standpoint you dont always say hey just forcing Boos left no matter where he is on the floor but if he gets to his right he is just too quick to stay in front of Marcus Burton knocks down both free throws Burton seven first half Music points Burton trying to wrestle that ball away and a jump ball called but possession arrow will stay with Boston Applause College both teams playing fairly well here defensively in this first half Notre Dame with seven steals Boston College with five in their own right just not a whole lot to show for they havent been able to turn those steals into easy offense on the other end Ving underneath and over J for the bucket Chad venning now with six first half Applause points mentioned the Steels turnovers there have been a lot of those in the first half nine so far for Notre Dame and seven for BC I think were going to get a technical here on Chad venning for saying something to Kev ji on his way back down the floor after scoring right there couldnt quite tell but BT Smith was pretty quick with the whistle there lets take a look again Chad venning when he gets to that right hand such a big body in there almost Unstoppable couldnt quite tell right there but BT Smith was quick on the trigger so he obviously saw something technical for on Sportsman life is what we are told so with that conduct it sends Burton to the line and he knocks down the free throws and sends fenning to the bench with his second personal foul yeah so not only did that give Notre Dame two points at the free throw line in possession of the basketball you just picked up your second foul so I know theres basketball is obviously an emotional game on the road possessions like that could end up just killing you Music Alo trying to get around tapes hes fouled and hell go to the line so theres a chance now for four points after the technical foul on Bennett not to mention that hes on the bench and Luca Taves The Freshman point guard has now picked up his third foul in the first half very deliberate there by Michael Shrewsberry saw the mismatch he wanted wanted Matt alako isolation on the wings so they just set a simple ball screen they knew Boston College was going to switch what they do quite frequently and just kind of cleared out almost an NBA style set right there which is no surprise spending six years on the Boston Celtics bench with Brad Stevens should probably pick up a thing or two absolutely big influences for Shrewsberry for sure and now Alo how about the swing that that technical foul provided and Notre Dame now into the lead by by two yeah that was a huge momentum swing like you said in Mato known as a threepoint shooter but that time very clever just putting the ball on the floor almost looked slow motion said you know what Im just going to take my time here nobody wants to guard me Ill go ahead and shoot it yeah five straight points for the Fighting Applause Irish Kelly the kick out tabes remains in the game with three fouls into the shot clock BC doesnt know it they get called for a violation good possession there defensively by the Irish doing a great job of getting out on Closeouts didnt allow an easy post entry there with bending on the bench Jaden Hastings for Boston College very capable but not quite as effective scoring in the low post second time here Boston College has gone to this 221 34 Court more than anything just a slow Notre Dame down make him eat some clock in the back court so now by the time they get the ball over get into what theyre trying to do theres already only 20 seconds left under a minute to go now here on the first half Davis gets by Hastings man his first step is so quick and again getting to his right hand Tay Davis and Marcus Burton are able to get to that right hand with those quick first steps they are really difficult to stop biggest lead for Notre Dame in the first half just four points now hand down low Hastings against the double loo trying to take it out of his hands and a jump ball will send it the other way good help defense from Matt oo Tay Davis again just facing up such a good handle there you see got 67 handles the ball like that really really impressive you say just stay in front of him dont let him get through him well thats a lot easier said than done especially when youre going against someone with Tay Daviss ability Notre Dame is scored seven straight over the last 134 much of it because of that technical foul against Benning now theres about a second difference between the shot and the game clock as Notre Dame can work it down to the end of the half with the lead and you dont want to go too soon here you want to make sure you get the only shot attempt here you dont want to get Boston College a chance by going too soon Davis with five puts it on the back backboard no good but a foul is called with 28 Grant not real happy with that call there whistle was certainly late but just double high ball screen Tay Davis going to his left hand you see the explosiveness and yeah Ro gr sees that he watches this game later on hes definitely not going to be happy not much contact there at all but nonetheless Tay Davis going back to the free throw line its tough being a Defender these days you go up with the offensive player basically you have to go straight up and hope that theres no contact at all well see theyre even harder against a guy like Tay Davis when we saw the Highlight re dunk early in this game you better meet him first because if you let him get to you its not going to end well as the defender Tay Davis good first half for the Fighting Irish first player into double figures and will take a quick timeout with 32 left in the half and Notre Dame up five oh never mind Im done okay I dont even know what he all right was Music Music Applause Music Thursday at 10 Eastern the nothing but net crew will break down the night and the ACC highlights analysis of every womens game well look ah the best matchups on the schedule for the weekend weve got you covered all season right here ACC Network and the ESPN app see Muppet McGraw hanging in the Rapters shes got a statue outside of the joy Center one of the many great luminaries of Notre Dame basketball history Tay Davis at the free throw line for one more already 10 first half points for Tay make it 11 Notre Dame with a sixpoint lead with 32 to go here in the first half Notre Dame has a foul to give but theres I dont think theres enough time left on the clock to try to commit that foul B to hand one second the three is good and how about that oh Bren Shrewsberry who had a very quiet first half didnt get a whole lot of space to get any shots off Marcus Burton you cant help on drives so a guy like Tay Davis is going to have a lot of success because if you help hes just going to kick it out to a great threepoint shooter so you almost have to pick your poison and in the first half Boston College said were going to stay at home on the perimeter and let them try to get to the rim and Notre Dame was very successful doing so second half begins in its Boston College basketball Chad venning with six first half points finding Beetle cutting to the basket and scores and a tough finish there Joshua Beetle caught the ball almost couldnt tell if he lost grip on it or whatnot but a great cut there Chad venning got established on the post they knew they were going to trap him just a great cut and a great find good start for Boston Applause College buron going to work now Davis against strong spins into the paint puts it up and scores we saw him get to his right hand very predominantly in that first half but a great spin move back and a good touch on the floater feeling Michael Shrewsberry is going to stay with that hot hand just continue to isolate him on a wing and let him go to work 13 now for Tay Davis Elijah strong being doubled cuts through it Penning I dont think realized how open he was now brown the pass underneath strong the bucket in the foul really really good interior passing there by Boston College couple times one of them could have gone up and forced it but they just continue to pass the ball to the open guy and a great shot B on the Baseline by Elijah strong you see a great overhead view Chad Benning didnt want to force it great pass that right there the shot fake Elijah strong able to go to the other side of the rim went up finished strong and again Boston College starting this half the way they started the game pound that basketball inside 10th tie in this game were noted at 38 elij just drawing the sophomore out of Charlotte its been a constant starter constant presence on this new look Eagles roster mostly came off the bench last year he was kind of a kid who was late recruited because he got himself into great shape and all of a sudden started getting big offers but Earl Grant was in on him early and was able to get him to join the Eagles he has certainly been a key player for this years roster venning picks up his third foul right there so Chad venning has to go to the bench well something to keep an eye on obviously that foul situation with Chad Benning but I go back to that first half how big now does that technical huge huge to get the third foul and then Burton wide open there more open than I think he thought he was going to be and misses the Music bunny nowo called for a foul on hand when you said it Jordan I dont think he expected to be this uncontested at The Rim almost caught him off guard not going to get much of an easier look than that and you see that happen a lot right guys get open they dont expect to be so open and then it kind of messes with you we see it a lot from a threepoint shooting St standpoint sometimes guys there wont be anybody within 15 ft of them and its almost more Awkward to shoot at that wide open than with somebody guarding you eight to shoot now for Boston College hand smooth over Shrewsberry for three well pun intended this time lets keep that hot hand going for Boston College and Donald H Jr picking up great pass and Burton theres a goal by Hastings so Burtons basket will count and a great pass there by Tay Davis from the high post just a little back screen on the wing miscommunication for Boston College just a breakdown defensively but a great feed Marcus Burton even without the goalen wasnt going to miss that one Burton now with 11 points himself Music strong drills a three and Elijah strong now with eight tonight and thats something hes very very capable of doing shoots about three threes per game so very confident and now ji with the tip back that all started with Tay Davis attacking the rim and Jaden Hastings and Elijah strong both went to block the shot so nobody accounted for kevi on the offensive rebound had a free reign at it he dont try to get to the Lane hes fouled Kaji will pick up the foul thats his second well you see Jaden Hastings come over and nobody accounts for his man on the offensive rebound guards for Boston College have to get back in there and put a body on him instead of staying out on the perimeter watching starting to see some momentum pick up for both these teams on the offensive end first half we saw a lot of turnovers Beetle at the free throw line for Applause VC heres Saturdays ACC Network basketball triple header Virginia Tech hosts Wake Forest to start us off two Eastern then Notre Dame and Syracuse square off at four finally Kell takes on NC State I think there were about six Lane violations on that free throw attempt right there I was going to say who is it on seemed like everybody going to go against BX Im not sure how B Smith was able to tell who went in first yeah lane violation entire Music team Tay Davis going to work on Brown muscles by him then has it blocked by Hastings and now Jai is fouled from behind by strong I believe yep another D just is going to continue to take advantage of the switching by Boston College that time Luca T got switched on the mismatch lot of contact there on the initial one Tay Davis but again kevi right spot at the right time with the offensive rebound and Luca Taves has three fouls or excuse me that time it was Dion Brown so Michael Shrewsberry just trying to get that mismatch on the Boston College switching tried to take advantage of it Kev next down the first the foul one against Hastings so kevi we go one trying to get Notre Dame back within Applause Music one and now some words between Davis and Hastings they got to be careful because you pointed it out in the first half when Benning picked up the technical foul that was a big momentum swing as a result to know today good job there by the officials too just break it up nothing escalated to where you need to go take a look at anything so lets just keep playing basketball good rivalry between these two teams 45th alltime meeting tonight first meeting between the two was February 7th of Music 1963 longstanding rivalries these two teams changed conferences several times but have always found themselves together and now in the corner strong stepped on the line out of Applause bounds after the freether here just Jaden Hastings and Tay Davis getting locked up and what what I do what I do why is everybody looking at me yeah arm locked up usually though they get the guy the retali yep second guy always gets caught Hastings didnt get called for anything good on the officials Burton now into the lane kick Shrewsberry for three that wont go that was the best look BR Shrewsberry has had and were going to get a loose ball foul here pay Davis and it brings us to a Timeout on the floor Boston College up one mikah Shrewsberry going to talk it over with his Music team for the American Red Cross would be greatly appreciated well a special shout out too to the all the First Responders out there in Los Angeles and from all over the West Coast in the country for that matter that are trying to help just unimaginable tragedy just awful awful stuff true heroes people that are going to run towards something like that when your instinct is to run away onepoint game 4544 Boston College the lead on the road Earl Grants team trying to pick up a big win at Notre Dame theyve won six in the last seven games against the fighting IR M Dame has lost four in a row overall just trying to get back into the wind Music column tried to get Tay Davis isolated here and BR shry coming off a little screen but Boston College has done a great job all night of not letting bra and Shrewsberry get any daylight whatsoever sir mohamd into the paint floats him with the right hand now Music thought about the three doesnt take Applause Music it good match up here between Tay Davis guarding Donald H Jr Josh Beetle Clemson or excuse me Boston College coaching staff said this is our guy at the end of the shot clock put the ball in his hands two seconds to shoot Beetle no tried to float it up there for on the left block but just couldnt get the roll first time BCs missed here in this second half they started four for four from the Music field and now the Fighting Irish back to work Marcus Burton trying to get to the paint hes f Music second B on Roger McFarland drewberry will get moment to rest Malo comes back in for Notre Dame be curious to see how long Earl Grant keeps Chad venning over there on the bench men picked up that third foul obviously early here in the second half but hes been very effective scoring on low post graduate senior you got to think at some point Earl Grant will trust that experience to not pick up that fourth foul loo down the paint kick out Mohamed a good look misses the three rout continues for no today Michael Shrewsberry frustrated right there Mato telling him got in the lane shot BAC can go up with it draw that foul it was a good kick out sir mohamd was wide open Farland lost the handle loose on the deck everybodys going for it all right possession arrow will send it the other way wiing up the floor bodies flying all over the place here hard to believe you would have told me coming into this game that Notre Dame is only two for 11 from three and only down one with 13 minutes to go I would had a hard time believing that but to make up for it theyve gone 12 for 14 from the free throw line so again a little contrary to what theyre used to doing but its been effective for him Notre Dame 372 on the season from three now a kick LCA Luca Taves went down ball was kicked Marcus Burton had the key tostanoski wide open under the rim there on the ball screen tried to get it to him but just telegraphed his pass a little too much one little ball F and he would had a wide open dump but great hustle keep the play alive and get on the floor Tes also picks up his fourth fou so tavs going to have to be careful here he hasnt played much in the second half cuz he had three comes in immediately gets the fort and theyre going to work trying to isolate him again from that Wing loo kicks it out Burton has a good look misses the three grabs the long rebound now into the paint and had that one redirected Fred pay back to hand open three doesnt have the hot hand there and now a kick out Taves for three he cant get it to go and constantini comes down a b you know Fred Payne made a great pass there by Boston College to his teammate Donald Han Jr but Donald Han junor he didnt step into the line he wasnt quite ready had to take that dribble I think thats what threw him off a little bit and now buron around Tes for the bucket T is trying to say he hooked me right there Im really impressed with just the resiliency of Marcus Burt just he doesnt stop attacking the rim obviously not the biggest guy on the court by any stretch but just Relentless and fearless getting into the lane Taves to the corner now hand stops on the Baseline misses there fight for the rebound and constantins got it Boston College started seven of their first 12 from three theyve missed a few here over the last couple minutes sir Mohamed Burton into the pain around Taves no still trying to work that match up good defense by Taves and now a three try off Target from Payne tip back comes out to Burton Marcus Burton good job there recognizing didnt have a whole lot but going to continue to go anyways he going to turn the ball over yeah thats a thats a frustrating one right there for Michael Shrewsberry clear travel on Marcus buron and it brings us to a Timeout on the floor 1137 to go here at the joy Center onepoint Music game Marcus Burton still working his way back into basketball shape but has had success tonight getting to the rim great jump stop under control playoff two ft got to love to see that great recognition here on the dribble handoff Joshua Beetle going under good recognition knocking down the three just taking his time right here not panicking but that last play right before the timeout little frustration here did a good job initially of pulling it out cuz he didnt have numbers and then changed his mind and tried to force the issue Notre Dame with the turnover so a little bit of an up and down night for Marcus Burton not the most efficient shooting night in a couple of turnovers but its had some moments as well kind of a microcosm of how this game has gone not the prettiest game offensively for either team but close game nonetheless reigning ACC rookie of the years trying to work his way back but still been an incredibly efficient player for most part this season averaging almost 19 points per game coming in and now venning the travel that was a great great job there by kevi of not letting venning get to his right hand or his left shoulder he sat on that shoulder made him go back the other way Chad Benning just wasnt comfortable turned the ball over Chad venning who picked up his third foul in the first couple of minutes of the second half has been on the bench most of the time but now back on the floor guarding Ser mohamd here and Michael Shrewsberry trying to take advantage of the switches that time they didnt switch and a great finish by matako they knew that Chad venning did not want to pick up that fourth foul hes got to be a little bit more tentative on defense great recognition there with the twoman game that play set it up perfectly I was just about to ask you because for a guy like Benning whose game is to be physical its got to be tough to play with three fouls but if Donald H shoots like that it may not matter yeah that was in Rhythm off the handoff little screen at the top just took that one little dribble and he has shot the ball extremely well tonight not necessarily his strength as a player but tonight has looked really really impressive shootting the basketball five of six from the threepoint Arc Donald H 17 points nine to shoot for Notre d k Davis going to work and if they get Ving there that would be his for yep sure is wow comes into the game Earl Grant wanted to get one of his key players back on the floor and he picks up his fourth foul within the first minute yeah when Tay Davis took off right here I thought he was going to try to dunk it and I think youre Chad venning right there you either to get there sooner and just wall up and show your hands or just let him go you can always get a basket back but you cant get a foul back but Earl Grant electing to stay with him here with 10 minutes to go that those four fouls expect Michael Shrewsberry here to continue to try to exploit that match up somehow someway try to get Benning to pick up that fifth foul Point Hastings back into the game hes got two foul down now down Tay Davis knocks down two 15 points tonight for Tay Davis to lead the Irish Tay Davis through the first 16 games of the year before tonight had shot 100 free throws on the season a very good free throw shooter 76 very very impressive Miss there from Chaz Kelly the third the rebound ji Bren Shrewsberry has not scored yet tonight 0 for three from the field and yet the Irish still with the lead you got Tay Davis playing as well as he has and again trying to get that oneonone match up here against Fred pay the smaller Defender but good defense here by Boston College only six on the shot clock Davis going to work three on the shot clock two puts it up no hand has it taken away and Davis scores in the foul what a sequence for Notre Dame how about the effort by Julian roer on the offensive rebound that was a great possession defensively by Boston College and nobody accounted for him just came in and stole the ball right out of Donal Jan Jrs hands and of course it ended up in the hands of Tay Davis got in the lane another successful shot fake that that possession right there could end up being one that we look back on before this games over Boston College played great defense just gave up the second chance opportunity and Notre Dame capitalized on it Julian roer hasnt played a lot of minutes tonight the transfer from northwester whos been in this program now for a couple of years roer a guy that has said publicly how much he wants to help his teammates be a leader on this team senior out of Detroit comes into the game makes a great play there and now gives Notre Dame a little breathing room up by five Music under 9 minutes to go strong from the Baseline wont go rebound Applause job another Dame again going to look to continue to try to exploit that match up on the side here now they got Tay Davis tend to shoot for Notre Dame Alo against Kelly turns around on him two to shoot got to put it up scores and the foul well Michel Shrewsberry was begging for a foul call prior to that on Chaz Kelly but a good job here by matako just taking his time didnt force it and Drew just enough contact there on the little fade away see a good angle here yeah and as soon as you get that arm to swat down and break the plane even if the offensive player kind of initiates the contact by going up into his motion you just cant make contact with the shooter whos already started the process so good call there another Dame all of a sudden tried to open this game up a little bit with an eightpoint lead with just over8 minutes to go8 nothing Run for the Fighting Irish 143 over all over the last 819 and theyve got their largest lead at eight points Dame has done a really good job here these last two possessions Boston College is running a single double type action the guy coming off the Baseline has the option but theyve defended it well off J with eight minutes to go and itll bring us to a Timeout on the floor itll be Boston College ball when we return but the momentum has shifted the way Irish trying to close this one out here at home Mah Shrewsberry team on an 80 run make it 143 over the last 842 in the first half we saw each team commit nine turnovers in the second half Notre Dame just one turnover BC got a lot of points in the first half off turnovers havent been able to this half Joshua Beetle into the shot clock scores may have an injury down here I think its ke of giant went you block that shot couldnt quite tell what happened but came down a little awkwardly I think you dont want to see that no and if youre gut Dam you can H afford to lose a front Court player especially someone like Kev who had a very good game been very active on the offensive backboard hes limping off constantini will come back in oh yeah landed on a foot it looks like yeah Joshua Beetle theyre what do they say the paper cut is the worst kind of pain well whoever came up with that obviously never landed on somebodys foot spraying their ankle cuz first couple of minutes of doing that is excruciating lets hope hes okay and can return to the game they need to have him on the floor they Music do Tay Davis working against Brown gets around him misses the shot there and the rebounds out great play by rer to get it back to a locko yeah theyre going to take a look at the shot clock I was going to say the shot clock wasnt right on that it went it didnt reset then it went to 30 it was supposed to go to 20 yep the ball definitely hit the rim good defense there hey davs got a decent look just kind of a loose ball and Boston College never had possession so that should have just gone back to 20 but a couple of seconds should have come off but what a heads up play by Julian roer just with a little back tip right there well hes made a couple of those now over the last few minutes he hasnt played a ton tonight but in the minutes that hes played 12 minutes tonight making plays like this in ACC games only plays about 15 minutes a game but leads the team in steals arguably their best defender but just hustle plays like this that dont really show up in the stat sheet that can be differen makers in a close game like this look like they are going to reset the shot clock to 28 surprises me a little bit cuz I didnt think Boston College ever took possession of the basketball normally on an offensive rebound it only resets to 20 but nonetheless here we are so not D will get a full crack at it here roer will be the man to Music Applause Music inbound Boston College electing not to switch that time they want to keep Donald hay Jr on tay Davis loo comes around Davis and puts it in thats one of the issues with going back and forth between switching sometimes and not switching is there was just miscommunication Donald H Jr stayed on tay Davis out on the perimeter and allowed Matt Alo again Julian roer with a deflection coming over here right to your lap I was ready I dont know I think I was more ready than you were going the other way you were backing up ready to receive again just the activity defensively the deflection good hustle after the loose ball by both guys Julian roer having an impact on this Music game rer playing key defensively now Benning with four fouls back in the game with 640 to go Elijah strong against the double Works through it misses the shot good job there by not Dame Braden Shrewsberry came down late to trap provided just enough resistance to kind of throw the Rhythm there of Elijah strong off Shrewsberry hes going to take the three over Brown yeah I thought he should have shot the first one initially but I think thats a result of having a quiet game so now youre starting to think about it a little bit Music more and a whistle here Shrewsberry o over for four from the field all have been threepoint attempts and see initially he caught it and had just as much space as Dion Brown provided on the second attempt and its very hard when you catch it you hesitate and then to say okay maybe I should shoot it but a guy like Bren Shrewsberry all it takes is one good look to get him going his teammates will continue to look for him hes too good of a shooter to ignore oh roer guarding hand tightly and now they get him for a Music foul for Boston College here where are you going for offense Chad venning obviously has had some success inside but the foul trouble has kind of taken him out of rhythm a little bit Julian roer guarding Donald Han Jr best defender on best offensive player now a strong in side thats blocked by constantini out of bounds T to shoot as Boston College will retain it the double came and they forced Elijah strong to spin Baseline and just kind of ran out of room there behind the backboard 10 seconds on the shot clock and Notre Dame worked really really hard today defending these underneath out of bounds plays Dion Brown against the loo spins on Alo puts it up no rebound constantini well constantinos had a couple big defensive rebounds in this game another guy who doesnt play a ton but with Kei over there on the bench still trying to get that ankle going they see extended minutes here over the last five sitting near coach Shrewsberry now if to maybe say hey I might be able to go back out there and now buron blocking foul on beetle its the eighth te foul so Notre Dame and the bonus the rest of the way Notre Dame on on the year a very good free throw shooting team 74 y 524 to go in this one so as the clock starts to wind down if Notre Dame can continue to be pretty solid at the free throw line help Micah Shrewsberry team end their fourgame losing streak hon knocks down the Applause first what an ACC Network womens basketball double we have for you Thursday night Hannah hielo number three Notre Dame host 13th ranked Georgia Tech 6 Eastern then number 14 Duke hosts number 24 Cal and Cameron indor all on acc Music Network Denning now going to work against Constantin noski and puts it off the window and again I know Im being a dead horse here but him getting back to that right hand has been extremely effective for constantini right there you almost just want to sit on it and just make him go back to his left now rer back to the top and Burton takes it spins into the lane it gets by Beetle no Roper there for the footb how about the minutes Julian roer has provided for this Notre Dame team tonight Marcus Burton again missing a point blank layup but who else is there Julian roer making some significant contributions off the bench on both ends of the floor and now strong throws it and rer there to take it away Notre Dame is switching everything and thats okay you dont worry so much about getting burned in the post because you know that theyre coming to double and trap so even if a guy like Marcus Burton gets get caught on Elijah strong its okay cuz you know the double team is coming Burton navigates into the paint and plays it in in traffic Burton now with 17 and a timeout Boston College with 355 remaining in this one Notre Dame trying to pull away and win one here at home Music Applause Music well I think because of that 42 number you come into the game saying okay we have to stay at home stay attached to our guy cant help as much off the dribble well give credit to Tay Davis and Marcus Burton they have just been phenomenal off the bounds just oneonone its just oneonone basketball and has been extremely effective Notre Dame 36 six points in the paint the Boston College is 18 I mean that really has been the difference in the game Notre Dame is also dominated on the offensive backboard 20 second chance points so they are literally doing it in the paint tonight hand has had a good night tonight missed the three there and now whistle and a foul on the floor and it brings us to another Timeout on the floor but Notre Dame up 12 with 338 left micel Shrewsberry Club trying to get back in the wind Music column night just a big time performance from the Indianapolis natives 338 to go Boston College trying to get the ball in bounded but they get a 5c call man right out of the timeout thats a tough call for Earl Grants team and a turnover by The Eagles 16 miscues tonight for Boston College well assistant coach for Notre Dame Mike farelli who had the Scout today will be really really pleased with that this gu locking in attention to detail Davis getting around two Defenders and throwing it down with two hands just count can not believe how quickly he gets from the threepoint line in the perimeter to the rim and now Beetle will go to the line after hes fouled on the way up little side ball screen just gets there before Boston Collins can even react defensively really good along that Baseline and I love his mindset of how he attacks the rim he is thinking dunk on everything we saw the highlight real dunk in the first half which I have a feeling a lot of people may see later on Sports Center but his mindset is phenomenal just go attack the rim on everything Beetle knocks down the first free throw yeah theres been a few Big Time plays underneath the basket tonight Davis had the big dunk early in the first half as a big dunk now Beetle knocks down the free throw Boston col down 12 this is a very close game for most of it but Notre Dame has had the momentum in the second half they stopped turning the ball over Boston College unable to capitalize on it one of the reasons why the Fighting Irish look like theyre on Pace to get themselves a win fou here on Hastings give UT damn credit they did a great job of adjusting Donald hyen Jr had it going offensively shot the ball really well was knocking down threes they put Julian roer into the game who just checked back in right now was their best on ball Defender and hes got the size to match up with Donald Han Jr and did a good job of not letting him get anything easy and that was the difference Boston College just went cold offensively and that was a big reason why Davis knocks down the free throw Donald Han offensively and you said it hes had a really good game 17 points 6 of 11 for the field five of seven from Deep he just hasnt gotten shots up since Ropers been on him oh yeah one out of two and who got the rebound Mr rer hes been everywhere tonight leading all players tonight in plus minus as well plus 20 at the last timeout and now Burton down the lane and a Applause foul its Dion Brown 237 to go fighting Irish last year lost both games to BC by three points each last year in this building on January 27th 2024 the 6158 BC win in this building there was a period in this alltime series where Notre Dame just kept winning and winning and winning they went on 19 of 21 streak in recent years the Eagles have been winning the games and tonight looks like the Irish are going to get back in the wind column unless the Eagles make a huge run here late well michah Shrewsberry said it today when we had a chance to talk to him after their shoot around he said we just we just need to see a win and see some success that thats what gets guys to just have some more confidence he goes we everybody believes in what were doing practices has been very spirited the guys have been engaged you know they lost here at home a couple weeks ago to North Carolina they were up three with 5 seconds left and fouled on a three in the three winning they end up losing by one they go on the road lose at North Carolina state by one go to Duke on Saturday which weve talked about were down 14 nothing and then outplay Duke the rest of the way after that so theyve been right there and just havent been able to get over the hump but it appears tonight theyre going to be able to do so so be curious to see moving forward how this game may have the potential to kind of catapult them going into the rest of the regular season and in those two onepoint losses Burton had a shot at the buzzer which may have changed the fortunes for Notre Dame theyve been so close just a young team thats close and now Kelly knocks down the triple from the wing Chaz Kelly now five points tonight for Music VC you said it just to see a win be really important this Notre Dame team is building something and you talk about all these transan rosters they got 85 of their scoring back theyre able to keep some of these guys together as they move towards March be a tough team to play against well its always difficult coming in here this is the joy Center I still have PTSD from a lot of bad experiences here myself Alo for three at the end of the shot clock no Davis yes and the foul doesnt that sum up his right there just points in the paint for the Fighting Irish Tay Davis now with 23 L clock matako had to put it up and Tay Davis just again shot fake theyve had a lot of success tonight just little shot fakes got to love the reaction there of the bench and I just we talked about it a minute ago just a a feelgood win almost just to see the rewards from the hard work that theyve been putting in you know it could be very deflating to lose two games like they did to North Carolina and North Carolina State so Im sure this one will feel good in the locker room afterwards Tay Daviss career eye is 27 hes at 24 for tonight 125 to go really from that opening thunderous dunk all the way through he has been the consistent offensive performer for Notre Dame and thats without Michel Shrewsberry having a very quiet night Notre Dames Le third leading score by his standards as we see Kelly knocked out another three but thats a good sign though if youre Michael Shrewsberry to see one of your better players your best threepoint shooter to have a very quiet night other gu stepping up in his absence a definitely a team win here tonight coming up next for Notre Dame belove a few days off after they played Saturday and then tonight just like BC play this weekend at Syracuse at the Dome Tay Davis again well if he does that I dont know how you guard him this first time weve seen him shoot the little midrange and it looked really good just one of those nights where everything is going in one more point to tie his career best he can get it his Notre Dames going to have to do something with this offensive possession of Music 15 nine second difference between the shot and the game clock as the Fighting Irish going to end that four game skid played a really good second half tonight but this guy has been the reason Tay Davis decides to kick and ji drills the three unselfish play from Davis who could have had the career by career best and ji will hit the three and now a Miss there from Kelly Roper grabs the rebound fittingly and the Notre Dame Fighting Irish end up winning this one by 18 tonight 7860 the fun and what a performance by michah shrewsburys team to bounce back after those four straight losses a needed win here on their home court Tay Davis is doing it all for the Irish impressive performance by seven in white great day for Tay Davis 26 points in this one and the Fighting Irish pick up their eighth win of the season and their second in ACC play final score 7860 tonight for David padet and our entire crew my name is Jordan burnfield thanking you for watching this one here at the purcel Pavilion at the joint Center fans are going to home happy its a good time to live in South Bend the Irish pick up the win over Boston College
