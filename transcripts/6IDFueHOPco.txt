right behind him Cameron Hildreth just over 13 points per game for Hildreth joined by Williamson Monsanto and Andrew Andrew Carr heres a look at the Toyota starting lineup visit your local Toyota dealer today for Notre Dame for you about Starling and what hes done he and his teammates are going to shoot some threepointers they average over nine made threes per game thats second of the ACC and their third best percentagewise from Beyond The Arc wake forth in the traveling black at old gold has the opening tip and Tom Notre Dame are in Wake Forest going small with their starting lineup they feel its a better matchup with Notre Dames threepoint shooters both of these teams very good offensive teams not so much defensively Wake Forest second in the conference over 77 points per game take of the shot clock deep heres Carr from behind the line lecheski grabs it for the Irish Applause yeah thats thats the one matchup they were really concerned with was lachevski outside and Carr is a is a much better matchup than Marsh on him Irish 10 and 12 this season to a nine in conference play that includes a recent win here at home on Saturday against Louisville 7662 no midweek game Goodwin with the spin couldnt finish it off and couldnt Chase it down and looked for Notre Dame to post their guards go and and uh startling on the great take there by Hildreth whos made a huge jump this year big Improvement 13 points a game the crossover and you know theres no shot blocker out there for Notre Dame theyre going to take charges olshevski was late sliding over and uh one thing Notre Dame cant suffer Tom they cant get in anybody in foul trouble they are really thin 77 percent from the line of the season for Hildreth unable to complete the old school threepoint play for the sophomore from Worthing England Irish shot 45 percent as a team in the winning effort past Saturday heres Cormac Ryan long distance on the three and Appleby snares it number one on the run and the recovery in the block Hammond got back to block that shot by Appleby and now Hammond at the other end hell have a chance at a threepoint play you know I think that Notre Dame will be more opportunistic and theyre running they dont play at Great Tempo but here on the block shot things opened up you got Appleby Trail in the play thats a terrific block there and then on the other end he pays it off him and with the nice lefthand finish Marcus Hammond the graduate student from Queens New York has a threepoint play hes a transfer from Niagara first year in the Notre Dame program 129 games in his collegiate career of course you could say that extensive experience about a lot of these Notre Dame players one of the oldest teams in the country as far as experienced six grad students Santo is the threepoint specialist for Wake hes inside the line and gets a kind Purcell Pavilion bounce and uh you know nice shot good soft touch but if youre Notre Dame thats what youd prefer long twos from him instead of Threes he doesnt do a lot of scoring inside the arc Wake Forest lost Tuesday at Duke 7573 Ryan offline and out of bounds and two the Demon Deacons Applause time for our forward keys to the game visit your local Ford dealer with Mike jaminsky yeah you look at it for Wake Forest we talked about last three games tom theyve lost by two points in each one theyve just got to finish things at the end and for Notre Dame control Tempo they will run but a little bit slower Pace in the half court its going to be a traveling violation for about Williamson the extra Stutter Step keep an eye on those keys as the game progresses Mike yeah Tom and Williamson has been dealing everybodys got some sort of uh issue you know he plays a ton of minutes and his back has been bothering has not been shooting the ball well in this losing streak starlins been shooting it well although that is Off the Mark well we saw him a couple weeks ago against BC he was very reluctant uh to you know insert himself into the offense but hes been more aggressive the rebound bounces out of bounds and will stay with the Irish Mike you talked about Starling in the win against Louisville he had 22 points that was a game high and hes got to feel like hes playing with grownups on this team Steve Forbes head coach for Wake Forest steady Improvement in his Seasons with weight coming from East Tennessee State as its head coach Goodwin trying to back his Man Down Monsanto the scoop pops around Monsanto grabs it a couple times that theyve tried to uh post Goodwin but Montana was a good matchup for him defensively Appleby put on the brakes that bounces off told you to expect threepoint shots from these teams but we havent seen yet Mike is a make from Beyond three point on over five I dont know that the wakeup call has arrived yet maybe after the first TV time out here they win again trying to work in the paint and races out of the corner cant spin it Appleby looking for help from Hildreth a good transition defense by Notre Dame to get back and stop the break Forest shot just 37 percent loss against Duke and a closein miss from Carr ie Starling get around Carr and he does it hes got a few really good time I love his game you know especially he gets that threepoint shot a little bit better you know the key in this game were looking for is the high finish on his follow through with mobility in that shoulder Hammond in the passing Lane thats 10 on 11 and 10 wins right you know its tough hes running downhill youre back pedaling and never an easy play but you have to understand hes lefthanded and wants to get to that side Marcus Hammond got his sixth start of the season so far making the most of it Applause points in the win against Louisville a week ago no midweek game for Notre Dame Hammond had a couple of Threes in that win against the cards who subsequently got their first win in ACC play against Georgia Tech up ahead Goodwin Santo just enough to disrupt Goodwin he was too concerned about where Monsanto was instead of finishing the play the cesky pokes it away two on two good win itll drop and hes going to the line for the Irish Applause Dane Goodwin the graduate student all the way to the rack and hell learn a free throw as well Irish in front foreign Market voted number one best supermarket in America and by zMAX micro lubricant extend engine life increased fuel mileage available at Advance Auto Parts 2015 the Irish won the ACC tournament in Greensboro with a win against North Carolina in the title game made it to the elite eight that Year Mike at the NCAA tournament and won 32 games back in 2015 and Mike Bray talked to us beforehand Tom about you know just finishing out the year he said his guy the spirits have remained good uh they come to work every day come to play every day feeling good about themselves after a win their last time out coach Bray announcing on January 19th that he would be stepping away from the Irish program as the alltime leader in wins Applause 13 NCAA tournament appearances now both teams different look theyre both going big thats some size at the four and the five and it gets Matt Zona on the floor coach said we would see Matt Zona 25 in white thats Hildreth couldnt get it over the front rim and zone is in the box score with the board weve seen uh some guards in on the post trying to take advantage of their size and this is the thing that uh C4s would like to keep Notre Dame in the half court but Carmack Ryan nice shot a graduate student from New York City and a transfer from Stanford 107 career games for format Ryan made threes this season with 44 approaching 200 career made threepointers fourth turnover for Wake Forest Ryan leads the break got it back from Starling with the aerial pass yeah hilders chased the play down and forced him to abort the shot bouncing two more coach Forbes doesnt like it he wants a timeout the lead is 10 for the Irish well take a look at this and we talked about keeping him in the half court they want to drive him off the threepoint line but Cormac Ryan the nice pullup give him they gave himself some space you know and the thing is that you know Notre Dame has not hit a three Tom but theyve been pretty efficient and theyve been opportunistic in those four turnovers and getting out and running and remember Wake Forest attempted 313s in their loss at Duke second most this season but were still waiting for that only two so far in this game the first six and a half minutes Applebee right now has not scored Hammonds been a factor for Notre Dame as well in the early going this is something that they fooled around with and lashewskys got he got picked up that early foul and he was able to were going to see some matchup zones for Notre Dame as well defensive foul Bradford that time got his elbow up trying to hold off his Defender first on Davion Bradford Applause Music a very tall lineup out there right now from Wake Forest I think Steve forms just trying to find a group thatll gel and work well together Trey wurtz is in there for Notre Dame as well number three in white and gold weve got the basketball now shot clock winding down back to Zona twoman game for the Irish thats a big offense I mean youve got lacheski out of the game its a threepoint shooter down in Matt Zona who has not seen a lot of court time is fired up as well he should be after that made basketball Notre Dame has made its last four shots and is on a 13nothing run of 164 foreign into the game for Wake Forest as well 34 in black and old goal hell be asked to shoot at three I dont know that that hit the rim Mike the officials yeah now theyre going to wave it off they reset the shot clock thinking that it did but uh not the case Clarence Armstrong Brent Hampton and our officials this afternoon there it is and theyre theyre half court theyre half court offense has not been very sound at all so there is a Timeout on the court the Irish in front 16 for the first half Matt Zona who had not played in the last two games for the Irish has a bucket here in the first half grabbed a rebound as soon as he came into the ball game Mike gray told us 25 would get some activity and he has for the Irish this season 10 and 12 on the year and the breakdown Mike for the wins and losses yeah you can see uh you know plus 10 and their wins they can score the ball 76 points a game and also a minus 10 and uh you know the opponents scoring as well they shoot it well 48 and they also get to the freethrow line too you know the big thing right now and this is a Notre Dame team that does take care of the basketball thats the one thing they do do a good job of and right now its 60 in turnovers for Wake Forest so the officials have determined that that previous sequence with the shot clock violation against Wake Forest Music so Notre Dame has the ball Notre Dame a decent shooting team on the season 45 percent and eight in the conference Mike mentioned the free throws their fourth best in the league has 75 from the strike interesting Cruise so far in this game the threepoint shot has been thats an offensive foul threepoint shot has not been a part of this game everybody Cormac Ryan picked up the offensive foul voted that the Irish make nine threes per game guess what Wake Forest makes a 91 and second best in the ACC havent seen the three offensive foul against Cormac Ryan theyre trying to work him into the lane area Applebee did a nice job of sliding and picking up the offensive foul dangerous pass its out of bounds can catch up with it Music seven turnovers in the first half right now the body language not real good for Wake Forest I mean turnovers four points in the first seven and a half minutes eight and a half minutes just Monsanto and Hildreth have made field goals and that picture right there will tell you take a look at Steve Forbes third season ninth overall as a head coach hes one and two against the Irish looks head coach of the Wake Forest Demon Deacons posted a victory against visiting Notre Dame last season Starling twisting and missing both teams actually have gotten into the lane and missed some layups wake is over its last six shot attempts with seven turnovers Appleby stepping into a three long rebound Ammon I cut off by the defending of Khan to go inside of 11 minutes to go in our first half so glad that youre with us wormy jaminsky Notre Dame Indiana ACC basketball and our outstanding production food ashesky Goodman had some position underneath Appleby with the foul trying to block him out and that was there were four or five black jerseys around Goodwin and he came up with the ball and with the size that wake has out there that should not happen Applause good win a Miss on the Baseline after scoring in double digits for 10 points in the win against Louisville and 10 rebounds got his second double double the season against the cards might have committed the foul at the other end Mike first foul but you know what and for not that you know theyre missing Paul Atkinson from last year so you know Goodwin has to rebound more Starling has to rebound more and they have been in this stretch Goodwin averages over five boards per game as Wake Forest throws it out of bounds Dane Goodwin Applause representing the Irish well as a graduate student School record 149th career game today for Dane Goodwin building on the school record didnt set it today and hell continue to add to his total as we head to Greensboro North Carolina were fighting Irish one a year in 2015 yeah and Tommy Wonder with the covid year thrown in there that if those records will ever be broken again you know unless theyve started to play a ton of games every year a lot of experience on the floor in and around college basketball and the ACC Applause ladies and lets you know yeah and thats uh they they needed that offense desperately but still I mean it was just there was a lot of standing around for wake and uh he was fortunate to get a good look Goodwin wants to answer that three from Monsanto Applebee up for the board and then he traveled his progress well nice job in him and got switched over defense quickly Appleby was not expecting that Mike this Monsanto three is the first by either team in the game combined one of ten nope was not an easy shot either hes the guy youd expect to hit a three for Wake hes made 69 on the season has 155 in his career he leads the team and threes made Hammond a little bit out of control Applause Monsanto let the defender fly on by misses the three car over the top it is tipped out of bounds and 10 Notre Dame Applause Music yeah really you know wake really you know relies on Hildreth and Appleby in Monsanto those big three have to have big games Applause Notre Dames win on Saturday stopped a fourgame losing streak their last win prior to that was also in conference play overtime at home midJanuary against Georgia Tech 7372 Applause Starling a multitude of moves Goodwin in traffic knocked away Clinton might have got a piece of it a good recovery second offensive rebound theyve given us a good one and then Clinton fills the lane from hildred Ill tell you you talk to the Wake Forest people and they love this kid they think hes going to be a terrific player and this is what wake thats when theyre at their best getting out running it all started with the block on the other end Bobby Clinton The Freshman from Malmo Sweden at eight points and four rebounds against Duke we had a couple of threes Applause Music normally youre playing him for a pop coming off that screen but he kept on curling had his defender on his back first two points of the game for Nate leszewski about the game we saw him Mike at home against Boston College recently in a loss it was just didnt miss much in that game 29 Points at a career high for lucchesky against the Eagles and the home loss all right Applause good one Applause just about seven and a half minutes to go here in our first half deep alltime meeting between the programs Starling not high enough on the Square see you guys Williamson thats the one that hes got to finish inside Music number four in Black transferred from East Tennessee State where he played for Steve Forbes and its Clinton Nifty move yeah taking over in this game got on The Fast Break early on puts the ball on the floor shoots it well enough from three that you have to honor him from Beyond The Arc as Clinton took it right to the rim Applause chesky got it back Applause Williamson jogs it up car nice job getting back to that pick and pop and challenging his shot Irish have cooled off Mike just one of their last 11 shot attempts Carr hero Epson scores yeah just I mean we had that sour look from Steve Forbes early but theyve worked themselves back in so the iris have led by 12 well get a bucket back at the other end the spacing that Notre Dame has there are all sorts of driving opportunities theres just nobody in the lane to help that time first basket for warts lead is seven Applause its three and five on the road this season two and four in conference play away from Winston Salem Williamson The Catch and Release and Hammond gobbles it up Applause Music like four is now one of eight in threepoint tries Goodwin pounds it into the floor and in before before the shot okay so the chesky was fouled on the play his team leads by seven 2013 in the first half Williamson reach an end Hildreth defending finally gets wake no basket in a crash yeah so while these teams are taking the threepoint shot they are not making an abundance of them so far 2013 is the lead for the Fighting Irish it has been as big as 12 in the first half yeah this thats that thats that subtle little word in there Tom you you know you have threepoint shooting range but you have threepoint making ring thats right see the illustration today just one of 14 combined for Forbes and Bray Brays team and right now Tyree Appleby has not scored in the game so you know all things considered weight probably fortunate theyre only down by seven at this point Appleby averages over 18 points per game lacheski was fouled on the most recent sequence but how about this they got bachevski and Zona out there I think Matt went his that was an early good rotation for him so Mike Bray said hes going to play some more today but earning his time out there Arizona has a field goal and a rebound heres Ryan and thats what hes going to do out there Cormac Ryan and boy hes just so solid in his execution but uh mad zone is going to be a screener in this offense so Marshas got to be active and vocal Cormac Ryan has scored in double digits in his last three games Marsh feed from Hildreth and thats why he shoots almost 88 from the floor thank you so Marsh you could ask it for Wake Forest you know the thing is that Marshas playing way off Zona but hes not there to help on the screens Marsh is 52 of 59 Mike shooting this season now granted its relatively close to the rim most of the time and then 42 from the free throw line scenarios a good take from the right hand and I like that for a player time you know when youre struggling in the game and uh attack the basket get a layup see the ball go through the rim feel a little bit better about yourself nine of 19 and 27 points in the loss but Duke in the most recent game for Wake for Appleby hes got the ball now right into the box score scoring wise with the bucket last time down Applause going inside of four minutes in the half Monsanto just stepping back and nailing it Applause Irish pick a timeout and its the threepoint shot thats come alive for Wake Forest Santa with a fancy dribble to escape the defender 70 run for Wake this is in its golden dome on the Notre Dame campus Monsanto hes the only player in our game Mike to make a threepointer so far and its a twopoint game Irish in front thats what hell take seven a game I mean thats where he makes his living He makes three on average 13 points per game for Wake Forest shoots 40 percent from Beyond The Arc for investing hundreds nice bounce for words Applause the graduate student from Charlotte North Carolina Providence State School a transfer from Santa Clara Music Appleby trying to lull him to sleep with the dribble Mars trying to rip it away from lacheski Arrow on the hell ball will favor Notre Dame that wasnt bad defense by Zona he got to switch Applebees eyes got really big you get that big guy out of the freethrow line you know he can take him off the dribble but hes staying look hes just bothered it enough that the Appleby overshot the mark Irish basketball shooting 37 percent as a team in the first half they are oh of seven on threepoint attempts Zone has set the screen for words for the rebound the thing I mean is when Zona sets the screen if you come off that youre going to have a good look if its a good screen nowhere to go for Hildreth Zona guarding him Hildreth around Tona its like can I guard Marsh please I really like garden centers more than guards out front Cameron Hildreth nice take sophomore from Worthing England recovered by works on the errant pass Ryan looking for the spot Marsh up for the rebound oh marshmike only played four minutes off the bench at Duke in the most recent game for Wake thats going to be situational I think with him easy board for lashesky Williamson has just really struggled over this stretch Applause last two games three points total for him one of ten shooting towards his double drop dead load of Zona and its knocked away Hills with the block from behind dont have never saw him Monsanto steps into the three ball and knocks it down for the demon defensively you have to run to the threepoint line to find him thats where Im going to rush up the floor hes going to linger and getting great looks first player in a doubledigit scoring today and his three gives Wake Forest a onepoint lead late in the first half pinpoint passing from Ryan again the great uh great spacing and even Zona outside that time is the screener and a really nice back cut Irish taking the lead right back Applause Music Notre Dame five and one on its home floor against Wake Forest in the series history inside of a minute to go on the shot clock winding down on Hildreth s to get the shot away in does as he got around Zona yeah and then normally youd see Appleby with the ball in his hands and the clock running down like that but hilgoreth did a nice job instead of rushing his shot anticipating the clock just finishing the play six points for Hildreth rosheski misses on the three the woes from Beyond The Arc continue now oh of eight for Notre Dame wake by one perhaps looking for the final shot that if you told Steve Forbes that Notre Dame would be uh oh of eight from three in the first half hed probably run a little bit bigger lead than this and at one point wake was trailing 164 final seconds intercepted Starling hit the rim on the interception and Eve Music 2726 Wick comes all the way back to 12 down Mike to take the one point lead to the locker room yeah no Panic there and uh you know a Notre Dame started off offensively really strong but slowed down some wasnt in the thing for Wake Forest in Balance scoring but nobodys really gotten the double figures yet and actually Nate lecheski a quiet afternoon for him only four points so the two primary scorers need to pick it up a little Monsanto up to 71 made threes on the season he leads the team Ryan let him scoring in the first half for Notre Dame last three games hes gotten a double digit straight away Monsanto feeling it for Wake picking pop Starling a nice job getting a hand up on that but Monsanto has got some good rhythm going 43 of the ball game after a 14point performance at Duke he was just three of 12 on threepoint tries against the Blue Devils starling Music Andrew Carr took one in the chops hes still feeling it a little bit and it looks like he got his uh what went into his nose that was a great take by Starling got the switch and used the dribble to get to the rim and then Starling and Appleby got tangled up coming up the court Applause yeah that Appleby was he was trying to he was checking things out on his own and uh just never even saw Appleby Santa stepping back over Ryan for another three and Thomas I mean the defense has been very good in those last two shots fifth time this year monsantos had five or more made threes and then number five on the drive for the Irish but you know what I I think Steve Forbes could live with uh two points at a time from Notre Dame looking for two points from Appleby he got Starling in the air much needed there an early basket to get him into some rhythm GMan mentioned just with two points in the first half for Appleby one of seven from the floor at that last basket the lead is now five for Wake Forest good win oh of nine now and threepointers for the Irish Monsanto without hesitation and he hit it its ridiculous I mean he barely touched the ball he kind of redirected it toward the rim everybody out there watching wondering what the Zone looks like in the zone looks like that his teammate Tyree Appleby was in disbelief watching that one Arc its way through the air and through the net look at Appleby is still just like shaking hes looking at him shaking his head whistling watch this I mean he barely touches it from the D Mike hes six feet behind the line which is 22 feet one and threequarter inches away so maybe 28foot neighborhood Williamson hes got a three right in front of his own bench contagious Williamson did not score in the first half talked about he had been struggling in the last four in this losing streak 198 career threes for Williamson Applebee and Hildreth collaborating on the rebound and staying inbounds Applebee sheds with Defender and heres whats happening Tom because Monsanto is doing what hes doing when hes in a screen action with Appleby Cormac Ryan has to stay with him he cant help at all and thats freeing him up for a drive Damian Williamson out of the corner graduate student from WinstonSalem North Carolina third year in the Wake program after transferring from East Tennessee State University its a little different start from the first half of the Demon Deacons it was 164 early in the first half Bush Chesney got free Goodwin song yeah I mean theyre really theyre really defending and were playing out at the threepoint line so that thats going to be there for Notre Dame six points now for the shesky Applause the crowd cant believe Monsanto missed cant believe he missed in transition Carr recovered and blocked it Steve Ford loves his defense Mildred going Euro not over the front rim bashesky got it and get past customs could not declare a basket for Wake Forest Applause see Ryan on that back door cut too Mike he was looking for it from Goodwin Applause Ryan Applause yeah they defended that lachesky screen and popped pretty well even though it was Apple Beyond him he forced the ball out of his hands that last possession nine point lead after leading by a single point at halftime for Wake Forest Geeks have come out firing especially number 30 able to save it Monsanto shot clock is late thatll be the recognition off the well now stop Mike you know its your day when something like that happens and and Applebees acting like hes hot he got bailed out by the backboard that time Geeks about scored the Irish 176 in the second half so far lacheski positioned in the height Advantage time out Mike Bray so Monsanto was firing the threes and then Appleby was he looking for the backboard give him three either way week by ten foreign shooting 67 as a team in the second half Mike its the Coyote Tractor turning point and its been number 30 who got things turned around and this team is really fed off of the zone that hes playing in Appleby with that bank shot that was with the clock running down as well but uh damari Monsanto has been fabulous 8 of 17 as a team on threepointers Monsanto is six of nine on threes his career high in a single game is seven and they are five of six on threes in the second half Monsanto a big reason why I like the way Appleby played off that three off the backboard like Hey I meant to do that Im good playing horse um how about Monsanto 20 points on 10 field goal attempts thats about as efficient as youre gonna get Applause Williamson out of the corner hes on target with a three ball now see that I mean Monsanto is one thing but for Williamson to catch fire in this second half is a huge bonus and Notre Dame is going to have to stand on the pedal here from three to keep up with the jam right now I mean theyre just trading baskets two for three that math doesnt usually work out very well in your favor to double digits now with 10 and five of nine from the club Hildreth trying to inch his way Ryan with the quick hands trying to race everybody to the rim basket and foul Power Mac Ryan Applause thats the first turnover of the second half and in order to make some pay Music the twenty dollars iconic things in this campus The Grotto is very deep spiritual place the Dome Touchdown Jesus when we saw earlier however during basketball its threepoint it is that is the Word of Life mural for Matt Ryan at the freethrow line starting to get warmer outside tuji man its up to 33 degrees when we arrived in town is about 15 maybe man I brought a top coat too I dont need you will not need that for Mac Ryan finishes off the threepoint play however our native New England is getting hit from the car today some very low temperatures Syracuse Orange are used to that sort of thing as they travel to TC tonight seven games on the schedule Marshall Applebee served it up and against the zone and Appleby can get into the paint area a really nice LOB Hammond threepointer and the first of the game for Notre Dame and he is a very capable threepoint shooter 43 on the year see if that opens things up for the Irish 240 career made threes Marcus Hammond Applause Santo close to the basket he needs to be behind the arc Ryan Trails the play lacheski gets it from Ryan best look that hes had in three this afternoon Applause Ryan and lashesky in double digits scoring for the Irish 20 points for Monsanto Williamson online but short hes got a couple of Threes in the game for Wake Applause told us prior to the game hes got a resilient group of young men although Ryan against goal for the offensive foul there but theyre going to fight to the Finish Line Mike you know what that was just great individual effort by Appleby watch this he fights over the screen gets positioned the left arm gets out that is solid mantoman defense on the ball Music the ball back to Wake Forest Cormac Ryan comes out of the game with his 11 points Music Steve Forbes team has made nine threepointers of the game right about their season average his second most per game in the ACC this year trailing only Notre Dame and they collaborate Appleby to Marsh about that unreal High field goal percentage but thats why its a big Target and hes got good hands he can go out and finish Zona tracks down the Miss from Hammond Starling reversing Direction underneath the ribbon in now with that size Marsh is not a shot blocker so you can attack inside he takes up a lot of space in the lane but Starling using the room to his Advantage Mike in the second half almost every basket of the Highlight variety between these two Marsh wide open hes going on a rim bender and its from Appleby again Applause Monsanto in uh how about seven assists for Appleby Music Appleby is second in the conference mic on average six per game as far as the Cisco hes actually across the boards hes honing it on a triple double I want to go at that too early weve seen one from Wake this season Cameron Hilder at that point yeah just the third in school history and thats Hammond see if this game had started at two it would have been a different offensive its the first half they kind of slept walk through your feeling about the early games noon and one start well documented Monsanto had it poked away whistle and foul foreign how about Matthew Marsh and Tyree Appleby what a combination for the demon Geeks in front today is protecting the paint is brought to you by CBI Security Applause see that great chase down from behind by Marcus Hammond and there have been some blocks in this game Cameron Hildreth right there Andrew Carr with the stuff invariably you get the block and you can turn those into points on the other end of the floors Matthew Marsh taking up a lot of the screen Music four blocks by awake against the Irish some weird numbers in this game Tom the wake is only taken one free throw missed that so theyve got no points from the line and Notre Dame has only one made three theres that theres Tyree Applebees flirting around with the uh with the triple double Music certainly keep an eye on his progression as the afternoon continues Monsanto Mike just mentioned in frequent trips to the freethrow line for Wake Monsanto is there Applause Music Wake Forest was 16 of 17 in the loss to Duke fight for the freeformal that was just a twopoint loss 7573 on Tuesday in Durham something else going on in Durham later on too I think later today on the schedule is going to empty Music attempts the tents will be empty around 6 30 maybe earlier North Carolina and Duke renewing the Rivalry of course they played at the end of the season last year near the Daviss team beat him in his first years head coach then they went to the final four yeah they well they they spoiled Mikes final home game with the win there and then in the semifinals of the Final Four good short jumper Goodwin Applause Music quick Clinton is in there 34 is black and gold got it back he wants a three hes got it as he expands his range hes going to become more and more dangerous and so many times you see a guy doubled at the threepoint line but thats what happened with Monsanto and thats why Clinton got the good look first the three for Clinton and now 10 made threes on 20 tries by Wake Forest even I can figure out that math Mike 50 percent hit that hit that thats how open he was a chance to look down make sure his feet were behind the arc just a second made three of the game with a fighting Irish they had nobody in double figures in the first half now theyve got three guys there they did not make a three in the first 20 minutes Monsanto wide of the intended target Clinton tried to save it Hammond La preserving The Possession to Goodwin he came up short two decent looks at the three Applause ninepoint wake lead Applebee on the drive foul was on the floor by Hammond Music second on Hammond if you want to stay tuned for the fast break its presented by your local Ford dealer and we actually will break down a couple of games coming up on the schedule today Miami and Clemson a couple of ranked teams and North Carolina and Duke to finish off the seven game schedule on this Saturday first of two meetings of course between the rivals GMan a big part of that rivalry late 70s unbelievable honor to be able to play in that game its its its hard to describe how different it is from from every other game that you play and you know for for the freshman at Duke this year its going to be a first then that first Duke Carolina game is is not easy to get used to Wake Forest was looking for a sweep of Duke this season Mike they had beaten him earlier in the year but then lost on Tuesday warrants able to Corral it really streaky game so far Monsanto has cooled off now from behind the arc Notre Dame playing better offensively words was trying to drive and the second foul on Williamson Music Applause Trey Wirtz who just inbounded the basketball back in the 21 ACC tournament a three at the buzzer in the first round to beat this Wake Forest program and then he grabs the loose ball and finds luccheski tees up a three the last couple of times the Notre Dames gotten good looks from scatters you know with a turnover that time the defense isnt set and uh you give lecheski that much time hes going to knock those down 16 points lacheski the leading scorer for the Irish yet four in the first half Applause Appleby got to the basket and got fouled with just over eight minutes to go in our second half take time right now time to remember Billy Packer passing away and you know its just great I have great remembrance of him having uh had he called my games at Duke and then become uh you know working with him in the ACC just an icon in the sport Applause yeah last Thursday Julie Packer passing away at 82 years with h I forget how great a player thats 1962 thats a great and Wake Forest basketball in the early part of the 60s twice he was on an ACC Championship team on the team that went to the final four in 1962 and 35 straight years broadcasting the NCAA tournament I dont know well ever see that again and uh how about this and he goes to bro he can broadcast in the ACC with his coach bones McKinney we extend our very best to the Packer Family and the way towards basketball fans knocked around underneath Appleby trying to do it himself finds Hildreth stumbles on the Baseline got it to Williamson Marsh ran it down to the corner Starling almost had the turnover and he stepped out of bounds seven and a half minutes to go in regulation with Wake Forest in front of Notre Dame foreign for the fast break presented by your local Ford dealer it is a big day in the ACC highlighted by a couple of matchups we want to show you right now and first Mike well look at a couple of ranked teams in Miami and Clemson which is undefeated at home this season and its not too early to start looking at the top four seeds in the conference Tom and a double Buy in the ACC tournament and like you said Clemson has been very tough as good a defensive team as there is in the country Miami brings in that good offense of course Hunter Tyson at the home but I think wild card for Clemson may be PJ Hall when he has a big game life is a lot easier for him Jordan Miller and then Tyson may be a great matchup yeah the tigers are 102 in conference playing at the top of the standings Miami is 84 in ACC play and then it is the Rivalry renewed North Carolina and Duke GMan yeah it really couldnt be any closer than it is and this should be terrific both teams sitting there at seven and four they both want to keep uh keep close to that top group so this has a lot of implications for it as far as standings and of course you know they could be 010 both of them and itd be a fabulous game and they did meet in the final four last year the Rivalry goals look around the league here in the ACC how about that first result Mike number six Virginia goes down in Blacksburg big win for Mike young and his group theyre healthy theyve got everybody back theyre going to be a dangerous team down the stretch theyve got their backcourt attack he scores 74 or four points against Virginia youve had a good game a top scoring defense on all the ACC Justin mutts had 17 to Lead the Way Louisville Florida State as the cards try to string together wins after their midweek win against Georgia Tech later on Syracuse Boston College Georgia Tech and NC State is close and then the two games that we preview coming up later today you know theyve ever recite about Clemson and Pitt as they should but NC State is is right there at the top of that double by that was Appleby on the jumper Applause Ryan was challenged by Hildreth the arrow will favor the Irish Applause very nice defense cars just going straight up that time challenging the shot Applause eight points for Hildreth in the game Monsanto leads the way hes got 22 Les schewski hit the deck Goodwin grabbed it on the weak side ball did not hit the rim Music Applause foreign Applause Hildreth bailed him out that time there was two seconds left on the shot clock and milcheski was dribbling left was going to have a difficult time just getting the ball up on the rim and he bailed him out of the foul Applause Irish trying to stay within Striking Distance getting late in this one drilled by a point at halftime go by 13 now Starling on the time you got a backcourt out there with Williamson and Apple tall and its 65 Starling its got that ability look at the burst of speed to go up go left and finish right Music so Starling at the freethrow line cant finish it off Music Applause Applebee recovered fired into the corner Williamson Hildreth driving on Goodwin stayed with the play and knocked it out of bounds really nice rotation defensively by Notre Dame the closeout on Shooters theyve closed down the threepoint shot to get the block inside six seconds on the shot clock theres a little good one now its a couple of blocks in this game Music Applause shot clock all the way down for Hildreth ball did not hit the rim that the shot clock violation against Wake Forest I dont know that he was aware of the shot clock at that point he was a little casual when he first caught the ball and then realized how much how little time he had wake had its largest lead of the game just a moment ago at 6552 of 13 points warts pass was deflected by car and then it hit the shot clock so the Irish maintained possession good hands defensively I think a bounce pass would have gotten through to lashesky that time Applause Music 16 points for luccheski and add to the total Applause three of 18 on threepointers for Notre Dame car with the feed from Hildreth easy to well you know both Carr and especially Marsh have really profited from that pick and roll and getting right to the front of the rim four points for Carr had a buzzer beating jumper against App State earlier this season Clinton ended up with the ball lacheski was in the front row heres the look you see that just kind of slipped the screen lachesky really showing out on the help and nobody on the weak side sixth foul for Wake so one more in Notre Dame shooting in the bonus for the rest of the game both teams with 16 fouls makes in the game this season for the Irish was two against Saint Bonaventure and now they still have three makes after the shesky misfires hes getting some decent looks too Apple will be wasting no time trying to get around Ryan and spin it off the backboard Applause you know when hes running downhill its just virtually impossible to keep him in front heres the look I mean you know it does a nice job hitting the brakes and then hes hes pretty crafty about getting a shot up on the rim how about the players that Steve Forbes has been able to mine from the transfer portal including Appleby at the free throw line for a moment now lets get a message from Coyote Tractor my experience if you work the land you got to be a jack of all trades you got to have a little bit of optimism a whole lot of getgo Applause so you get alondus Williams in the portal and Appleby youre youre doing some pretty good work there Applebee is four for four from the line hes gone to the line 152 times this season Mike second best of the conference almost got it away from Ryan and then committed the foul how about Appleby today Mike 13 points seven boards and seven assists and Tom in the last in the last five games hes missed a total of four minutes of play hes not in the picture right now hes over chatting with Steve Forbes Cormac Ryan at the free throw line Applause Tyree Appleby a couple of Seasons at Florida also played two years at Cleveland State first year in the Wake program and this is how Notre Dame has got to get back in this game theyve got to make it a little ugly weve got to convert on free throws but get to the line try to slow things down a little bit you know Appleby Mike with his scoring average this season 181 first among major conference players six feet or shorter Music reason why lake has a chance to snack a fourgame losing streak this season Monsanto not basketball at all thats bad news for Notre Dame good defense again but nothing has faced to Mari Monsanto in this game today seven threes in a game ties a career high hes also tied his career highend points with 25 today Monsanto and this ones slipping away from the Irish and uh you know and just right now and Steve Forbes putting up the stop sign on third base rounding wants his team to run some clock now with this possession Hildreth pushed off fourth on Hildreth so it inside of four minutes to go the Irish getting the ball back so lets check out our zMAX Max performance and its damari Monsanto from Wake Forest yeah Im seven of eleven from three and he was the one who got this team going offensively Tom in their first half they were really struggling to score he started knocking down threes and then just got into an insane Zone 7 of 11 from deep and theyve the some of them been deep the seven threes made also ties a career high for a single game on Center and how about um Mr Appleby 14 points eight rebounds seven assists strong stat line there trying to match his teammate Cameron Hildreth who has a triple double this season through the fourth in Wake Forest history if it happens Tim Duncan alondus Williams last year Cameron Hildreth this year thats quite a sentence to belonging foreign assist Music Applause Gilbert did it with points rebounds and assists Clinton trying to save it on the Baseline and that appears to be Irish basketball they got to do something in a hurry Mike three and change to go I just you know theyre theyre not going to win many games scored 57 points and uh you know its its really where the threepoint shot in Steve Forbes you know theyve defended that line pretty well Irish average almost 71 points per game 10th in the ACC ENT thats as effective as youre going to be if you can defend without fouling against Notre Dame and driving them off the threepoint line Notre Dame had stopped a fourgame losing streak of its own Mike with the win last Saturday against Louisville prior to that they defeated Georgia Tech on this floor at home midJanuary well and bright you know and we talked about the top of the conference you know wake wants to get on a little bit of a streak here they want to avoid Tuesday at the front end theyre theyre tied with Syracuse at six and six right in the middle but those bottom six teams have a long long road Skis at the freethrow line here is the upcoming schedule brought to you by Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina demon Deeks against North Carolina Tuesday at seven and thats in WinstonSalem they lost it North Carolina this season early January 8879 Music foreign offense here running clock Hammond grabbed the Jersey a little bit there by Appleby who is streaking through the lane third Music thats what happens if youre just really active and moving without the basketball you get those type of fouls and that happens tough enough with the basketball when hes moving without it like that he draws those types of grabs last victory here for Wake Forest was midFebruary of 2019 Music if the score holds it would be Steve Forbes first win on the road here at Notre Dame is the Wake Forest head coach Applebees all smiles and for good reason Music its coming off a 27point performance in Durham against Duke game high 27 Applause Applebee today Mike 14 points that is now 15 straight games of double digits Tyree Appleby hes the Forbes he talked to us about it you know its you go through three twopoint losses like that it was different things in each of those games that that caused that but still it doesnt make up for the lack of sleep that you have after those nights what did he say to us prior to the game Id rather lose by 10 15 then two and one and a close game this one might not be a close final score Irish losing it Clinton to the floor Ryan got it back bounced it to lashesky words for three Appleby has it he found Carr Applause Music foul for Notre Dame free throw line Andrew Carr the Junior from Westchester Pennsylvania you know I looked at it before the game and we touched on who was in our open with uh with JJ Starling coming off for two really good games I thought he was in a really good Rhythm but and especially playing against a smaller backcourt but has just not been able to get anything going this afternoon its only taken but hes you know hes been more aggressive hes almost got eight field goal attempts in the game the Deeks had a fourgame winning streak prior to the four game losing streak which appears to be ending they were rolling they were six and two and sailing right along right now six and six in conference Play Good win theres a little bit of life three from the corner certainly seen crazier things Mike on an ACC Court when Applause Laughter Ill get the staff on that anybody should change the channel right now by any means okay Notre Dames got the ball back Applause good win Monsanto poked it away and then grabbed it so Appleby will slowly bring it up foreign thats pretty much the day right there for Wake Forest yeah and you know I weve seen some pretty good play by The Freshman uh Wake Forest fans should be really high on Bobby Clinton and his future knocked out of bounds wakemade nine threes Mike in the game against Duke losing effort today they are 13 of 29 on threepointers and that was about in 30 minutes of action because the first 10 of this game they were not involved at all foreign started making his threes and he was really the only guy in the first half to effectively shoot the three and Ive always contended to that that type of shooting is contagious you know when people see that you know they just feel a little bit better about the ball going in the basket seven threes for Monsanto and then two from Applebee Williamson Applause Zona gets the follow on the Drive Clinton also has a couple of threes Alex wade into the game for Notre Dame oh goodness Monsanto again High degree of difficulty new career high with 28 also for made threes in the game hes now got a eight of 13 one of two from being inside the ark what an afternoon for tamari Monsanto as that one spins out Irish got it back a foul on the play Sanders fighting underneath Music just a onepoint game at Halftime you and I well actually youre going to be up here and see some more action Im going to stick around following the womens game tomorrow Duke and Notre Dame Ill tell you you know were talking about that Duke North Carolina matchup tonight Dukes got to turn around on Monday and go down to Coral Gables and play Miami that is a stout back to back because Ill tell you that that game tonight is like playing a game and a half 23rd season will be his last that Notre Dame for Mike Bray maybe not a win today but he does have the most wins in school history Im very fortunate to call him a friend hes been wonderful me through all my stuff and uh met him when he was on Mike krzyszewskys staff hes a great great gentleman Applause Georgia Tech for Notre Dame lake has North Carolina on the schedule and wins this one 8164 what a second half performance by wake yeah and uh and really you know the performance by damari Monsanto is one of the best shooting exhibitions Ive seen in a long time especially
