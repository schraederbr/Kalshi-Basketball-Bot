Music Applause Red Wolves control the tap they made the MAC Championship game last year as the 11 seed in their conference tournament finished last in the regular season went on a historic run to make their first championship game appearance in program history knifing down the left side of the lane the Lefty lay in is through and Marist is on the board well thats what John done does with for the red foxes you know he makes sure they share the ball they really space the floor and they have a lot of continuity in their offense and theyre going to get good shots theyre going to be very patient on in the half court dri had the basket for Notre Dame Kei starting his second consecutive game guard Julian roer the second is out with a foot injury tonight and the Lefty shot is through for the afor mention ji Jai does a good job of carving out space down there in the low box and hes got good footwork nice drop step into the lane usual cast of characters for the red wolves Max Allen is their big post player who does a lot of really good things including passing from the low block shock clock into single digits as Collins Rises and connects another good halfcourt set you know Michael Shrewsberry told us earlier today James theres not going to be a lot of possessions in this game both teams like to run their stuff use the clock and wait for the good opportunity Notre Dame they hoist their first three its in and out and a foul head coach of the red foxes John Dunn in his sixth season 65 and 89 in his 18th year overall he was the head coach at St Peters for 12 Seasons hes won eight games in the ma tournament as a lower seed more than any other coach in program history well John dun longtime coach at St Peters and then took the Maris job in conference and hes done a really good job as we mentioned they got to the MAC Championship a year ago and theyve had to retool their team a little bit but hes done it the right way I I I like some of the pieces hes put together especially the Freshman Got Back quarter Collins and pascarell Booth connects on both free throws one thing that stood out to me Tim about this Maris team is just how balanced they are they feature eight players that average over six points per game yeah theyre deep theyre very deep hes going to use his bench and thats what he said to us earlier is that everyones bought in they dont care about the minutes everybodys getting a little chance but theres a lot of balance in it that mean everyone knows their RS every piece has fit together very well for Mar Applause first a three off the front rim rebound for Applause Marist Notre Dame has started 0 for two from downtown they ranked 343rd out of 351 Division 1 teams as Barris big man Max Allen steps out and hits his second three of the Year Max Allen thats not normally what he does but hes got good skill on the perimeter very good passer that time found himself open and took Applause advantage looking for a cutter banging with Allen three ball from Burtons wide left rebound kept the live by keski seems a little bit more energized tonight after the Citadel game and Michael shwar not happy with their energy or effort the entire second half Max Allen headed to the line theres Notre name head coach michah Shrewsberry in his first season 4 and seven spent the last two years as the head coach at Penn State put together some historic numbers for the NY Lions especially defensively hes from the Brad Stevens coaching tree was an assistant at Butler for those two national championship game appearances what do you like about the the way that Micah coaches and the teams hes had over the years well I really liked what he did at Penn State he kind of built it and he every coach James talks about establishing a culture but he really means it and I think he he brings that to the table its going to take a while for that to build here at Notre Dame especially your first year sometimes you got to take some chances in the portal you got some young players out there and trying to get your message across I like what he did the other night after the cadel game I mean he went out and you know you you rip your team youre upset you take blame yourself and then you you turn you flip the page your team gets the message you cant continue it too long and I dont think he has I think he felt feels very good about where they are coming into this game tonight after what happened earlier this week Allen splits the pair and he said that you know thats a game that well remember 5 to 10 years from now looking back on and saying okay that was Rock Bottom thats where we figured it out and started to turn the corner well thats spin move in the lane go ahead do it overnight at at Penn State uh he was lucky he said he had a couple guys that were passionate when he got there he had John hair and then he brought in some transfers and it all kind of fit together but he established that program and built it into a very very good team in the Big 10 Applause the two freshman guards for the red foxes playing keep away in back court deep in the timer pascarelli pull up and he buries it thats what John dun said about pascarelli that just noticed him in high school kind of played that three played the three man in high school but he was make shots he off the dribble and can do things at the end of the clock that are special on his own Bert in the lane throws it up with the right and gets it Applause down that last Notre Dame basket ended over a threeminute drought for the Fighting Irish shot clock already at 10 for Marist Collins nice find the cutter right down the middle Trace sultan with an easy one well thats what Maris does pretty well as they look for the open man and theyve highly theyre highly skilled in a lot of areas so they have a very very good passing team already the fifth different Red Fox to score Burton deep in the clock Rising Fire its good we talked about Marcus Burton in the open thats what he does he gets where he wants to go to off the bouns and can create for himself very confident Music Applause Music guard Collins with 10 to shoot hoist to three barely nicked the front rim offensive rebound Applause Marist and a steel Burton ahead of the pack shot bothered out of bounds and it goes back to Marist 12 to8 at our first media timeout coming up next Micah Shrewsberry challenges the Irish on Tuesday day but Tim he said he got his guys together the next morning to reconnect with his team yeah I mean thats what you have to do sometimes you know especially early in your tenure you got to let let the guys know thats unacceptable them to not come out and play hard you can miss all the shots in the world and not take good shots some nights have poor decisions but if you dont play hard thats what really gets to a coach and thats what Miker was trying to you know communicate to his team youve got to just play hard and tough and I think he got the message to them I mean were in for a battle tonight though Maris is a good basketball Music team Isaiah Brickner on the handle shot clock into single digits terrific passer from the top Harris knifing shooting wide right off the mark saved and itll stay on this end Tim what do you like about this start for the red foxes well the red foxes H have an identity Johns duns Team all teams always have an identity uh at times theyve struggled to score over the years but this year they average 68 points a game theyve got a lot of skilled players but one thing they can always hang their hat on his hardnosed mantoman Music defense theyve held six of their nine opponents below 60 points this season and theyre six and0 in those games an air Bank on a three from Javon kulie this is a bit of a homecoming game for him hes from Chicago one thing Maris does defensively as their scheme is they dont give a lot of help they John dun puts it on each player you guard your yard and were not going to help off threepoint Shooters and you see that there they stay home on the outside and help on the inside Burton called for a travel third Notre Dame turnover most certainly Notre Dame missed Julian roer in the Citadel game and you can see tonight they theyre putting a lot on Burtons play plate without rer out there with him and someone else has to step up besides Burton what you think about Coach Shrewsberry telling us that you know theyve put a lot on Marcus Burtons plate not just you know this one here tonight but all season long yeah they dont really have choice you know you grow up quickly when you know youre the only point guard out on the floor the only thing you know the thing with Burton is a freshman handling the ball as much as he does you see is hes got more turnovers than assists so thats thats a little bit glaring but the other thing thats glaring is that piece of the floor right there thats the second time someone slipped right at the top of the key burton all alone for a three and he splashes at home good ball movement he kind of changed sides of the floor used the used the dribble to get into the gaps and Burton found himself open Burton has the last seven points for Notre Dame thats his 10th three of the Applause Year Marist has missed their last four shots price lost it on the way up out of bounds itll stay on this end with six to Music shoot not Dame certainly not one of the best threepoint shooting teams in the country theyre at the bottom but right there back in 1988 but Miami wasnt independent at that time as you look at the resume of John Dunn in his sixth year and what hes trying to build with the red foxes well when Tim Murray the athletic director at Maris hired John Dunn everybody around basketball in the Northeast said that thats a home run John dun was highly respected when he was at St Peters and hes done a tremendous job with Maris shot clock at six on the inbound Allen spinning in the lane throws it up left it short and a shot clock violation forced by Notre Dame well this is Notre Dames defense has been pretty good tonight theyre not letting Maris have anything easy and this is guarding your yard again just good defense High hands not biting on that fake and gai holding his own down low Notre Dame trying to avoid their fourth straight loss and their second in a row to a non power five School its close early on here in this first half trying to hook it inside a hold and a foul called on Max Music Allen now Max Allen has been a nice pickup for Maris but there he gets caught that little hole down low both coaches told us they expect a low possession ession game tonight this one will be played in the half court J doesnt get the bounce into the hands of Boo and Carrie Booth will head to the line the Freshman from Englewood Colorado whos the son of Calvin boo who is the 1998 Big 10 defensive player of the year at Penn State and the current general manager of the Denver Nuggets well when youre kind of lack some Firepower on the offensive end guys that can really go make a play or youre not a really good threepoint shooting team youve got to create offense other ways not only with your defense but hitting the offensive glass is so important and thats where youre going to get some open threes as well that time boo did a good job of sliding into traffic knocks the score at 12 Midway through this first half Notre Dames on a mini 60 run its been over the last three and A2 minutes Marist has missed their last five shots offensive Applause rebound Booth leaner Applause no Marist hasnt scored in over four minutes Tim whats working for Notre Dame on this end well theyre very connected on defense and I that was one thing Michael Shrewsberry said you know we had to be connected on both ends of the floor you can see High hands theyre theyre moving as one five as one theyre putting a lot of pressure on the not only on shots but on on the basketball and on passes and Maris is having trouble finding angles to the rim Booth had it Deni out of bounds itll stay on this end good crossover dribble covered by Marist who got a keep that protect the ball with his body Notre Dame has scored the last six pullup is short from Shrewsberry its the coachs son Braden Shrewsberry a freshman one of many freshman on this Notre Dame Team Notre Dame returned just 16 of their scoring from last season which ranks fourth lowest in the Applause nation a bump and a foul called on Notre Dame hey next Friday December 29th over on ACCC Network theyll have a mens basketball double header highlighted by the Tar Heels Miami host North Florida at 6 Eastern then the 11th ranked heels host Charleston Southern to cap off the 2023 schedule cant wait to see what 2024 has in store for us a couple of big wins for this conference which well touch on later on with North Carolina taking down Oklahoma Duke took down Baylor as the ACC goes 2 and0 against the Big 12 in those matchups well the Big 12 has been talked about as the premier conference in the country so far this year and the accs had some ups and downs but certainly that was a big time night for the ACC earlier this Applause week both free throws pop out and Marist hasnt scored in over five minutes of action Applause loose ball picked up by a red wolf red fox I should say rather Marist started the game five for six from the field since then they are 0 for six deep in the lane throwing it up in Jaden doy whos known for his defense finally ends the drought good move by do Tre and Notre Dames defense has been extra aggressive tonight that time doy found an angle in the lane driving kick Burton Baseline Up and Under didnt get the whistle Marist has numbers five on Applause four a little bit over penetrating in the lane nowhere to go Collins absorbing contact and hes musling it through Jaden Collins is a goodlooking freshman for John Dunn he runs the team but he can find a way to the rim hes got quick hands and quick feet coach called him a trueborn playmaker they recruited this kid for over two years really wanted him Music driving kick boo lines up for three and he cans it Bo got a nice stroke hes doing a good job tonight getting open alleys in the lane that time a little step back from the Applause outside its been the two freshman for Notre Dame leading the way Burton and boo if combined for 13 of their 15 Applause points deep three from pass gelli goph for Applause out Notre Dame looking for their first lead of the night on this end a whistle and an offensive foul called on the Fighting Irish well Marist has a s2 record because theyve got a youth movement a freshman back cour dri is a goodlooking sophomore and he struggled a little bit offensively but starting to open things up a little bit off the bouns the ball dont overh help off the ball everybody to the glass no wasted possessions and dont let anybody attack the rim cover the line and cover the rim thats what John dunen Applause do Marist has forced five Notre Dame turnovers theyve also held Notre Dame to 36 shooting in this first half heres a look at their season numbers top 10 in the country in scoring Defense 3 third in the nation and field goal percentage defense tops in the mac and theyre top 20 in guarding the arc also leading their conference thats why theyre in every game and we talked about it over in the past some of the Maris teams that Johns had has struggled offensively but I think this team is is better offensively because they have better skill people they necessarily shoot the ball great but they do pass it very well Allen couldnt connect Notre Dame has never LED in this first half Burton trying to turn the corner drive and kick an open three from Zona and the Fighting Irish are on top for the first time well thats what Michael Shrewsberry needs he needs Matt Sona to step up you know not necessarily as a scorer but hes a veteran player theres so many young players around him Sona can help in a lot of different ways just with his experience Burt with the steel Baseline Drive nice feed in traffic Davis is in trouble Burton pulls up that is so smooth for Marcus Burton well you could get that shot against the Mays defense because as we said earlier theyre going to choke the basketball on the threepoint line and theyre not going to get a lot of help until you get to the rim so if you can get by your man with a little space on the wing after ball reversal theyll give you that midrange shot but if you over penetrate get to the rim theres going to be two and maybe three Defenders attacking the ball Notre Dames on an 80 run and a 144 extended burst they lead by four Allen got tripped up and a whistle and a foul called on Notre Dame Music fouls on Matt Zona thats his first and the fourth team foul called on Notre Dame well we have a little gift for you starting Christmas morning celebrate the Day in the holiday season with the ACC mascots it all starts at 600 am bright and early 600 am eastern and runs every hour through 400 just our way saying thank you to you our viewers good way to start out Christmas before we get into the NBA action right Little mascot action my kids will love that got those kids entertained for hours the dunk is blocked at The Rim boy coach Notre Dame has really ratcheted up the defensive intensity I like Zona what hes doing out there hes battling Allen and hes theyre banging each other that time good week side recovery and and resistance at The Rim Z is a stretch four capable of knocking down threes he already has one in this game he hit three threes in the ACC tournament against Virginia Tech last season tough Fall Away From The Freshman Applause pascarelli message delivered by Michael Shrewsberry his team is playing with a lot more intensity tonight than they did earlier this week against Citadel Burton thats his spot but he left it short another long scoring drought for the red foxes over three minutes this time Allen yes well thats what John dun said earlier Max Allen has been a terrific pickup for them the transfer from San Jose State he can step out and do that and hes very skilled at passing the ball as well Mar coaches said once he entered the portal they called him for 25 straight days trying to get him to become a red fox transfer from San Jose State who was under the radar because he had an injury last year and only played in Eight Games corner to three Logan Imes no thank God the NCA changed the old rule of one phone call a week one of the most one of the many ridiculous rules that they fixed over the years burton all alone and the freshman in double figures with Applause 11 32 timeout Notre Dame picking up the pace they lead it 22 18 well its been hard noos Notre Dame defense T in bunches he went off for 29 Points in the season opener setting a record for points by a freshman in their debut and hes tops among ACCC freshman with 15 1 half points per game hes got 11 of the 22 for Notre Dame tonight well Michael Shrewsberry is a little rest here before the under four timeout and rightfully so he has played very hard on both ends Marist has gone ice cold on offense a three from price is off the Applause heel long one from Shrewsberry Applause no probably a little bit of a force quick shot by Bren Shrewsberry on that possession points have come out a premium tonight for meist Jackson price Scoops it home to trim it to two its a nice drive by Price hes a high percentage shot guy finding that angle to the rim transfer from The Citadel who came in here on Tuesday and beat Notre Dame by 20 price is coming off a career high he had 19 the last time out for meist against Maryland Eastern Shore Davis turning the corner stopping pop offensive rebound and then a foul on meist reaching in sends us to the under four timeout its a dog fight here in South Bend its a twopoint lead for Notre Dame he does and at the beginning of this game I think he had to get adjusted to the through the Maris defense hes over penetrated a couple times where he tried to twist and turn right around the rim and throw up some shots where he really didnt have an angle and now hes found that little niche not only on that midrange game but defensively has been terrific on the ball leads all ACC freshman in scoring at 15 and a half tonight he already has 11 and hes joined by some impressive company including Carlton Carrington over at pit who averages is just under Music 14 Notre Dame by two theyve trailed most of this first half but Marist has gone ice cold deep in the shot clock Burt oneonone step back three blocked its a Flutter Shot and meist with a lead pass to Brickner and hes fouled on the way up this will put him at the line 42 well this is good defense turned into easy offense at the other end and waited too too long in the clock and youre trying to make a desperation step back three against Maris they are not going to allow that that time BR Brickner just with that length bothered Applause Burton first free throw pops out hey Thursday bull Mania roll s on right here on acc network with command center broadcasts of the Bad Boy Mowers pinstrip bull at Yankee Stadium between Miami and ruter at 215 Eastern then the poptarts bull at 545 Eastern with NC State soring off against the Kansas State Wildcats theyll get multiple game angles with realtime player and team stats throughout both games check it out Thursday Peters excuse P Maris is doing a really good job of pressuring the basketball that time they denied they denied that pass back out to the top and where n Dame has to dribble drive into the gaps 30 second Timeout on the floor uh I dont know Jake from State Farm but just imagine my homes and my auto best BND in the league baby man why cant Patrick change his name it could be Kelsey and K see how much you can save by bundling home and auto yeah if you make the letter smaller Home Auto lets go come on model lets get it put your jersey on bundling just another way to save with a personal price plan like a good neighbor State Farm Maris guard Noah Harris had a steal that led to the break for the red foxes oh Maris has struggled offensively but both teams have done a really good job defensively now Maris seems to be picking up the pressure one thing you cant do against Maris is throw loose soft bounce passes on the perimeter Harris has a smaller role this season for the red foxes he started every game last year hes coming off the bench here in 2324 but coach Dunn said hes been even more productive with his minutes than he was last year jumper rolls across the rim wont go for keski whos still scoreless tonight in fact that was his first field goal attempt one thing about him hes usually in the mix scoring wise but up in his chest on the catch Notre Dame keeps possession its a lowscoring grinder here in South Bend Applause Burton had the hot hand for the Fighting Irish hes in trouble hes got the big Allen on him hook pass knocked away and a whistle and a foul called its on Maris with four to shoot Notre Dame was fortune on that position they tried to force it into the post and there was no angle and Maris had three defenders in the lane and got called for the reach in Notre Dames missed their last four shots they havent scored in 212 kzne needs some help deep in the shot clock three ball off the back rim from Davis Marist wants to run Collins Euro Step scoop er down low a whistle and a foul and this will put doy at the line for Marist a good job by Maris on the defensive end again not giving Notre Dame anything easy and at the end of the clock a force contested three turned it into R into a run out seven players have scored for Marist in this first half Dria sophomore from Fresh Meadows New York combo Wing player who was the third leading offensive rebounder on this team a season ago and he leads merest blocks and dunks this Applause year all tied at 20 two Marist goes on top and keep in mind theyre six and0 in games this season when theyve held their opponents below 60 points with two minutes left in this first half Notre Dame stuck at 22 nor needs a little bit more ball movement and player movement because the ball gets stuck on one side of the floor Maris will usually suffocated Zona has it blocked off the glass outside to shrew Berry for a three no and there are three red jerseys in the neighborhood for the rebound standing around on the perimeter and thats not a good recipe for Success against this Maris defense and now Maris needs to move the ball as well because s defense has been solid inside of 90 seconds left of this first half pero weding Allen gets position with the drop step thats big time footwork and power around the rim and then ended it with nice finesse with the left Marist leads by three with just over a minute to go before Applause intermission Burton downhill Davis slicing in and he puts it in off the glass thats a good move by Tay Davis thats what he needs to do use that length to get into the lane coach Shrewsberry said he has potential to be great for this Notre Dame team he was really just an offensive rebounder while he was at se Hall but they need him to be a little more productive as a Applause score down to a half minute left in this first half marised by one britner deep in the lane misses off the side of the rim and the rebound Notre Dame good help recovery by ND on the backside with their defense and their defense weve praised a lot weve said a lot about Maris but Notre Dames defense has been outstanding as well final 10 seconds of this first half well be sending it back to the studio with Justin Walters and Seth Greenberg standing Applause by Burton trying to give Notre Dame the lead at the break he had it stripped out of bounds Maris of the intensity that your team played with on the defensive end of the floor they they really worked the ball pretty good against mariss defense but they just mariss defense so stingy going to have to create some offense with your defense Burton gives it Up Notre Dame with the ball to start this second Music half Burton Crossing lost his footing and a whistle and a foul called on Applause Marist make sure you take take your opportunities but you got to move youve got to move the defense if you try to go right away against Maris defense theyre going to eat you up but if you can move them men a little bit and take away some of that help side you will have opportunities in the with the midrange game haris leads it 25 to 24 start of the second half Burton a long way from the coup pulls up from 12 and hes got 13 points to lead not Dame well thats what we we spoke about youre going to be able to get that midrange shot and thats what Burton game is hes very good in the midrange an injured player and that is Max Allen the big for Maris who led them with eight points in the first half its not a good sign as he hopples off hes their top scorer on the season at over 12 per game as we take another look hes been big factor on the inside for them very good player all season long no aame shorthanded tonight without Julian roer for the second game in a row and a whistle and a Ticky tack foul called out near midcourt Burton with a hand in the passing Lane theres a look at roer who averages nine points per game hes a playmaker for the Fighting Irish theyll be excited to have the transfer from Northwestern back well we talked about it earlier in in the open that that was a big loss for them in that Citadel game CU he is a guy that can go get his own shot crosscourt skipped to kulie gets downhill big steps but a Miss offensive rebound and the put backs no good good job by Notre Dame presenting resistance at the rim and another whistle on this end and a foul this time on Jaden doy the second foul already here in the first minute change for Marist Music very good look play for Max Allen he hobbled off getting looked at on the sideline Burton pulls too strong Notre Dame with their eighth offensive Applause rebound Applause deep in the shot clock Burton gives it up a three is goodone from kesn its his 12th of the year kesn we talked about it earlier hes usually is into a good Rhythm offensively 10 points per game they need him to Step Applause Up Notre Dame pushes their lead to four Collins TOS it on his hip and the pass fired over the head out on the perimeter a turnover just the fifth of the night for meist Notre AES got really good body language right now they seem to be locked in on the defensive end the bench is up and uh theyve put that Citadel lost behind them tonight because theyve had good energy from the tip Applause Davis leaning Applause in Baris big man Max Allen left the bench he has returned well get an update on him momentarily he are leading score on the season in tonight went down with an injury just moments ago Collins coie three on Music target Timeout on the floor marris needed they needed to drive dribble drive into the Gap draw that extra Defender and the kick out to kie with the step back Duke and Baylor a big win for the Blue Devils 78 70 freshman Jared McCain finished with 21 points a game high and in the other game North Carolina they give Oklahoma from the Big 12 their first loss of the Season RJ Davis with 23 points an impressive win out in Charlotte for the tar Hills they win it by 12 8169 some upcoming games on the ACC Network tomorrow Detroit Mercy takes on NC State at one Eastern its the last game before Christmas and well return on Wednesday Virginia and Morgan State Miami and North Carolina in action next Thursday at 6 and 8 Eastern on acc Network yes Ryan young was huge for Duke Kyle phow was in foul trouble and stepped up big just across the river from his home in New Jersey at MSG and how is RJ Davis not on any of the all League teams in the preseason the accs led the heels scoring seven straight games well coach you told me a couple of weeks ago when we had the Clemson pit game not to panic if youre Duke that they would be back and that was a statement win well there theyre still not whole got had some injuries uh but theyve played a really hard schedule I think its its showing now its starting its helped them in their development Marcus Burton hes developing before our eyes The Freshman from Indiana up to 15 points both of those free throws hes sixth in the country among freshman in scoring at 15 and a half per night as right around his average and his team leads by three tall fallway from Collinss Applause bother Burton probing Burt three is cash and hes up to 18 points they backed away from Burton for some reason they dared him to shoot hes only 21 in the season from three but hes feeling it tonight thats his second three tonight hes been so effective off the bounce and hes not a great threepoint shooter so they did back away and say going to take away the drive and he made him pay Marist on this end without their top scorer Max Allen who tweaked a knee a couple of possessions ago hes been out for the red foxes Notre Dame has pushed their lead to six their largest of the night like a foul on that last threepointer Burtons three is a brick and its run down by Price next dead ball will send us to a media timeout turning the corner pascarelli basket would have counted hell be at the line when we come Music back Marcus Burton has done just about everything tonight and add this to his repar nice little step Music back Pavilion at the under 16 to start this second half Notre Dame leads by six big story developing for meris their starting center Max Allen did this just a couple of trips ago he went to the locker room and uh HBL off didnt look good at all but there are certainly needs him back in the lineup because gives them something they dont really have just a big body inside he can step out and make shots High basketball IQ on the offensive end hell give it a go after tweaking that knee eight points tonight on three for six shooting lets the game come to him as coach told us as pascarelli hits the first free throw he had a game earlier this season on November 21st he had 28 points against New Hampshire and the next game barely took any shots totally got his teammates involved and racked up a ton of assists thats what John dun said about him hes just a selfless player he does what he needs to do to help them win games and tonight hes back in after getting banged up pretty good Notre Dame was on a 10 to3 run with him on the bench Imes against the Freshman pascarelli nice wrap around feed and Shrewsberry will head to the line to shoot a pair you see Im is highly skilled and he missed the Citadel game as well this is what you have to do against Mar you got to move change sides in the floor and then have some quick cutting against that defense if a teams going to overplay you at the top and take away the three youve got to find other ways and usually starts with good player movement along with ball Shrewsberry hits the free throw to push it to six Marcus Burton prior to that free throw had scored 11 of Notre Dames last 16 points hes up to 18 for the game now coach Notre Dame coach Micah Shrewsberry told us on our call today that cutting hard would be key against this defense can you elaborate on on what he means by that well away from the basketball you got to find angles and if the floor is if floor is spaced properly and mov the ball theres going to be opportunity to cut to the rim away from the ball before the defense shifts because St Peter excuse me Maris doesnt give a lot of help Maris defensive philosophy is pressure the basketball take away the rim but away from the ball you can cut and the hel the help wont come from the weak side because theyre going to stay home out on the threepoint line Notre Dame by five Allen had the basket for the red foxes on the the other end hes in double figures with 10 trying to get downhill losing his footing blocked kzne keeps it alive the runner from Booth The Freshman that is Silky Smooth well again thats a good basket cut by Booth good basketball IQ understanding his man was inside helping and he found that alley to the rim theres a lot of things to like about Carri Booth The Freshman a top 50 player in this Years 2023 class just a freshman hook pass to kulie the Southpaw to Allen banging into his man double pump and he finishes around the rim well we just spoke about Max Allen and his importance to Maris when he stepped out of that game they just lose any type of inside presence on both ends and that time Allen just forced his way to the rim Marist wont go away its back down to a fivepoint deficit Notre Dames lost three in a row seven on the timer Imes in some trouble booth has to hoist banked it Music in Logan Imes again dribbled penetrating into the Gap and he saw the second and then the third Maris Defender and had the presence of mind to dribble drive in and then kick it back out to Booth booths in double figures with 11 Notre Dame by eight rner sores down low sutan cant convert Notre Dame shooting 50 in this half and theyre three for four from three and kzns hurt down on the lower left part of your screen down in the Music corner coach Shrewsberry loves the effort from his team tonight well theyre cutting hard on the offensive end of the floor you you just talked about what what that really means well what it means what it means is theyre playing a lot harder than they did earlier this week against Citadel were back in a moment Notre Dame by eight and heres what happened keep an eye on 20 and Music white weve got a topnotch officiating crew here tonight and Bert Smith and Ron Grover were at the table for a while and they took they looked at every angle and certainly that is totally unnecessary there by Javon kie good call by the officials so kolie is ejected the senior from from Chicago averaging seven points and five rebounds per game whos been its very uncharacteristic of him hes been in this Maris program since 2020 started 30 games last year and played the third most minutes so hes a veteran that knows better for the red foxes and this puts Notre Dame at the line leading by eight and you know sometimes James how it looks on film and the result is one thing but the intent is not on was there sometimes this just happens in the game of basketball its unfortunate but like you said its uncharacteristic of of pie but a dangerous Music play kesn hits both and all of a sudden coach Notre Dame has quietly pushed their lead to double figures for the first time tonight but we spoke about it I their body language has been excellent all night long even even when they had some scoring drops they never relented on the defensive end Applause underneath jas working hard against Allen lost the handle some thievery from Noah Harris too much dribbling down on the low box with nowhere to go Baris has started this second half three for eight from the field they have just eight points Allen the step through and Allen 14 points for the big down low for the red foxes think Maris needs to go through Allen a little bit more than they have they go to him but probably they should look for him a little bit more with some spacing because you see his footwork his power and his finesse at The Rim is been there all night long he has the last six points for barrist Burton navigates the throw back to Davis deep in the shot clock theyre trying to post up ji and its smothered out on the wing another steal for the red foxes thats what Maris does they laid off and there was no passing angle into the Applause post double comes on Allen Allen one of the best passers from the low post in the land a three Corner no from doy in the rebound to the Fighting Irish Davis got away with a push whistle basket wont go hes headed to the line to shoot two well as you get set to ring in the New Year next Sunday well have a womens basketball quadruple header right here on acc Network

on Christmas day which is interesting that theyre going up against the NBA but well be tuned into the NBA yeah NBA NFL college basketball not on Christmas but usually right around theres been a lot of games this week and and high level games too Tim we touched on Duke and Baylor and North Carolina and Oklahoma right before the holiday break Harris catching shoot three thats a big one for marris well no Harris is a pure threepoint shooter he just needs a little bit of space that time they did a good job but misdirecting him he moved without the ball just popped off that weak side and nailed it its by far the best threepoint shooter from a percentage point on this red Foxs team at almost 50 after a missed dunk Maris down by Applause seven pascarelli driving price got open left it short and Imes the rebound for Notre Dame Notre Dames done a very good job on the defensive backboard not allowing Maris too many multiple chances Notre Dame hasnt made a field goal in almost four minutes and a Rugby scrum and a jump in the possession arrow favors the visitors itll be Maris basketball just loose passes on the perimeter thats just nothing on that ball make quick solid passes against this may stingy defense Notre Dame has turned it over three times in their last five Music possessions Collins Shimmy Shake deep in the lane off the glass falling to the floor and he goes time out Notre Dame lets go back to this Harris 3 coach well Maris has hung around and its again their defense they just sometimes are challenged offensively and that they found Harris open on the weak side Notre Dame fell asleep finding him on the perimeter and Jaden Collins freshman who runs the team but can get into the lane a little New York City action max Allen leads Marist scoring with 14 points tonight but these guards are picking it up for the red foxes theyve been more aggressive here in this second half well you got J youve got some guys from the New York New Jersey area that they could step up and play you talk about Collins from New Jersey pascarelli from the New York City area uh Dos only a sophomore these guys have played a lot of basketball for their career so they can step in as younger players and make an impact and you saw Collins right there that one hes he is a tough kid and Collins and P pascarelli as a freshman back courp very impressive this is the first meeting between these two schools in 19 years Notre Dame leads the alltime series two to nothing hav it made a field goal in over four Music minutes and a moving screen and a legal p pick set by Kev another Notre Dame turnover now Notre Dame has lost their Rhythm on the offensive end of the floor too much dribbling and standing around Maris with a chance to trim it to a onep possession game under nine left Collins lost the handle and an easy steal for the Fighting Irish Notre Dames only points in the last five minutes have come from the foul line kzne deep in the lane banging with his Defender price is all over him with five to shoot Burton lost it out of bounds how about the defense on that trip from the red foxes thats what they do they stay home on ball side on the threepoint line but once you get into that area right under the restricted area they swarm the basketball there was nothing there not was fortunate actually it was probably a 3se second violation before they turned it over inside Collins count the basket hoop and Horn and Jaden Collins is headed to the line John dun said we recruited Jaden Collins for a long time and this is why he can get where he wants wants to go with the basketball he filled up the stat sheet against Maryland Eastern Shore on Monday he had seven points nine assists six rebounds and four Applause steals hes a 63 foul shooter a Miss offensive rebound Collins has it Harris puts it on the deck Harris on the perimeter a long one from pascarelli for the tie its short Notre Dame secures it that was good defense on that possession after the Miss free throw by ND Notre Dame has turned it over five times in the last four minutes they had just five blunders in the first 28 minutes of the contest theyve been sloppy with it with 10 to shoot Zona Davis spin move and a foul 45 to 42 Notre Dame leads by three at the under eight Tim what are your thoughts on this miris team theyre on a 70 run how have they been able to climb back well theyve stuck to their game plan and its who they are thats their identity its their defense and then if their their offense starts clicking thats when they can get back in a game or take a game over and thats been their its been their identity all season long and M Dame has gone through scoring droughts at times this season and now theyre in another one but this game we knew was going to come down to short long possessions and a tight game at the end and who makes the plays at the end offensively are going to win tough shot from Harris short whistle and it stays on this end Notre Dame is plus n at the foul line in this second half they are 10 for 10 and Marist is one for three Notre Dame hasnt made a field goal in 6 minutes but theyve been able to fend off the red foxes from the foul line that last foul called on Burton and that is his fourth thats a big foul Marcus Burton who leads all scores with 18 has to go to the bench with his fourth Applause foul Allen double tend to shoot Allen rips through trying to get back to his left shoulder and he turns it over a good change by Michael Shrewsberry thats the first time theyve sent the double at Allen and it was Music successful six to shoot Davis trying to get to a spot trying to clear over Allen throws it up and gets it to rattle in thats the old school you were speaking about earlier thats the Up and Under step through on the Baseline with no room Allen was pre preventing but Davis found an alley that ends a drought without a field goal for Notre Dame in over six minutes Collins stop and start no rebound shuberry well thats excellent defense by Notre Dame and Michael Shrewsberry told us earlier today he has been happy with the defense for the most part all season long and tonight they have been Rock Solid Marist had trimmed it to a threepoint lead for Notre Dame Notre Dame scored the last four Davis in the lane whistles it out on the arc five to shoot Shrewsberry fall away thats a tough shot from The Freshman thats another good job by Notre Dame going inside drawing that second and third Defender then kicking it back outside and Shrewsberry with a real good decision going inside outside and then the step through by Davis impressive with no room the roome but he found a little angle and then Michel shuberry son great all smiles from the Notre Dame bench 51 42 they lead by nine and theyre on a 60 run over the last two minutes of Music action two starter Burton and J saddled on the bench with four fouls booth has stepped up with 11 Shrewsberry with four Davis with Music eight their last five go ahead Michael Shrewsberry said after the Citadel game that he should have went to the WalkOns earlier and if they didnt show energy early tonight he was going to go to the WalkOns early and theres been no thought of that whatever message he delivered to his team its wored because they have played connected on the defensive end theres been great energy from the bench the guys that have come in have done their job and then offense theyve been solid enough to get this lead ninepoint lead for the home team pascarelli and the rebound to Davis Maris has missed their last five shots its been one and done for the most part with Maris not been able to get any rebounds in that he Davis Notre Day by 11 and Davis is in double fingers with 10 stop and start cins SNES through thats good offense by Maris changing sides of the the floor found an opening on ball reversal now a steel Collins with a gimme a quick four from the Maris point guard and an injured player thats Logan Imes for the Fighting Irish he missed the Citadel game with an injury and he might have injured himself on that possession Marcus Burton has reentered the lineup for Notre Dame with four fouls Corner Booth three in and Applause out that was good little ball reversal you got you have to attack Maris if you can attack and find an open man quickly youve got to take the shot and a carry call against Jaden Collins thats only the eighth turnover tonight for the red foxes Applause hes holding his shoulder down there times had issues with that shoulder in the past Marist such a young team what does it say about the job that coach Dunn has done with how few turnovers they average per night well they were very efficient offensively you know they have their system theyre not going to rush the rush it up the court unless they have opportunity and there you have opportunity Burton playing with four fouls aggressive hes up to 20 points a game Applause high Harris a three its Music in Burton backed away a little bit on Harris with the four fouls and he didnt want to let him dribble drive and pick up the fifth Harris just backed up sixpoint lead with three in change left th Dames lost three in a row trying to avoid their fourth straight defeat Burton in traffic throws it away Collins on the break feeds it ahead and the Freshman passarellis streaking to the goal its a fourpoint game just when you thought Maris was dead in the water their defense tightened up and they found some openings on offense and a whistle and a foul called on Collins Timeout on the floor well you dont get this opportunity much against Maris and Tay Davis found a little opening and just extended to the rim and Max Allen has 14 points to lead the red foxes coach meist is on a 92 run over the last 21 theyve made their last four shots well theyre running very good offense and you their defense has been solid weve talked about it all night long theyre not doing a great job on the offensive glass but theyre make make made some shots on their first possession Notre Dame has switched it up a little bit you see Allen still rubbing his leg and hes been dominant all night long Michael Shrewsberry though has changed up his defense when Allen catches it hes hes been trapped but theyve gone inside out and Harris has made some big shots along with Burton but dont forget hes still playing with four fouls out there on the floor so defensively marris may look to go at him he has a game high 20 points on eight of 17 shooting hes two for six from Beyond The Arc that last foul was the eighth on marish this is a one and one opportunity for Burton whos 82 for the year from the line and Notre Dame pushes their lead to five omis fou Burton coming up the sideline John Dunn put the Press on kind of energized his defense another a turned it over but hustling off that Miss free throw Applause and nether official knows were they looked at each other and said Somebodys got to make a call here Burton goes one for two from the stripe Notre Dame basketball on the alternating possession so allegedly they both touched it out of Bounds at the same time obviously its this is not reviewable sometimes youre play to make to make a call that happens sometimes because the play comes up on top of you and and you dont see who touched it last the ball was pinballing around in that coffin corner Burton downhill a whistle and a jump ball in the arrow favors Marist now thats this is what Marcus Burton was doing at the beginning of this game he was over penetrating against that Maris defense you take that extra dribble to get to the rim thats when youre going to get that second and third Defender Burtons got to pull up in the midrange closing in on two minutes left Notre Dame by five trying to snap a threegame losing streak Maris theyve won five in a Applause row doy fumbles it out of bounds its a turnover just the ninth tonight for the red foxes well that wasnt a smart play by doy he caught the ball at the top he came from the left wing all he had to do is reverse the ball Noah Harris was standing right next to him on the right Wing hes been hot as of late he could have pulled the trigger for a three Marist applying some pressure they got to stealing a score out of this earlier this Applause half Shrewsberry lost the handle Harris all tangled up with Applause Davis out of bounds stays with Marist on this end might have been a bump there at the top by Applause Music marris Harris quick triggered three and its buckets Maris better be aware no a Harris is on fire and Notre Dame is backing off him for some reason theyve got to stay glued to him and dont help off Harris Davis out of bounds turnover Notre Dame theyre 15th tonight on this end Noah Harris is three for three from downtown for meist all nine of his points coming from Beyond The Arc in 19 minutes Michael Shrewsberry pointing to his head saying where are you going and make smart plays and that was not a smart play Tay Davis had nowhere to go just put his head down turned it over closing in on a minute left Marist is connected on their last five Applause shots doy he turns it over thats two possessions in a row for doy just putting his head down nowhere to go trying to go one on five turned it over Notre Dames turned it over three times in the last last minute 48 40 seconds left clinging to a twopoint lead Burton in the lane barely gets off the floor a Applause Music Miss Collins racing aead boots it out of bounds and Maris with backto back turnovers here in the final Applause minute both teams trying to rush the issue in the half quarter in transition just not understanding the spacing needed or if you have an advantage in transition sure you take it but if not such an important possession Mar should have pulled it out run some clock try to get Harris involved this game has entirely been played in the half court to your Music point Notre Dame will head to the free throw line hey next Friday December 29th over on acc Network theyll have a mens basketball double header highlighted by the Tar Heels Miami host North Florida at 6 Eastern then the 11th ranked heels host Charleston Southern to cap off the 2023 schedule cant wait to see what 2024 has in store for us on the ACC Network Notre Dame at the line where they are 11 for 12 in this second half Davis gets the bonus still a onep possession lead for the Fighting Irish with 26 seconds to go Applause Davis got them both just 65 on the season tonight he is six for six from the Applause strike so well see if marris can get Harris involved if not quick two is needed Harris his first Miss of the night Notre Dame by four marris trying to foul they track down Shrewsberry in the corner whos a 75 Applause Marksman was fortunate there they threw it to the Deep Corner lucky that they werent trapped they got timeouts to burn if they do get in trouble and they have a foul to give tin did you like that quick three from Noah Harris or should have marris tried to get in deep and get a quick well youre running youre running out of clock and you know what are you going to do Harris has been red hot it was it was contested it was under duress the problem I have is that previous possessions where they just didnt take their time down two and goty just put his head down and turned it over Notre Dame by five with 11 seconds left Shrewsberry gets them both sixpoint lead for the Fighting Irish Applause price is three in and out no offensive rebound and a foul at the basket with 13 on the clock and Marist headed to the line that big your pardon thats only the sixth foul on Notre Dame and if its on the floor it inbound Applause Music underneath they will doy to the stripe to shoot Applause two hasnt attempted a lot of free throws this season shooting just 25 perenties one for four from the line well Michael shs got to leave the building tonight with a satisfied feeling because of the fact that you know you we heard him after the Citadel game and what we saw on the court uh he knew he had a lot of work to do to get back on track against a solid team tonight in Marist and theyve answered the call without Julian roer they still they hung their hat on defense and down the stretch made enough plays offensively to win this game Maris tungue in there tough
