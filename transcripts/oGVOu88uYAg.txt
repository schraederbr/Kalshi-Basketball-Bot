Id be better prepared to lead this program than than coach Conroy Chase Hunter knocking down his first freethrow attempt of the Season 75 percent a year ago Ed Conroy a fouryear stint as the head coach of this alma mater the first time and he delivered one of just three 20 win seasons in the long history of Citadel Hoops that was back in the 2000809 season 0809 that was a really special year I was in Charleston that year coaching at Charleston Southern and the energy around that program The Citadel Alum really rally around their sports teams and they loved that team that year he had one of the best players I think in Citadel history Cameron Wells a guard in fact three straight years the Citadel had the runnerup for the most outstanding player Most Valuable Player of the Southern Conference the winner each of those years was a guy named Steph Curry thats right tells you all you need to know look at Clark had the big man move couple of years ago when he first came to them thats not a shot he would necessarily finish and hes back to a twopoint game hes such a dynamic Guy 112 assists 72 turnovers last year theyre going to use him to initiate a lot of offense or the team that lost Hayden Brown who elected to play his final year at South Carolina he was a great player in the socon for them Tyson can get it on the jumper Jer comes away with it hell push the pace good job defending by Galloway to create the turnover absolutely made sure he didnt foul Galloway the pullup shefflin Hemingway and the infraction can be an offensive foul Alice Hemingway called for the charge as Dave Maynard hit the deck Tigers playing aggressively early on a twopoint lead in the season opener back door cut moments ago dont forget about Ben middlebrooks role in that play absolutely this High post screener has become so valuable for Clemson right here weve got two Cutters Middlebrook says the first one Hunter Tyson comes off at a second cut we get the layup right there thats an assisted field goal thats a big play and Middlebrooks his famous connection the nephew of a guy who played some pretty good quarterback both in college in the NFL Danny canal and his sister was a

same neck of the woods in the metro line area probably got to know each other over the years Hunter hop stuff knocked away nice reach in move by the citadels Austin Ash the Iowa Transfer itll stay in Clemsons end so Dylan Hunters checked in this is one of the biggest things for us to watch is whos going to be the primary ball handler whenever Dylan comes in with his brother Chase Applause Galloway looked low and now Dylan Hunter the shot to the head but hell be called for his first personal foul so Dylan Hunter a freshman 64th rated recruit in the country he was signed with Baylor early the Tigers were able to get him late Ive loved watching him in practice and in the exhibition game hes really going to help the Tigers a little bit of different frame than his older brother hes 63 193 he does not look like a freshman Pete good things in last weeks preseason game look at Clarks spin move average 97 a game last season that number will grow for a couple of reasons but hes going to be

saw him when he was a senior his dad is the principal at his high school uh he was a thin guy but joined that class for Clemson and has really turned out to be a special player for the Tigers he told me his mom and dad were both Collegiate athletes so good athletic family and his brother is a freshman at Belmont he will be in Greenville this Friday whenever the Furman paladins host the Belmont

shoes of the injured PJ Hall weve seen that out of the sophomore from Theresa Georgia so far here in little well the weight continues for PJ Hall trying to come back from a couple of injuries since last season the most recent one a knee surgery and they just continue to hurry up and wait if you will as the expectation was maybe by this month hed be able to at least get back to practicing and at

Chase makes an easy basket for Ian set him up well 71 percent from the line as a freshman Chef on a guy who had his career high against North Carolina 12 points and thats not the easiest thing to do so its got the ability to score and Brad often said especially early last year that guys like Middlebrooks and shipsland they were just trying to figure things out on this level just coming here needing to grow physically and and get used to the ACC level of flood yeah when you think about that Ben Middlebrook should only be a freshman right now thats significant thank you so the score tied at 20 a piece Music Citadel began last season on an ACC court and knocked off the pit Panthers up in the steel city that guy keeps doing that its going to be a tough night for Clemson Austin Ash draining another trade Alston Ash continues to stretch the tiger defense and he has let nothing go from Deep chips on feeding low Hunter Tyson strong move Clark got there too late Applause Music Bulldogs have been in the Southern Conference since 1936 about 15 18 years together with Clemson in that League for the Tigers left in the early 50s when the ACC was formed Durham on the drive strong move and hell head to the line boy that is a good looking freshman Fred Conroys team the spacing that the Citadel is playing with right now is giving the Tigers a lot of trouble theyve got him so spread out that is creating some room to be able to drive Austin Ash has made some threes so theyre a little bit spread out right now theyve got to be able to guard the ball better oneonone dude just like this one right here whenever Brevin Galloway gets beat from the top of the key to the right thats a thats a talented freshman play from Madison Durham Music his first personal 16 fouls on the Tigers five so far in the Bulldogs Applause perfectly to the foul line five for five give him nine points that leads all scores Madison dur is off to a great start you know particularly as a freshman

Bulldogs try to build their biggest lead of this opening half Maynard lost it to the right guy teammate out on the wing Dylan angler just checked in from the corner Mater and inside battle for the rebound the foul is going to be called I believe on Spence coming over the back Citadel Bulldogs have a fourpoint lead in part because Austin Ash has been hitting him from outside either up high or in the corner Tigers Hunter Tyson keeping his team in it in the early there Ed Conroe and the Citadel Bulldogs a fourpoint lead 735 to go in the opening half second tenure as the head coach at the Citadel he left after the 09 010 season to become the head coach at Tulane and then after guiding that American Athletic Conference program he has since been an assistant in both the Big Ten and the SEC been around guys like Richard Pitino came to the Citadel after serving as an assistant at Vanderbilt to Jerry Stackhouse who many in the SEC think is one of the best exes guys in that League Stackhouse learn from some pretty good guys back in his college days Reverend Galloway forcing one not going to go look at shefflin battling inside and Hunter saves it to another Hunter from Chase to Tyson Hemingway thats what he does 41 Beyond The Arc a year ago just like that Clemsons back within a point so Alex Hemingway led the Tigers in scoring in France theyre gonna need him to play well particularly early this year until PJs back from the wing Morgan nothing not that time Bulldogs three of seven Beyond The Arc of good strapping hustle that time by Colby McAllister to recycle their possession Applause Morgan a guy who would have face the tigers with Notre Dame shot clock at five angler kicks it back out one of the shot clock Morgan realizes it to beat the buzzer itll head out

communicate an offensive rebound could have been a possibility but no trouble at all middle Brooks taking it away Hemingway tries for another trade Music Applause will bring it up four to six four good ball handling skills he could be a really Dynamic point guard for them as well if they so desire and he caught uh Ben Middlebrooks in a switch in the last possession was able to get downhill just missed the layup Conroy telling us that he wasnt really sure what his guard rotation would look like he was there without a freshman AJ Smith and a senior Rudy Fitzgibbons tonight for various physical reasons and an offensive foul called on Durham Madison Durer continues to attack the rim he drew some fouls early on but he was able to stay vertical right there and he didnt foul him led to the offensive foul here you see him getting downhill Madison dur is a strong guy to be a freshman you know to drop that shoulder uh got where he wanted to get he heads the bench four and a half to go before the break for the second personal foul middlebrooks got the start tonight Ian schifflin trying to fill the shoes of PJ Hall while hes still out Galloway splits the fender so nicely Ive been really impressed how Brevin Galloway has attacked the rim the exhibition game and here tonight instead of just settling for threes its going to open up more things Applause Ash got caught off balance and then this were hockey wed call it tripping instead itll be a push on Middlebrooks Music see some down low action for the Tigers really nice drive by Galloway so Brevin Galloway tore his ACL two years ago at Charleston um because South Carolina state went to Boston College with Earl Grant last year but got an extra year back late in the process was able to come home to Clemson his body looks the best that Ive seen in about three years really moving well right now Tigers wish he had missed the flight from Boston down here a year ago because youll recall he delivered the daggers so now hes here to make amends this season for that one moment in time in his collegiate career absolutely he calls it a dream come true to play for the purple and orange fivepoint game tigers look to build their biggest lead of this opening half Chase Hunter driving inside on Morgan in a pretty move while he was in the air and then Conroy has seen enough and he calls the timeout Music Chase hunter in double figures with 10 points chase continues to get downhill attacking the rim and able to pay for Grand Brown Hill youve got to be able to switch on defense in an instant so right here Ian schifflin is going to be involved in this ball screen with Hunter Tyson theres a switch now Ian is going to be able to stay in front and move his feet now the big part youve got to be able to stay out with the shooters Ian does a good enough job moving his feet theyre able to stay out it leads to a turnover thats how you got to be able to guard when they try to space the floor like that now moving out on ash who obviously is a little bit smaller probably a little bit quicker 63185 Chef one six seven two thirty and that 2 30 is a solid rock of granite having seen him be able to adjust physically as his freshman year progressed a season ago Elijah Morgan with the move Bulldogs trying to break an 110 Tigers run so here comes Clemson looking to build on that Galloway no fear down the lane with a good job on the rebound by Jackson price who just checked in the sophomore out of Highland Georgia other end Morgan got a little bit too physical as Hunter Tyson hit the deck Hunter Tyson continues to do what he does stands in there takes that charge moves his feet team foul on the Citadel and a turnover Hunter Tyson Bulldogs continue a scoring drought of nearly five minutes in the process Clintons gone up by seven tigers have been able to guard the ball and stay out with Shooters Hunter Tyson turned into a point guard for a moment Chase Hunter will fire from our truck foreign tigers are starting to get in Rhythm Chase feels comfortable with that that ball screen they went underneath it he drove it last time that time he pulled up from three 13 points to lead all scorers for the Tigers senior from Atlanta Chase Hunter Maynard Ash quick heave with a right hand as Heaven away got out there and wanted the travel call against the Citadel guard that snaps a 140 Clemson run such a hard shot Ash is pivoting able to get it off Music Hunter will pull up oh hes feeling it Chase Hunter when he got hot last year a lot of his buckets were scored close to the basket but he did hit him at 35 percent Beyond The Arc Chase Hunter has been a really Dynamic scoring guy for him all throughout the trip to France and in the preseason off to a great start this year you can imagine with everyone not just the post players who talked about trying to pick up for the scoring in the absence of Hall how much better tool they would be for his return once he gets up and going yeah its exciting for Coach Brown now to think about the possibilities Dean shot fox in a violation Morgan got hung up Hemingway and Company able to get the turnover so coach Brownell really felt like this had to be a better defensive team for him this season you know thats such a calling card of his adding associate head coach Billy donlin to come back and help with some defensive stuff Ive Loved what Ive seen and from them in practice defensively and tonight he shows the fact that these guys are a team that likes each other he thinks actually will help them play better defense youve got to be coming youve got to be connected to play well on defense Bulldogs nine turnovers in the opening half of play Tigers forced just over 11 a season ago Callaway well beyond the arcs with another tray for the Tigers thats his first in a Clemson uniform from long range Clemson hitting him its 44 in their lead now to double figures extended Ash forced the shot another rebound for Tyson what a good first half hes having thats six boards so far but they made him dribble it thats the most important part they made all they made Ash put it on the deck Applause Music Hunter calls to the screen for Middlebrooks thought about the shot how about Hemingway and Clark runs it down Applause Music facing out High little back door feed Maynard nice idea inside for price Galloway almost knocked it away a little Bobble by Price didnt have possession so no travel and he gets the hoop so the Tigers have used their timeout so coach Brownell is going to let him go Applause Music and Chase Hunter calling the timeout with 174 to go thatll take a break as well an 11 Point Advantage for the Clemson team on Citadel Music where can you go for the latest musthaves and every seasons nice Dives Moes actually find everything you need and more this holiday at Lowes Brad Brownell the Tigers trying for one more good set offensively tiger team thats led by as many as 13 Chase Hunters starting his senior season quite well 16 points so far were not even at halftime yet ended up averaging just under seven a game last year but again a surge in scoring over the final four to six weeks of the Season yeah he really finished the year Well playing with a lot of confidence its off to a great start Applause your team thats uh hows Bohannon and David Collins move on to Connor transferred so did alamir Dawes a guy with the ball one of the holdovers as well as Hemingway under 10 to go Middlebrooks Hunter Tyson four heres hunter from the wings why not feeling it knew it before it left his hand and the Clemson Tigers closed the opening half on a roll a 205 run over the final seven minutes and eight seconds and a 14point Advantage at the break through the tunnel they go here at the half Chase hunter in Clemson closed the half on a big run first four minutes Pete always big in college football the new the cool new term is the the middle eight which I had not heard until this season ever since Hal McGuire said it on a basketball telecast the first four first five minutes of the second half has been the thing nice play out of the start of the second half but Spence unable to finish inside really good drop off by Madison Durr who continues to play well Chase Hunter been running some point tonight but certainly carrying the scoring load rev Galloway his debut at his hometown School Hunter Tyson adding to his scoring night he was 35 percent Beyond The Arc a year ago and he knocks down the threepointer thats his first of the ninth made five last Wednesday against Benedict thats huge turnover by the Bulldogs they had nine in the first half Applause Music so coach Brownell will bring Middlebrook Off the Bench to start the second half and start Ian after that strong performance Galloway off the no look from Hunter but he leaves it short you notice that time Chase Hunter stayed until his shot got to the rim and was able to get the offensive rebound drive on the Baseline McAllister nice job by Galloway Tyson with dirt defend to solve the contact itll be a block the turnover right there another great example of the tigers being able to stay at home defensively ball was driven Baseline and it came out led to a turnover Tigers able to get the ball moving that led to a good thing at the end driving kick by Brevin Galloway creating for a teammate again tigers have created well thats 11 assists now Hunter Tyson all right gets the line with some physical play after Galloway forced a turnover Music great willingness by Madison dur to give up his body I actually thought it was a charge but hunter got the call and its a block hes shooting two gets a second to go down and Clemson adds to its biggest lead of the night Applause Music Brady spins senior out of Douglasville Georgia heres dirt kicks it on the wing and one as Colby McAllister knocks down his first Citadel three and hes got a chance to make it a fourpoint play Applause Music freshman Colby McAllister The Freshman out of

college career coming all in the same play that doesnt happen very often Music Bulldogs try to get a stop Galloway Chase hunter that wide open I dont know but to knock it down Applause heres derb Applause they had a very experienced point guard here the last couple of years Tyler moth who came to them after previous college thoughts but he really messed with Hayden Brown they had a good combo inside and out look at Durer hes gonna make a name for himself in a citadel uniform with moves like that the Bulldogs back within 12 Music a front schifflin Ian schifflins showing you some range I dont know if we talked about that part of his game he took a three Wednesday against Benedict and so coach Brownell is going to let him shoot it Music Spence hoping to take some of the inside pressure off him Stephen Clark especially with Browns departure from the city of the lineup der strong move on schifflin no good box out Down Low by Hemingway prevented defense from getting the ball Hunter schifflin and the Finish Music Ian schifflin showing his versatility getting out and running the floor great pass easy finish schifflins night 13 points and five boards Chase Hunter leads all scorers with 19 theres a drive inside by Austin Ash to no avail Citadel had pulled within 12 tigers and lead by as many as 20 after this possession tigers are doing a great job not fouling on penetration right now they struggle with that early on much better of late and endure the rebound Applause Music and a whistle and weve got a foul away from the ball take a look at Madison Durham his strong move to the bucket so so much of the Citadel offense they got the post up to the top of the key it spreads the floor Madison dur is shown over and over again he gets downhill with his right hand hes hard to stop that was on the Tigers Brevin Galloway for second I thought of the number 11 the official was indicating was for the guy right there near the bottom of your screen Madison dur and that would have been trouble for the Bulldogs hes on the floor with three McAllister pulls off with a hand in his face oh thats a freshman hitting that hes got seven points here in the second half hes keeping the Bulldogs in it he hit that after setting a ball screen too thats a big play by freshman Tyson from the wing rebound by McAllister Music McAllister another guy is going to be a tough matchup in his League at 65 195 and with range Kobe McAllister and Conroy took the rapper off for the second half how do you like that they have scored 12 points since the intermission and Kobe McAllister has 10 of them and a timeout is called as the Bulldogs are back with an 11 Ian schifflin doing his part as his sophomore season gets going for Clemson Ians stepping out stretching the floor making a big three from the top of the key and then Chase Hunter coming down the floor dropping it off Music tiger pep band doing some double duty today the womens game earlier and now here for the mens game I wonder if theres an hours limit per day on the trombone I dont know if they have NCAA countable activity hours for the band the horn section adding the atmosphere here in Little John Coliseum Hospital trying to put a run together McAllister defending the ball handler Dylan Hunter who Mike McAllister is a freshman Hunter Tyson backing in on Maynard look at the collapse Tyson the battle Scrappy player the Tigers senior he decided to come back for a final year he wants to be a big part of a Clemson run here in 2223 game number one tigers have a double figure Advantage were gonna take a timeout well Citadel getting a breather with those quick timeouts and frankly that might have been a benefit for them and because theyre having to use a lot of energy to stay with Hunter Tyson he has been energetic in this game as evidenced moments ago yeah we keep talking about the physical development of Hunter Tyson you know 10 points eight rebounds right now physically has continued to develop switches ball screens such a dynamic player I was talking to assistant dick Bender last Thursday after the exhibition Hunter Tyson will play basketball professionally for as long as he wants guy that just is the dude into the game usually in the right place where hes supposed to be to see dick Bender long time Brad Brownell assistant Tyson 79 from the line last season three or five so far tonight its in the ball game tigers with three and double figures Hunter 19 all those were in the first half Tyson with 11 and Ian schifflin with 13 Applause Bullet Pass underneath nice fine Morgan and Clark finishing it off Applause so schifflin and Hunter are talking about the ball screen we they broke down on that one back to a 10point game Chase Hunter looking for his first second half Point shiflin cant get the put back the first time rejected by Clark the second time one of the best shot blockers in the country a year ago average over two blocks per game heres Ash wow just like that its a seven point game Applause when they have space Bulldogs are eight of 14 Beyond The Arc in the contest thats kept a minute case Hunter no again an offensive board for schifflin Hunter on the drive off the hesitation Hunter Tyson with the rebound heres Hemingway oh that would have been big but the Tigers keep the possession or schifflin hitting the deck hard as he ran into Ash so we talked about it early on Clemsons ability to offensive rebounds you know games like this when its an ACC School versus a socon school youve got to create extra possessions and youre seeing Clemson kind of impose their will a little bit right now this is physical play yes see holding the right leg but hes able to pop up three thousand The Citadel in the half two so far in Clemson thats trademark of an ed Conroy team though they are not going to back down from anybody theyre going to be physical and tough Hunter Tyson strong move Applause Clark feeling it and its going to be called a blocking foul I think he was inside of the Ark so Stephen Clark picking up the personal thatll be his second and he is still yet to get back up on his feet Music a little bit of see him pop back up once again Tyson on the attack Hunter Tyson on the drive but you got to credit The Citadel Stephen Clark sticks his body in there he knows hes going to get hit but the Citadel there well coached thats a big part of that Conroy and their culture theyre going to play with physicality and toughness stood in there and took that that charge just didnt get the whistle it looked like his feet were actually outside of the Ark so that can happen Hunter Tyson back to the line Bulldogs on an 111 run over the past 207 which is how theyve been able to reduce what was a 18point deficit early on in the second half so much of it they hit four threes in the first six minutes of the second half that equals the number they made in the first half Music Tyson knocking down the free throw now theres 12 points in the game the Southern Conference has a Palmetto State School pick to win it all the Furman paladins who thought they had themselves a championship with clocks at all zeros in overtime in Asheville last season but maybe Gene Baptiste jumper to beat the buzzer and Chattanooga the socon attorney title and they almost Advanced past Illinois in the NCAA head coach Bob Ritchie is a rising star and he was my roommate for two years in Charleston when we uh coached the Charleston Charleston Southern yeah he was there for a while Music Charleston Southern come into little John play the Tigers in recent years their longtime head coach Barkley right a ball and knocked away that time from McAllister theres been a huge story in the second half of the Bulldogs Dylan Hunter trying to catch up to his good brother in the scoring column and theyll get Hunter Tyson battling inside fonte might call it over the back but its the other number five Dave Maynard for the Citadel do I believe this call for the first one so Dylan Hunters Menace were cut short in the first half because of foul trouble but coach Barnell wants him to find a rhythm needs him to play well so youre going to see him play some extended Menace in the second half thank you Josh Beadle Richard freshman kicks it to Tyson and schiffler looking and battling playing a little bit of volleyball to go with his Hoops theyre going to count the bucket no Hemingway arguing that the defender Durr was inside of the arcs but that time it will be a charge against Clemson and I believe theyll wave off the hoop that was the third one the citadels tried to take this half third times a charm they finally got it stood in there and got one Tigers now seven of 19 from Beyond The Arc lets take another look Ian shifling keeps the ball alive him and whale on the tip out just got to play off two feet the play by Durer who has three fouls and hes been able to be on the court with that number for a while pull the ball is trying to get as close as theyve been since way back in the middle Mark of the first half McAllister feeds to Clark I dont think he was ready for it shot clock at six Clark over schifflin good defense by the Tigers sophomore Music coach Brownell going with two freshmen on the floor right now its a big stretch heres their fifth year senior who got out of sorts travel is the call official on the Baseline calls the traveling the official out High Nick heater I think was about to ring up the Bulldogs for another foul Tigers played with great Pace offensively in the last 10 minutes theyve gotten a little sped up here to start the second half at Brownell chasing win number 219 at the helm of Clemson tonight closing in on 400 in his career not that time out front for McAllister his first missed from three in four attempts Music Applause and a whistle away from the ball and the foul will go against McAllister of the Citadel Music so Ian sheffling continues to pose for the Tigers gets whistled for the foul by the Bulldogs and the balls underneath 16 fouls Now by The Citadel 65 trying to defend 67 its a mismatch in that respect what can you do if youre McAllister and try to front the player other than then just move around him youve got to use your quickness you cant play behind them nice idea by Beetle Tyson thatll go back to the line outstanding pass by The Freshman from Columbia Josh Beadle Durer picks up his fourth so they came out of this ball screen slip right here thats called a follow action Hunter Tyson is coming to the ball Takes Two Steps Cuts straight to the rim again outstanding pass by Josh Beadle Tigers nine of 13 on free throws in the game Music come on Hunter Tyson its a nine threepoint play Applause builds the lead back out to 11 nice and now with 15 points he had 19 points six boards in the exhibition last week against Benedict Morgan driving the lane not a wise move great example by the Tigers was making sure that you dont foul as were trying to build in a double figure lead beetle not a bad drive at all a little fake in there but he can finish Bulldogs had pulled within seven after trailing by as many as 18 McAllister defended by Hunter Music Applause green just onto the floor thats him with the ball for the Citadel Morgan and the rebound to Hemingway thank you really good defensive possession there by the Tigers staying at home with shooters Music I thought Clark might be inside of the circle but a foul onto Ian chiplin hes been doing many good things though on the night great job right here by both schifflin and Beetle staying vertical right there not Ian schifflin picking up his first personal foul playing a lot of minutes tonight for good reason so Brad Brownell did not think this should have been called a charge yeah and I dont think so either its uh its a tough one thats a secondary Defender rotating over Hill is on the ark but I tell you what every time the the Clemson drives the basketball there will be a citadel guy waiting for them to take a charge Applause Bulldogs down by 11 Central team a year ago finished 1318 two years ago they had their first winning season in a while thats a winning play by Hunter Tyson throwing it down off the turnover foreign Tyson makes so many plays that impacts winning basketball games 17 points for the tiger out of the Charlotte area Clark out High Morgan Morgan kicks back out shot clock under 10 Clark Works inside Stephen Clark with a nice move tigerton kept him reasonably contained but he does now have eight points in the game with a citadel with the answer Music really good drive by Stephen Clark outstanding defensive possession by Clemson till the end and well get a block away from the ball Tyson getting it done in lots of ways activity in the passing Lane just anticipated that used his limbs August reversed leads to a steal and a dunk Applause Hes listed at 68204 I think the the weights a little bit more than that taller than six eight I think so you know I remember when he was in high school hes grown so much physically just a really mentally tough kid as well good ball movement that time and Austin Ash finishing hes having a nice debut for the Bulldogs and double figures now has 14 points Music schifflin draws the double team Galloway havent heard from him in a while and start the rebound so here come the Bulldogs she wants to get back within seven where they were earlier in this half Ash coming to the socom school from the Big Ten where he played in Iowa Applause McAllister moving on Galloway Park will step back missing badly Clark last season with a 29 shooter from Beyond the yard photographer fortune in that possession there was a late breakdown defensively and it led to a wide open three Music under in the corner to Galloway low block schifflin Lefty hook no offensive rebound and hell go to the line youre seeing Ian shifling really step up youre seeing him grow today becoming a guy the Tigers can throw it to and score its a great Athletic program his high school has developed over the years their girls teams a dynasty and their boys teams not that bad either and hes taken that winning attitude to the college level and coach Sweeney and the football guys have had some pretty good ones come from Grayson High School as well Chase Bryce wasnt too bad on Fourth and six against Syracuse very good point uh Wayne gallman outstanding Athletic program in Georgia and thats a big part of this class for Clemson if you look at those freshmen Georgia guys primarily they do a great job recruiting in the peach state chiplin 71 shooter for his career coming into the night 10point game and shiflin 14 points a new career high as previous was 12 last year against North Carolina and he hasnt been subbed out in the second half thats big Pete middle Brooks got the start in the pivot of course PJ Hall not available for this game and really no word when hes going to get back to game action boy Ash really likes to force the shot hes been successful doing it tonight but not that time Hunter dumps inside schifflin foreign call a timeout this team had the ball with a chance to get within seven he looks up with 825 to go and doesnt want this to get out of hand tigers have a 12 point advantage moving the basketball is what they want to do just ask Chase Hunter Chase Hunter continues to Crave for others Music a couple of guys with double doubles and Ian schifflin building on that career high we told you 12 against North Carolina last year had been his Benchmark 16 so far with JD Powell Pete Hannity back with you lets not lose sight of the fact and I probably should have made this point earlier you talk about guys like Ben Middlebrooks Ian shifflin trying to fill the shoes of PJ Hall Hunter Tyson needs to be part of that dynamic as well until the hall returns hes gonna have to be and thats why his performance in the exhibition game making five threes was so important for Clemson when he can shoot threes like that it really changes their offense especially when PJ comes back and it also gives them the opportunity to score off the dribble so youve got to respect the fact he can go outside and might have been a bailout foul by Galloway as they enforce McAllister into an off balance shot Music Applause The Citadel makes you have to be really disciplined defensively youve got to stay home with Shooters youve got to show your hands on penetration theyre going to shot fake you theyre going to give you every move in the book it just tests your discipline Applause Colvin McAllister having a big second half 11 points all since the break those three threes really got the Run started for the Citadel at the beginning of the half as well and those three threes they changed the way Clemson has to defend you know it makes them have to spread out more stay out more with Shooters now it opens up those driving lanes and allows them to get to the rim and then try to get fouled get to the free throw line Music threes of a third free throw of color Applause and hes perfect on each of them 13 points in the game for the freshman at a Spanish Fort high in Alabama between Birmingham and Huntsville Music Applause Music Fling by angler and a foul and Clark a look of exasperation but they didnt call it on him they called it on his teammate Elijah Morgan Applause Music so were gonna get this back cut right here another great example of Ian schifflins ability to pass from the top of the key but its a oneonone so the Tigers go back to the free throw line next fouls The Double balliness with eight minutes to go nine point game Clemsons not out of the woods yet Music first points of the second half for Chase Hunter Applause the damage at various points in half number one including that three beat the buzzer the Tigers took a 14point lead into the locker room foreign Applause he went to Westlake High his younger brother Dylan finished up his high school career at a different School Sunrise Christian in the Atlanta area one of the best prep schools in the country they always produce really high level players at Sunrise I can ask showing you a teardrop running 5657 Citadel just hanging around and again you see the nine point deficit but the way they shoot threes is not all that safe Tyson down low has the size on England and said kicks it out Hemingway he tries the runner with success found some space and able to get downhill thats a big basket for Clemson Music Brad Brownell will use the timeout so so much of it Pete in a game like this its Citadel Clemson Clemson has won 16 in a row as the game gets under eight minutes and its a single digit game you know the pressure all shifts to Clemson it shifts to the home team particularly when youre dealing with a team like the Citadel who has shown they can spread the floor make threes in transition so the biggest thing coach Brownell is talking about right now first of all we got to play without fouling theyre fouling too much you got to stay home with Shooters be solid for the full 30 second shot clock finish the possession so they can get back in transition they havent been able to get in transition as much in the second half thus they havent been able to score it as well you were on the Citadel staff when Clemson came down to play in McAllister field house that was a brad Brownell team I want to say Oliver Finnell also brought a team down there but I could be wrong yeah I remember the Brad Brownell game down there several years ago Citadel team was coached by Chuck frisell the son of legendary coach Lefty drizelle there was so much anticipation for that game with the Tigers coming on campus that was a great time the cadets showed up as they always do for big games like that didnt turn out well for the Citadel but it was a fun night in the low country and it was great and of course a bunch of Clemson folks down that way appreciated the Tigers have played in the Charleston classic I think Im thinking of a game when Oliver is coaching played Charleston Southern in the North Charleston Coliseum on a Saturday night many years ago thats right fun too after the Bulldogs got the offensive rebound McAllister gets him another no guilt out of the Iowa Transfer and why not 93 made in the game for the Bulldogs ashes 16 again an offensive rebound honors Tyson with the offensive foul a look of disbelief as he speaks to the official nearby Applause Music and a back trailing by eight Music Applause this is the hard part when youre guarding the Citadel its a long three leads to a long rebound gotta go find the shooter Austin Ash gets a second one hes able to knock that one down Ash has made five of their nine from Beyond The Arc and now the officials are going to come to the monitor to determine if there was a flagrant nature if it was it was inadvertent all Hunter Tyson looked like he was trying to do was positioned to make a pass and we will take a look along with the officiating crew as Tyson picks up the personal foul Music and defended by Dylan Engler I think Engler would be the first one to tell you there was nothing flagrant about it all Hunter Tyson was trying to do was swing the ball so he could make a pass to look for a cutter Joe Builders okay yeah whenever I saw it in real time I didnt think there was very much contact obviously on the replay there was any contact to the head or neck area its going to be a flagrant so itll be a flagrant one said I will get two two shots down eight and then theyre gonna get the basketball so 6 41 to go theyve got a chance to cut this to a two possession game with the basketball Music and so as I said you know under eight minutes to go uh first first game back for Ed Conroy back at the Citadel where you had so much success not just as a coach but as a Cadet and as a core Squad athlete first game they played well and uh theyre going to be a tough out in the Southern Conference down near the bottom but in a conference that as we mentioned Furman picked to win it dont sleep on the Samford Bulldogs thats a talented team Chattanooga Wofford among others who will be heard from in that conference but Citadel they were a tough team to play when Digger Balkan was there because the pace they played at and the fact he had to get out on the wing and defend so often yeah Duggar Balcom former head coach at the Citadel did an outstanding job just a really good man Im very grateful to to dugar and what hes done for me in my career obviously had the incident at Duke last season when he collapsed during a game and an assistant Jack Castleberry had to finish the game for him but just a really good man Music player control foul so nothing more so they didnt go with the flagrant thanks to Nick heater one of our officials for telling us that um Duggar that night it was tragic but fortunately he was okay thank you sir Citadel made 18 threes in Cameron Indoor Stadium Duke still won decisively but they did their thing as far as three pointers go well Im sure coach Balkan is watching tonight proud of uh of the Citadel they really played well that night even after he uh he had to leave Morgan kicks it on the wing angler with a nice little move and Clark couldnt find the handle still plenty of time for the Bulldog Clark right back at it reversing cant cant get the roll boy that could have been significant would have made it a two possession ball game sure could we had a Baseline Drive dropped it down Stephen Clark just couldnt finish it Music beetle the tigers are hoping throws his game this year nasty spill by Clark actually landed on the leg of beetle that might have helped break his fall but hes slow to get up other end Ash they were playing four on five and now a stop and play as Stephen Clark is still on one knee on the other end of the floor I think it was fortunate that he landed somewhat on the body of beetle and that that broke a good part of the fall or else his head would have hit hard sure would you know Josh Beadle driving that to his right the lefthanded guard tries to go back up with his left big Collision anytime the Tigers have driven the basketball to the paint there is at least one if not two set of those guys waiting for them tour comes back on the floor McAllister will have to sit for a moment Im sorry uh Clark left to sit for a moment I believe Applause so Josh beetles are really Dynamic driver he starts it to his left his strong hand spins back got to be able to finish that with his right hand got to be able to go off hand right there not going to be able to scoop that underneath in the ACC and finish that Park able to stay out there but you see how he landed on part of the body of beetle and that was very fortunate and fortunate the beetle wasnt hurting anyway on that play too shifflin Hunter Tyson Tigers trying to get something going offensively once again Bulldogs within eight Applause Hunter no look schifflin with authority Chase Hunter just continues to do that over and over again he gets in the lane plays off two feet drops it down to schifflin plays it in Tigers lead by 10 Applause getting as many minutes in a game as he has in his collegiate career the foul on beat him so youve coached in a variety of leagues you were a player in the late 90s at Clemson and the ACC you coached in the Big South the socon the colonial the SEC as we take a look at this move Inside by schifflin yeah Chase Hunter has been outstanding you know and Ian schifflin is well schooled and just playing right there on the Baseline and that dunker spot have your hands ready Chase Hunter just keeps serving it up to him five assists in the game for Hunter the senior as Durr hits the first free throw we always hear about physical play in the power conferences Applause doesnt seem to be more physical having been at Georgia recently watching SEC because I watch a lot of the Southern Conference and I see a bunch of physical guys going at it in that League yeah I I think its physical everywhere you know theyve tried to clean it up a little bit more on the perimeter with the hand contact but um these are the biggest strongest athletes that weve ever had playing basketball and theres a lot of contact around the rim in every League trying to hold their own physically spin move Hemingway rejection Stephen Clark averaged 24 blocks per game a season ago thats something hes been very good at in his time at the Citadel Maynard quick three attempt Im gonna go for him heres beetle Music schifflin from outside boy wouldnt that have been something on his careerhigh night of 18 points adding in three more Applause Clark will try it from Long Range Stephen Clark with a trade and it is a sixpoint game Bulldogs have cut it to a two possession deficit transition basketball you better find where the Citadel guys are hard picking up his scoring 11 in the game Tyson nice move forces it Hunter Tyson 19 points hes closing in on his career high at 21 against wake a couple of Seasons back Applause Dave Maynard the Colgate transfer second season in the Bulldog program again launching a three again missing badly and a foul underneath take a timeout come back to Little John Music to each shoulder and then running the floor being able to catch and finish in transition and then when he can step out and hit the top of the key three like that when PJ Hall does come back for the Tigers it gives him another scoring threat hes really played well tonight and hes got to thank Chase Hunter a lot for that chase has done an outstanding job of driving it playing up two feet finding Ian getting easy baskets at The Rim little dude we know when we talked about schifflin in our open that he not only got a clear high in points but would have the best game so far of his Clemson career with a double double 18 points 13 boards and in talking about it during the timeout the recipient of many of those passes from Chase Hunter I dont know what I like more tonight Chase Hunter the scorer with 21 so far or the distributor with five assists zero turnovers very efficient night for Hunter the senior and schifflin the Tigers sophomore both out of the Atlanta area shipler might have gotten away with a couple of crow hops there like an outfielder in baseball gets the offensive rebound Tigers trying to add to this lead add some insurance Galloway the man to do that back up by 10 so the Tigers come out of the timeout post Chase Hunter get an offensive rebound at least to a layup much needed Bart trying to score when his team needs it cant get the Finish battle inside Hunter Tyson doing a good job Chase Hunter pretty move he blew right by the defender of McAllister thats a great example of what we talked about earlier he was able to get in transition after a miss Applause Clark looking to back in on schifflin Applause and he fronts him well Stephen Clark building on his Knight hes got 13 turned to his left shoulder got to a spot jump hook foreign not going away 10point game theyll have a lot to grade on their film I think Ed Conroe will be happy with much of what hes seen this evening youve also got to factor in theyre going against the team that has athleticism they simply dont possess at this point in their program no absolutely its a great starting point for Coach Conroy in the Citadel Hemingway that might be the dagger Alex Hemingway knocking down another three his second of the night big shot by Alex under two to play Ash working inside Galloway defends Tyson anticipating nearly knocked it away from McAllister Clark from the corner shuffling got out to defend timeout called by Conroy back to a ninepoint game with 143 remaining so so much of it late game like that youve got to know time and score got to stay out with Shooters and Ians a little bit late closing out to Stephen Clark and leads to a mate three so now were going to be in a situation where Clemsons got to take it full length up nine that stage of the game where Brad Brownell is preaching efficiency at least hes about to is he gets back in the Huddle Tigers doing a good job really good job on the offensive glass this evening absolutely and Ian schifflin has been such a huge part of that creating extra possessions Music one of the funny things Pete uh were sitting right beside the Citadel bench at one point Ed Conroy picked up my pin and a stat sheet encircled Ians offensive rebounds and handed the Sheep back to me and as you said he knows they cant simulate that size but these games are going to make them better and theyre still in it you know three possession game then at 43 to go Citadel doesnt have a timeout Clemson has one and so theyre talking about all those situational things right now as they come out of the timeout this is great preparation for the Citadel and for their team for those close games in the Southern Conference and Pete I want to make sure I mention Mike capacio the athletic director at the Citadel hes done an outstanding job building that football program giving coach Conroy a chance to come back and rebuild this basketball program and Tony skull their baseball coach does an outstanding job but Mike capacio is as good as anybody in the business officials reviewing as to whether or not Hemingways foot was on the line so thatll continue and Mike Posse doing a fine job and you mentioned Tonys school and at Conroy both Citadel alums now working back at their alma mater and skull was on that College World Series team in 1990 for the Bulldogs so he went out to Omaha of course at Conroy very good career and also very good run the first time as a head coach delivering one of their three 20win seasons in Citadel program history theyre one of the four teams thats been part of NCAA division one since the tournament came about in the late 1930s that has not made the big dance came real close under Les Robinson about 40 years ago Saint Francis of New York William and Mary and army are the other three and Ed Conroy trying to get the Breakthrough up until a few years ago Northwestern was part of that group they were as something that having been a part of the Citadel program that you know we always talked about it every year you want to be the group thats going to be the one that breaks that through and its going to happen one day by the way Second Chance points are reasonably even in the game but the Tigers do have a 135 advantage on the offensive glass and Clemson coming out of the last time out had scored seven Second Chance points big reason why they still have a reasonably comfortable lead here in the late stations coming up on a buck and a half to go in regulation Applause all right I guess hes trying to milk some clock Chase Hunter defend it out High by still in angler Hunter had it deflected to the right man its all going in shufflings way in the first game of his sophomore campaign those two have been really good together tonight Ian schifflin and Chase Hunter thats something that coach Brownell and the Tigers will be able to build on for sure as they get ready to go to Columbia on Friday 20 points 14 boards for schifflin foreign ER tigers and double figures Hunter leads all scorers with 23 Clark has 16 to lead the Bulldogs Applause Tigers vow rebounded The Citadel by 12 nice job reaching in that time trying to create the turnover by angler Tyson almost made the three to beat the buzzer and schifflin cant save it with 334 to go sometimes it just stall goes your way when you do the right things like Ian schifflin has done yeah its a great ball string right here for Chase Hunter and those two have really been able to connect tonight another great roll and die pretty sure that ball was deflected to him but hunter has given the assist on the play Tigers just going to dribble out the final seconds of this ball game and the Clemson Tigers will make it 17 straight wins in the series hit the Citadel Bulldogs credit though they trailed by nearly 20 points early in the second half got as close as six down the stretch Clemson Tigers will open up the 2022 and 23 season with an 8069 Victory is Ed Conroy and Brad Brownell talk about things as this game comes to an end great start for both teams uh therell be a ton of things on film that they can take away from it as they get ready to move on to the next one Clemson team with a home win to start now the Rivalry game awaits on Friday night in Columbia its been a whole lot of fun working alongside JD Powell and on
