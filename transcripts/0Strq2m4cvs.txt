these two collide here on the last day of January and a series that we told you has been ultra competitive since Mike young took over at Virginia Tech hes now in his fourth season Jim larenega said to us today at shoot around theyre not just close games theyre one possession games every time for us its a good thing I get this sense that neither one of these coaches like how it has gone down to the wire but I would expect the same tonight as well both these teams match up evenly North Shadow Mirror wins the tip back to Nigel pack and Miami has it for the first time its 16 and five overall seven and four we showed you in the ACC thats tied for fifth coming off a threepoint loss on the road at Pitt and the first Miss from Wooga Poplar and now Virginia Tech with it for the first time once again the Freshman MJ Collins starts yet again no Darius Maddox we send him our best out for a second straight game due to a family matter and not with the team and theres Grant fazzilli going to work and a chance at three early on for a guy whos been really good these last two wins for the Hokies beautiful pick and roll uh you cant do it any better right here Sean Padula comes off nice little dump off pass and we talked about the silly in the open hes a guy that scores on all three levels you have to honor him popping out that time he rolled to the basket beautiful pass by pagula excellent offense early by Virginia Tech so more of the same from Grant bazilli yesterday named ACC player of the week the Wright State transfer 24 against Duke 25 against Syracuse Mike young told us to shoot around today he is playing great as you check out the Miami starters Isaiah Wong the top scorer Jordan Miller a hair behind him and packed as you said has logo rage Miller on the Baseline and the left he scores well we give a lot of recognition to pack and Isaiah Wong but I feel like Jordan Miller hes a guy thats under the radar that time scoring with the left he is a pretty much a three level score and I love his ability uh to create matchup problems for opposing teams shot clock below 10 theres Sean Padula top scorer for the Hokies and he walks with it against a Miami trap hey we mentioned Darius Maddox we want to send him our best back home in Maryland we said for a second straight game and Mike young said to us today we think well have him back very soon but he said its way more important than him playing against the Miami Hurricanes to be with his family bigger than basketball and credit Mike young and staff worrying about that young mans wellbeing as opposed to the game but take a look again were seeing early on of some great pick and roll offense by both teams and back to my comment about Miller thats a great a read off the pick Applause that he stepped up and nearly swiped it from Justin Motz who pivots in the post Collins cuts and finishes great pass out of the double team Justin mutts one of those guys that does a little bit of everything for Virginia Tech Miami was a team that will double into post so Virginia Techs gonna have to be very good out of the double teams that time much makes a nice little pass that led to a layup he was playing Syracuse over the weekend so of course he threatened to triple double had one of them last year omir on the glass and a stick back off his offensive rebound if you have not seen this young man play he is one of the best rebounders in college Jim learonega said his pursuit of the ball on the offensive or defensive glass is relentless so is Isaiah Wong who stripped Collins in Wong hoists cant hit Padula trying to get it around Nigel pack instead Poplar too strong in the midrange a little pick and roll defense going to be key for both of these teams they like to run a lot of screen actions and again right there no hedge by the big and all these guards on both sides are very good that time Sean Padula beautiful drive to the basket itll be a leading scorer for Virginia Tech Sean Padula the sophomore from Oklahoma who dealt with foul trouble against Syracuse over the weekend only played 17 minutes and only scored six points as Miller turns it over for the Keynes the Hokies push and its last touched by omir and stays with the Hokies yeah good job that time by omir just getting his hands up didnt really see where the ball was saw the big beat him I think it was basily but just got his hands up just to break up what looked like it was going to be a wide open too good cut by Couture and he finishes through the contacts before out of bounds underneath look at this right here you cant do it any better look at the curl cut by Couture pass on Point again by Padula and both these teams two of the better Coach offensive teams in college basketball you cant do it any better on the curl cut there again ball screen defense and then also pinned down a screen defense is going to be key because these teams both run a lot of screen actions with the ball or also off the ball as well too and you know as an opposing coach how much you have to prepare for when youre going up against Mike young because the Playbook is voluminous Applause pack and it batted Away by Petula and a takeaway for Virginia Tech but to a lot the hesitation the Hokies moving Padula jacks hits they talked about Nigel pack having logo range Sean Purdue has got logo range and one of the quicker releases if youre not there on the catch and close out with your hands down uh he is going to make you pay one of the better Shooters uh in college five shots five makes for the Hokies Miller stopped in the lane for two this is similar to the start that Miami had on the road versus Pitt it was Jordan Miller in that first half that created a lot of problems for Pitt I think they continue to go to him he is a difficult matchup for many fours but silly drills one and the hot shooting start continues for the Hokies last two games but silly 24 and 25 points he has become a matchup problem he goes straight up but commits a foul on Isaiah Wong that will put Wong at the line when we come back well on Saturday it was 26 assists on 32 buckets for the Hokies five dimes on six makes here early on on the road to Coral Gables its easy to bundle your home and car insurance at progressivecom couple of seasons ago Hunter Couture at the end of regulation forcing overtime for the Hokies and then last year in Blacksburg Charlie Moore half court buzzer beating winner and yeah that is how this series is gone it has and both these coaches laughed when we talked to him about these close games and I think for us obviously as fans watching and calling these games theyre exciting both coaches made a joke at the end though uh we hope it doesnt come down to that but certainly it has been entertaining all of their matchups that Hunter Couture shot Mike young admitted to us today he said we set the most illegal screen you could possibly set and on top of that Miami fans will point out and Mike young did admit Hunter Couture had stepped out of bounds we didnt need to remind Jim laronega oh no he got a chuckle out of that one but certainly I think uh closing out game is going to be key for both of these teams oh nice move by Jordan Miller hes up to a strong start with a half dozen one of the most underrated uh players uh in the ACC uh he is a guy as you can see right there can finish with anybody I love his defense and I think hes a guy that they continue uh to run their offense to right here runs the floor well a nice little hesitation and then finish uh thats a big time move uh by Jordan Miller 15 points five rebounds two assists all of that on 54 shooting but the George Mason transfer second year with the canes Mike young agreed with us earlier today hes playing out an allconference level well thats how active Miami is in the passing Lanes this is something Mike young talked about we have to be strong with the ball strong D on MJ Collins Keynes run theres Juan matched up with mutts long spinning and hes fouled by mutts and well go to the freethrow line well Jim larenago is lamenting some of the late game execution from his group Saturday thats a game that that you call that Pittsburgh yeah it really is but you look at his numbers they dont like Hall of Fame coach one of the best in the business his numbers I I think the career wins uh yes thats great but for me whats been impressive his Player Development Ive seen some of these guys I go back to Shane Larkin turned him into an all ACC uh type player uh NBA draft pick the job that he has done with Isaiah Wong look when you talk about great coaches I think its how they get their players to improve year over year he is one of the best in the business at doing that got this group off to the great start through the end of December they began 40 in ACC action they have dropped for their last seven so theyre trying to avoid a slide coming off that loss over the weekend yeah big game for both these teams uh Virginia Tech resume building uh but for Miami as you said theyre looking to stop this little losing streak Bensley Joseph with a good defense for Miami and then Wong lost it Padula picks it and pushes both teams very active in the passing Lanes kickball by Anthony Walker we asked Mike young whats the difference he had the seven game losing streak but then those backtoback wins Duke and Syracuse he said he started playing good basketball and not looking like a bunch of idiots always entertaining speaking to both these coaches Mike young love his or really is this Candor and again on another guy records numbers do not lie consistently in the NCAA tournament and you know look this Virginia Tech Team one of those teams that just they can beat you in so many ways really sound defensively but for me theyre spacing and when you watch them run offense as again I jinx them right there they turn it over as Im talking about their offense but theyre one of the better offensive teams but Mike young was concerned about this right here Miami again theyre very active in the passing Lanes Harland Beverly finished it off off the turnover its an 80 Miami run Applause dribble handoff for MJ Collins who backs it out amid a trap mutt skips Padula pulls up yes and he is off to a very fine start textbook skip it and then a head fake thats a great job of Patience by Padula he could have easily settled for that three one two pullup jumper and hes got some of the best footwork setting up for his catch and shoots that time though off the bounce seven early ones for the point guard for Virginia Tech Wong for three Applause and off the turnover on the inbounds its Bensley Joseph getting two more for the canes handling Miamis pressure but also going to be key in this one and now mutts turns it over Joseph pushes wall place it in Im gonna sound like a broken record anytime you play against Miami you cannot be careless with the ball theyre just going to try to get deflections or tip the ball away from you if you lose concentration for one of the most surehanded teams offensively in the country its nearly a seven turnover pokies have six of them Miamis on a 152 run Lynn kid goes spinning for two and a street stopper for the Hokies I like that by kid again dont mess around with it grown man move uh body on body and then take the hit finish through contact much needed bucket for Virginia Tech fastpaced high scoring start to this one the first nine minutes in Coral Gables Millers matched up with the always excellent Defender Justin mutts Miller went to work Walker on the follow draws a foul now how about the defense you mentioned for Miami they have forced six Virginia Tech turnovers Harland Beverly off the steal and layin defensley Josephs been involved as well for the Kings in there five of the seven games away from Blacksburg and four of the games without this guy hunter Couture with the fractured elbow and I think thats the big one the four games without Hunter Couture theyre a different team without him in there I think the biggest thing defensively uh he was on Joseph Gerard most of the game in that Syracuse win and look Joseph Gerard is one of the better scorers not just in the ACC but in college basketball and Hunter Couture made life difficult for him in that game I think held him below double digits for that one so I think yes offensively hes good but on the defensive end as well too hes one of their better onball Defenders Mike young recently asked Hunter Couture how hes feeling Hunter said 80 85 percent Mike young said to us today that he told them Ill take you at 25 we chatted with Hunter after shoot around he said sometimes just the unnaturalness of of how his arm gets bent that causes pain running off the screens and Mike young said hes going to run off about 957 screens defending Isaiah Wong today they know by the way for the visual he had ice all over his arm probably about four or five packs just on that elbow piece so hes just gutting it out for this Virginia Tech Team hes just too important and thats twice now though a kid and the paint taking his time and then showing off nice touch that time nice little jump hook with whats on the bench kids got the Hokies within three Wong has an early nine gets it back from omir and there is Couture one of the great perimeter defenders in the ACC draped on him Beverly kicks Joseph Rises and hits and what a start for Bentley Joseph Off the Bench Mike young said you know hey I know you guys want to talk about a Wong and Nigel pack but Joseph is an X Factor for them and hes absolutely right playing really well but a Virginia Tech will make you pay if you do not there on the catch with their threepoint Shooters uh its almost automatic great spacing and ball movement Again by Virginia Tech Coutures got six Hokies 10 of 13 from the floor the only issue offensively is those half dozen turnovers omir over the top a kid for two Applause Music defense might be optional although I may say that jokingly uh those are contested shots uh both these teams though right now are playing at a high level and making some difficult shots these teams are combined 21 of 29 a bazilly miss and omir skies for the rebound thats a break though for Miami bazilly came off pretty clean off that pin down Wong speaking of tough shot makers Applause Music kid wants it hes got the height advantage on six foot seven North Shadow Mirror beautiful drop step to the Baseline footwork really impressive and then the patience you have to stay home if youre in Miami again they have four Shooters out on the perimeter so if you go and help theyre going to make you pay and I think thats a matchup theyre going to Ill continue to go to kid Force Miami to make a decision because every time hes touched it he has scored he was making the second half of the win over Duke last Monday and now Beverly travels with it as he lost his footing and it goes back to the Hokies down three again this is great patience no help coming for Miami the spacing though I think thats what makes it uh so important for Virginia Tech allowing their big that time kid to operate they have great floor spacing and you cant help because again theyre such a good threepoint shooting team excellent offense uh by Virginia Tech Justin Muntz returns and you saw Malaysia Poteet the 265 pound rice transfer enter in the front Court as well for Mike Young watch how Miami Hedges on the ball screen so they do a good job there forwards and Biggs a hedging on any ball screens Miller showed there on Padula shot clock below 10 Padula hits what a start for Sean Padula hes got an early 10 if you lock light guards that can make difficult contested shots youre at the right Channel John Padula my goodness now thats not bad defense thats a guy that just size them up crossed them up and then raised up over him from Deep oh mere just Burrows his way to the cup Music Collins on the blowby the dump off and Poteet finishes Applause hes got a chance at a threepoint play when we come back and if you like offense this is the spot to be here in Coral Gables how confident is Sean Padula and rightly so hes got 10 and nor Chad omir for the canes good one going from the watsco center due to the Pavilion in Oxford for Oscar shibway and Kentucky taking on Ole Miss gotta love a good fat head especially at this time of the year we are close to February which means we are close to March Malcolm Huckabee best time of the year you got a lot of stuff going on a lot of options and we got ourselves a pretty good game right here as you take a look at the latest from our guy Joey bracketts huge game for Virginia Tech uh this would be a huge Resume Builder for them on the road against the top 25 team in Miami and certainly as weve talked about with Miami theyre looking to stop this losing skid that they have and again both these teams how closely contested they played over really the last three or four seasons we expect this one to go down to the wire late game and second half execution I think going to be key in this one Miller too strong yeah the Hokies looking for what would be their first road win of the season and of course this represents a chance at a quad one win which is valuable currency come the end of the year medulla Miss run down by Morgan Poplar shielding from Couture and up top for Miller beautiful play by Wooga Poplar under control and then had his head up beautiful Live pass excellent transition offense by Miami key for Virginia Tech Mike young said this look our transition defense is going to have to be good against Miami Couture has to roll off the rim hope hes doing a good job here to get back and set up man Nigel packs pass was too tall for wogga Poplar and this right here again young players take note head up the whole time you can see uh whats out there in front of you nice little lead uh alleyoop pass again Miami one of the better teams in the ACC pushing the pace off of Misses or turnovers they do a good job in their transaction transition offense butts backing down Miller spinning into a double good feed for Poteet who draws the foul and Jim larenega disagrees yeah Jim learonega is hot on the sideline he felt like his guy was standing straight up lets see again great patience nice pass by mutts yeah from that angle right there now it looks like Norse that omir was straight up and he is so strong oh mirror you hit him youre gonna bounce but it looked like he was standing straight up I think uh Jim larenega might have a pretty good argument right there on that one but again we were blocked from our angle and these referees one of the best crews out there in pretty good position but Jim larenegger still having a friendly conversation I would say with the referee because its two on omir and hes their best big and its a team that doesnt have a lot of sides to begin with omirs undersized a guy they have spent time with this year Watching all the fouls he commits with him on video after the fact and trying to eliminate one or two dumb ones and how about this Padula forces a turnover on the inbounds at this end of the floor and Isaiah Wong says my bad just careless with the ball right there and back to your point about uh Omer being out of the game look early on uh Virginia Tech has exploited some matchups in the paint with omir out Im going right back down low into the post if you get an opportunity starts driving at the Freshman AJ Casey whistled for a foul and thats key the blockout and their loss to Pitt as you take a look at facility going down uh Justin Muntz over the back but that was problematic for Miami on the road and pit pit had 17 Second Chance points they had issues with their defensive rebounding something Jim larenega harp all uh this morning in their shoot around said look we must rebound against Virginia Tech limit any second chance opportunities two fouls on mutts Mike young keeps him in the game Joseph driving right past Padula Applause and now Roger Ayers will head over to the monitor I think hes just warning both coaches and both teams Im not sure what hes going to look at but something might have happened in between the play yeah lets lets see they might be throwing a fan out of the Arena now a couple plays prior to that there was a pretty vocal fan who barked something very uh perhaps ill intention shall we say toward the officiating crew after the foul on North Shadow Mirror so a Miami fan is being escorted out and again the cops are coming over here right now listen good job by the officiating crew theyre not messing around and that to me I think you have to in this day and age I dont care whether its players coaches fans if you see something getting out of hand knock it off right away and if you feel like its something thats going to continue get them up out of here really no place for it whatsoever and I dont blame them in that situation you got kids here in the stands no need for it whatsoever of that type of stuff going on Hunter Couture gets the friendly roll and Powers the Hokies back up by one well back to the basketball and Im not sure either team have they missed and this one I feel like it I mean my goodness were seeing some high level offense we knew coming into this both teams are very good offensively but early on in this first half these teams are executing at a high level Miller was shut off heres Casey he needs somewhere to go with the shot clock winding down its Wong oh out of the corner how many times have we seen Isaiah Wong do that well the difference between a good player and then a Next Level player making contested shots Isaiah Wong uh one of the best at making a contested threes or twos had 11 lead changes in this first half brazili carving out space missed it with the left hand Applause Miller attacks back out Joseph way off Target saved by Casey long rescues it back to Casey shot clock reset it shouldnt have it went all the way back to 30 off the air ball from Joseph so we will take a timeout with less than four to go in this first half Isaiah Wong 12 points no three tougher than that one for the explosive high octane guard for the canes loved seeing how early he got onto the floor today coming off late game scenarios where he had some turnovers and some missed shots that cost Miami down the stretch I call that game the pit game on the road he felt like he led his team down but youre right out here an hour before his team got out here putting shots up and working on some of his pullup games that hes one of the best at thats what the great ones do get here early first ones in the gym last ones to leave thats why Isaiah Wong is a guy thats one of the best in college hes got a gamehigh 12 Miami by two on Virginia Tech here in Coral Gables late first half Malcolm Huckabee Mike Monaco our entire crew with you Padula searching for space and he throws it right to wall runs with Miller long is blocked by bazilly great recovery and transition d by facility this right here against Isaiah Wong breaking up looked like theres going to be a deuce cant do it any better at that time still though Miami up two well be right back tonight why dont you ask him youre right big moments call for Big Crunch he said yes thats you crunching the day ready go I dont like to spend a ton of time shopping but I like to look good for me Poshmark makes that so easy and whenever I get tired of something I just relist it back on Poshmark its honestly a little addicting making some money I can spend keep my wardrobe fresh Music start of our doubleheader on ESPNU we will get you to the Big 12 later on really important game in the ACC for both these teams and Isaiah Wong keeps cooking hes up to 14 ball screen coverage again off of a curl pinned down or out of bounds or a guy coming off with the ball off the bounce you have to do a good job against Miami they run so many screens for their guards and wings and long runs off so many of those screens but zilly the roll man he missed another one in tight two of six shooting for Grant vasili Miller going off the bounce on bazilly threw him a couple of fakes and gets the roll I mean he threw about four up and unders in that one move right there great patience and footwork and Jordan Miller uh continues to play at a high level he is such a difficult matchup for opposing fours patulla adjusting and finishing how good is Sean Padula he is a difficult matchup Shifty little heavy and then right there the Finish Big Time touch off the glass hey Thursday night were featuring a Primetime Pac12 matchup on ESPN in the app will Richardson and the Ducks theyve won four of five theyre at the McHale Center in Tucson and take on the fifth ranked Wildcats two of the top teams in the conference coverage starts 10 30 Eastern 7 30 Pacific threepoint game Padula snaps it John Camden returns replaces Lynn Kidd remember nor Chad omear still out on the Miami bench with his two fouls AJ Casey The Freshman getting a lot more run Camden clears the Wong Miss and thats pretty good uh individual defense that time by the freshman Couture trying to shake a poplar Vasily drives on Miller met a double good hands by Casey and Vasily sticks with it and Mike I think thats something Virginia Tech needs to continue to exploit you talked about it Omer is on the bench I think theyre going to have a size Advantage with facility no need to settle for jumpers let him use his size get into the paint Force Miami to either double or hes going to get some high quality looks one drives on Collins Applause 16 in the half for Isaiah Wong with less than a minute to go until the break lets see how Virginia Tech counters again I go back down low to basily Ill let him get isolated on the wing or in the post I got him on the Block Couture instead for two and that works pretty well also yeah Jim Lear calling for a pushoff with the refs uh but uh no stopping Couture right there thats just a big time bully move right there got the player off balance and then was able to raise up this right here again Jim layer calling for a pushoff footwork and body control uh by Couture again might have got it out a little bit still though again this game has been evenly called and theyve been consistent with the whistle thats a big time to step back by Hunter Couture a guy that is playing at about 85 percent coming off the injury and Mike young said Ill take him at 35 percent he is just a warrior so important to what they want to do uh offensively and defensively attacked Hunter earlier today told us the hardest thing about sitting on the bench for those four games was not just being unable to contribute but the fact that they were all close losses felt like he could have made a difference and he saw his guys hurting out there and a streak that for Hokies fans you were just waiting for it to end because they knew that this team a whole lot better than that slide would indicate and now with him back theyve gotten back to the team you expect from Virginia Tech I I think hes one of the most underrated guards in the ACC again last year with Kevin Luma yes he got a lot of attention rightfully so but for me a hunter Couture is one of those guys Swiss army knife can do a little bit of everything three and a half second Difference game and shot clocks heres Juan got Collins In The Air short bazilly the rebound and gets it off nearly got it to go and it sends us to halftime high scoring Miami by one on Virginia Tech at the break 4544 the Keynes the lead on the Hokies well check in with the studio after the break and then back to Coral Gables for second half action we welcome you back to Coral Gables and the watsko center second half on the way after a first half that was eventful and thrilling and high scoring Fast Pace Miami by one on Virginia Tech alongside Malcolm Huckabee Mike Monica with you Hokies start out with mutts missing the jam but getting fouled and going to the line well thats a great set play to start off of the second half both these teams screen well a little cross diagonal screen that time by Virginia Tech and again both teams its so important to communicate on any ball screens or cross screens both these teams do a good job with their spacing but then they run a lot of screens for their wings and guards and so after norchado Mir the big man for Miami who averages 1310 sat for the final 5 45 of the first half with two fouls 10 seconds in he saddled with his third and Jim larenaga keeps him in yeah and thats a big decision for uh coach learonega and staff uh look hes got to be able to be on the court Virginia Tech started taking advantage of some postups uh with Omar out of the game theres Isaiah Wong read those 16 in the first half Jordan Miller had 10 Wugga Poplar tried to break the house omir follows at his fouls whoa they might need to check the screws on this Rim my goodness look a poplar almost ripped it off and then uh old mayor afterwards loosen it up some more a great job by Miami not settling and theyre one of the better offensive teams offensive rebounding teams because of that guy right there so strong thats a big time offensive rebound and putback and its three fouls as well on Virginia Techs Justin mutts who was quiet and scoreless had a couple of turnovers in the first half for Mike Young long picks it from MJ Collins and thats his fourth steal of the game Miller wave it off it is a foul on MJ Collins a blocking foul and the foul on the floor and theyre going to say its not in the act of shooting Jim lehranag is still lobbying for that to be a and one but yeah I think thats right again he had not gone into his shooting motion he was still Gathering himself again we have the luxury of slowing it down but I do think that was the right call Hunter Couture matched up with Wong off the skip for Poplar Miller Mott stays right with him omir underneath two more Jim learonega says his Pursuit Relentless he is relentless well on the offensive glass said It reminds him of Kenneth Faried the Great a former college player and also NBA guy but certainly OMeara guy that can get after it on the offensive glass and then Virginia Tech though still running great offense so what do we got that came onto the court is that a piece of gum not sure what that is maybe part of a PomPom were being told I think so the halftime show I think thats probably what it was oh we got a tight one here though twopoint game uh in favor of Miami its one of the same oh Mira calling for it hes battling with Lynn Kidd ing Poplar swirls it out good rebound Couture and a great block out that time by kid now again he didnt get the rebound but he made sure omir was not able to get his hands on that one double handoff for Padula who had a big first half for the Hokies kid was the last to touch it Applause thats great team defense by Miami again the Hedge comes out hard but the key to that is the rotation on the back end thats Jordan Miller with that Miami versus Pitt only had one offensive rebound tonight against Virginia Tech they have seven mainly this guy right here whoa North Dev Omer doing the Euro Step my goodness weve talked about his strength that time showing off the agility with the Euro and finish with the left hes got 13 three canes in double figures kid wanted it instead bazilly drives adjusted finishes I mean he made that look easy my goodness oh just midair and go and finish Miller from Nigel pack this is back and forth Up Tempo strap in folks we got 17 more minutes of this both these teams almost over 60 percent from the floor Collins quickly attacks had it roll off and theres omir carving out space for a rebound long pushes got stripped and lost it good hands by Padula he leads the Hokies back on the reverse he is so smooth I mean Up and Under reverse on the other side just calmly throws it off the glass with norshad omir uh Trey chasing him down is cooking in the second half hes up to 17 and nine here in the second half when I asked him if theres an NBA guy that he tries to mirror his game afterwards he said Draymond Green he said look I like how he impacts the game with his rebounding defense and doing all the little things honor katore connects from deep is second three and the hot shooting continues in the first half I said it has anybody missed I think its the same in the second my goodness its not bad defense these guys are just hitting uh some tough contested shots long no kid the board Music Applause Vasily to the basket thats a beautiful slip of the screen vasili faked like he was going to come set a ball screen for Couture and because you have to heads hard in Miami he just slipped that screen beautiful read by Hunter Couture offensive foul on Isaiah walk Applause yeah norcato Mir said Draymond Green but he said with a little more scoring hes got plenty of scoring in this one 17 Padulas got oh my God Saturday Carolina Duke for the first time this season Armando bacon Kyle filipowski they might be the two best players in the conference yeah absolutely and uh the Freshman philipowski playing with the little Edge but Armando baycott alls that guy does is average a double double thats just always uh entertaining one of the best rivalries in college basketball I think in all his Sports uh really always fun when those two get together tour got a great look for three out of the timeout for Virginia Tech which leads by one just over five minutes into the second half here in Coral Gables thats a break for Miami thats a clean look for Couture and thats something one that uh Jim Lehrer definitely does not want to give up too many more of those open looks for him coming off really nice ball movement Anthony Walker working on Malaysia Poteet shot clocks at five for Bensley Joseph Walker slipped and finishes through the contacts pinpoint passing Joseph uh you cant thread the needle any better right there give it to the big high all he had to do was catch and then go and finish this is just great offense and recognition body control and concentration on point second foul out of Grant basili and Anthony Walker stamps a threepoint play Applause back and forth we have gone 15 lead changes still 14 minutes remaining hard hedge on Camden moves it for bezilli post entry for Poteet working on Walker potique finishes excellent patience and again back to the spacing for Virginia Tech but you have to stay home again you got four guys out there that can shoot so when you go into the post Virginia Tech Miami always conscious of the threepoint shooting Beverly down the lane Applause both he and Joseph I believe X Factor guys before Jim learonega and their staff but when theyre in the game they dont lose anything when you have well Isaiah Wong and Nigel pack on the bench kickball on brazily and Couture they talked about Virginia Tech going inside when norchado mirror was out Elijah Poteet has given seven points in four minutes and now omir returns some more girth in the front Court once again for Jim laronega rotation for uh Jim larranega and what a luxury he has get his guys a main guy some arrests and not lose much when he goes to his bench good defense as well from potique hes giving good minutes for the Hokies Applause starts to back down Walker but silly with a chance at a threepoint play uh easy to see and why he was player of the week and the ACC we talked about his threepoint shooting this right here that I think he can do a lot of damage right here put him out on the wing and then let him work his way down again Miami chose not to come and help and uh hes a guy we talked about it at the top last two games uh he has been 20 plus cant stamp it Beverly the rebound Applause hes got 14 Couture with 13 for Mike young locked at 61 here in the second half oh mere Zach iron hes only made two career threepointers in three years and uh Jim learonega turned to his bench and again he gives his guys a lot of freedom as you take a look at the deflection but thats probably not where he wants omir doing his damage setting screens at the threepoint line like that thats more like it for nor Chad OMeara and a bump on vasili who gets saddled with the foul on the Baseline thats his third with 12 minutes to go and the student section which has come out and pours here really good turnout but we got ourselves locked and another tight one between these two teams lapped at 61 well be right back Basketball top 15 Showdown Kansas and Iowa State noon Eastern and Ames followed by Auburn Tennessee ranked second in the country then its number one Purdue number 21 Indiana and then we told you about at Cameron North Carolina and Duke 6 30 Eastern and our Saturday showcase a lot of options really though looking forward to that North Carolina Duke one thats always a fun matchup how about though Zach Edie of the year he is having almost unguardable oneonone plenty of college hoops this time of year and Zach Edie is the front runner if not assuredly the national player of the year Bensley Joseph swirls out a triple thats a pretty good look off a nice read by Isaiah Wong Joseph upset that ball went around a couple times and then rimmed out hes played so well hes got increased minutes Nigel pack at his minutes shaved out in the first half as Hunter Couture hits a third three and him and Sean Padula if you watch them come off pin Downs I would hate to try to lock and trail on them if you are not there on the catch they have such a quick release and they do a great job moving without the ball and then curling tight off of screens right up into their jumpers Poplar looks like MJ Collins still down and Roger Ayers is headed over to the scores table he wants to have a look I believe at that left elbow Avoca Poplar Music now I think thats a basketball move now again he got hit and I can tell you uh in my playing days I got hit plenty of time that you hate to see it obviously we hope that young man is okay I think its more the intent if its a basketball move he was trying to do a head fake and then just happened to catch him in the face but again I dont think it was a malicious elbow and again I think its intent and whether or not its a basketball move from the initial right here looks like look he comes to a jump stop jumper head fake and then hes trying to go over yeah again I think thats the explanation right there and I think thats the key intent and then whether or not its a basketball move but Poplar he is trying to go over thats something youll see players work on that move all the time Jump stop and then make a basketball move the same words you use Malcolm Huckabee from Rogers its a basketball player yeah hes a veteran official and again I like they go take a look at it they dont take a lot of time they explain it to the coaches and again its I think the key word is he was in his cylinder and its a basketball move a good job again we got a veteran officiating crew uh dont take a lot of time with it give everybody explanations they may not like to hear it but then lets play on a good job of them not taking too much time on that one and hopefully MJ Collins is all right for the Hokies 11 minutes to go Virginia Tech by one on the road pokies on backtoback wins Miami ranked 23rd in the country off the loss on the road Saturday Miller commits the foul defending mutts and Mike I like that play of by Virginia Tech now mutts again he is a guy thats so unselfish I think sometimes in these games look you want him to be a little bit more selfish if he has a matchup of that he likes try to get him isolated let him go to work see if he can continue to draw some files kid on the Block spinning on omir and that kid walked with it right idea by kid again Omer with three fouls yeah he lifted up that pivot foot right there just ever so slightly but I like the idea though by Virginia Tech go at Omer hes got three fouls hes going to be less aggressive playing defense in the post Joseph calls for the ball screen wants somewhere to go and finds Wong omear on the Block barreling into kid rebound Padula and kid has really done a nice job against omir that time great individual post D hes also done the nice job he hasnt gotten rebounds but hes kept OMeara from going completely crazy on the offensive glass which is so key when you play Miami mutts drives and scores six points for Justin mutts and theyve all come in the second half Wong hasnt scored yet this half and it rolls off the rim weve got a foul on the rebounding action or Chad OMeara was battling on the boards and he is so difficult to keep off the offensive glass again kid for the most part has done a pretty decent job right here Couture again one of the underrated Defenders and the ACC good contest uh but yeah Omer he got his arms around him sometimes thats all you can do with him he is so relentless on the glass he runs into Camden who gets called for a block and when you get a block on North Shadow Mirror it hits different hes six foot seven 248 pounds and we were talking with a strength coach of Miami and again he is their strongest player and I think the key with that one right there he was falling over um before he got there trying to sell that Miller bangs with mutts or rebound Camden Applause neither team is led by more than eight it has been tight the lead has changed hands medulla on courts Camden kept it alive but Poplar the board and thats a break for Miami again they got to do a better job communicating on screens pin Downs for Couture and Padula you have to be there on the catch Joseph off the bounce out Padula does a nice job staying in front Poteet Hedges mutz Picks It Off the Hokies run Padula underneath to mutts patience Padula could have easily jacked that first three right there great patience and get a higher percentage shot of these guards this backcourt of Virginia Tech theyre defending and then in transition theyre making great reads right here Justin mutts with the pass ions by Padula give it back and right now Virginia Tech up five on the road marlets first base coach tight end David and joku in the building Gabby Sanchez Big League AllStar in the majors one of our colleagues here at ESPN and Braxton Barrios boy he was electric theyre all here for a really good one between Virginia Tech and Miami eight minutes to go in the second half Malcolm Huckabee it is not disappointed it has not and a great atmosphere a great crowd here in Miami and its coming down to the wire again great post entry pass though that time Jordan Miller a great seal uh by omir and hes got the greatest set of hands Im surprised football team has not called that young man right there uh he is not going to miss too many things that are thrown at him and joku asked hes got 19 now to lead all scorers Padula drives and turns it over got caught in the air long attacks Poplar moves it patch tied up cannot run your transition offense any better dribble Drive Kick Out Pass and then extra pass that led to a wide open three Poteet is stripped and fouled by Nigel Peck Applause with five points for Miami out of that timeout well its a thing of beauty when Miami is moving the ball uh Jim learonega happy with that ball chains on Saturday afternoon three Eastern they square off with Clemson who Trails right now over on acc Network at Boston College and next Wednesday the Hokies they host BC at 7 Eastern in Blacksburg its going to be an interesting finish to this ACC season a lot of teams uh bunched up at the top half and you got some battles uh down uh in the middle bottom half up the ACC aspote who has really been solid uh for a Virginia Tech and Mike young misses the first free throw he had made his first three hes a good Foust shooter for a big guy 71 percent for his career and he splits a little key in this game really has been Virginia Tech in particular Padula and Couture uh their defense on the wings uh right now Miami shooting 23 percent from the threepoint line theyve only made three uh in this game credit to Wings and guards for Virginia Tech theyve done a nice job contesting and Couture strips Poplar who collides with bazilly and the foul on Miami after some great Virginia Tech defense on the perimeter to your point yeah I mean right on point I mean theyve done a good job individual plays right here again this is just great individual play and then uh Couture comes over help not over helping but gets his hand and forces a turnover and theyve been a really nice job in particular in the second half forcing Miami into some difficult shots and then creating some turnovers it was only the sixth foul on Miami boy how good is Couture hes got to deal with Isaiah Wong Mike young said Id prefer if I didnt play him on Wong because hes so good off the ball as we just saw now hes off Target wide and left the rebound down to Miller pack pulls up for the lead I said it at the tip hes got logo range you have to be with him as soon as he crosses half court uh hes got unlimited range that time a breakdown in transition d by Virginia Tech is one of the best threepoint Shooters in the country turnover Hokies Couture couldnt connect with mutts right here though Nigel pack almost from the Miami logo did not touch the rim and just when I was praising Virginia Techs threepoint field goal defense theres a breakdown in transition he saw the frustration and the reaction of Hunter Couture who knows that much base for Nigel pack is a problem they run him off the screen hits again foreign Applause game we got going on right here Motts in the lane pevenick and scoring a much needed two for the Hokies who have it down to three and Ive said it earlier at times hes really more of a passing big I think at times hes almost too passive uh you like to see him be more aggressive thats a great move by Justin mutts hes got 10 in the second half Miller hanging in the air fivepoint Miami lead five to go and Coral Gables but silly cerse Applause and a timeout Mike Young you cannot ask for a better played offensive game uh right here uh hi Joe pack logo range foot on the Miami logo nothing but the bottom of the net but then on the other side the ACC player of the week Grant facili answers with a three we are in line for another fun finish under five to go in a rocking atmosphere in Coral Gables how good has this one been great offense on both sides Virginia Tech is shooting 66 percent from the floor for the game I mean you would think that uh Miamis not playing defense that has not been the case both these teams shooting at a high level just making some contested shots Sean Padula is hugging Nigel pack searching for space now Wong stops swirls it out and a big rebound Grant fazzilli a nice job again blocking out uh that time mutts although he doesnt get the rebound the key thing when youre going up against omir hes such a good offensive rebound you just want to make sure he doesnt get it Isaiah Wong whistled for a foul defending Hunter Couture thats two on one and seven on Miami so the one and one coming for Hunter Couture a 72 percent freethrow shooter for his career and that was a frustrating foul again I talked about Hunter Couture yes he is one of the better offensive players underrated defensive player to me he is a guy one of the better onball of Defenders hes just a pest we talked about the job he did against Joseph Gerard of Syracuse one of the better scores not just in the ACC but in the country Applause Mike young said that the work they did as a team on Joe Gerard Hunter Couture deserved 75 of that all the credit that he got and hes had to face Isaiah walk here in this one and oh by the way hes at about 85 percent yeah and hes continued to shoot a well from Deep thats what hes done his last two games he is three of six from long range of this one 17 points now Mike Roberts goes over to explain something to Jim larenaga there was some sort of spill in front of the Virginia Tech bench that got wiped up between these free throws and some explanation coming the way of Jim larenaga and in any event it doesnt phase Hunter Couture we are tied at 76 coming up on four to go here at the watsko center Music Miller quick first step blocked by months my goodness a quick First Step by Jordan Miller looked like he had much beat and then mutts out of nowhere what a recovery and block bazilly oh he missed it hes missed a few in close today pack streaks to the basket and Miami leads and Mike thats all set up because hes knocked down two deep threes theyre thinking hes going to pull up little has he and then he gets to the basket heads up play by Nigel Patton all 11 for him since halftime Petula short ball screen coverage lets see how Virginia Tech decides to play ball screens Longs looking for another he goes off the bounce out Couture stays right with him shot clock below 10 for Nigel pack off a screen yes foreign Applause Music Applause here come the case pack wants another oh hes unconscious Music Applause I mean there are heat checks and then there are men on fire Nigel pack unlimited range my goodness this guy is on fire Miami with the eight point lead have all come in the last 507 hes got 17 of the last 19 Miami points and the Kings lead by eight we featured him in the open his last four games 52 percent from the threepoint line 1529 Id say that percentage is going to go up a little bit hes five or six in this game but silly short cant answer and Miamis got it with all the momentum and with that eightpoint lead well obviously a Virginia Tech again uh defending Nigel pack and really some of those were just contested tough shots uh one was a breakdown and Miller turns it over and thats one thing you dont want to do if youre Miami Ford now the only good thing about that its not a live ball turnover allowing Virginia Tech to go on transition youre able to set your D up but certainly you dont want to have lost possessions if youre Miami Sean Petula goes spinning and nearly got it to go he will settle for two free throws you know just back to Nigel pack we asked Jim larenegger today is there any sort of shot with his range that youre uncomfortable with he looked at us like were crazy he said oh gosh no no no absolutely not and the Virginia Tech coaching staff Kevin Giltner who had the the Scout for Miami he said to his team today at shoot around you have to pick up Nigel pack pretty high meaning close to Mid court because he will pull from anywhere well in the tip again I said it hes got a logo range again he hit a couple from the Miami logo you have to pick him up as soon as he crosses a half court and theyve done a good job Miami credit them once he got hot they kept looking for him well actually the job recognizing their guy is on fire omir is fouled by bazzilli so thats four on Grant bazilly with 144 remaining and coming up nine Eastern over on ESPN well take you to Oxford Mississippi for Oscar shibway and Kentucky against Ole Miss now one thing to remember with Miami here down the stretch Saturday against Pitt they led by eight late in that game and pit closed on an 110 run Jim laronegas team led by eight with about 215 to go and lost omir splits I think the key thing I said in that last a possession to turn over by Jordan Miller listen cant turn the ball over that was problematic for them late in that game at Pitt but theyre at home they can illiford turnovers in these possessions but silly had to go in and out omir clears it Applause pokeys looking for a trap long escapes and Poplar backs it out Applause step back too strong mutts the rebound Virginia Tech down seven minute left in the second half mutts kicks Couture moves it Collins spins it out oh Mira the rebound and Petula fouls awesome good looks for the Hokies here in the last couple of minutes you cant ask for a better look if youre Mike young off a ball movement right here in transition they had Miami spaced out excellent extra pass by a Couture and thats a wide open look youll live with that if youre Mike Young right now its going to come down though to Miami for Miami free throws and then obviously handling any pressure or traps of that Virginia Tech throws at them OMeara has missed two in a row now still 45 seconds left foul right in front of the Virginia Tech bench and Jim learonega not happy thats a really poor foul two things stops the clock and puts a very good freethrow shooter on the line and then now gives them a chance but to set their defense up and uh back to your point OMeara that time had a chance to give it up to the guards before he got fouled got to be heads up in that situation get it out of your hands get it into the guys that are probably better presented free throw shooters Couture is good on the first hes four for four at the line here in this one Bentley Joseph perimeter Defender for Miami comes back and replaces Wugga Poplar and I think the other thing Joseph really uh one of their top call handlers as well too so again you know Virginia Techs going to pressure of the key thing now Virginia Tech if theres no safety back uh you dont want to get beat long Miller nearly got Stripped by Padula Now wongo searching for somewhere to go takes it Over the Top Line and Joseph is found hes a 68 freethrow shooter so one of the guys you do Target if youre Virginia Tech and thats a great job of scouting by Virginia Tech they realize pack Isaiah Wong strong free throw shooters trap get the ball out of their hands and then get it in the guy that has a lower percentage again thats a great job of scouting but then also these guys understanding whos out on the court get it out of the good Fritos Shooters hands put somebody that you want at the free throw line on the line sophomore with his first trip to the line tonight and he makes the first its a sixpoint game 33 and a half seconds to go Applause makes both key for Miami in this situation communicate any screens you do not want to file Padula High arcing and he got fouled by pensley Joseph so Sean patula goes to the line for three and hes a fabulous freethrow shooter thats just a breakdown again you have to be able to play deep without fouling lets see if he got him um yeah look its enough comes into his land yes its enough of contact for the refs to have to make a decision should not even come to that very close uh again you dont want to give up a fourpoint play in that situation uh but theres contact and again uh referees are put in a situation you do not want to put them in of this situation lets see closer look yeah I mean again thats a foul that impacts the trajectory and his flight of the ball right there and thats right in front of the referee Applause its an absolute nobrainer entitled to that Landing space Padula has made the first two he is 505 at the line in this one 87 percent for his career hes got it down to five Applause gets all three so its a fourpoint game 263 seconds left vasili goes out with his four fouls Lynn Kidd comes in Miami does have two timeouts if it needs them heres the key right now Virginia Tech okay looks like kids going to go back play safety I just dont want to get beat long and give up a layup they follow Meer very quickly Lynn Kidd sprung to him and fouls the 70 free throw shooter and thats a great job again of Virginia Tech realizing what they want to do well keep Nigel pack Isaiah Wong off the free throw line lets put uh omir back on the free throw line again not as good as good a threetoe shooter as youre back for it he has missed his last two here in the second half the Junior from Nicaragua Arkansas State transfer misses another closing out games again free throws in this one right here and these end of game situations teams again practice these all the time who you want to put on the free throw line now back defensively maker missed for Miami who you cannot foul fivepoint game Petula to the basket and what do we have one official started to signal travel and now they both do traveling is called on Sean Padula great team distance right here again uh you cant do it any better gets beat on the initial and then youve got three guys coming over there yeah you should Shuffle his foot a great job of help side G and right now again nobodys long for Virginia Tech pack in the corner got it free to wall and Padula bumps him goes the sixth Padula turnover in this game and now one and 83 free throw shooters going to the line yeah great job that time breaking the Press but also to taking some clock off thats what you want to do if youre Virginia Tech go for that steal out of the first trap they dont get it Wong extends it a little bit takes off a little bit more time Applause lets see if Miami stays up and gives a little bit of pressure yeah Josephs still up there now keving 10 seconds you just do not want to foul if youre Miami what his blocked by omir Poplar mation now the celebration can start for the Kings what a finish well we talked about the offense uh but it was the defensive stop at the end that put of the finishing touches on this game Omer with the denial of Justin months Big Time block kept it in play and Mike we went back to the beginning of this game we talked about Miamis issues closing out games they did a masterful job offensively but make no mistake about it Nigel pack caught fire late in the second half and then defensively they were sound enough to defend the threepoint line and the paint uh they get a win against a very tough Virginia Tech Team Miami has
