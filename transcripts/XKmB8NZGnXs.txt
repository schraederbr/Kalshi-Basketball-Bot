manipulation Mobility worked trying to get the swelling down decreased pain he went through a big time warmup and he looks good moving out there but this may be a pain tolerance situation but Armando wants to play he promised us hell be good to go and here he is out here ready to go Holly thank you and needless to say Carolina a bubble team and Jay just about everybody thinks they need this one and maybe another one after this to assure themselves of an NCAA tournament I think North Carolina is in must wins territory they have been for quite some time now but this game the Tar Heels have to have they split two with Virginia during the regular season the whos won in Charlottesville Pete Nance whos got the ball didnt play in that game with a back strain Armando baycod barely played left a minute 19 in After Rolling the ankle then Carolina beat Virginia 12 days ago in Chapel Hill so they know they can do it but here comes Virginia again so methodical so poised Great backcourt Clark Beekman Franklin Jaden Gardner a doitall guy what a wonderful fiveyear career hes headed East Carolina and Virginia and again Francisco caporo formerly known as Cafaro who has been a starter every now and again over his years in Charlottesville he gets the start in the place of vanderbloss and in North Carolinas first offensive possession just about a shot clock violation and a turnover and North Carolinas got to try to find ways to score early in the clock try to get out in transition difficult to do against Virginia Applause first going against capro I think bacotts going to have some opportunities the question is is Virginia going to bring a double they like to trap the post post to post and then Carolinas gonna have to play out of it Arman Franklin misses the midrange jumper into baycod the alltime leading rebounder in Carolina history down with his first of the night and already Armando baycott is you know gingerly running up and down the court and in a game like this its not too bad I mean he can handle its going to be a slower Pace game youre not going to speed Virginia up always near the bottom in terms of tempo Gardner a little shoulder contact to create space on Nance and he knocks it down thats his game I mean he is a midrange scorer that has a great first step especially after his shot fake and shot fakes are going to be key tonight for Virginia Kihei Clark has one of the best shot fakes in the ACC caleblove had 22 in the win over Boston College last night and hes got an assist here on a three by leaky black if leaky black can make that shot thats going to loosen some things up you know thats a long way for a Defender to recover because Virginia does a very good job of staying in gaps and protecting the paint you have to knock perimeter shots down to stretch them out three Speakman misses a three at the other end in Virginia not an offensive rebounding team they send three guys back they want to take away transition knocks it away but out of bounds still Carolina ball Huber Davis felt about as good about his team at the offensive end and the defensive end as he has all season they were connected their voices in the Huddle were really good Tony Bennett obviously feeling for vanderplas the broken hand into what he told to seemed like a harmless play at practice yesterday so now not only Francisco capro but also Peyton Shedrick who hasnt played at all Jay the last couple of games hes got to play some significant minutes tonight for Virginia yeah youre going to see some some different players playing longer minutes and is not going to be one player really good read of the defense by Kihei Clark to get that open shot in the corner that was just a little floppy set Defender goes over the top and he Fades to the corner Manson again a concerted effort early by Carolina to get the ball inside while Armando Bay caught in a foul on Catherine lets see how big caparo is hes a half a head taller than Armando baycat and he is a substantial body in there and Kaden Shedrick coming in for Cafaro right now hes not quite as wide but he is a good shot blocker good rim protector and thats going to be key in tonights game Gardner knocks it away Shedrick is a guy who at times in his career Jay looked like he was on the verge of really becoming a big thing but his minutes have pretty much dried up here late in this season well he didnt play at all against Clemson and Louisville the last two games Tony Bennett deciding to shorten his bench good hedge there and again leaky black looking inside Shedrick fronting baycat at the time black should won three already tonight not this time of the rebound down to Kihei Clark yeah I dont know if thats the shot its a shot clearly that leaky black can make but I think North Carolinas settled there but you can see Virginia just packing the paint their their Gap protection their weak side Defenders theyre so good at you know basically the balls of magnet pulling him into the right position a steal by leaky black a member of the ACC all defensive team and in fact the runnerup for defensive player of the year in the conference to respeakman of Virginia Carolina basically going four round one now theyre going to bring bacon out to set a high screen and roll bouncers back to love love has it stripped deflection and a steal in the same possession for respeakman you know some players look he sees Tony Bennett talked about his anticipation with us before the game hes just got a remarkable sense of knowing where hes got to be and what plays got to be made hes like a defensive Wayne Gretzky you know he escaped too not where the puck is but where you think its going to be misses the three look at you with the hockey records yeah I wanted to make you feel a little more comfortable thank you first game of the tournament Applause again here comes the double and a turnover Clark has Beekman with him and Carolina back in transition when that double comes Carolinas got to move you have to give Armando baycat an outlet to pass the ball out if you just stand there its going to be picked off Arman Franklin with a shot fake good drive and draws a foul well not a lot of offense Jay in the early going leaky black responsible for a good chunk of it on one shot well Caleb love if you can get any sort of penetration Caleb love able to turn the corner and draw a Defender then he kicks it back out and look how far Armon Franklin has to recover feels Roy Williams has won a few of these and he is watching the game tonight and like everybody with a vested interest in the Carolina program they know the meaning of this game now Carolina again did beat Virginia less than a couple of weeks ago but if you look at their overall body of worth most people including Joe linardi have them on the outside looking in close but on the outside looking in some people feel they need to win the tournament to get there uh just about everybody though feels they definitely need to win this game and then see where theyre at after that its not like they have bad losses because they dont they just dont have those quality wins other than the one of Virginia that really jump off the page actually yeah when you start looking at the numbers you know their quad one wins which Im not a big fan of the Quad system but thats whats used to evaluate teams and its not this positive but thats what the committee uses to organize their information and what whatever you use to organize thats going to be in the minds of the committee members Turn Around by black left it short and its Virginia ball down by two well talk about Clemson in the second game another team that is looking for a big week here in the Greensboro hoping to solidify an NCAA tournament Clemson and NC State coming up in the second game boy the wolf pack looked good against Virginia Tech last night when the two games that North Carolinas played against Virginia the Tar Heels have been only had four Second Chance points in each game and they were outscored in the paint in the two games by 18 and thats got to change if they want to win this yeah Shedrick tapped it out but into the hands of love so far Virginia has protected the paint expertly North Carolinas not getting anything inside the paint unless they get it into Armando bake on hes got to work to get an angle it feels like a slice to the low post now and getting him on the move I think is a good thing feels like every possession at both ends is going right down to the end here with the shot clock and this one is no exception Davis gets it off and hits seven three heals as soon as the double team came to Armando baycott when he caught it on the left block RJ Davis went on a run to get the ball you cannot just stand at the threepoint line and expect baycot to throw it through two Defenders he can dribble out of it but the perimeter guys have to move and make themselves available and somebodys got to get to the front of the rim too Applause Shedrick off to Franklin and he knocks down the jumper just the second made field goal for Virginia to get it back within two Armon Franklin has really settled in this year after transferring last year from Indiana and at Indiana he shot about 42 percent from three but hes been more efficient this year he knows where the shots are coming from nice kick from love but leaky black will kick it back out to Davis and the heels reset not sure leaky black shouldnt have pulled the trigger on that one so tough to find open shots against Virginia and a held ball the possession arrow will give it back to the whos take a look at RJ Davis here youre going to see him on the right side right there and the double is going to come right away Jayden Garner goes right away all of a sudden hes doubled and this doesnt get stand in there he moves to an open area catches the ball and then he can take on Kihei Clark one on one at the end of the shot clock that was a really smart cut by RJ Davis is still trying to overcome Holly Rowe had an amazing report last night about RJ Daviss mother nickname nickname him weasel right because weasels are ferocious which was news to you it was news to me and to many others even though the weasel is from the mastella genus that also includes the badger and the Wolverine The Mink and the otter I wouldnt have chosen weasel as a ferocious animal she could have gone with Wolverine here he comes honorable mention all ACC RJ Davis averaging about 16 points per game this year DeMarco Dunn is in for Carolina puff Johnson as well and black fouled and will be at the free throw line for the heels when we come back Holly Rowe with much much more on RJ Davis when we come back Id go with mink or polecat some people say the metaverse welcome back to the ACC mens basketball tournament childhood nickname of RJ Davis was weasel because he was a small ferocious little thing he said no I would have given him the nickname Cupcake or something similar hes just the nicest kid ever for crying out loud he has a minions backpack he even related a hilarious story about how when they were kind of down at one point this season he went to the guys and said I we need a word were at Notre Dame its going to be a tough game and when things arent going great we need a word that gets us back on track what word can I say to you and RJ with a straight face looks straight at his coach and said Hakuna Matata and Hubert said I love you thats a great word but thats not going to be the word were using you we dont we need something a little stronger than Hakuna Matata like how about box out Hubert was in uh in great spirits before the game Holly thank you very much and I guess Huberts kids not really Lion King fans growing up because Hubert wasnt intimately familiar with Hakuna Matata and his wonderful a sentiment as that is coach Davis vetoed that for the for the Huddle pep talk yeah its probably not the the right huddle thing but Holly has really given Marlon Perkins a run with the weasel story lets Ive learned a lot about the weasel family I still think Wolverines the right way to go another held ball the arrow gives it back to the heels we are almost nine minutes in Carolina up by four and Armando baycod try to stay warm and loose when he is not in the game so on the bike right now again for those who didnt see in the game last night against BC rolled his left ankle the same one he ruled against Virginia in January not the same one he ruled in the NCAA in the tournament last year but you could see the look on his face when it happened Jay like not again he has had ankle issue after ankle issue but even though hes far from 100 percent hell obviously get back in there and play through it as best he can double team came at Pete Nance he turned away from it but still if Jaden Gardner is able to get a piece of that North Carolina you know this is going to be a slow pace game its really difficult to speed Virginia up but you still have to run your offense with Pace make a pass make a hard cut and try to move that defense and then attack it does it wear down an opponent mentally to play at the Virginia Pace for 40 minutes its not so much the wear down mentally as it its Rhythm disrupting youre used to a game that goes up and down and now all of a sudden the games really slow and so its hard to get rhythm youre used to getting more shots more reps like being in a dentist office for a couple of hours now the Phillips 66 Championship continues Kansas and Iowa State have advanced on to the semis you can see the quarterfinal lineup tonight those games over on ESPN2 and we want to Echo everybody else in the college basketball World sending our best to Bill self whos dealing with a health issue right now Kansas announced a couple of hours to go uh that coach self will not coach at all during the Big 12 tournament and uh you know sending our best to to Bill self for a full and speedy recovery okay all the best of Bill self and his family and get well soon his health is certainly more important than the Big 12 tournament but look at the pressure the Kihei Clark puts on the ball hes guarding RJ Davis and everything is contested every catch every dribble Clark voted third Team all ACC and you look at the guys in the first and second team and you say okay I get it those are great players but boy you know Kihei Clarks about as valuable to his team as anybody in this league and having a pretty sweet up and under there from DeMarco Dunn now you cant allow him in the paint if he can shoot it if he has some time but hes starting to play at a higher gear and if he plays more minutes that makes more North Carolina that much better Ryan Dunn in Off the Bench for Virginia as is the Freshman Isaac McNeely a very good shooter and Ryan Dunn is going to be a great player Beekman left hand up and in might have drawn a foul as well but they play on As Virginias back within two and I agree with you on Ryan Dunn I think a couple of years from now were going to be talking about him as one of the best forwards in the ACC well hes hes going to be the next great defensive four man that Virginia has and then the DeAndre Hunter Isaiah Wilkins mode hes so athletic and lengthy and interesting now with the injury to Vander plus ooh big screen Clark got leveled by a legal screen from Nan she just didnt see it coming and got the worst of it uh that freed up RJ Davis for that drive but its almost like thats what you have to do to get Kihei Clark off of you and he gets right up underneath you hello Pete Nance when youre five nine and the guy youre running into is 610 youre gonna get the worst of it the layup for Davis caught back in leaky Black coming in as well as Davis sits down so Carolina gets a little bit bigger right now Don love in the backcourt puff Johnson leaky black and again the return to baycot up front Applause Gardner with a turnaround I dont know why he faded away against puff Johnson just take the ball right into his chest and go to the basket Jake Gardner such a good score loved and not the one theyre looking for but its kept in play by puff Johnson and they still got plenty of time on the clock give it back to one of the guards and lets start over but Applause Beekman those are the ones that are so difficult youre trying to get a shot and Reese Speakman just like a defensive back shoots the Gap and takes it the other way and as mentioned earlier the ACC defensive player of the year well he almost gambled on that one well he plays the ball you know everything he does is about the ball not about his man two to shoot turn around leaky black is short Mark the rebound well you talk about a game being played at Virginias pace you can talk about speeding up Virginia youre not going to do it no you know its easier to slow game down and they are expert at it McNeely and the Cavs have the lead first time denied Virginias been on top Isaac McNeely 45 of his 67 field goals on the season are threes boy that was kicked by capro but no whistle and now Virginia comes up with it and a rare chance to run as Beekman lays it in hes got Aid Virginia by three and Beekman has made two buckets at the basket where he got hit and still finished the play hes a creative finisher around the basket Virginia playing right up to the threepoint line but not out further than that they are just mucking everything up look everybodys in the lane and Bangkok called for the offensive foul momentum in Virginias favor Jay right now Virginia not having much success on their offensive end so turn defense into offense Reese Beekman with the steal and then more defense for Beekman knocking the ball away Kihei Clark comes up with it and gives it to his alldefensive backcourt made thats a good date Michael leaves here Steve wojohousis go to the big 12 Texas Oklahoma State well this is a big time play by Tyrese Hunter right here great pass by Marcus Carr its always better for Texas when Hunters making threes Tom crean thank you very much Steve bojackowski how about you take the Big East to Paul and Xavier well DePaul continues the momentum from their exciting win over Seton Hall shooting 78 from the floor guys thank you very much welcome back to Greensboro along with Holly Roche billis Im Dan Shulman of Virginia on a 70 run and now lead Carolina by three again the Tar Heels in desperate need of this game and probably more if they have any shot of getting an NCAA at Large new Speakman has been great tonight and getting an assist on the bucket by Gardner Virginia running that mover blocker they call it sides where the two big guys are screeners and the other three are Cutters and just really good action working off of Jayden Gardner you help on the cutter they just drop it off to him so good in the midrange so the blockers are the screeners and the Cutters are the movers you are right on your game thats what makes you the best in the business when I decide to show up shot clock running down again stop me if youve heard that before and a shot clock violation on the heels and heres how much they love forcing shot clock violations at Virginia they tracked them in the game notes thats the 25th time this year an opponent has had a shot clock violation a very patient crowd that like shot clock violence yes they appreciate a good 30 seconds of Defense as much as any aspect of the game in Charlottesville but really for North Carolina their offense has to help their defense so far their offenses turn the ball over and thats put their defense into bad spots you cant guard a run out boy great movement off the ball by beat Music and then Beekman found caparo for the slam just a Next Level view of the game not only defensively where his anticipation is so good he sees whats happening but he also sees whats happening on the offensive end to make a very intelligent cut to the basket Davis cant get away from Kihei Clark I dont think anybody can well thats one way to do it and hell knock it down to stem the tie what North Carolina cant afford to do in my view is dribble too much but you know make a couple passes they get taken away and all of a sudden youre a little worried about making those passes but just make a pass fake fake a pass to make a pass going with Virginia offensively its not just the ball movement its the movement off the ball you see such Rhythm and coordination between Beekman and Clark and whoever else is out there they are always looking for each other and as Beekman having himself a half or what he had 13 points five assists and five steals against North Carolina in the last game and hes having a similar game where hes impacting the game at both ends averages just over nine hes got 11 already love misses Nance runs it down and the foul is going to go on capro a really smart job here by Reese Fitness look at this cut to the basket he sees when Caleb love turns his head he cuts right to the basket and that draws Armando baycat and then over the top of this screen you go underneath it Reese Speakman able to knock down that three and hes having a terrific game a complete floor game for Reed speaker so Jay Id imagine there are a lot of Carolina fans watching the game Sing get the ball to baycott get the ball to bait out of the heels against Virginia get Bay caught the ball in a good spot to make a play theyve got to get him on the move youre going to have to screen them into the post or get him into the middle of the floor when you can play some sort of high low or four round one well see if they can do that when we come back foreign business is a lot like basketball principle when you take care of your team they take care of business and the Oscars on ABC Sunday March 12th 8 Eastern 5 Pacific Reese beefman has been all over the place for Virginia here in the first half of the boy heres Hollybrook well obviously Rick Reese Beekman deserves every word he got this postseason he has been playing terrific the ACC defensive player of the year and he came into some really good company look at the dominance in this category respeakman joined what they call the Brotherhood a pretty impressive club right here DeAndre Hunter Isaiah Wilkins Brogden of course was fantastic and Atkins its really a great honor they did a nice little social media post with him that said hey welcome to the club and he has proven that he defend he defends at a high level hes got great instincts and he deserves that award and all the accolades hes gotten were seeing it play out right in front of us right now absolutely and no slouch at the offensive end third in the ACC in assists and second nationally it assist to turnover ratio because he just never gives it up never coughs it up Im no slouch myself oh dont sell yourself short youre a tremendous shot clock down to four Franklin and black down with a rebound for the heels it would have just been stymied offensively for most of this game heres the fouls ball on Isaac McNeely and Virginia really doesnt go after the offensive board Tony Bennett would rather take away transition from North Carolina than take the chance of sending two or three guys to the offensive glass North Carolina gets beat in the paint but whats really hurting the Tar Heels right now its nine to nothing in points off turnovers Carolinas got six turnovers a couple of them shot clock violations but its those turnovers for touchdowns that have hurt North Carolina Applause averages 77 points per game a much needed bucket there by Davis its a three and that gets him to 18 and hes got half of them yeah thats nine points now for RJ Davis and hes going to have to be really aggressive because getting the ball inside to pay cut has proven to be really difficult and he gets doubled right away when he gets it love hasnt scored bade cots got two so Davis has been carrying them to the offensive end well its so difficult to guard these Cutters coming off screens and rescreen action Franklin left hand up and in as the Cavs Drive the ball to the rim again well you have to force him to dribble because you dont want him shooting it hes made 58 breeze on the season so you give them a straight line drive to the basket hes going to be able to finish that so he better not sure he liked that call well hed like to have his Defenders a little closer together where RJ Davis doesnt have the chance to split those Defenders but a nice little juke move to get past Pete Nance and doesnt even bring his right hand to the ball just wants to get it up on the rim and on the backboard as quickly as possible just a really quick strong drive by Armon Franklin thats the sixth foul on Virginia neither team is in the bonus yet icing that ball screen keeping it on the right side of the floor Applause its a such a welldrilled defensive team baycot having to work hard cant finish it and its Virginia Bull and they are forcing him to go over bodies to get a score trying to get it quickly but theres no question Armando Bakehouse a little bit hobble Applause Gardner good patience kicks it back out 10 to shoot see Virginias running their offense with much much more Pace much more movement than North Carolina and getting good looks Gardner mans down with eight for Carolina with a minute and a half to go in the first half this is an important minute and a half can Carolina get back into this second of the night but because of the quicker attack in transition the penetration and then the kick and leaky black was ready to shoot at no hesitation and the Tar Heel fans making themselves heard for the first time in a while here in Greensboro yeah Beekman not this time long rebound to Clark Beekman again this time for three and Nance down with a rebound Caleb love cant take off in transition because Kihei Clarks right there on him our rejection there by Kaden Shedrick one of the things she does best 32 seconds away from the AllState halftime report Rhys Davis lafonzo Ellis Seth Greenberg hell show you the day action here from Greensboro Miami a winter wake Duke rolled over pit also whats going on at the Big 12 tournament as well Applause right now Caleb loves is having to think more about whos guarding him than running offense its so difficult Davis yes what an answer by North Carolina Virginia could have stretched it out but Carolina flexing a little bit of muscle the last couple of possessions to get back to a onepoint game RJ Davis has half of Carolinas points knocking down another three as the Tar Heels make a bit of a run theyre back within one in the closing seconds of the first half foreign a 60 run for Carolina theyre back within one you set an important minute and a half so far what have weve seen of that last minute and a half has gone very well for the team in blue I think Carolina was down seven and in a transition situation leaky black hits one from the left corner and then RJ Davis hits a tough one from the right wing now its a onepoint game if Carolina gets a stop here two fouls to get here too right yeah Im not sure Id use it until they get inside the line and theres one thats why duns in the game Seth trimbles in the game as well so Huber Davis can use those guys its one theyve got one more to give here if they want you just want to make sure that Virginia doesnt get in a shooting motion before you give the foul I want to let him get a dribble or two McNeely got it off mans down with a rebound and the half comes to a close with North Carolina playing very well in the last minute and a half getting back within one big first half Marie Speakman for the Virginias lead down to one at the break here in this quarterfinal game at the ACC tournament in Greensboro North Carolina Holly Rose with Tony Bennett this year said than done right like Cooper Davis knows what his players need to do how easy is it to put that plan into practice its really difficult against this Virginia Defense I mean try to run a high ball screen and they hedge it so hard almost to the point of trapping it and you cant see the roll guy you know with Pete Nance you can you know set a screen and he can pop out of it and then you play from there but its really difficult I think you just have to get more cutting Gardner just using his strength to back down leaky black a little bit and leaky black telling one of the officials on the way back down on D watch that forearm that he was giving me well he just knocks him back and then hes got that good midrange game I mean in East Carolina he was a 19 20 point of game scorer and you know I would talk to Kelvin Sampson his staff about it he was the most difficult player to guard in the American Conference when he was playing for the Pirates the first two baskets of the second half belong to Virginia Davis open in the corner and he buries for three and its a twopoint game hes got 15 of Carolinas 27 and that was set up by the penetration along the Baseline by Caleb love and he was able to freeze that Defender just getting around Armon Franklin and sometimes the penetration just doesnt have to take you all the way to the basket sometimes one or two dribbles can do it loves fourth assist of the night the answer at the other end from Arman Franklin thats two times that Franklin has gone on that side against leaky black and then on the other side leaky blackout Switched Off on Jayden Gardner and Gardner just took him into the post Carolina eliminated Virginia in this tournament in Brooklyn in this round last year beating 6343 Beekman no but capro with an emphatic yes you got to get a rotation if Armando Bakehouse gonna go block that shot as a weak side shot blocker thats leaving the offensive glass wide open for caparo capro a 71 fifth year senior from Argentina hes had some International action playing for Argentinas national team a guy who at times in his career in Charlottesville has been a starter at times a role player and again if youre just joining us Tony Bennett is without the services of Ben Vander plas tonight broken hand in practice yesterday unfortunately done for the season and it happened when they were working on their their postdouble teams thats why you should never run defensive drills in practice North Carolinas been using heat and ants with that high ball screen and then Armando baycot can duck in but theyve had a problem throwing out of that ball screen action because of the defense boy look how hard RJ Davis had to work for that shot and its down to Virginia everythings challenged and you get deep in that shot clock it gets even more difficult thats why North Carolina has to attack earlier great pass Clark to Gardner how many times have Virginia fans seen that the last couple of years between those two well thats that mover blocker offense the screen is set by Jaden Gardner and then he can either roll to the basket or fade pop out wide I mean its so difficult to guard because they run it so well and they run it over and over thats his third person see Gardner sets the little screen they curl off it Pete Nance helps on it now hes got to recover The Gardener and he just comfortably gets into that midrange shot where he is so effective afro just picked up his third he goes to the bench for Virginia Armando baycott sits down less than three and a half minutes into the second half puff Johnson is in Pete Nance now in effect the fiveman for the heels and with they caught out they can spread the floor now because Pete Nance can play out on the perimeter that opens up some driving and cutting lands and right now RJ Davis is keeping Carolina in this game hes got 18 and its really about stops you know Virginia is not going to be throwing the ball inside to Caden Shedrick hes going to be a screener but theyre going to be looking for Gardner off some of these screens in this mover blocker offense Franklin into traffic Gardner with a follow where the guards have to block out too and right now North Carolinas not rebounding on the defensive end with all five guys Applause Music Applause chance with a height advantage on Franklin picks it out to Leaky black and now gets it back Applause with a shot fake drives and draws the foul and they got it off the reversal Virginia kept it to one side of the floor they reverse it then they can attack ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball he is brought to you by principal when you take care of your team they take care of business Music there are all kinds of products in this world things run for Tony Bennett as the head coach out of Virginia and you know really I think theyve established a baseline that is the Envy of just about every other program in the country there you know they may not be National Championship good every year but you know this team is going to be competitive every single year not only that impeccable yes you can read that so easily its the master of the chalkboard but with this smaller lineup That North Carolinas put out on the floor I think Hubert Davis is trying to spread the floor and you know not having it clogged up by a big guy thats down there and see if you can get more driving lanes and really put this Virginia team in a little bit of rotation because youre not getting anything out of throwing the ball inside with those quick doubles kind of amazing isnt it again Armando baycott may not be 100 but a guy as good an accomplished as he is that right now right in this moment in this game their best plan maybe to not have him in there at the moment well hes hobbled and thats certainly not helping it but with Pete Nance at the five you know the ball should move a little bit more and thats nicely done there the screen in the slot then the roll and Kayla Bluff came off that with some pace and got it to the other side of the floor to the opposite lane line now watch him roll to the basket when he took it to the opposite lane line all of a sudden its got to be picked up there by Ryan Dunn otherwise you could just hook past it to Puff Johnson for an open three in the corner this spread floor is much more effective for North Carolina in this type of game first basket of the night for Nance completes the threepoint play in that beautiful feed from Love in demands was Caleb Loves fifth assist of the night and theyre back within two and that has brought their fans back to life again and now its about stops and Virginia in their sides offense great pass wow back door cut by Clark and Franklin found him just right off that little opposite elbow back screen and you can back screen you can take it to the basket you can rescreen it its so difficult to guard because all thats happening in space on the weak side love into the chest of gardeners stolen away by Beekman Clark bobbledon got it back and then turned it over very few turnovers in this game for Virginia but North Carolina puff Johnson doing a good job of taking away that pass Johnson picked up his dribble and turned it over theres just nothing there right now Virginia has dominated the paint and they have dominated points off turnovers I think North Carolina has a single basket off of Virginia mystery once the ninth turnover committed by the heels and Beekman converts at the other end did a great job of protecting the ball to get those through those two Defenders and Virginia works on those creative finishes at the basket because when beefman takes it in there as a guard hes going to have to finish over bigger guys good pass Nash opens for three even even though he missed it thats a good shot thats the kind of shot that North Carolina has not been getting throughout the course of this game man should four threes 22 points against the whos 12 days ago in Chapel Hill Beekman headed to the line heres that mover blocker sides offense watch the left side of the floor a little back screen from done and then throwing over the top just not enough pressure on the ball from DeMarco Don then excellent use of the ball to get through that split and protect it and then get up to the rim and finish that by Reese Speakman such a good driver he really does have a complete Game hes worked on his shot hes become a much better shooter hes about 38 39 for three he puts up numbers Dan and assists Steals and blocks that have not put been put up in the ACC since Grant Hill did it at Duke thats remarkable good remarkable yep Beekman came into this one with 25 assists and one turnover in his last three games yet most of the attention he gets and its understandable is for how amazing he is on the defensive end around and out for Davis well theres a two in a row Reese speakmans free throw and then that one by RJ Davis thats both were in and out Applause for these guards for Virginia really good cutters and Ryan Dunn fouled on his way to the rim again great ball movement and player Movement by the whos you think theyre coming off a pin down then they restrain and go the other way their pace is really good its just difficult all their cuts are to the ball or to the basket and those are the most difficult things to guard in a cutter well theyre nothing but net Crews going to be back at it tonight after the second game between Clemson and NC State theyll break down all four games if the New York Life ACC tournament postgame interviews and a look ahead to the semis as more and more Kelsey Riggs has her hands full with Luke Hancock and Carlos Cruiser and Joel Berry and thats uh Joels beautiful little baby girl Carter who is up there with the crew through a trip yeah inadvertently but Shedrick trip love number three North Carolina needs to keep attacking the basket with this smaller lineup Applause never too early to learn the cheers right if youre growing up in a Carolina family Music Applause Dave is the source of the bulk of the offense tonight gives it up and how about that rejection from Ryan Dunn a seven foot wingspan athletic and a live body what a great recovery by Ryan Dunn to block that shot that was a sure basket if not for that blocked shot if youre not a Virginia fan or an ACC fan and you havent seen a lot of them hes kind of Biden his time getting better playing behind some older players but hes going to be something for this Virginia program well it has been one and out for North Carolina there are no offensive rebounds available that was a really good blockout by Isaac McNeely on DeMarco Dunn the defense by DeMarco down on Franklin who then turns it over Davis in transition got fouled by Franklin well DeMarco Don his defense on Franklin forcing him to pick up his dribble that allowed that sort of weak pass and RJ Davis able to take it away you know thats the kind of defense that North Carolina needs to play Applause RJ Davis with more than half with Carolinas points tonight and Huber Davis is going to bring Armando bacon back into the game Davis with nine teams arrested his mates theyre just 17 as Armando bacon returns so with baycott back in the game that initial set that Carolina was running to start the game where they went four round one and Bacons laboring to get up and down the floor hes really gutting it out just like he did in the championship game against Kansas immediately Tony Bennetts going to put him in ball screens hes in drop coverage Neely off the screen gotta stay close to him Beekman Shadrick Cedric sets the screen Beekman curls into the middle and Shedrick just rolls right to the basket youre worried about the ball and then the Cutters the one thats open Applause done strong drive and he will be at the free throw line when we come back Aidan Shedrick a bigger role because of the injury to Ben vanderplas and making the most of his minutes tonight often times when you set a screen youre the one thats going to be open screen set by Shedrick he rolls right to the basket on the open side and Beekman just lobs it right up to him drawing two Defenders leaky black cant get over in time beautiful offense by Virginia Kevin Gates oh wolf packed up here for this game as the Tigers get loose in the hallway across the way from us really looking forward to this one Clemson again a fascinating case theyve got some really good wins this year including two over NC State went into Raleigh 12 days ago beat him by 25 but theyve also got some troubling losses lost to Loyola Chicago loss to South Carolina lost to Louisville I think theyre a fascinating team to be evaluated by the tournament selection committee theyve got four quad one wins and again Im not a fan of this quad one business but three of those squad one wins are on the road and I dont know how many teams in the atlarge nomination pool are going to match that DeMarco Don missing both free throws and thats a little bit deflating North Carolina hadnt missed a free throw before that Applause Virginia by seven here in the second half McNeely launches and hits another one the Freshman from poker West Virginia gives the whos their largest lead of the night just out of the timeout it was a staggered screen and McNeely set the first of that stagger then came off it after the cutter he was the second cutter and was wide open for that shot if neither was Player of the Year in the state of West Virginia last year and he can really shoot it now the offensive glass left open on the help there in the bacon happy to capitalize yeah that was overhelp by copperov McNeely was there to force a tough two and theres no reason to leave to go block that shot and leave the offensive glass wide open for Armando bacon afro playing with three fouls Shedrick on the bench with four for Virginia right now North Carolina is chasing these Cutters the movement for Virginia this mover blocker offense is excellent the movers are moving and the blockers are blocking as Gardner gets to the rim and draws the foul now watch the left side of the floor here you can see a little staggered screen and watch number 11 McNeely hes going to come over its actually theres the Stagger so hes the low man on the Stagger and then he turns and then coffero takes out Caleb love to give him that little bit of extra time to knock down that shot theres two nearly the Freshman 39 from three on the season second foul on baycod weve got the worst of it physically as well still holding his throat okay he took one from Gardner right in the neck as Gardner was trying to ward off the block shot and thats supposed to be an offensive foul but if you want a foul called in this game you better buy a whistle yourself and baycot right back to the bench so back to this really five out offense for Huber Davis with Nance black puff Johnson the front court right now for the heels and now Tony Bennett going to match that smaller lineup That North Carolina has on the floor lets check in with Holly well guys an update on Kaden Shedrick he is out with those fouls but hes also been receiving medical attention his mouth is all bloody on the right side he was actually trying to figure out if one of his teeth was loose lots of blood coming out of his mouth theyve been treating him on the bench hopefully he can come back in but I dont think its broken or loose from what I could see as he tugged on that tooth all right Holly thank you sir a very small lineup in there right now for Virginia with Ryan Dunn the biggest guy on the court for the whos Shedrick trying to go up and block that shot just took one right in the chops from DeMarco Dunn thatll get your count your Chiclets on the on the bench afterwards third quarter final here in Greensboro Miami in Duke one earlier today Clemson and NC State still to come Applause well these these Hedges are so Good by Virginia oh Tony Bennett is as angry as Tony Bennett can get but Ryan Dunn went straight up in the air on that I differ with them on that I thought his arms were down but in todays college game its rarely called and the arms came down he did get ball there third undone mans to the line so Shedrick Ford done three caporo three vanderplas out with a broken hand so a little mix and match a little thin up front right now for Bennett and Virginia Applause Carolina put a little full court pressure on and actually against Virginia its not bad to actually throw a little one two two out there or something just to slow the advance that way you dont have to guard this stuff for as long and you put full foot pressure on you can take eight ten seconds off the clock before Virginias able to get in anything and youre negotiating fewer screens Mark with a long jumper its a two and its a 10point lead for Virginia Virginia just takes whatever you give them you go under a screen theyll pull back and shoot it you try to go over the top theyll curl it and take it to the rim love for three field goal of the night hes got five and Carolinas within seven its also one of his first open shots and North Carolina got it because they reversed the ball Ash deflected so it stays with Virginia 15 to shoot one thing North Carolina cant afford to do is over help on some of these cuts so you can stunt at the cut as a health Defender but if you over help I mean Jaden Gardner was wide open there and if it werent for that deflection he would have had an easy basket Applause Andrew McNeely The Freshman to giving Virginia some good minutes tonight Clark into Gardner turn around no Nance the rebound good health by puff Johnson to pick up Gardner on that roll love to match assist number six for love and its a fivepoint game much more effective in this spread four attack for North Carolina with the smaller lineup inside eight minutes to go Gardner a Miss from a spot he normally makes but he was wide open because two were drawn to the ball on that little curl cut love left alone in and out Johnson draws the foul the spread floor makes blackouts that much more difficult and puff Johnson with the offensive rebound near stick back foreign with the wide open three on ball reversal for the first time in the game hes got a little rhythm going into a shot and then drawing the defender off the ball screen and Pete Nance rolling right to the basket in the middle of the floor stay Serge ibari rice has got the best shot fake the most lethal shot fake in college basketball but he didnt need it there straight bucket three Steamboat houses go to the Big Ten Penn State Illinois Penn State sending a message to the selection committee Andrew Funk five second half three I think they get that win theyre pretty much solidified in the tournament well a lot of bubble talk guys thank you very much so Oklahoma state is trailing North Carolina they need this win everybody who follows the heels knows that by the way Arizona State UCLA 11 30 Eastern tonight on ESPN right after our game a USC excuse me Arizona State USC forgive me 11 30 Eastern right here on ESPN right after our Clemson NC State game so if youre a fan of Oklahoma State or Penn State or Carolina Arizona State matters to you its not overstating its 7 40 to go in this game Carolinas tournament hopes riding on what happens over the next seven minutes and 40 seconds and I think everybody understands even if they were to win that may not be enough but dont you think automatically they absolutely need this win tonight just to even have a chance right yeah yeah I dont think theres any question about that and if I were North Carolina right now Id put on some full court pressure and slow the advance its not necessarily to get a steal youre not saying you wouldnt take it but that way you dont have to guard as long how about that an immediate payoff there as they force a turnover just the fifth turnover of the game for Virginia and Virginia just looked like they almost werent prepared they hadnt been pressed all game long but the pressure was great the initial trap to get the turnover but just to slow the advance and that way you dont have to guard their half court offense for as long shot clock at five love with the drive and Shadrick got it from behind Caleb love tried to take it to the other side of the rim but he wound up taking it into more pressure than he avoided thank you mark off the screen kicks to Franklin who knocks down the three Applause that was over help you overhelp on that curl cut and you leave it wide open in the corner for Franklin Applause leaky black misses the three Clark down with a rebound and time of possession and North Carolina spending far more time on defense than they are on offense and they are chasing every cut foul on puff Johnson thats the fourth team foul here in the second half Applause and I said Shedrick it was actually Franklin I think who got a piece of it but it was two Defenders there and because of the overhelp on that curl by Kihei Clark Armon Franklin wide open for that three in the corner Applause Clark up top Applause for what Kihei Clark from behind Applause all right Applause RJ Davis gets it back through the fingertips of love and back over to Virginia just trying to dribble through all that traffic with Shedrick when you bring a ball screen up all of a sudden you got two guys out Pete Nance got in the way that was part of the problem but North Carolina just cant afford turnovers even though it wasnt a live ball turnover now theyre back playing defense again and the foul on Davis is second for this Virginia team is so disciplined offensively theyre cutting and the decisions the reads they make of the defense its really beautiful to watch and foul to buy Nance super Davis cant like that how usually Beekman got into the lane Applause thats a Freon dance North Carolina has to make some of these Cuts go through their chest right now theyre just chasing Applause weve been 79 on the season misses the first you know we we talk a lot Dan about reading the defense when youre an offensive player whether you have the ball or a cutter its hard to think of many players that read the offense better as a Defender than respeakman yeah and the word that Tony Bennett used pregame with us was anticipation he seems to know what the other team is going to do before they even do it sometimes Applause and again theyre not in a rush and this is whats tough about trying to make a comeback late against Virginia that clock just keeps on ticking fox seems to move faster when youre playing against Virginia boy off balance by puff Johnson nothing there trying to get a quick attack but just not strong enough with that move and now youre gonna have to play 30 Seconds of Defense again Applause McNeely takes it out to Franklin Applause and Nance down with a rebound 4 45 to go eightpoint game Applause Davis Shedrick cupped it up on the glass love for three just his second basket of the night but its a big one for the heels essentially an offensive rebound for Pete Nance and smart enough to kick it back out for a step in three from Caleb love another offensive rebound that leads to a three and North Carolina needed that one desperately they are still down by five 4 32 to go heals bench youre UPS 12 action Texas Oklahoma State SEC network all were making a run right now in Arkansas over on ESPNU we got Wichita State and Tulsa but if you want to break from the Hoops how about the best team playing right now the Bruins on ESPN plus taking on the Oilers but Dan and Jay just so you guys know the only game Im watching is yours all right Michael had a baby you are with us how about the Pac12 mens tournament presented by New York Life UCLA and Oregon already into the semis unfortunately for the Bruins they have to go the rest of the way and now Jalen Clark after the season with an injury a big one coming up again at 11 30 Eastern tonight on ESPN USC and Arizona State the Sun Devils a bubble team so if youre a fan of Carolina or Clemson who we will see next what Arizona state does tonight may impact your teams chances lets go to Holland braided Carolina defensive pressure weve seen them go more pressure and want better shot selection but taking care of the basketball the biggest thing right now for western or excuse me for Virginia and for North Carolina guys got to make plays in leaky black just made a heck of a play at the defensive end yeah saved another basket that was a great cut to the front of the rim by Armon Franklin on that drive RJ Davis who has carried the load offensively for the heels will be at the line whether we come back but lets look at the Leaky black defensive play on the way to break on the Baseline Drive Armon Franklin gets right to the front of the rim a little dropoff pass and leaky black with the basket saving block and North Carolina needs every one of these big plays to have a chance to win over 12 s there to help guide you through lifes happiest and most difficult times kind of a difficult time right now for the North Carolina Tar Heels are they looking at the NIT unless they can pull this one out and get another one tomorrow night they are down five late in this one to Virginia Miami overweight by two wake had a half court shot to win it at the end of the game two malt hit today Clemson and NC State still to come right now its Virginia Carolina 356 to go Virginia leading by five and RJ Davis at the line for two for the heels as he misses the first and this is the accs leading free throw shooter on the season North Carolinas missed several free throws in the second half these two could have gotten it down to a one possession game Carolina going to bring the full Fork pressure so after the initial pass youre going to get a quick trap Applause Gardner back to Clark theres the Trap Clark gets out of it by finding Beekman but even with Virginia breaking that pressure youre down to about 15 before they start getting into offense I just think its a smart move to play that way wide open Gardner oh and Carolina catches a Great Bear just a miscommunication between puff Johnson and Pete Nance Vance keeps it spins lost it well he knew what he wanted to do and he was almost there just couldnt keep the dribble on the spin every time North Carolina gets within Striking Distance Virginia for one reason or another able to Stave them off Beekman pull up no rebound leaky black inside three minutes to go Applause love trying to drive by Clark and hes foul you saw Caleb love he was waving off RJ Davis saying give me some space and let me take a middle drew a little bit of help was able to draw that foul and Caleb love whos also a good free throw shooter just gave the wave off just put his shoulder down went right past Kihei Clark and into his body Armon Franklin came over to help another missed free throw now North Carolina has had so many opportunities to cut this down they could have cut it to a one possession game this one would do it but there they could inch even closer theyve missed five in the second half at one point they were seven of seven from the line and I think DeMarco done missed two in a row and thats what started this five for ten since thats 50 by my calculation congrats threepoint game 247 to go almost a steal by Caleb love Applause but just this little full court pressure is disrupted Rhythm a little bit of Virginias offense Applause five to shoot Franklin the drive off the glass and good I did it through contact got a switch and he had RJ Davis on him and Armon Franklin has a size advantage McNeely on Davis and he had Clark given help oh what a play why RJ Davis was so smart of him to go away from Kihei Clark Clark was helping off of Caleb love right in the middle watch him theyre helping and then he just gave a little move and decided to go right you cant really come off that corner shooter puff Johnson if Reese Beekman commits you pass it out if not you go right at Isaac McNeely what a big time play by RJ Davis but hes been doing that all game long 24 for Davis and its a twopoint game where would North Carolina be without RJ Davis Clark gets it over and gets fouled and that will be the seventh on Carolina so one and one coming for Kihei Clark 75 free throw shooter hes tried to split that double team and able to pick up the foul the accs alltime wins leader trying to get another one the ACC tournament just a fantastic fiveyear career for Clark a part of that National Championship team as a freshman Tony Bennetts done pretty well with point guards in California at London parentes and now Kihei Clark from Woodland Hills California Applause make some boat three Speakman guarding RJ Davis to pass Huff Johnson misses the three out of bounds off Nance hits Virginia ball Applause Music right now for Virginia getting the ball inbounds cleanly and Virginias been catching it coming toward the Baseline and that makes it a lot easier to trap and even though Kihei Clark is small back there I still think he can throw over the top Applause will dribble it over boy a huge possession its already a fourpoint lead for Virginia a minute and a half to go hey Clark trying to get some cutting going in that mover blocker offense Beekman has done so much for the whos tonight finds Gardner and Davis called for the foul the first three Speakman got fouled coming off that exchange there with two hands on the ball handler wasnt called but Jaden Gardner just made himself available right in the middle of the lane after setting this screen see Pete Nance has two hands on him but you got to get over and rotate in front of them RJ Davis whos behind him James Gardner three years at East Carolina two in Virginia got emotional on senior day just had a wonderful couple of years in Charlottesville and in the five years between the two programs over 2 300 points and almost 1100 rebounds and a sixpoint lead for Virginia North Carolina wont turn down the three but they dont have to have it I still say attack love for three Virginia ball so you take that shot and its a shot love can make but that was a deep three and Carolinas not been getting a ton of offensive rebounds but you dont give yourself a chance to get fouled doing that and that can extend the game you score with no time going off the clock then he can put on some full court pressure maybe get a turnover so not the not the best decision of shot for North Carolina Applause and Gardner right back to the line for the whos foreign Virginia knocking in their free throws North Carolina has not been quite as good from the line Applause one of two for Gardner still a three possession game with just over a minute to go Applause Davis creates some space cant hit it Gardner the rebound really good pressure on that shot from Kihei Clark just a step back three from RJ Davis and Virginia assaulting this away series moving closer to a spot in the semifinals tomorrow night and meanwhile on the other side What Slim NCAA at large hopes Carolina May Harbor those feel like they are slipping away free throw by free throw right now Applause thank you and its Enchanted UVA that you can hear around Greensboro they may be outnumbered some by the Tar Heel fans but theyre the more vocal group right now Applause Puck Johnson for three Applause swatted by Shedrick Franklin and at the other end Shedrick with the exclamation point Ill give Caden Shedrick some credit he didnt play the last two games against Clemson and Louisville and hes come in when needed and has done a really nice job cow fat basket itll still be 6657 Kaden shetter because you said getting a chance to play Ben vanderplas out with his the broken hand this he does very well and then youll love big guys run on the floor Armand Franklin with the unselfish pass on the pipe cup from Caden Shedrick and you know Virginia dominated the paint scoring points off turnovers was the difference in the game they took advantage of every North Carolina miscue that their defense forced so the two seed to Virginia they are going to advance into the semifinals tomorrow night against the winner of our next game between Clemson and NC State and Carolina fans seem to understand their faith this might not be the year for them to get an NCAA tournament bid and they might be looking at a trip to the NIT Applause Virginia going back to their more traditional sides offense that mover blocker without Ben vonderplas in the lineup lost for the season but but Wahoos showing they are still a contender love a basket but that is going to do it a terrific second half by Virginia and Tony Bennetts team has advanced on to the semifinals over the New York Life ACC tournament with a 6859 winner for Carolina tonights verbal player of the game is Rhys Beekman who did a little bit of everything and a lot of most things Jay for Virginia tonight well 15 points five assists five
