14 Duke on the road something they havent done all season win a road game trying to do that for the first time all year against Notre Dame a team pick to finish last in the ACC but coming off a good week as we are underway AT purcel Pavilion Kyle filipowski controls the opening tap and away we go alongside Randolph Childers Im Mike Monaco from South Bend Kaleb Foster gets another start for Duke comes in on a fivegame winning streak after those backtoback losses is against Georgia Tech and Arkansas here is Foster making a sixth straight start and off to the wing for Jeremy roach and now filipowski straight on swirls out of three Mark Mitchell the offensive rebound Jared McCain no dice from deep and cleared by the Irish great job there bud Fighting Irish just to get a stop the first game theyve theyve been solid all year the defensive end of the floor so theres no surprising there lets see if they can keep this up and continue to rebound the ball now they have struggled offensively as Kevin GI goes to work and the Penn State transfer starts the score I think the game plan tonight for the fighting irishes they want to make filipowski play on both ends of the floor they know hes going to be aggressive on the offensive but theyre going to attack him make him defend as well hes the leading scorer for Duke as you check out the starters again Tyrese practor coming off the bench Jr kesn with the block on Caleb Foster and the Irish have had their struggles offensively this year they play low meanwhile Dukes been trying to play faster as Marcus Burton rimmed it out and Kevin ji gets tagged with a foul Mikel Shrewsberry is in his first year here in South Bend after o just 23 years of Mike Bray Shrewsberry of course the Indiana native spent two years as the head coach at Penn State hes got this noted a group playing better they had the win last week against Virginia feel like they should have won Wednesday against NC State yeah this team feels like they should have won three in a row and have two ACC wins and make no mistake about it forget the record this is one of the better defensive teams in the ACC off the turnover Carri Booth nearly gave it away and now he does Foster the pick Foster draws a foul on Marcus Burton other side John shy we said the fivegame winning streak he told us that we went through some stuff yeah with those losses to Georgia Tech and Arkansas but he feels like theyve come together in a way that maybe they hadnt earlier in the year well were going to find out because this team is this is a third true Road game in their 0 and2 so were going to see how they come out and finish you know this first just this first half I think you take it half you know time out TV time up about TV time out tough shot Jeremy roach and thats kind of what the seniors been doing recently averaging 17 a game over his last eight and now Duke extends pressure his leaderships been outstanding hes picked it up in the offensive end really making good decisions hes taken over that point guard Road and decisionmaking Road when Tyrese Proctor went out and hes playing so well I dont know how he take the ball out of his hand to be quite honest and so he starts again with McCain and Foster a couple of freshmen and Proctor like we said comes off the bench Burtons the top scorer for the Fighting Irish the local freshman gave it up with the shot clock winding down on kesn who hits on Two And Jr kzn has done that twice now in the last eight days he has and he told us early today he promised me he was going to get ready to shoot bark Mitchell gets Stripped by kesn and a thunderous start for the Fighting Irish here at home in front of a packed house theyre going to be forced to make shots Burton off the bounce gives it up to the corner Tay Davis left it short offensive rebound and sck back Bo great job there just attacking the offensive glass where Duke is vulnerable where they can be vulnerable with this three yard lineup is on the offensive glass they get caught in these theyre switching everything they get caught in these matchups not a lot of size on the offensive glass when youre attacking filipowski off the dribble with your point guard roach gives it up McCain off the shot Pi good close out kesn McCain driving and gets the Applause roll last five games for Jared McCain The Freshman from Sacramento hes averaging 192 points per game booth can step out and shoot it at 6 10 and theres another offensive rebound and a foul on filipowski you said it John sh said it to us earlier today a shooter around very worried about the offensive rebounding of Notre Dame they are and they want to attack filipowski you know and they want to attack him that time they got him on the offensive glass and theyre going to make him guard on both ends of the floor like hes the key to this Duke team hes one piece they know thats invaluable and shs not happy about that and I think hes going to get him out he told us if he get a quick foul early hes going to get him out yeah lets see tyres Proctors coming in hes going to get Caleb Foster and for now filipowski stays in John sh said to us today we are aggressive in terms of a guy gets two fouls in the first half we are comfortable letting him go but he said with filipowski and as you just intimated its been a little bit different well you have to earn that I mean you want coaches tend to let you do it and then they get burned and filipowski hes been burned a couple of times and hes a little bit concerned about that theyre down 84 so I dont think he can take them out this early Proctor bounces for Mitchell and he got Stripped by Julian roer ahead in transition Burton the trailer back to rer cant stick it filipowski clears it what do you want to see with Proctor in the game for dud I just want to see Proctor be super aggressive I think hes as he rounds himself in into shape hes been out he missed three games rolled his ankle so hes not 100 in his his conditioning and thatll come roach hits the three and lets see its going against Duke perhaps he kicked out his legs a foul on Jeremy Roaches for indeed just that Applause Music Jeremy roach catches that and cant tell if he could kicked his knee out there but just a great job there taking it away got a close game here sou in IND the end the ad mentioned a half bath yes you know what lets um lets double back here no its this way its down here somewhere finding a perfect home is hard thankfully Geico makes it easy to bundle in safe do you know how to get out Notre Dame here at home up by four on the number 14 team in the country in Duke and we said it earlier and John sh said it to his team at the start of shoo around today he told him if we want to do something special we got to be able to do that away from Cameron and he said there tonights the first step of that as we check out how the seasons gone lets see how they respond to it uh theyve been challenged early you know what was coming and theyve come out for a team thats taking care of the basketball theyre six in the country in the least amount of turnovers offensively and theyve given up three already here and got themselves in an early ho well see how they respond Notre Dame only forced four turnovers against NC State the other day theyve already forced those three duke turnovers and Duke turns to TJ power for some early action The Freshman from Massachusetts Burton is very good in the midrange the freshman at 16 points per game one of the best rookie scorers in the entire country roach chop the bounce and hes trying to take charge he had the three wiped away and so now he goes to the rack for two Jared McCain and roach are just playing at a high level right now and and without CER being there theyre just taking over for this team on the offensive end theyve been so efficient there roach drives gets the angle takes the contact and finish he is just really playing at a high level and its just fun to watch if you follow his career hes had so many Peaks and valleys and he isnt playing any better in his career than he is right now career highs this year in points per game and then efficiency too field goal percentage three point percentage and free throw percentage as well for the senior from leeburg Virginia so Jaylen Blakes into the game so after the make it the free throw line again extended pressure from duke and this is something that bothered a turnover proone not same team against NC State who did the same well they only really have one guy that can handle pressure and make decisions and thats Burton and the last play you took him off the ball set a screen a lot of pressure on Burton here because theyre going to do a lot of switching and force up other guys to make plays and that hasnt been a strength of Notre Dame they like to run execute their offense let their sets to it when everything breaks down they got to do this with Burton he yanked it back and hit the three wow what a move from Marcus paron hes telling them get over here playing with a ton of confidence softspoken freshman we chatted with him earlier today who said yeah what could be better than playing here at home the local guy from Mishawaka filipowski lost it another turnover braen Shrewsberry cant finish and it belongs to Applause Duke what do you like most about Marcus Burton I I I just think hes so poised hes you know Wise beond his years we here create space I mean hes not just proed the rod of his shoes there and knocks down a three but hes Fearless he goes in there hes only 511 hes but he really loves attacking the paint creating space for himself but again he has a lot of responsibility on him with this team because hes the only true decision maker there double on filipowski whos passing it well this year power cant stick a three TJ power known for his shooting getting some early run as we said for John shy he he can really stretch before floor but I think he has his hands full with Gard Burton Marcus Burton is cooking here in the first half yeah hes cooking with the fish greas and it is hot hes got as many as duke has with seven not in by eight roach navigating Roper moves it for power Proctor to the corner for Blakes hits a three those shots are going to be there because theyre going to double filipowski if the ball moves theyll get open shots like that you just got to knock them down but this a fighting Irish team is their defense is predicated on they want to control the paint if Duke beats him about shooting threes I think theyll live with that shb nearly threw it away Tay Davis got to it and hes banging at 69 with Blakes Davis lays it in its great match up there by Davis taking a smaller guard Blakes inside and no help came continue to get to a spot just elevated over and finish heres a double team coming 7in Advantage for Davis Blakes tried to knock down another kept Alive by power and then give it away to shrewbury the Irish run with Roper Pon is calling for it he is hot wants to Jack too strong a heat check Matt Zona though the offensive rebound the ground wanted him to go right back up with it I think Burton shot that one before it was in his hands he was calling for it by seconds feed me Roper going to work tough fallway for the Northwestern transfer and Dukes got it down by seven fastpaced start to this one it is and Irish is really young and filipow is fouled by Zona got to watch you dont take quick shots like that still want to run your offense when the quick shots present themselves just run your offense you dont have to force things how about Notre Dame and where things have changed for them a team that you know lost year to the Citadel by 20 and had the loss to Western Carolina early on in the season couple of weeks in but now theyve got the win over Virginia again they feel like they should be two one in the ACC after falling by two here Wednesday against NC State and now a lead here on Duke confidence is a fragile thing I mean you you know you can lose it and you can gain it and youre seeing a group of young men that theyre young theyre inexperienced but theyre gaining confidence with that UVA win and then they feel like they should have and the results dont dictate it but they had that NC State game under control late turnovers cost them the game and they feel like they should have won it and theyre going to come out and fight they feel like they they supposed to win this Duke game K Philip psk iss good on both he dealt with foul trouble Tuesday against Syracuse and that great win for Duke where they were up to at half time and then had a monster second half filipowski sits as Ryan young Music enters nnny with an illegal screen yeah I think he was just trying to run back just a smart play by Jaden Blakes there trying to pressure full court theyre going to pick up Burton as much as they can try to wear him down with different bodies of guys and unfortunate call there purely accidental trry seem more displeased with kesn than with the officials so Baseline out of bounds for Duke down by five Proctors going to work trying to bully Burton no foul calls great defense Burton pushes Burton in attack mode and he turned it over coming off six turnovers against NC State that match to season high for the Freshman point guard Foster step back created space s it twopoint game this is where Burton has to show his maturity because they want to speed him up hes the one guy that has to get this team under control open shots present themselves take it if not slow things down cuz Duke is trying to speed this group up it was just his first turnover of the night now he bounces nicely for Zona who finishes great job there getting to the paint for Warden Applause Zona double on Ryan young and a foul is called on Notre them on a push on the Applause sideline I think sh coach shrewbury cant be happy with that young tried to escape the double team get away ball went out of bounds hes got to like his team effort though theyre playing really hard just got to take care of the basketball not take so many quick Music shots so a fourpoint lead for the Fighting Irish uh Duke just about 8 and 1 half minutes in all right we welcome you Courtside here at pel Pavilion hes Randol chers Im Mike Monaco uh Duke you talked about the importance of this on the road can they get a road win in their third try this year and theyre getting everything Notre Dames got so far well you knew youre going to get that but the biggest concern you got to have if youre a Duke fan is the early turnovers its surprising because they hadnt done that all year and theyre coming out now and they got five turnovers here early giving up a couple of offensive rebounds they got to sh some things up if they want to take this on the road try to get more ACC wins and just know the D team is not throw their record away they are one of the better defensive teams in the league right now and and and theyre going to control the paint theyre physical even though theyre young theyre physical Music Applause Music Music team J Josh thank you very much wow another tight one another overtime game there in the ACC as we welcome you to South B Indiana and say hello longside Randolph children Im Mike Monaco we already underway between Duke ranked 14th in the country and Notre Dame whos got the advantage here Notre Dame picked last in the ACC but playing better in the last week Duke meanwhile a fivegame winning streak but trying to win on the road for the first time all year they have and its been difficult they had to play well and so far this first half they turned the ball over and had rebounded well so well see if they can handle this pressure and and who controls the paint I think will go go a long way toward who wins this game and right now quite Irish are controlling the interior five turnovers for Duke to your point meanwhile the flip side for Notre Dame they got one of the best freshman scorers in the country and Marcus Burton and hes got an early seven and you can tell hes feeling it yeah its fun to watch hes got an extra gear to him really good midrange shot there doesnt matter the size when he gets in the Rhythm and here he just snatched frocker elevates to his three far better shooter than than his threepoint shot shows you but hes really good in that midrange can get to any spot he wants on the floor and off to a hot start here for the fight n the number three scorer in the country among all freshman the local guy from Mishawaka and Penn High School which is 8 m east of here and hes been good now the key turnovers limiting that against some of the pressure hes already seen from duke like he saw in a twopoint loss for Notre Dame Wednesday against NC State and it isnt just the pressure he does have to take care of that but he has so much responsibility for this unit he has to score his points hes averaging 16 a game but he has to distribute and create for others and when Duke does all this switching which theyre doing hes the one guy that can break this guy down and make a decision so youll find the ball in his hands you just got to hope he doesnt wear down it look like theyre trying to get him a few minutes here get him a quick blow I think hell play at least 35 minutes they want to pull off the upset meanwhile for Duke talked about trying to get a win on the road John sh brought his team in at the start of shoot around this morning and he said to him guys if we want to do something special got to be able to do it away from Cameron away from Durham and he said to him tonights the first step of that they have to uh its its its for a team that was preseason second in in the country you know the talents there they just got to take this show on the road theyre going to get tested today Ryan young in the game right now for Kyle filipowski and young walks with it against Matt Zona and so thats six turnovers for Duke a team this year thats been one of the best in the country in turnover race yeah theyve been six in the country in that and early but again we talked about it this Irish team is inexperienced theyre young but theyre physical and they defend and Zona there has more experience than anyone on this roster and hes had his fair share of battles with Ryan young and understands that hey I got to take away that left shoulder theyre banging again as JR kesn takes a follow away that comes up short another local guy the junior whos waited his turn here in South Bend and hes the second leading scorer for the Irish behind Marcus Burton you know when youre not playing when youre not playing great and and its doing the break during the holidays you dont not used to having crowd Duke comes in the Arenas full theyre feeding off this energy and theyre taking a couple of quick shots I thought that shot there from conz could have been could have been an extra pass there to a teammate meanwhile Mark Mitchell going to work coming off a careerhigh 21 Tuesday in the win at Cameron against Syracuse but he couldnt get it to go hey next Saturday a basketball triple header starts with number 16 Clemson against Boston College at three Eastern then this number 14 Duke team against Georgia Tech at Cameron finally Miami Virginia Tech both of them trying to bounce back off Heartbreakers they Square Off in blackburg Clemsons going to be trying to do the same as well after North Carolina went into little John today with a 10point win yeah theyve dropped two in a row and 14 that I think is really good they dropped the last two one in a road and at home against a really good Carolina team thats showing theyre not just good theyre borderline great right now ke but ji couldnt get it to go against filipowski and Dukes been pushing more ever since the Tyrese Proctor injury Philip went to the rack but couldnt finish quick shot but youre not upset got to the rim filipowski will make those more time than not but theyre trying to the ball moves theyre trying to play faster kesn went down back to his feet shadowed by Jared McCain kesn had a big game last Saturday against Virginia found ji and it stays at this end of the floor know the names doing a really good job on both ends of the floor theyre controlling the pain on the defense end but youre in the offensive end theyre really effective when they get inside pain they averaging 24 threes a game and Co shury said were not doing that intentionally they want to take better shots right now you asked him about it today he says their shot profile has changed yes well shows what we know it is a three though there have been fewer of those recently we allege but youre okay with that I think what hes concerned with was that they shot 25 threes a game but you know he did looked at the D and 60 of their threes were contested you dont want to do that McCain bounces for filipowski just two points so far Kevin Jai stuck right with him and then Jai rips down the rebound I think there for filipowski at times he tries too hard to play with his back to the basket just turn and faing a post theyre already doubling you you can see it coming but his quickness on the interior would be a matchup problem for any big he gives up pounds physicality when he tries to back guys in facing him I think its his Advantage Car Booth walked with it John sh said to us today that filipowski maybe hasnt had those great games yet we said how so he said well we havent seen two dominant halves from him and yet were still in the position we are ranked 14th in the country on a fivegame winning streak well when you have a talent like him hes 7 foot hes the most skilled seven footer in the country he has it all and you just want to see him put it all together and really just say hey when you got a smaller guy on me dominate him inside you got a bigger guy on me Im going take you outside thats what we talked about this team doesnt have the physicality outside of zon to matches match him on the inside and he just has to take take his time and just dominate Blue Devils have missed six of their last seven shots from the floor down by four inside a nine to go in this first half Randol Childers Mike Monaco our entire crew with you from Southbend Indiana home of Mike Monaco oh yes I thought you were going to keep silent on that all game had to wait to the right time Burton for ji shot clock winding down on the Penn State transfer smooth move for two they are theyre sticking to the game plan they feel like they can attack inside and again theyre going to go after filipowski inside and theyve only taken six threes so far been doing it more in the paint like you said Jared McCain with a slow shooting start hes 0 of three now from long range yeah they got away with that one that was a mistakey shoe came off and and left him wide open I think McCain was surprised he was that wide open when he came off the screen cuz if you read the recent Scouting Report you wouldnt want to do that against Jared McCain The Freshman who in his last five is averaging 19 and a half per out to Booth shot clock winding down Burton dogged by roach he drives he floats couldnt finish rebound Mark Mitchell theyre going to be in that situation quite a bit because again Burtons the guy and when a shot clock gets low he can beat his man and make a play filipowski left alone cant connect from Deep Burton a block out and last Touch by McCain shots havent fallen yet from the outside for Duke and here at home Notre Dames got the sixpoint lead on number 14 ACC mens basketball

in a ranked on rank matchup you know the new head coaches by now and that includes right here in South Bend with michah Shrewsberry following 23 years of Mike Bray and then new faces ter of players including a couple of guards here tonight both playing at a very high level recently in Marcus Burton and Jared McCain Rand chers what sticks out to you from what weve seen so far today in the ACC with this being the final game of the night just conference play when youre in a conference it it doesnt matter Road you want to try to win as many road games as you can winning in conference play is hard winning on the road is even harder evenly matched teams you you know theres there are no gimmies and you see were watching this right now Dukes the number one team first Place team preseason pick first place in the ACC and then Fighting Irish are picked bottom team 15th Place team and you couldnt tell that by watching the first half the first 10 minutes of this this half right now Dukes got more turnovers than made buckets and Bren Shrewsberry Strokes a three the freshman and coachs son known for his work outside the yard great great play call there coming out of a Applause timeout this is as large as the lead has been for the fight Fighting Irish at nine a double on filipowski a good find to Roach out of it for three I think thats what he has to do that time he caught it know the double teams coming turn and face it I think at his s foot length hell throw over top of it du will get easy shots you just got to knock him down at that point that passing out of double something John Shys talked to us multiple times about this season heres Burton had to adjust against the seven footer length and then its a foul underneath on the Fighting Irish thats the one you want to give off to a teammate there just a great play coming out of the time out there you know Jeremy roach get hit on the screen and Bron knocks down to three in front of the Duke bench I wonder if he told his dad coming out of there give me the ball he might have he likes to shoot it from Long Range until the 76 of his field goal attempts have come from three meanwhile the 1 and one for Mark Mitchell 72 at the line this year you know its interesting with Bren Shrewsberry coachs son was living in State College Pennsylvania when Micah was finishing his two years there but Bren Shrewsberry knew Marcus Burton from the aaou circuit in Indiana so even before it was official who the new head coach is going to be those two guys were texting one another Well if your son isnt going to help you recruit then whos going to help you right spoken like a guy who also had a son play for him at the AC hey call that guy hey call him too yeah get as many as your friends as you can Brandon you didnt do enough recruiting no no third in by four Burton slashes and it rolled off great job there getting to the rim just couldnt finish though but at LED Duke burdens on the the bigger Mitch theyre going to have to come double him they do and Tay Davis forces to turnover thats the seventh for the Blue Devils buron off the screen and we get a foul away from the ball that goes on Tyrese Proctor and thats his first yeah Tyrese proor got caught up on the screen and Zona tried to roll and prevented him from rolling down just got stuck under to tried to get back in front of the ball just Music Applause couldnt talk to sh about this today too with all of his guys they got to do a better job of protecting the first foul sometimes youre just so casual with that first foul and then the second one comes and then you got to sit whats that mean treated as valuably as you have to I think you just start the game with players you dont think of it as much and if you got to be died in and protect the first one you dont want the first one to be some hand slap or theres times you get you draw you know foul and you have to you have to stop a layup or something like that but Davis burrowing underneath missed it and then roach helps secure it dke down four in transition Mitchell takes off and couldnt finish last Touch by Young well they want Mark Mitchell to be aggressive and he saw an opening Al that time he tried to avoid the contact a little bit had he taken it to the rim I think zon was in the the the No Charge area there and he tried to avoid the contact and they didnt blow the whistle for him had he gone to the rim straight to the rim I thought he would have got the foul career high 21 for Mitchell last time out in that big win against Syracuse on Tuesday at Cameron and John sh said he looked like himself Burton off the bounce loves the midrange kicks for Shrewsberry off a shot fake cant hit and a black out from Young great job there by Young fighting J on the blackboards theyre going to go you know they theyre theyre comfortable with who they are The Bigs are going to attack the glass shot goes up theyre running great job by Young there putting a body on him and didnt get the rebound but he kept his man from getting it Notre Dame plus one right now in rebounding boy michah Shrewsberry was not happy with the rebounding effort Wednesday against NC State roach Miss fires young an offensive rebound and it belongs to Notre Dame as young got bumped out of BS their name was minus five rebounding against NC State Michael shrewbury said it felt like minus 200 yeah he you got to defend the rebound if you want to play for him he doesnt care who you are and Im just surprised even though its a young team youd be surprised with their physicality they really do hit you and get after you heres ji banging with young lowering the shoulder gave it up John shy wanted a 3se second count Burton lost it to Roach second Mark is Burton turnover what a f roach to Young and its a twopoint Gain No One turns defense into offense better than this this Duke team does and Jeremy roach is probably the one player in a four I think can match Burton speed for Speed great job there in front of the ball creating the steal and finding the teammate feels like hes been Dukes best player no question this first half I I think hes been outstanding and you can you can make that argument hes been at the last four or five games truberry short filipowski pushes all the way to the rre and hes fouled by Braden Shrewsberry Duke with a chance to tie it at the line when we come back number 14 in the country getting everything it can handle from Notre Dame and South Ben so yeah USAA they always have my back USAA you were in the military oh no I wasnt but my grandpa was he joined USAA passed membership to my mom then to me theres other ways to get in yeah my neighbor Ron hes in cuz his wife served even little luna when shes born her dad served so all this time I could have had USAA insurance and banking wheres my phone over there USAA for the military community and their Music families Micah Shrewsberry had his signature press conference moment a couple of weeks ago after a loss here at home this game was over before we even got here we a have no energy to shoot around we a have any energy at practice thats who this team has been so a message needs to be sent to some of these guys that like if you dont play hard then you can sit and rot over there on the bench and Ill Ill find a way Ill go and talk to the people in compliance I will help you transfer cuzz this culture is getting built the right way and if you aint a part of it youre out and I dont Applause care a month and a half before that opening night of the Season he said honesty is probably my greatest strength and my greatest weakness he was foreshadowing just how honest he would be December the 19th coaches hung out inside their room a while after that 20point loss here at home to the Citadel and they looked at each other and they said were going to Remember December the 19th 2023 because it has changed how we approach really everything it its losses like that do stick with you how do you handle that and you can tell by the energy there that hey were going to deal with it were going to get better from it and this team has responded filipowski just missed both at the line for Duke with a chance to tie and now Tate Davis goes driving and is fouled by Ryan Young I think Tay Davis will have an advantage at that four spot of Dr off the bounce if he wants with particular if they go with a four five match up that time ripping and driving Young comes over a little late Davis misses the first coming up next the nothing but net crew will break down the day in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every mens game then theyll look ahead at the best matchups on the schedule in the coming week right here ACC Network and the ESPN Applause app and Davis misses both as well so filipowski and Davis both come up with nothing all right twopoint game three and a half to go in this first half at pcel Pavilion lowc scoring Affairs a lot of Notre a games are in terms of their Tempo wow one pass by filipowski to McCain a rounded out young battles on the boards and it will stay with d how about that pass from Philip psky yeah he knows its coming now and they theyre diving hard with their for man making that weak side guy have to take him so that skip will be there and hes just able to throw a direct pass and that puts so much pressure on your rotation when he does that tyes Proctor off the screen back out for foster jery roach the only guy whos made multiple shots for Duke filipowski missed another end close and hes 0 of five from the floor Burton had trouble with it and it does stay with Notre Dame with 5 Seconds to get it across midcourt I think Jared McCain has a point there I think the arvish got away with one his point being why are you diving no the point was that I dont think he hit the ball and I think thats up Music Burt well get a timeout well take it here as well 258 to go in the first half not d by Music two back in South Bend where Notre Dame led by as many as nine but right now Dukes on a 70 run theyve got it back within two but if youre fighting Irv youre not concerned because youre youre used to with their inability to consistently knock down threes they go through scoring droughts but their defense stays strong theyre still up two no reason to panic regroup lets see if coach what coach shury Drew up out of this timeout see if they can get a basket here Burton gets it across midcourt coming out of of the timeout so its Burton kesn Booth ji and Shrewsberry the five on the floor for the Fighting Irish Bren Shrewsberry no dice from Deep filipowski a strong Applause rebound Proctor probing and he turns it over ninth turnover for Duke and Burton finishes the lowski and roach running back out for Applause roach proor behind the back skips for roach out of the corner cant hit sometimes we forget that this this Duke team as talented as they are you know you look at the group thats out there now roach is the experienced guy theyre still relatively young themselves and they want to play with Pace but they want to share the ball and theyre not always doing that Jai had a roach on him underneath and then got stripped on the way up and theyve been trying try to run more recently John sh said we want to reintegrate Tyrese Proctor into that way we were playing without him and Proctor way off the mark from long range hes 0 for two now and still scoreless here in this first half and were in a rock fight I mean this we said before this was not going to be easy this this Irish team is a legit really good defensive team and theyre going to scrap and Claw and fight theyre going to play with a level of physicality but those things like that the careless turnovers a mistake are the things to holding this team back right now traveling on kesn so after keeping track at home weve got 16 turnovers in this first half Im going to say thats because of the defense not sloppy play lets go with that one narrowly edged out by 18 made bus in this first Music half 126 to go until halftime fellas are standing by for the halftime show in Bristol roach wow nice L navigates to the cup and hes got 10 the lead all scores he is playing extremely well right now and I honestly think hes the hes been Dukes best player the last couple of games hes just been really efficient on both ends of the floor he said it after the win over Baylor I felt like I didnt set the tone in our losses I wasnt leading the right way I wasnt doing what I needed to do played better since Burton pulls it back on Mitchell gives it up for booth The Freshman drop booth on the step through had it roll off and then a foul called on the rebounding action that goes against Kyle filipowski and thats two on Duke star roach just comes down and look at this in and out move here just comes off and just oh look at that with a nice Lefty L have some would you no ones playing better than that young man right now really playing at a high level and so much has been talked about Jared McCain and his stretch in the last five games but Jeremy roaches played equally as well shooting over 50 from the floor and 50 behind the threepoint line doing the last five games but also been taking care of the basketball four to one assist turnover ratio leaderships been outstanding and Dukes used to this theyre you know when they when they travel they play on the road theyre going to get everyones best shot because theyre Duke and you want to have a cleaner half than you have right now but still within three McCain saved it it was a shooting foul by the way just called late one of two for booth and then McCains got a chance at Brian a chance to tie just so many weapons and we talked about it him me his last five games being so efficient just catches that skip pass and just look at the hesitation gets the angle hes a physical guard too plays a lot of perimeter we we talked about his ability to catch and shoot and second in the league and catch and shoot threes but has the ball skills of getting the paint and the physicality in his body defense finishing there as well those transition threes which McCain hit a lot of them you see he had the 18 four triples Tuesday against Syracuse he said afterward its probably the best feeling in the world I wouldnt know can you confirm shooting anytime you could just shoot so much like that and when you giving a green like your coach allows you to take that and youre a good shooter like he is shooting over 40 yes well he thats help tie it up for Duke here with a half minute to go until halftime about 3 and 12 seconds separating the game clock and the shot clock here for the Fighting Irish theyre going to put Ryan Young on the ball screen here with Burton run Shrewsberry off a pin down McCain sticks with Burton Shrewsberry trouble on the catch Mitchell grabbed it along the sideline and threw a foul and 63 to work with for the Blue Devils and theyre going to the free throw line its a bad possession there for this young team and thats what you get when you deal with freshman BR shury comes up sets the ghost screen I think you seeing now coach Hur is telling telling this freshman point guard hey I didnt want you to pass it to him I wanted to clear out and give you your right handed drive and instead he tried to pass it over to his teammate and turned it over and now its a big possession big swing Applause here Mitchells get on the first you mentioned it earlier and you asked Michael shrew bear about it today with as much responsibility as Marcus Burton has running this team and being the leading scorer how do you manage him how do you him we saw it right there theyre talking on the fly so much more than the average head coach point guard relationship because he has as much responsibility on him as anyone and hes a freshman because this team needs his ball handling hes the guy like right now he has to go back and get the ball for this team to get it up fouls to give for Duke so Blakes commits one on Jr kesn with Duke grabbing its first lead of the night and they shouldnt this is part of a young team like they had the shot clock could have kept before the last shot of the half turned it over and then commit the foul and now Duke gets the lead and you got 29 seconds here to try to come up with a play to you know to tight this game or take the lead Music again so 29 some subs from Micah Shrewsberry KES to put it in with ji Shrewsberry Burton and Davis the other four with him kesn wants somewhere to go with it find Shrewsberry off the bounce for three and too strong to send us to half time you see thats part of what it played there again had 29 second gives you a chance to get at least two dribbles off nine points for the preseason number two team in the country against Micah Shrewsberry and this Notre Dame group pick last in the ACC preseason pole theyve struggled mightily the only one thats got going in the offensive end is Jeremy roach and just been really good and expect to see the ball in his hands more in the second half and no reason to panic just continue to play the way youve been playing he had 10 points on six shots Tate Davis at 69 burrowing in against Mark Mitchell and then Davis commits a foul thats his second I think Mark MIT Mitchell is the most difficult guy to attack here hes so physical hes so strong hes the one guy on Duke team that can guard all Five Guys on the floor and I think i pick on someone else known for his defense we both loved him had them on our all ACC defense ballots last year we did so physically strong and athletic Foster is swatted by carry boo more defense from Notre Dame to your point Davis whos a 69 guard in the words of his head coach gave it up to kzne he left it short he only had two points in the first half as well averages about 10 in transition McCain back for roach spins it out Mitchell on the offensive glass and a foul great job there getting the paint up kicking it out Jeremy Rose knocks now shoots the three and and Mitchell just cleans it up I mean thats what he does to get himself active we we talked about him early in the game and just really just does a great job they dont have to run offense for him but he has to make you guard him keep you honest and he can do that by going to the offensive glass John sh said to us today it was Christmas break they developed a plan for Mark Mitchell with how teams have been guarding him its been well documented sagging off of him and begging him to shoot the first part of their plan was the mental side of it they said to him it doesnt mean youre a bad player that theyre sagging off of you and daring you to shoot well just its just scheme when you play against Duke youre not going to leave the other guys hes the one guy you have to say hey if were going to live with Duke were not going to let roach beat us were not going to from the threepoint line M K or Foster or Proctor you know youre going to say hey hes struggling from behind the ark they just got a plan for him to continue to play and filipowski blocked it and then Jai couldnt follow it up heres Mitchell underneath against booth and he gets blocked by Applause chai Booth running the floor he had it wrestled Away by roach and getting a little Helter Skelter here yeah thats just two freshman there you Burton shouldnt pass to the big run in right there you dont want to give him a bounce pass shot fake McCain on the drive got his own Miss right back up and he missed it in too deep what you say Rock fight with about 9 seconds left in the first half thats what it is I think both teams are competing at a high level in a defensive end I mean Booth off Target from deep I do think sometimes the Irish take quick bad shots like that one I think its youre okay with that shot but you dont want to be one pass a quick shot youre in control this game is being played at your pace but this Duke team is really explosive their name O for five since halftime these teams combined one for 11 McCain cant change that rebound Applause kesn McCains two of nine now an 0 for five from three Mighty confident freshman we told you hes been so good recently hes around 50 from three for the season Burton turns it over again its Mitchell leading the break and Mitchell all the way to the cup and Mark Mitchell forces a noted aim timeout hes leading the way for Duke out of halftime Music best player on the floor out of halftime no question has been Mark Mitchell hes missed the do it all for right now for Duke hes really active on the defensive and this is how he impacts the game and Duke needs him to do this he gets def flexion gets the steal goes Coast to Coast he just does so many different things and hes finding his niche in his offense he wants him sh wants him to be aggressive he doesnt care he tells him the worst thing he can do do its just stay and now you see him hes active hes like N9 and N hes on his way to a double double and leading his Duke team in rebounding and thats how he helps him he can attack the offensive glass he can rebound and push it and he forces you to guard him when he doing when he doing those things when he just standing on the threepoint line he tend to Sag off of him and thats the Scouting Report its more the same from what he did you saw Tuesday against Syracuse those careerhigh 21 points John CH said after that game look its not easy playing it du theres a lot of criticism and no doubt Mark Mitchell heard that in the first chunk of the season but hes responded Wellen shuberry with a response for Notre Dame and that was much needed from D they needed that first basket here in the second half and felt like Duke was getting control of things and that shot just puts him right back in his game filipowski got a Roper on him Mitchell does that so dont hesitate be decisive do that and get to a spot where you can hit that shot get to the Elbow right there knock that 15 footer down now if he continues to do that what are you going to do now now you got to come out of the paint thats going to free things up for the guards and filipowski TRW Barry hits another ra shuberg is doing what he does got to find him now theyre attacking Duke on that pick and roll and drops and knowing they got a tag giving him a second or two and he doesnt need but a quick second to get that off Mitchell takes it this time one way or another they want him to be decisive and they want his feet underneath him on threes like that because you know now you know whats coming now you see a few go go in the basket this time now hes ready to take that three and then have to shoot a lot but its a percenters to go up its only a second one on a year had been one for 22 coming in and how can you not just feel good for him on a human level no one likes to see that someone sagging off you so much consistently throughout the season and look at the confidence hes playing with here in the second half he just needs to get in on a move he doesnt have to stand there and stay stationary McCain got bumped and its a foul on rer sends us to a timeout Mark Mitchell leading the way for Duke hes up to 14 points hes got nine rebounds as well and he has powered the Blue Devils in front he G you want to Sag off from here take that knock down a three duke up six here so Music B so yeah USAA they always have my back USAA you were in the military oh no I wasnt but my grandpa was he joined USAA passed membership to my mom then to me theres other ways to get in yeah my neighbor Ron hes in cuz his wife served even little luna when shes born her dad served so all this time I could have had USAA insurance and banking wheres my phone over there USAA for the military community and their families tomorrow afternoon right here on acc Network have a womens basketball quadruple header starts with number 13 Virginia Tech against number three NC State thats a noon Eastern then its Georgia Tech pit number 22 Florida State and Clemson and we wind things down at 6 Eastern with BC and number 25 Syracuse how about Mark Mitchell 14 points nine rebounds you said Randolph his second threepoint make of the Season John CH told us today we looked at all 22 threepointers he had attempted he told the 16 of them he was just shooting because he was open so thats what youre talking about with be decisive you cant hesitate like this Mitchell again just like that hes not thinking hes just playing when you know sometimes when teams scheme you that way youre just stand in there you just shoot it because youre open you think thats what youre supposed to do youre not shooting it to make it with a purpose and right now hes playing with confidence and thats going to make this Duke team really dangerous because we know all the other guys can really score it now you got to guard him all by eight this is as large as their lead has been tonight Burton got filipowski switched onto him moves it for Roper shot clock winding down defended by Mitchell rooper drives on a reverse much needed for the Irish great job driving in there and using a rim for protection and shooting the reverse layup Northwestern transfer Julian Roper who is banging with filipowski gets saddled with a foul its third game back from a foot in meanwhile 16 and9 for Mark Mitchell well he knows the double teams coming and he went and they they lifted their help and no one was there wont get an easier one to that just a great drive and finish there Philip Pals got to get over there to rotate a little earlier but Rob did a great job there getting there quick before helping come filipowski going to work on Kevin ji still held without a Midfield goal yeah hes missed a couple of bunnies in there tonight rer was calling for it in the corner near side bottom left of your screen hes feeling good hurton driving on McCain and now Shrewsberry hurton no dice from Deep rer runs it down hes been a turbo shot of energy thats one concern that Sher had was the guards rebound shury Ro for these guys from the wing they will attack the offensive glass and Sh cant be happy with that like you see shot goes up theyre running in and theyre not giving up on the play and this team is going to fight for everything they dont play pretty but they they play effective for their style of basketball again its what John shy said to us worried about Notre Dames offensive rebounding yes and John sh did say to us that he feels like Duke has been better rebounding recently than some of the struggles early in the season he knows theyre going to give up some offensive rebound against bigger teams how about this Kevin Dr keeps it alive saves it off a foot thats just wanting it more there thats just a 5050 ball ji wanted it more and those are the things that upset you as a coaching staff you can see shs not happy and thats where Philip palsky can be better hes not scoring offensively do the little things like rebound the ball and get yourself going on the offensive end of the floor as well attacking the glass they run Shrewsberry off the screen playing off two feet and now Jai with a shot clock below 10 heres Burton scoreless in the second half these first six minutes Philip psky on him Burton drives around the corner no and then Burton was out of bounds so it belongs to Duke I think Burton there had the angle just lost lost his footing there at the end couldnt Music Elevate just really quick and getting in the paint Proctor filipowski Blakes young and roach the five for John shy ball screen for Proctor a switch from Davis and now roach to filipowski with a mismatch its a double filipowski backs it out cant stick the three yeah you can tell hes frustrated now and double team came he wants to get himself going and the double team came Burton off the crossover found J double team came just lifted out elevating a shot of three J had it roll out but drew a foul on young though the Dame is controlling the paint and theyre controlling it on both ends of the floor I think thats why you see the Duke playing with the big lineup theyre going to try to get Ryan Young on some post touches and try to get filipowski on the switch and not that the double teams coming but he ends up lifting out taking that three thats what you see right now why Duke is so frustrated hey you talked about the responsibility for Marcus Burton for someone who hasnt done it especially as a freshman which you did what is the burden like that he feels playing almost the whole game against this kind of pressure and trying to solve guys on defense like Mitchell and like filipowski he has so much responsibility thats why his numbers I hope voters take this into consideration has so much responsibility because he doesnt have another ball handle and hes a small guy hes only 511 and teams are picking him up full court theyre pressuring him when a shot gets low its hey go bail us out go make a play J 6 and youre already thinking about what ACC all freshman balance voters that sort of thing Im one of those guys I dont know where people get that from its too early to talk about anything dont the games in November count like they count too oh this its too early to talk about the tournament yeah until you dont get in Bur for three rings it out youre piece of work man hey Im telling the truth took it back and got fouled by y thats the part thats frustrating with I think with SH is that right now theres no theres no the Dame team is competing off the crowd theyre winning the 5050 balls and theyre keeping themselves in the game theyre just mucking the game up theyre just making it just they just getting dirty and grimy and its not pretty and thats the way they want it youre not going to get to your scoring average right now with the way this team is defending we talked about it thats just how they play and he said that he didnt emphasize his offense with this group this team is going to get better because they emphasize defense its where he wants it and then now theyre going to start getting better with on the offensive end of the floor hes a selfdescribed defense first coach look at him hes fired up with JR kesn on the sideline and he has said throughout the year were doing it defensively with effort right now he says were not really understanding the systems we dont have the basketball IQ because of our youth the way we eventually will so to be where they are defensively playing well on that end it comes out effort thats the one thing that you can do no matter what age you are you can play hard and you can play defense and you can learn you can be out physical with from a freshman standpoint look at this guy he is on a row now Mark Mitchell with another dunk hes up to 18 and 10 the 10 rebounds are a career high and its the first career double double for Mark Mitchell I think his career high on points hes 21 I think hell get that really going out on a limb there 18 points in 12 minutes to go like to do that thanks for that that was helpful i like to jump out there and say stuff like that heres roer shot clock wi and down Roper Rises cant hit roach runs it down and Mitchell leading the way with the 18 roach had the 10 all in the first half heres Mitchell again driving dish Blakes into the lane and Blakes lost it another turnover number 11 for Duke who has a fourpoint lead inside at 12 to go in the second half at South Bend Dukes got 14 points in the second half and Mark Mitchells got every last one of he does and hes doing it in every way hes going to the glass hes finishing taking it coast to coast and laying it up hes getting it on a move and now hes getting comfortable confidence knocking down jump shot at the midrange knocked down his second three of the Year here he is I think hes made the adjustment of how to play how to adjust to how teams are playing him right now I think hes found his Niche hes outscored Notre Dame as well since halftime 1412 Mitchell against Notre Dameon 8 plus minutes out of the break he has and lets see if ilowski he hasnt scored but his impact on it has been good as well because some of the basket that Mitchell is getting hes hes getting him because of filipowski and their ability to or they forced to have the double team Jamal Spearman one of the officials just brought over what is that a gum wrapper something from the cheer crew no its just yeah he gave it to you and said Merry Christmas he appreciated uh your prediction on Mark Mitchells career high that was there you go I jumped out there Burton kesn Shrewsberry ji and boot the five for Micah Shrewsberry Burton being dogged Again by roach kesn drives lost the handle kesn tried to save it off McCain and couldnt dozen turnovers for the Fighting Irish something theyve struggled with this season they have and thats what we talked about not having multiple handlers thats what Duke wants to try to force the fight Irish to do someone else other than b to make a play Proctor filipowski McCain want to leave him just great ball reversal so many weapons on this team right now with Mitchell playing the way he is its just a matter of time for The Other Guys knock down shots MC been 0 for five from three hes been so hot recently from long range Burton bumped by a roach who thought that Burton initiated the contact he does and next Saturday a basketball triple header starts with number 16 Clemson try to bounce back couple of losses now for the Tigers they host Boston College in Little John to start us off at three Eastern the number 14 Duke against Georgia Tech at Cameron and finally Miami Virginia Tech in blackburg here on accn buron a hand off around the ja screen Burton kicks Davis Rises can hits one arm rebound underneath by chai and the stick back great job there got the switch had roach on him inside didnt get the ball but again when youre big and on the switch you dont get it thats how you make your impact go to the offensive glass Kevin G the Penn State transfer coming off maybe is two most productive games of the year 10 six against Virginia and then 11 rebounds against DJ Burns in the wolf pack Wednesday yeah hes hes got some starter experience in Philip pasi there it is for K filipowski on his eighth attemp is first made its frustrating for big at times when you double team team because you dont feel like youre a part of the game but when you have his skill set and you can step out and knock down threes you know theyre not going to double you there Kowski sticks it 32 from three this season pass the Midway point of the second half Duke by eight on the road where they havent won a game this year in their first two true Road games shot clock winding down on the freshman Marcus Burton had it roll off shooting above Proctor pushes McCain moves it Proctor hoist it can hit rebound chai good possession there by Duke open three after a really good defensive possession there shuberry off the screen and hes hot 4 three for Braden Shrewsberry who in his last four games coming in only had 16 points hes got a dozen here against D hes did a couple of big shots theyve gotten down big and theyve gone to him coming off down stre again someone else his way of contributing is off down screens and catching the shooting is his strength filipowski driving too strong and Tate Davis has it Notre Dame trying to make it a one possession game Burton accelerates to the basket chance at three for Marcus Burton and his first points in the second half just a great job there you couldnt tell from your angle but Burton looks he sees the help the cutter goes through there you see McCain going and he just takes off beats roach finishes and gets the a one just a great job there by the young freshman showing you his growth so he sort of saw a clear out in effect and an open Lane yes he had a teammate in the corner teammate cut through and McCain turned his head and he just changed the gear he has a gear about him and he can he can he can get from one to 10 Quake let me run this one by a little undersized guard in the ACC who seems to bounce off bodies I see a little Chris likes buying that at all bounc I will say Chris was really athletic and he was a little bit more compact you know hes probably shorter I think hes a little taller than Chris but his game is speed and hell get stronger as he grows and he develops and he has enough speed to be effective hes already a heck of a player right now as a freshman I replaces him eight and 1 half to go twopoint game Proctor prosos McCain got two in the air and the fouls on the floor D Davis fifth foul on Notre Dame with 21 to go in the second half you got to be okay with that foul they are flying around nothings easy for this Duke team theyre giv multiple effort efforts and thats what you want to see theyre helping one another just doing a heck of a job here theyre going to make Duke earn this every every Point filipowski flashes to the block draws the double finds McCain oh hes heating up here it comes Applause McCain so impressive about Philip palowski again he he shouldnt get frustrated the double team is coming he knows its coming now it may be time for fight Irish to make an adjustment there and traveling the call on matona the lowski was pressed down on him forces another turnover well who is going to join Mark Mitchell Jared McCain has entered the chat here in the second half for Duke catching this this pass directly from the KN from uh Philip palsky there knocking down a three duke up five here great game here in sou look back at the history of Notre Dame and Micah Shrewsberry following some lineage the last 50 years and of course most recently following a legend here in South B 23 seasons of Mike Bray and if nerd playing a basketball game in South Bend Indiana AT forel Pavilion you know whos going to be in the house Digger Phelps is absolutely always going to be there yes he is and he always comes over to us and talk to us about it you know every time weve had a game here and he comes over and us but he reminds me of like even my old former coach they dont like this three balls and all the shots you know they like the old school ball where you get more inside and everything kind of like this modern day game with Digger attentively watching a good one here in South Ben Duke by five the number 14 team in the country on a fivegame winning streak Jared McCain cant hit another Kev ja got the rebound Michael Shrewsberry the first year head coach with his group playing better basketball in the last week a win last weekend here against Virginia by more than 20 and then a game they lost by two to NC State on Wednesday Marcus Burton underneath backs it out to Julian rooper who supplied good energy here in the second Music half rer a deep one cant hit hit and a foul on the rebounding action goes against Duke you know John shy on one side seconde head coach someone here in attendance knows a little bit about what John chs been going through Notre Dame football head coach Marcus Freeman like shy in his second year they share the same agent so they caught up at shoot around this morning and had a chance to connect theyve stayed in touch a little bit the last couple of years if Marcus Freeman first row well they got a lot in common and we talked about that two young head coaches theyre they have young children and I didnt know coach Freeman has six kids yes and I know coach sh has three and theyre young and when youre youre the head coach of demanding Elite programs it just demands so much on your time and its one of the things I always ask sh when I see him its first thing is hows your family because I know this job and people dont understand how difficult it is for coaches and their time the demand on their time and theyre away from their families just and uh you know he always apprecia that and thats one of the things he talked to Freeman about yeah pretty neat meanwhile the foul was called on Caleb Foster his second and as you can see the officials are at the monitor Lee casselle and Jamal Spearman perhaps seeing if there is a flagrant foul to be called here Philip palsky definitely sold it like there was contact so I dont think its anything look just basketball plays yeah I think you let it go I dont think theres anything their arms are just tangled up theyre fighting for position position and I think some of that is that Philip p probably got caught in the throat but I didnt think it was anything intentional I think it would just be a common Music foul yeah Tommy morrisy just looked over at us and said nothing nothing extra there on the foul call yeah he didnt intentionally try to do anything and I think Philip house is probably more upset that it was the foul called I think hes upset he just didnt think he did anything to Warrant the foul well keeps possession with Notre Dame with 716 to go trailing by five against number 14 in the country this has been a rockus crowd with a lot of Duke Blue in the building we should say here in South Ben bton theyre doing a great job of getting him on the Move getting those bodies off of him getting him on the move a lot want him to use his speed in this really good midrange game 14 points on six of 17 shooting Burtons been busy tonight one possession game Proctor around the corner a switch from Davis Mitchell left alone hits another Mark Mitchell had been one for 22 from three this year and hes got two triples tonight I think he has figured it out and taking shots like that he shot 35 a year ago he is a much better shooter than he shot this year just taking shots being in the right place knowing when youre going to get the shot I think at the key as well McCain didnt bite on Burton shot clock winding down on tay Davis the seat in Hall transfer got the roll around Mitchell great move there by Dave Davis just keep attacking the paint getting an angle there finishing over Mark Mitchell who I think is an elite Defender Davis with seven Duke by four filipowski working on Davis filipowski gives it up to Proctor on the repost filipowski single coverage banging and a foul is called on the floor uh Tay Davis so Mark Mitchells hit two threes he has for now matched his career high of 21 its one as way I told you it was coming there again game plan is to Sag off him and leave him open for that shot and hes knocked down a couple let me ask you this what goes through the mind of a shooter when you slump the way Mitchell has compared to how he was last year about 35 from three I I think you know when teams started scheming you was different because in your mind psychologically you start thinking am I a weak link and I think thats something that hes go through because hes an accomplished player youre just not used to doing that and like coach sh told him its not anything against you its just the way teams are scheming us McCain off a screen and he couldnt hit Mitchells been great mean that foul was on Tate Davis his fourth so he goes to the bench with inside of six to go he has been a secondary ball handler at times this year even with his size something youve been talking about all night you just get concerned for Burton you will he wear down over the course of the game tried to snake the screen drag the pivot foot and now Booth driving out of the corner tough turnaround Music no really good possession there by the Blue Devils protecting that paint cutting off Burton and making boo take a really good contested shot there you feel like filipowski has defended pretty well in space against Burton around screens I think theyre feel really good about him guarding him on the perimeter the difference is that when he gets inside against smaller guys it worries him fourpoint margin Duke in front 505 to go come on back its a South band after Music this Notre Dames down by four if theyre going to come back and grab a lead the recipe to do it is what I I think you got to helped Burton I think and continue to defend defensively theyve given themselves chance theyre going to need somebody else making shots trb has gotten hot you know knock down a couple of Threes who else is going to step up and make shots its just so much pressure on the Freshman guard to create for everyone they got someone else has to figure out a way to help 5 minutes to go duke has the ball and the lead filipowski with a face up on Kevin chai goes spinning filipowski no and the rebound to Carri boot trying to get him going without the double team they knew they were double teaming him in the post and I think he can do more of that just catching it facing up driving making plays hes now one of 10 shooting Burton stops on a dime left it well short thats a spot he loves great job by McCain there being able to stop and contest that forc bird to Arc it just a little bit more than he wanted to and came up short Michael Shrewsberry is in a defensive stance himself trying to will his team to a stop thats a bump on Burton at a foul and itll send Jeremy roach to the free throw line thats what a freshman thats thats just a SC youre taking advantage of experience there roach gets the angle initiates the contact and forces the ref have to make a call second on Burton so roaches to the line 82 this year 77 for the career of the twotime captain good on the front Applause end yeah you want the ball in his hands come late hes battle tested shot 82 on a year makes both hes been such a stabilizer the last month and a half or so in particular for Duke I think hes been their most consistent player I think everyone else has had their highs and lows I just think hes been really consistent its on both ends of the floor as well sixpoint margin Burton is directing traffic he played 33 plus minutes tonight with four to go to the corner Booth gives it up someones got to step up and help him Burton off the bounce drags it back hits maybe not just give me the ball and get out the way thats what hes telling his guys right now average 30 a game as a senior just down the road last year best player in the state of basketball Rich Indiana try to will not her name back down by four roach created space left it short Mitchell on the glass and its a held ball thatll keep it at this end to the floor when we come back Duke woke up at the end of the first half mark Mitchells been the star can Marcus Burton The Freshman will the Fighting Irish back in South Bend within four with 329 to Music go the war Rift is expanding all worlds within the galaxian veil will be consumed this difficulty Demands a specialist and ease specialists yeah thats me GEICO makes it easy to get coverage for what you care about cars Apartments jewelry jewry and what about the walk Rift of go you there you go dust in the cartridge goon from Cars to renters to jewelry its easy to Geico how about this day in the ACC Carolina by 10 Clemson we had Wake Forest in overtime by 4 against Miami BC in comeback fashion by eight against Georgia Tech Florida State by three with a review at the end against Virginia Tech and Tallahassee and here in South End to close down the day 5753 Dukes got the lead on Notre Dame Duke has led the entire second half Notre Dame has gotten as close as two out of halftime yeah were getting down to the guts of the game here and Duke is going to try to keep him at arms length and know that a needs to get a stop here and continue to do what theyre doing put pressure on the r controler paint hes Rand chers Im Mike Monaco this game produced by Robert ringer and directed by Tyler Honeycut turnover has been an issue for Notre Dame and Mark Mitchells been an issue for Notre Dame here he is left alone so decisive one way or another wasnt going to shoot that so he didnt when he had the space just move it you know if he was going to shoot it catch and and shoot it right away Kyle filipowski gives it up to Tyrese Proctor can knock it down Braden Shrewsberry the rebound and Tyrese Proctor still scoreless through 37 minutes meanwhile for the Fighting Irish who else helps out Marcus Burton hes got a team High 16 points hes taken 19 shots hes turned it over four times hes been under a lot of pressure shot clock winding down moves it for Davis back in with four fouls Davis drives cant finish batt it around Davis lays it in twopoint game shur is calling for the crowd to get in this game they need to do it now he hasnt had a game like this in this building in this job yet until now roach for filipowski filipowski drives got it to go and a foul thats what you want to see from your All American thats what you want to see team needs a basket catches it giv a little shot fake there just takes the contact finishes gets the n one thats what you want to see you can struggle all game long but when its time to close you cant you cant win close games if you dont have a closer and I think du has multiple guys they can put the hands they put the ball in their hands for baskets but hes got to be the guy we talked about dominating had had a dominant performance but hes got to dominate in these moments he couldnt stamp it after just his second made bucket on a night in which she has faced a steady stream of double teams from the Fighting Irish who Trail by four coming up on two to go in the second half its Caleb Foster on Marcus Burton freshman on freshman Burton to the Elbow Shrewsberry comes to help out nearly a double dribble now Tay Davis five to shoot Davis drives spins and a foul is called on Mark Mitchell its great job there just getting a whistle there by Davis I mean hes a spinner when he gets in there drives to his left he wants to get back to that right hand and I think Mitch was like Hey I knew it was coming and couldnt stop it Tay Davis to the line 68 this year short on the first you could see it from when it left his hand yeah n name had some trouble with free throws in the final minute against NC State Wednesday they missed a couple of big front ends of one and ones including one from Davis who comes up empty oh man thats what youre deal with when youre learning how to win when youre learning how to win games and how to close games thats what this young team will figure out down the road and the last two ACC games theyve been in this one in NC State theyve been right there these are game situations yeah you got to make free throws there and but theyre still in this one they got time to defend Kapowski too strong trying to run down his own Miss and McCain tipped it out to Foster fresh 20 for Duke inside a 90 to go in the second Music half trying to pick the match up here theyre trying to ISO it here give Caleb Foster right hand he drives too strong Mitchell the rebound and the stick back Mark Mitchell have a Applause night continue to get himself going here he is proven to you he is out of this slump and I think I won to bet when I told you he was going to score going to get a career high today well hang on a sec it appeared a timeout was taken with 102 to go the Duke player started going to the Duke sideline and Lee Cassel keeps everybody on the floor I think everybody thought sh Michael was calling a timeout shb was calling his guys over I think they was under the interpretation that he was going to call a timeout he was just trying to get his point guard to come over to him so he could draw a play tell him to play you did not see that much if ever no no no Burton on the dribble handoff gets bumped by Jared McCain and the one in one is coming for Marcus Burton an 82 free throw shooter yeah you need these two if you know to a get yourself down its only get to a fourpoint game got plenty of time you got to go down and get a stop see I think hes driven up so he says he says to jam spearm didnt take a timeout all right so the Whistle Stop play yep inadvertent whistle and everybody stay put that almost got Harry a great job by the officials recognizing that hey just throw it in bounds and get going Burton was good on the first expect some type of full court pressure now makes the second JR kesn sizing up where to be at the head of the snake its a double on Foster and a foul is called thatll put Caleb Foster at the line for the one and one this is where Duke is really difficult to defend because they have multiple handlers I mean even Philip psky can help be a you know break the Press so with the three guard lineup any one of the three can initiate offense weve seen Mitchell push it and again not many centers can Guard filipowski full court from a Notre Dame perspective you would rather foul Foster 62 than you would roach McCain Proctor and filipowski and Mitchell to for that matter and hes a better free throw shooter than his number suggest wow all the way around and out for Caleb Foster 45 seconds to go Notre names got it down by four Burton off the bounce and it was last Touch by filipowski with 419 to go and now Michael Shrewsberry will take a timeout give it to me now with two remaining he uses one hey AC CPM with pack and Taylor his weekdays from Marks Charlotte studio in his basement starting at 4 Eastern all the latest from around the conference and guests from around the ACC as well right here on accn and the ESPN app all right so if you havent been with us throughout this game ner busted out really from chump Street in this first half they led by as many as nine getting late in that first half but Duke woke up headed toward halftime led by Mark Mitchell now in the second half they have led this half throughout but Notre Dame has stayed within Striking Distance oh they right there and I think coming out of his timeout now you know you got to settle your young group down and you got to talk them through these moments and they dont need a three here theyre down four continue to play Draw Something if you get a fou stop the clock even better but you got to get multiple plays in so youre going to try to get a basket here preferably a two if you get an open three youll take it set your defense up and you probably have to foul depending on how much time you uh you know you take on his possession you know so if youre down two you know you got to make a decision does shrewbury want to take does he want to the whole possession to go and then try to say hey we got to make one stop and come down and tie it or will he foul I mean thats part of what he has to decide right here but all thats decided on how much time does it take for them to get this shot attemp against John shires Duke team on a fivegame winning streak and trying to win on the road for the first time this year kesn into Shrewsberry 40 seconds to go Shrewsberry drives and turns it over to Roach got a foul now roach gives it up they soak seconds inside a 30 to go before the foul after a turnover from Braden Shrewsberry and the Irish didnt even get a shot off its a good possession there by Duke he tried to get in the paint and filipowski came over and held his ground and just a great job in defensive in there for the Blue Devils 14 turnovers for mik Shrewsberry team and Jeremy roach to the line three for three tonight 82 like we said this year and hes good on the first yeah hes not the guy you want to put here hes been there before now your situation of basketball comes into play you can come down get a quick quick two there or your situation was where you started running your your threepoint execution shots roach makes both try to let it run up if you can just like that now you got to to go Burton does down by six Burton to his spot over the sevenfooter short offensive rebound chai and its down to a fourpoint game with 208 to go duke you got multiple handles you just want to get in in bar one of your better free throw shooters you got two timeouts if you need them roach on a step through and he gets fouled so hes going right back to the line and hes the guy you want if youre the Blue Devils in John shy well you can see Mitchell there was looking for him McCain came to get it the Freshman Foster went to get it he looking for the senior the guy he knows feels comfortable knocking down those free throws thats been in that situation handful of times 14 points just one turnover today from Jeremy roach the twotime captain and the senior for this Duke team ranked 14th in the country that started shoot around surrounding their head coach John shy who again said to his team guys if we want to do something special this year we have to prove that we can do it away from Cameron and tonight is the first step of trying to do that and they got to learn how to win away from Cameron as you said and they they figured out a way to to win this game again throw out the records this is this this conference in general and it gets a lot of national slander there are no easy games on the road I dont care where do you go and Dam star is doing a heck of a job so its arry there in Syracuse and shury is letting everybody know his team is for Real as well Philip psky with a block on Burton and then a foul of roach and that will just about do it in southbound heck of an effort there about to Fighting Irish again theyre learning how to compete learning what it takes to win in games like this the efforts there they got to learn to control their emotions and stop taking some quick shots I think itll help them on the offensive end and how about Duke I mean give those guys credit Mitchell seems to have figured out how to attack teams thats you know the sagging off him clogging up the paint he keeps putting up numbers like this youre going to have to get out of paint and guard him on a perimeter Chris Carwell told us before the season opened that Mark Mitchell is the biggest key to our season yes if they get this from Mark Mitchell whats it do to do well they dont need this but if they get this then theyre unbeatable and even on the night when everyone else struggled like no one else on the offensive end outside of Jeremy roach played well tonight they frustrated filipowski with the double teams and he has to do a better job of handling those but a great job they respond it theyre learning how to win on the road great job out of blue 6759 Duke wins it its first road win of the season
