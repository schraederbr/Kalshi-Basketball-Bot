got to be a good one its going to be a good one Matt Zona and Harland OA as Niagara win the tip and theyll start off on offense look for a lot of sets here uh the purple Eagles run a lot of perimeter sets getting a lot of movement a lot of touches Baloo an opening kicks off to the wing bis drives in gets stuck in the paint has to kick back back off to bumbaloo great defense by the Irish working in is Henderson The Freshman gets fouled going to the r just a little bit of a hesitation there and went for a ball fake you guys stayed down in that situation Burton goes flying out after that ball fake and that led to the drive in a foul Henderson one of three freshmen here today making their first career start yes between these two teams Fresh Faces he didnt look like a freshman shooting that free throw you know if you can see the ball go through the net right away thats always a good sign if youre youre a freshman getting your first start Anderson makes his first two baskets in Collegiate basketball now Burton and the Irish will set up their offense Burton and Shrewsberry the two other freshman making their first career start Davis at the top of the key launches a three goes out of Applause bounds yeah Im not sure coach hury would say hey we want our big taking the three after two passes you know theyre going to see the Irish do a lot of cutting a lot of moving the balls not going to stick the balls going to keep moving AR lineup features bumbaloo transfer from Ball State twoway guy as well an off ball foul against the offense y got a moving screen there a double stagger screen a little moving screen you got to be stationary thats been a point of emphasis here the last three years in college basketball a bright future for this point guard right here from the backyard pen high school high school coach Al rhods is right here watching his his uh young player play Shrewsberry takes it to the rack cant get it off the iron Henderson run the point both teams manto man Anderson drives in quick switch off looking kobang menah Henderson from the corner three Ahmad Henderson five points for Niagara all five points coming from the Freshman yeah really good start if youre Niagara you want to see an opportunity to get a lead get a little the nerves out of the way and sure enough uh uh their freshman steep and hit some big shots for him oper sees a lane TR to go to the basket stuck underneath forces it up the transfer from Northwestern gets it in just muscled that one in you know took advantage of a smaller guard and so he took him to the paint did a great job of pivoting without without traveling knocked in the first bucket for Notre Dame passes off to Henderson bumbaloo off the Baseline into the corner again another Corner three this time for oing menza the purple Eagles have got off to a perfect start Shrewsberry Works off the pick and roll now to go back out oper trying to take it down into the B get it into the paint has it POS get picked by Bess oper on their expiring shot clock has it tipped around bubble comes down with the rebound Ager looking to push the ball a little bit long three hes filling it Anderson with a little bit of a heat check now Burton The Freshman cant get it to go again this is the first start you know and youre going to expect freshman to get a little nervous and actually all these not Dame players are in their first start so uh its going to just take a little bit of time to that first timeout to kind of get uh their feet setteled inang Mena trying to go big against Davis Davis works the rebound itll be a kick ball against bumbaloo yeah a lot of team lot of both teams have a lot of young people out there this is their first experience and so it takes those first four minutes to kind of figure out whats going on the game will slow down eventually for both teams and again for the Irish with five new people on the floor its going to take a little while none of them have it ever played for Coach Shrewsberry as well Davis going into the paint going high off the glass cant get it oang menza comes down with the rebound Alis will slow down the offense for Niagara Henderson for another three no good off the glass and that was a little quick shot co paulus didnt really like that shot a little quicker than than he would like to see Burton with the jumper off the iron y d has had good looks by the guards it just has not dropped bumbalo gets it and heres a young man that grew up in Indiana Im sure that he would have loved to play at another Dame and is finally happening as a fifth year player from Ball State Burton crosses mid Court line gives it to Davis sherberry for three cant have it come down and hit nylon yeah I think theres a little Panic right now you know youre down by eight youre taking quick shots you just need to get settled in run the offense and eventually youll get good looks that youre going to break the defense down bis what a shot from the senior hes the veteran of the team hes got a lot of experience so you would look for him to have a good game here tonight oper top of the key Davis thought about a three rolls around its a foul that will bring us to our first media timeout Niagara leading by 10 here in South Music Ben being an NFL fan is the greatest unless youre home per of their points and you can see the numbers here its staggering Notre Dame is pretty much starting fresh yes its a new season its a new start all fresh people out here and you know its going to take a little bit of adjustment but uh well see how everybody reacts here this next four minutes Burton takes it into the paint gets by Henderson however theyll wave it off hell be a player control foul against the freshman Marcus Burton yeah he kind of came in there and kind of hooked with the left hand left arm got a hook situation and uh they made that a tough call but yeah he swung with his left H uh now they got to take a look at it I guess but I didnt see anything that was going to be flagrant at all yeah theyre going to go take a look at it on the monitor see if they want to elevate this to a flagrant and I think youll see a lot of this early in the year as officials also get squared up but they dont see anything its time to play that that was quick oh my quick one there it will not be elevated to a flagrant just it will remain a player control foul thats Marcus Burton his Applause first home crowd not too happy with that here in personel Pavilion Hometown kid they didnt like that they was to bumbaloo wide open cant get the roll look the Irish they move the ball here a lot better in these possessions offensively dont let the ball stick asne hands it off to Booth oper trying to go in goes underneath gets the roll a big basket for the iris and you would expect that the Northwestern transfer to come in and get him some quality minutes hes a veteran hes been in the Big 10 hes not going to Flinch or blink in these situations 44 points last year for the wild Applause cats buron crosses over takes the Euro Step Off the glass gets his own rebound stunk underneath will bail it out to Shrewsberry off to Def flection will go niagaras way you know you attack the basket here good things happen again you put a good spin on the ball reverse layup knocked it in but thats the things that youve got to do when youre down youve got to make easy shots get to the paint get to the rim get easy buckets the veteran guard knows exactly what he needs to Doon passes it off oing menza bumo taking it into the paint cant get it Booth comes down with the rebound oper will push forward up to Booth cant get and now Henderson will go the other way arbo on the roll wow great take to the basket extremely solid RI D take times now in for the Irish shuberry down to Bo and a Slammer for booth this freshmans going to have a bright bright future someday you can just see his length really creates problems for people hes a rim protector and you can see now he can finish inside Bo standing at 610 Henderson though takes it all the way wow way up off the glass over the outstretched arm of boo wow what a great take working in geometry class right there W that was way up there off the glass and dumps it off to rer rer pulls up from Beyond The Ark oang menah comes down with it its important as a coach not let your team p Panic they just need to settle down they dont need to take wild shots youre not going to get a 10point shot just need to run your stuff run your offense at the same time really focus in on the defensive end and thats what coach wants to see happen oang menah right to the basket purple Eagles cannot script this beginning any better when youre playing on the road and youre young and and uh you really dont know what to expect you know coach Pauls Kids come out here and really execute takes it to the rack off the glass gets the layup Disney another local player right here in town so again the local players are out on the floor have done some good things and he you know red shirted last year got stronger looking forward to this opportunity this year ends on the top of the key Shrewsberry and the Irish push forward on offense a foul called against the purple Eagles Niagara leading by 10 here Niagara has seven transfers on their roster for this season three of them that really stand out bumbaloo marble no bang Mena yeah when youre talking to coach beforehand last last year he had eight new people this year hes got that same situation with new people and thats kind of been uh the mid major situation where you got to work the portal you got to find new players each and every year hands it off to Shrewsberry Burton calling for Davis to step up clears it out for Burton to go up and gets fouled hell go to the line to trying convert on the threepoint play and thats exactly what he needed he needed an opportunity to get to the rim thats his game he gets the rim turns the corner draws the foul protects it and makes a great shot you know thats his game beating people to the rim splitting the defense and going up strong now get to the free thr length for threepoint play I would say thats more important for Marcus than even the Irish to get that bucket Burtons able to make the free throw ner now only leading by seven buo loses for quick second regains great defense half court defense here by the Irish good switch out there by the guards on to drive in Bullock Burton trying to take the oneonone with Bumble goes by OB be how cant get it bulock with the move into the basket now bis on the wing off ball foul again Tay Davis his first foul of the day against the transfer from seen hle yeah when Im looking at this team I see a lot of confidence theyre not panic coming in here and this is a big crowd here great student turnout here for the Irish bble on the top of the Applause key travel called against marble now its able to get the turnover yeah both teams are pretty much running almost the same look on offense you know theyre really trying to move the ball and get mismatches trying to get the guards you know off of ball screens high which we see right here trying to just create some offense with movement hes trying to go up stay Notre Dames one great student section tonight great student section they have come out to see what this young teams going to look like hands it off to Burton shuberry in the lane shuberry its the basket I think every time a ball goes in for the Freshman you can just see they had they kind of theres a sigh of relief and theyre thinking all right now I can go out and play Ive got my bucket now I can just go out and enjoy the game Henderson tosses it out of bounds and not name suffocating defense works the turnover and again as we talked to coach shb before the game he said we just need to be really solid defensively thats what this young team has to be solid at the defensive end and uh you know thats what hes ingrained in them from the very beginning Bon sees the open Lane takes it right to the basket he has an exceptional extra gear that you just cant teach or you cant simulate that the young man has got a great step to the basket M aame on a 90 scoring run over the last 2 minutes and 34 seconds be ah is able to get it great inside interior pass there great high low look and again what you want your bigs to do just be able to catch it and finish and thats where the pass led to the bucket Burton pulls up from the elbow cant bounce into the Applause nyline Dem Marcus Burton has to be understanding hes got to be a little bit more patient break the defense down a little Applause more bis now to Henderson from the ACC logo Zona comes down with the Applause rebound Bon 2023 is Easter basketball Indiana dish to Davis its the foul Notre Dame starting to knock on the door they only Trail by five here in South B Four Freshman onto their team and theyre starting to get going here coach youre absolutely right you know its going to take a while but these freshman are really special they can shoot the basketball they just The Games real fast right now and for people that havent played college basketball or youre making that adjustment from high school aou now the game is just so much quicker the athletes are so much better so they got to make that adjustment makes his first and then how much of it is trying to figure out yeah how where you fit into the team because every R is different for majority of these freshmen they were the star players yes they all were and they the ball was in their hand all the time now they have to give it up and you know thats an adjustment period thats why you know freshman get better as the season goes Music along waiting for the offense to convert trying to go down low looking to open menza yeah he had a great look there just didnt finish again shb is very smart coachs son knows how to play the game hes not going to panic at all Irish need to reset here with a high ball screen Burton with the dribble going to go in off to the corner Booth cant get it down foul against Davis his second second so yeah probably make got to make a decision here yeah hes probably out for the rest of the half then you also have its a foul all the way from the basket you know thats exactly what coach is saying here youre ping 90 ft away from the basket so thats just not a smart decision on your part you know and again uh this is all new to him too hes never played here before and even though hes had some experience he all new here uh hes got to have to make that adjustment as well Davis played for seatan Hall last year average 134 minutes a game for the Pirates Mena tries to go in a foul called and can is it I think again he got beat off the dribble if he would just stayed strong and chested up I think could have been okay but uh he started reaching in and kind of trying to uh block the shot rather than just chest up and thats going to be called a foul and Niagara looking at this right now they need these buckets theyve been on really a kind of a dry spell here for the last five minutes oh bang menza gets the first last year for UNBC at a 661 free throw completion Applause rate unable to get the second good screen out by Booth again a young freshman just figuring things out well hes going to have a bright future as he matures and grows all screen from boot to Burton kzne for the three rolls around Henderson with the down with the rebound into the hand of O menza he stuffs it down great transition long rebound you know when you take threes theres chance to be a long rebound and long rebounds allow quick transition baskets Burton sees the opening Coast to Coast that was a great left hand for those people watching when he goes to the basket either right or left hand hes affected both ways you cannot sit on his left hand or his right hand cuz hell beat you the other Applause way off to the veteran bis bis driving in off the iron fresman Booth with the rebound Shrewsberry from Deep Off The Glass fumbler up beond the arc and you see both teams here that are just still figuring things out out you know when to get a good shot when to be patient taking your time at the same time both teams are really trying to play strong at the defensive Applause again Burton dumps it off outside booth on the dribble and lays it in on the roll hes got great length and great body control there as a freshman wow takes a lot to stop right there with two men right in front of tell you what he stopped on the dime and you know uh just had a great feel for getting the ball to the rim you cant teach Applause that Henderson simple as it comes coach driving kick out yep name of college basketball today is drive drive drive find an opportunity then kick out we predicted you know a pretty lowc scoring game I think thats basically whats going to happen Burton off the contact hes pretty special and he can get to the paint he is pretty special a lot of poise for Indiana Mr basketball right there Burton leading the Irish with nine points not name and Marcus Burton trying to cut in to the perple ya oang men having himself the night leading the way for the purple Eagles in points and rebounds with eight and five respectively yeah he has been so steady and the thing that you dont see in the stat sheet other than his rebounds hes quite outstanding defense many times hes on a perimeter player and he still has the quickness and the length to control a guard so hes really had a great first half also playing with a lot of energy here tonight yeah again you can tell that he is not by the Crowder or anything like that he just wants to go out and play hard run the system and you know hes got that experience that really makes a difference goes to bis high off the glass again that was an out of bounds play that the Irish went over during their pregame but did not pick it up here uh actually in play Burton hows a foul gold against him a lot of people ask ask me how do you control bur you go with quickness or you go with size and I think uh its both ofs a tough situation because if you go with quickness well hes going to try to beat you the rim or knock down a three if you go a size then you know all of a sudden hes going to draw you away from a basket get get you away from the basket then get to the rim so hes got the ball in his hands almost all the time Burton trying to give it off to his fellow freshman Booth cant get it into his hands Applause bumboo BS around Booth chasing down the rebound keeps it in Applause Music Bound 230 left in this first half Four Freshman out on the floor another pror control foul against the Irish take another look at that you know theyre talking illegal screen there I dont see that at all that just doesnt look like that theres nothing there there is nothing there well the referees are just starting their season too so uh their aame not here all the time but uh coach shu is letting them know about it right now ACC officiating crew led by Lee Cassel Jeremy is here and Mark Applause Music Applause rafy B menza drives in sees the lane jump ball Applause called now kesn with the big one there all a going with a really A four guard lineup here with Boo and inside AR coming out with a little bit of a fullcourt press Im will bring it across the halfway line IMS to the baset just have been so impressed with his Poise and confidence he just works hard again another Indiana player coming here playing at Notre Dame and he play with a lot of passion and grip Henderson to the r now Burton Barry left foot it on the wing good decision to bring the ball back out get your offense oper loses on the spin move oang menza up to Henderson left handed lays in unforced turnovers unforced turnovers can allow easy baskets thats exactly what coaches hate to see his unforced Applause turnovers Burton tries to get it the alley oop to Booth great interior pass perfect position great pass Burton is showing exactly all the things he can do for the Irish freshman to freshman think they got a connection already coach I think so too and look at this flush right here about as good as it comes for the allei oop coach Paul has taking a time out to talk things over with his team Irish within three what are you saying if coach po I I think youre saying hey lets finish this possession right here lets not panic lets get a great shot you know Nan got 17 fou so anything that happens we get to the rim were going to get to the free throw line so we just got to make sure we make good decisions with the basketball not force anything dont have to run it down turn the 25 just get a really good look have great Poise get one good possession here before we go into the half not closing in have for Niagara theyve been leading for yeah this first half yeah they have haris trying change the story line heading into the locker room coming out with a Zone here thats a great decision coming out with a different look they can clearly see was not expected Baloo tries the three on the Zone see how the Irish play they have about 5 seconds in the game the shot box again these are the times when coaches make their money theyre going to work on their simple things that theyve worked on here for the last four weeks of practice just little opportunities to get the ball the right person spread people out either get a drive to the the basket or a kick out three thats going to be what theyre looking for in this possession Marcus Burton Indiana Mr basketball only the third in Notre Dame history Chris in 01 and luk Zeller in 05 comes in and big pickup for the Irish you know I watched this young man play since he was in junior high and you know uh he just knew there was going to be something special about him as he grew in stature got a little bit stronger and then had a great career playing at pen high school here uh in missana played for a Hall of Famer out roads you can see that he just kept maturing keep getting better and his Junior and senior years were outstanding and you can see now is carried over to his college game was committed to Mike Bray when Shrewsberry comes on kept his commitment to play for the hometown school that he always dreamt about playing for yeah doesnt that say something about the character of Marcus Music B harer waiting to roll down the shot clock look for a high ball screen here there we go Burton drives in loses it however foul called back to the free throw line with a one andone again he just has exception he gets low behind below the defense he can stay low and stay explosive that makes it really hard to guard FAL Cold against Marvel on the bonus one and one here for Burton Burton makes the first again you want your point guard to be able to get to the line get free throws down and thats exactly his his Mo he can really attack the basket but you know we get to free throw lines a coach doesnt help you if you miss free throws but he is an outstanding free throw shooter free points Applause Irish within one for the last four minutes the Irish really stepped up their defense Henderson two seconds time expiring Fade Away cant get it the purple Eagles in the fighting points ready to go here underway in the second half B men on the top of the K strong post up inside great pass back Mena trying to be big down on the paint Davis comes down with the rebound yeah he played really strong that possession I think youre going to see a much better half out of Davis for Notre Dame in the second half Davis takes it into the paint Burton from the free throw line Davis tips it away o beoa comes down with the Applause rebound y hand off to bumbalo be a player control foul yeah they go screen you know both teams have really not shot the ball well well from the three I think that uh if we see one of these teams can get two or three looks and knocked down some threes that will open up some space in this game for the drive but we have not seen very much success really from either team from that threepoint line for Notre Dame they are 0 for seven from Beyond The Arc going into the halftime and then for Niagara they were three for nine Davis off to Applause Shrewsberry shes buried to Davis forer thought about a time expiring fading away that three no good sometimes its just better defense and that was a situation Niagara just have really outstanding defense kick ball against Zona and the Irish you know we havent talked about coach hollace in his great def you know quarterbacking you know people forget about that he was fouryear player you know and one of those years hes playing for Syracuse as a quarterback he was an AllAmerican in both Sports and hes got two guys out here that played great football bumbaloo had a twoway offer to Ball State to be a wide receiver to Ball State team ultimately said he wanted to focus on basketball OA goes in and gets fouled wow that looked like an opportunity as a lineman right there he took the ball strong to the basket there I would not want to see him as a defensive end coming in at me but you know he had those same opportunities to play football wow I cant imagine that and OA one of those other players that had offers from Iowa State Arizona State and Old Miss to go play football as well something that coach paas talked to us connected with them about and having that two sport background can you imagine that sevenfooter coming across the line if youre a quarterback I would not want to have any part of that look at that look at that 67 it wasnt that he just played he was really good at it he was the 05 Gatorade male High School athlete of the year a distinction very few have and I told him before uh here walk through practice as I think you can still play he is in great shape with how much hes going up and down the sidelines I think he might be still getting that work out there hes getting his steps in Burton hand off to Zona Zona lays it in yeah thats been a great look for the Irish a great look where they really do a great job coming off that ball screen rolling strong in the basket Burton finding the roller or the lob tied at 31 between the two teams Alis looking to the Freshman Henderson with the money on the three hes been the guy thats been able to have great looks and that was a great look coming off a a stagger screen on the Baseline again Burton was trailing the cutter and he had a great look knocked it in Burton from the paint stay hot you know many people dont realize that he can also not just get to rim but that midrange jumper is also deadly for him well see which team locks in defensively and gets some straight stops three in a row or whatever is going to be the difference here bis going into the paint triying to get the fade away Henderson comes down with on the loose ball what a basket wow nice touch around the basket by the big man being able to go up against strength Zona was right on him but he still was able to finish wowa out to guard Zona ni Zona with the back door to Shrewsberry great backo cut by shuberry Perfect greed again the Irish are really starting to get easy looks to the Music basketa off to bis bis from the El got it playing extremely well in the offense running their stuff being very very patient getting great looks both teams playing well offensively right now IMS for three cant convert Henderson works it by Burton just too much on it Shrewsberry is going to slow down the offense yeah neither team have been been able to really get on the offensive boards throughout this whole game it be interesting to see if one of these teams can get to the offensive boards Burton Baloo up to bis and both teams have taken kind of Rush shots they need to set things up and get back in their offense thats exactly what with paulus ask of his freshman guard Henderson Mena trying to take on two Defenders great double great double team needs to take it oh great look Burton wide open Imes there though for the rebound Shrewsberry now for the three the Irish just cannot knock down a three but here they are theyre only three points down both teams is kind to be like a a boxing match right here both teams just punching each other again trying to find the the the combo punch is going to get give him a serious lead Henderson oh rattles around almost had to go in that was in and out see if they run a good ball screen action here double screen look for a slip screen coming out of it sh Barry for the three well the ice has been broken their first three of the game for the Irish and itll be a timeout from coach paus Notre Dame and Niagara back tied we sit tied at 38 Irish and purple Eagles today Niagara 4 for 11 Notre Dame one for 12 on the day and those are those are just Jitters I really think as a coach uh theres too many great Shooters out there especially for Notre Dame uh watching them in practice watching their their concept of getting shots up they get a lot of Threes And so I just attribute that to the first game Jitters theyre going to knock in shots Alis will wait for the motion on the offense Baloo sees an opening pulls up transfer from Ball State hes been quiet and uh hes one that can really light it up and he can really knock shots in Newcastle Heist school graduate went to Ball State you know and hes played hes hes a veteran knows exactly what to do so its its going to be interesting here this last uh before our next timeout whos going to be a execute offensively theres a big back door Boo the big man beyond the orc well I guess if the guards arent hitting whats let the big take a shot he is going to be really good as he gets stronger physically and you can tell his confidence is building as his minutes played here in this game increase Iris leading for the first time today by one B menza has it go out of bounds and that will be our media timeout Notre Dame holds on to a onepoint lead their first time leading today been great energy you know I think think this is something when you have a new era started you have the student bu and say hey we want to see the things and coach hury said I will only guarantee one thing and thats going to be we will play extremely hard oh per cant get it again coming out the timeout Nar goes to his own a good look bumbaloo oh nice kick out to the corner Applause again both teams are still struggling from that line but uh its really good movement there by both teams if youre coach youre happy it just didnt go in who is going to attack the basket here with Burton not in the game is going to be a question I I have to ask booth for another three offensive rebound only the fifth offensive Rebound in todays game leads to points and he is a strong guard who knows how to post up and get to the rim and theres a big buck easiest way to scoring basketball is offensive rebound and anybody who go to the boards hard is going to get easy opportunities to score follow the shot follow the shot go to play physical pull it to bumbaloo OA good double team good double team this could be a good look bumbaloo for three off the iron and I think I think H his shots been a little long cuz he has had his work cut out Garden Burton he is tired you got to look for roer who is a veteran asking you shall receive coach yeah he knows played in the Big 10 played at Northwestern hes ready to play he plays strong hes playing solid you can just see in his eyes hes got the confidence he wants the basketball bumbaloo spinning around behind the basket wow boo is becoming a man right in front of our eyes here great defense by Micah Shys team they are solid they are making good decisions every screen every angle is being covered theyre staying in their Gap so well Irish on a 70 scoring run over the last 2 minutes and 45 seconds rer gets fouled thats a Applause mismatch rer gets fouled going to the basket it has been his day hes finding himself offensive rebound get it Irish leading by five here in South Bend right now say hey this is my opportunity to play here to get a little settled in defensive rebound putback he just shows the strength and will to get Buckets and here he really uses a mismatch against the big getting the basket and then going to reverse lap he has had quality minutes for the Irish in this ball game hes able to make his first oper last year Northwestern had a 455 free throw percentage Applause rebound comes down in niagaras favor after rer misses the second again nor Dames just very solid in their defensive play their their defense whos spacing theyre where theyre supposed to be heres the post up that a lot of people are going to see the tap back and you know thats one thing that uh the Irish are going to have to find figure out with with Burton if Im a big guard Im going to find my way to get down the block force him to either front me or Im going to post up strong so hell make that adjustment but thats what guards are going to do especially veterans guards asy goes into the paint trying to take on Henderson what a basket yeah again local players St Joe High School and again he had a small guard he used his 66 body to get inside and get a quality shot high IQ play knowing the mismatch there yes just knowing how to play menza hand off to bumbaloo B BL says an opening what a smooth jumper yeah hes a player you know again hes been very successful both in high school and college here in the state of Indiana and you know if youre from Newcastle which has a largest gym in the high school gym in the world hes not going to be awed by anything out here nice post up Booth tried to curl it in yeah again I think hes just hes played so hard hes run into a little bit of fatigue marble wow tried the spin move but itll be a foul on P you know what you really want your your guards to recognize mismatches and again gii recognizes that situation just uses his inside opportunities again this is just a nice midrange jump shot Applause there marble at the line makes the first setting for the Irish number 11 trry number 1 Davis number 25 full shift for the Irish to bring back in their starters yeah I think were going to see this you know from there on out youre going to see more and more of the starters playing strong minutes here and match up like they did at the beginning of the game theres got it back within two Davis on the top of the key got the opening sees the opening and gets the foul he just has a special Knack of getting to the rim I mean he can use his body hes got incredible watch this incredible body control goes into the defender first draws a foul protects the ball for anybody watching out there if youre a little guard and youre saying how I going get the basket just watch Burt play he gets his body into the defender uses his body to protect the ball then puts it nice off the glass and now he gets the chance to knock in free throw makes it a threepoint Applause play next couple possessions I think are going to be very important for Niagara to execute you dont want to start falling down and getting down by dou Applause digits great close out bumbaloo sees oang menah and now hell have an attempt for the threepoint play yeah just great spacing attacking the basket being able to find him you know if you look at that play again he was out of bounds came back in bounds everybody kind of lost him but he established himself back in bounds and then had a wide open layup if you go out bounds and come back in and establish yourself then youre good to go but if youre jumping back and forth now thats an illegal move but he had got knocked down came back found himself underneath the paint got a layup there is a lot of grit on both these Applause teams we have a whistle I want to clean up the quarter a little bit bourt pressure here by the purple Eagles like the call here coach yeah I think theyre just going to its really going to be token pressure I think theyre just trying to get n Dame sped back up Nord is feel very comfortable in their half court offense so youre just trying to speed things up a little bit get the ball in other peoples hands he Mr Shrewsberry boy see quick Davis for the wideopen three into bumbles hands yeah not the shot bumbaloo on the other side we knew sooner or later statistics you know play out that hes a great shooter hes going to find one of Applause them yep Burton draws the Applause foul bumbaloo able to get it back tied with a big three in response 51 all saw in 2022 and 2023 yes you know hes been successful wherever hes been and you can see what hes done at Niagara he has taken them from being in the bottom to now the top five and you know theyre predicted to be one at the bottom but thats not going to happen I guarantee you he knows how to coach hes going to have those guys in the top five and hes going to be successful it comes tournament time ultimately fell to the Mac champions in Iona R patinos former team Burton oh the young mans smart he just went back door said hey I you over play me this way Im going to go back door and get a layup by menza to bumbaloo bumbaloo again feeling himself oh yeah you know analytics come back you know hes a good player and he can shoot the basketball so now hes got a little Comfort once you see the ball go through the basket if youre a shooter youre going to try it again Imes good take good pull out by the Freshman Burton oh going in hand off to lost it nice pass calls the foul though I count one two three freshman on the floor for Notre Dame almost Four Freshman right now on the floor for Notre Dame and uh boy have they responded they have done a great job and that goes back to the coaching staff you know they didnt have a whole lot of time to put this team together lost everybody graduation and they put this together with a few veterans and a lot of freshman hands hands hands up for those guys have been able to do a great job recruiting bringing those kids here to own Dame and one month with into the job Michael Shrewsberry art had a 23rd ranked recruiting class for the class of 2023 yes yes thats impressive yes you know he said Im going to go first of all Im going to recruit Indiana kids you know he said Im an Indiana guy Im going to recruit Indiana kids first and I think thats a great decision Im below oo a big three shot that one from mishel waa I mean that was deep now leading the purple eagles with 14 points Burton in response wow gets the roll this is amazing right now weve got a shoot out here in South Bend Indiana look out wet spot wet Applause spot boy that was lucky that somebody did get heard on that on that slip we talked about how the three wasnt playing a factor today it has come out in big droves yeah this is a deep one coming off of that deep look at that jump stop pivot went straight up and then you know heres Mr touch Ive shot in these rims before growing up up they got my name written all over it Fork get cleaned up coach Paul has taken the opportunity talk things over with the officiating crew yeah its you know its been a hard fought game there hasnt been that many turnovers for a first season game you know first one you expect a few more turnovers but really hasnt been its just been two teams that are just playing hard palis off the Baseline Imes comes down with the rebound Irish looking to push Applause it Burton driving in gets the basket Notre Dame fans I think youre going to enjoy watching this young man play Fromm below off to Applause Henderson o bang menza for three big man from behind the ark wow both teams are playing so hard and knocking in Big Shots this has been a lot of fun to watch maybe not to coach but to watch for sure Burton what a pass to Davis and gets the points oh my goodness both teams are on fire were going back and forth here in South Bend getting pretty loud in here right now Henderson drives in tries underneath two onone break Burton takes it himself gets the roll what a great left hand take there what had a great hand take Shrewsberry losing his mind its going to be a timeout from coach paace Iris have come out firing big moves from The Freshman Burton not Dame leading going into the media timeout big defense turns to offense points and look at this young man going with his left hand and knocked in that fo and now heres something I really love to see out this timeout look at coach shuberry getting people out of their seats getting excited about nordan basketball thats what this town is needed and he is responding and getting those guys to play hard the reflection of the coach fumo goes to the basket what a great atmosphere a fun atmosphere were trying to recollect the last time n Dame had had this made people in the crowd especially for a nonconference game it had to be Michigan State last year man so with the inbound to bumbalo great defense by Notre Dame here Henderson with the Hulk oh baby what a shot goodness that was great defense and better offense four minutes to go here Burton Leading The Way with 25 points drives in has an open one make it 27 the young man has got absolutely the control of this ball game and the Poise goes it ties The Freshman scoring record for debut with lonso Ellis my good think hes in Good Company yeah and lefon is here to watch it hes in the Applause stands menza has his pocket pick Davis comes up with it passes to Imes good decision by Imes slow it down run the offense here neither team is in the bonus oh yeah theyll say IMS pushed Applause off turnover and now what coach Shrewsberry wants here allow Niagara the opportunity to get back in off the turnover youre right just watch kind of gets his left hand in there and pushes little bit off you know again thats an easy one for the officials but the problem was that uh IMS was looking for somebody to pass to and there was kind of everybody was standing so he was trying to make something happen by going for the basket Bea no deep thats not the shot that coach paus wanted you should never bur will slow down n a can take advantage of it here he got a big on the guard hes going to attack him oh my that fouled is this man putting on his show or what I mean he is just doing Mr everything right now for Notre Music Dame were actually watching something has never really happened in the history of Notre Dame as a debut as a player uh is happening right in front of our eyes as Oba has fouled out of the game sophomore forward for the Boral Hawks and miss his presence down on the post here down the stretch in the final 220 yeah that was not a good decision that at the offensive end and that led to to foul defense then you know and that usually happens but make one mistake at one end and if you think about it then its going to carry over to the other end of the p and thats exactly what happened um a bad shot and then a bad foul Burton that a record 28 here on opening day surpassing fonso Ellis now 29 sh Irish leading by six 210 Applause left in this opening day contest between Niagara and Notre Dame great job by shy coming off that defensive double stagger B menza fading away great defense you want to run your offense now you dont want to be in a hurry you want to run your stuff and I think Burton needs to get the Applause basketball oh he got a mismatch now Burton drives in up on the glass Davis tried to push forward foul thats a foul Again by Burton pen trting Daviss man had to come over and help great opportunity for him to get to the free throw line here on the Applause tip oang menah commits the foul it is only his second Burton breaks freshman record in a debut with 29 Points you know the thing about it thats been impressive to me is that he has transformed into a Defender too where um you know that was kind of a thing that people come in as freshman and they know they can score but uh Burton has decided I can also play at the defensive end Im not a liability and thats coach shrewbury just demanding that in the off season thatll be a foul yeah and Roper over the back called one juler thats his second and you just want to be really solid here keep them off the free throw line make them make good decisions at the offensive Applause B bis great defense yes that was much needed timeout coach paus will use his final time out here with 115 remaining in regulation here in South Bend and I think theres a lot of people in niagaras League watching this game and going uhoh uh we picked them eighth I dont think thats going to happen I think that uh uh coach PAs teams going to be ready to play they have come in here and played you know punch for punch against Notre Dame and responded and you know even though theyre down seven with a three here or quick two theyre back in it look at the the M Pole where they have Niagara KN well if theyre N I dont think Id want to play in the mat talking to people close to Niagara today underst said they are second guessing us because of how new we are but its the same store we had last year where we had a large majority of newcomers and we finished fifth in the regular season put on pressure into the postseason making it to the semis for the third consecutive time theyve seen the story line they know what they can do exactly and that goes to coach paulus and his staff and if that just just magically happens you got to have guys that you coach that buy in and so that happens during the summer in the weight room that happens in preseason conditioning and then that happens when practice starts where you have really got to have guys buy in and say you know what were predicted here but thats not what were about and thats exactly what you see with Niagara theyre going to be winning games that theyre not Clos to putting up a fight here and Notre Dame Irish only leading by seven lets see if Notre Dame comes out with a different look here defensively are this out of bounds play bis will inbound for the purple Applause Eagles defense Henderson tries to go to the basket I tell you IMS has been so solid as a freshman my goodness my goodness he has done so many little things well great decision there to pull the basketball out run some time your the clock is in your favor right here still got time five now on a shot clock shuberry whos it going up again you can live with that you didnt really get a good shot but at the same time will stay niagaras way for Ropo cant come down with the rebound however this will initiate an official view yeah it looked to me came off a Ropers hand but you know theyll take a look at it its a very important possession here where you got to make sure you get it right under with under 30 seconds to go and I look for uh you know coach shry is going to say all right we need to make we need to make some adjustments hell probably go real long here yeah thats a tough one to look at there it could have went either way theyre going to have to break that down you know one thing we havent talked about at all is you know what the Irish have played without a key player and you know you look at this team and look at uh what theyre going to be able to do this year and uh right now they got a starting Postman thats really really solid thats not in uniform because of the broken hand right there maybe wow it is so close has to be concluded elusive to overturn the call Music yeah theyre taking a good look at it and again this a critical possession here if youre Niagara youve got to have the ball in this situation itll stay niagaras Music way after it goes out of bounds yeah not enough there to overturn it niagar gets a little bit of a timeout off for that as well on the official review oh yeah out of timeouts here used to be able to drop an inbound play again Booth was on the ball at 7 foot thats uh lucky to get the ball in he did get a deflection out of it you got to make sure you stay away from the three again thats great defense again there just been so many little things that the Pressman guard has done has showed a lot of poise he is just so solid again another young man from Indiana you know coach was talking before coach shury said you know Im the coach Im an Indiana guy and I Im coaching nor Dame you got Mike Woodson an Indiana guy coaching the IU you got Matt Painter an Indiana guy coaching the Purdue so I think its fitting that these guys are going to be really recruiting the state where theres a lot of great basketball players got to turn hoers in 49 other states its only basketball but this is Indiana and thats what he emphasizes time and time again yes well this has been an outstanding first game for the Irish and theyve had a a great a great game especially Burton carrying the load but uh theres been a lot of quality minutes by everybody else as Music Applause well quickly bis goes and gets the basket theyre not even going to foul that will do it Marcus Burton has a historic night in irishs opening win
