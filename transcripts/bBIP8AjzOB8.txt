at home there in Clemson Louisville in the white Were underway as they win the opening tip into the hands of Chucky heurn who won the game at the buzzer against Stanford last night on the last second shot and what was a great basketball game up top here for jaman Headley and Hadley a guy who had a great game in their first meeting heres Hunter and hes going to stuff it on the other end Chase Hunter and Chase Hunter inp to have success at the ACC tournament hasnt seen a lot of it as we look at the Louisville starting five Terence Edwards off the front of the iron who also could have been a first team all ACC performer in my book adley lost the ball scooped up by Chase Hunter comes in averaging 16 a game he is a big time Talent adley with the rebound well we had a great crowd obvious for game number one Duke in Carolina if you missed any of that it was an amazing second at first half it was all Duke they piled up a huge lead as heord blows by everybody Kentucky heord going by Jaden Zachary JayZ a strong Defender but Chucky heurn will live in the paint as we get a look at the Clemson starting five we know about Chase Hunter but Ian sheing could be the key to this game 13 points nine rebounds for the 68 seniors he can make life very tough on the guys in the post Victor lockin the 611 senior from Russia bounces here for Wiggins Wiggins in the paint shot clock down to two he did get the shot up but it wont roll into the cup and shefin already making his presence felt oh oh and shein went down and so did Hadley both grabbing at their elbows as they hit the deck hard urn trying to get free and its tipped out of play by Clemson we got a collision on the other end OB Ian shling holding on to his left elbow Javon Hadley these two get tangled up a tough fall as sheflin bangs the elbow on the ground Hadley came away from this as well a little banged up holding on to his right elbow So Physical from the start between these two thir that Collision in Raleigh over the top and a kick out ball moved very well by Louisville but it wont drop down by Waterman and both these teams playing without one of their normal starters Dylan Hunter injured in yesterdays matchup in the semifinals and Rain Smith who led the ACC in threepoint field goals made injured against cow last Wednesday that turned his ankle and hes dayto day you mentioned Dylan Hunter he broke his hand and he is done yeah so when you think about both these teams Chanty Wiggins who was the starter for the majority of the Year back in the starting lineup nice drive there by Chase Hunter against SMU last night he showed why hes the first team all ACC got 15 of their 29 in the second half and Chase Hunter is so difficult to contend with when he decides hes going to go to the basket Edwards to the paints and yes nice touch the fifth year guard gets 16 a game for the Cardinals love this match up Terence Edwards who Pat Kelce said their defense changed from early in the year once Terence Edward picks up his defensive effort having to to go up against one of the best in the game and Chase Hunter who delivers the strike the Victor Lock and knocking down the first three of the game locking getting 12 and six he was in a lot of foul trouble last night be a huge key for him tonight to stay in the game another a loose ball Big Time scramble a tie up there possession arrow will take it to the opposite end itll be Clemson Applause ball Ian selin working down low the quick spin to get to the other side of the rim the Finish Javon Hatley under sized in comparison to Ian shein shein taking it advantage of it on the Applause Block entry pass for Zachary it pops free and the Cardinals Come Away With It they are red hot coming into this tournament having won 19 to 20 before they won yesterday so 20 out of 21 for Louisville on the spin triari cant get it to go and I love the way the officials are calling this game right now Obie theyre allowing them to play and be physical yet not allowing Applause fouls now approaching immediate timeout once again hell get it downstairs sheflin cant finish that he reaches in and commits a foul trying to get that back and so Clemson has the lead early on here four in our second semifinal of the ACC tournament e e e e ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by tro price invest with confidence another beautiful night here in Charlotte North Carolina its been a great stay for the ACC tournament once again into the semifinal round lets go over to Angel Gray well guys for Louisville this is a program that has 15 transfers and one true freshman so their success has been grounded in the idea of it takes a village and the ACC coach of the year in Pat Kelce also uses a mantra amongst his team says 25 strong it goes back to the traditional 25 chairs on the bench with a reference of how everyone is needed for the teams overall success on the stat sheet you can see four players averaging double figures but it comes down to the respect as well the front of the bench respects the end of the bench and the fans respect the team everyone works together for the overall success they absolutely do angel and if you ever have the opportunity to go to a Lal shoot around there is never more energy as Terence Edwards gets the bucket OB I have been able to sit in on a number of Lille shoo rounds and every time I leave Pat Kelce has me believing that I can still play basketball now when I get up and start walking I know I cant but he still makes me believe I can and then the hips start the hip right way downtown arounded out by Hunter Edwards coming away with the rebound and 25 points yesterday recently blew up for 35 against Cal so he can be the star in the Cardinals too he really can OB over his last 12 games ever is averaging 21 points per game and also doing the job defensively thats the reason why I had him six on my voting for all ACC of course he made the third team Im not sure if people recognize how valuable hes been to the Louisville team sheelin up top Hunter finds the cutter shefin for the slam nice find from Chase Hunter Im not sure how you lose I shefin aka the chef along the Baseline not with those shoes no not with the I dont know what color they are I just know theyre bright neon green Ill go with Ill go with it goes perfect with the orange uniforms right of course 116 the Tigers Edwards stepping back cant drain it rebound pops up Racing for that trior hell go back inside with the left hand and trior plays much bigger than his stature Pat Kelce will often put him into guard fives guard fours play on the interior but he does not back down to anyone youre talking about the heart of a champion with one of the great names in college basketball of ubac car trior back up once again shefin man does he work hard he absolutely does and youre talking about one of the elite offensive rebounders in the game heon spins cant finish Applause it Zachary the transfer from Boston College sheing again but SP chy Wiggins running to the threepoint line the defender did not know whether to take him away or Ian shefin a nice M from JayZ to Ian and the tigers with a sevenpoint lead Music Music look at those patches that the Cardinals are wearing the JB patches for Louisville and Milwaukee Bucks Legend Junior Bridgeman who passed away on Tuesday afternoon OB I had the fortunate pleasure of introducing Junior Bridgeman in 2017 at the ACC Legends brunch and of course doing all the background research understanding how great he was as a player but more importantly his contributions as an entrepreneur the first billionaire retired NBA player with a B with a b and of course built his fortune in the hospitality industry but a great man for the for Louisville to be associated with and to be an ambassador for that great University boots inside Ro to 68 freshman now its 158 Clemson once again shein on the entry he continues to work after the miss it comes right to heurn whos been pretty quiet so far Chucky heurn ACC Defensive Player of the Year First Team all ACC the star last night as he has been many times this season and right on Q he makes the bucket he has four points and Chucky heurn has been a problem for opposing teams to keep out of the painted area all season long and he continues to put pressure on the defense attacking off a screen and roll you cant go under because he knocks down the jumper but when you try to Trail hes going to attack your big man Chucky having success early e e Applause Music Applause e Applause it dont well the Tigers can hang their hat as the only team to beat Duke this season in the ACC regular season that was back on February 8th at Clemson Cooper flag got hot down the stretch but he also had a big Slip On A wet floor and the fans went wild as Clemson knocked off the number two team of the country 7771 OB you and I were there with the opportunity to call that game with the great Dicky V and now Clemson trying to beat Louisville and vice versa for an opportunity to play against Duke tomorrow and guess who will be in the building well thats right Clemson said where is our lucky charm Dicky via Dicky answered so hell be with us for the championship game the bank in close there by johy Wiggins you can see early clemon trying to take advantage of their size Chanty Wiggins at 610 playing the small forward position can get an advantage on the interior and has taken advantage of it a number of times pass barely got to Edwards hell drive it and cant finish but its tipped up and in by James Scott you ask who is that mask man it would be James Scott who does the majority of his damage in the painted area second nationally with 71 dumps on the season showing off his soft touch on the last Zacharys open that wont fall another rebound for shefflin as he goes down to the seat of his pants and James Scott wearing that protected mask right out of the Dark Knight Rises he got hit in the mouth in the game back in February lost teeth and everything and the Louisville JB School of Engineering built it for him and hes up high for another two and he yes you mentioned the losing teeth he broke the Mask two Wednesdays ago and then I had them again on Saturday and I was discouraged by him not wearing the mask at the end of the game I didnt know he had broke it and I said hey keep your mask on and when he spoke turned to speak to me I saw the entire top of his teeth all gone and hes like oh I got a new one Ill make sure to have it on today yeah its not the nose a lot of people think its the nose but he didnt have any damage on the nose but he lost some chicklets and a foul on the floor here with two seconds on the shot clock quick moving first half 957 to go it really has bon in sheff just all over the offensive class weve seen this from him throughout his entire career at Clemson but theres never a shot that goes up on either end of the floor that Ian sheff is not going to chase down a rebound for offensive boards already for the shf already has six rebounds so he has been all over the glass I wonder sometimes if opponents just underestimate him a little bit given his size I mean hes not a really big guy at 68 they maybe could have gotten away with that for the first year or two but not over the last last two seasons hes been amazing on the glass had 20 boards against Kentucky yes and a win for the Tigers at home in the ACC SEC chap as a senior now the the word is out how good he is he bur ahead of the field cant finish it he missed the bunny great Hustle by Dell Jones to get back Wiggins out of the corner no he does make 38 down the threepoint L good shooter yeah thats his strength he stretches the floor at 610 he can often keep big guys out of the paint that bur crosscourt Edwards with 10 to shoot Edwards Relentless driveing it no but a foul with 908 to go Louisville was down by as many as 15 to Stanford in the quarterfinals they had a crazy comeback to win at the buzzer and stun the Cardinals 7573 foul here will go against Chase Hunter first and Edwards makes 79 at the line says the player he would most like to meet is LeBron James and shocks me because hes from the Atlanta area he wears the number five and his last name was Edwards soon similar to the one a Edwards of the Minnesota timber wolves however they may be about the same age so Im sure hes probably already played against and met Anthony Edwards at some point want to meet LeBron I say the line starts over here its a long line Ive been there done that its it people youve met and done that ah no big deal no thats a long line love I breeder with a misfire 40 from three for the Tigers and Lille an opportunity to grab the lead M there our ACC final number two its Edwards Jr no rebound comes out high he races for it he will swing it ban got bottled up back out high and that one wont get there for Edwards another scrap and again Louisville had it and winning the 5050s great effort from Pat Kels team you know for those who are familiar with Pat Kelce they may be wondering what happened to the glasses for the longest time you saw Pat Kelce wearing the large black frame glasses however he said that his daughter told him that he looked like a dork with the glasses on soon went away from them I went to Louisville did a game they were giving out the glasses in the stands yeah but Pat Kelce actually stopped wearing it hasnt worn it since going to contacts banked up and in Edwards working very hard himself the 66 senior and this is an eight nothing run the Cardinals have grabbed the lead nice footwork by Edwards on that possession to get a bucket hes been Ultra aggressive here to start this game Wiggins 610 Junior and thats going to spin in on a nice move by Jaden Zachary one of the four tigers averaging double figures great cut by Zachary to make himself available recognizing his teammate Wiggins may have been in trouble adley draws a double heurn from the corner got it Zachary an elite Defender turned his head smart play by Chucky heurn to relocate outside of the vision of jadeen Zachary to the corner and able to knock down to three Applause on the bounce to Wiggins Wiggins with a Fall Away rebound knocked around its on the line it will be Louisville ball 658 remaining here in a first half that is cooking Louisville and Clemson battling for the right to play Duke in the championship game e e e e Music thats a shocker Alabama not making a three yeah we we used to watch them watch make a lot of three thats one thing thats pretty much consistent with the Cs and top 2119 The Ville Edwards with a Miss in tight and it comes out to Zachary the 61 grad this experienced Clemson team there one nine straight around and not by shein theres a lot of contact on that one and nor oh must say Chuck can get away with a lot but I dont think he can get away with that one what he did get away with earlier though was an opportunity to be able to disappear out of the vision of Jaden Zachary well go inside the pl in a little bit OB show you the smarts of Chuck heer Chucky with career start number 135 in his career and thats every game hes ever played as it gets inside for Victor lockin and two yeah Chucky missed a game earlier this year for the cards and during that game Terence Edward had 27 points and 10 rebounds taken over at the point guard Applause position but Chucky heurn one of the smartest B basketball players that were going to see take us inside the play were going to go you look at Jaden Zachary guarding Chucky Heber and as he turns his head of course the double team comes but Chucky relocates to the corner and its now you see me now you dont Zachary when he turns to look back Chucky heurn has already vacated the area finds himself in the corners able to knock down the three ball for the Cardinals but youre talking about one of the most confident and cerebral point guards that we have in the game today you said earlier this season Im the best point guard in America and he is absolutely on that list however hes not on the Koozie award list which is a travest the OB Lockett slamming on the brakes and banking it in 2321 locking with seven Victor told us earlier in the season he did some standup comedy in Russia hed like to try it again in the United States he loved it as heurn cant hit rebound comes High to hrer Hunter had to bat it away on the loose ball it comes back over to the Cardinals adley with it he had 32 in the first meeting against Clemson earlier this season as louisv will beat the Tigers 7464 the corner jumper wont drop for Applause Waterman lson trying to build on a little bit of a lead here back out top shefin lockin gets the entry little too strong but Sheen and locken do a great job of throwing that bounce pass from the top of the key you normally see two Bas going high low over the top but they normally do a great job of sealing in getting that angle at bur flips it up there but no basket its a difference when youve got Scott there as a receiver in comparison to Frank he ask when you think about Scott normally finishes those for dunks Frank trying to lay that one up missing on the opportunity s eBay couldnt do it now on the turnover as Scotts on the bench with two fouls Hadley driving in flips up two smart play by Hadley recognizing that Hyer was in the restricted area going to attack him and gets the bucket the pace has gotten a little ragged and these teams need a little bit of a break OB couple of guys that may have got tired during this stretch ESPNs EX exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by principal let our expertise round out yours e e e e its been kind of a wild ACCC tournament lots of ups and downs a lot of emotion from the coaches the players as well some good some bad a big celebration there from Chucky last night sheflin as well SMU eliminated yesterday Duke had a giant lead earlier tonight against North Carolina they came back but in the end would lose it by three Cooper flag out with that ankle what a game that turned out to be particularly the second half it really was it lived up to the Rivalry that it is as Jay bis would say duke North Carolina always delivers and an absolutely delivered in the second half Duke had a 24point lead they were up 21 at at halftime and they had to hang on for dear life Luben missed a jumper that would have tied it after some trouble getting it inbounds we thought in all likelihood RJ Davis would be the guy to take that shot yeah but so did the Blue Devils and they denied RJ Davis didnt give it an opportunity but Luben also had an opportunity at the free throw line to tie it missed the first one and then a lane violation on the second one cost the Tar Heels dear Withers who should have known better given his age and his experience but he was just heartbroken and so are North Carolina fans working hard underneath its Victor lockin for a basket and another offensive rebound now a 82 forgive me the four Second Chance points for Clemson but theyve been all over the offensive glass throughout this game adley pounding it into the paint Waterman decided not to shoot the long one shot clock is down to 10 heurn to drive and kick Hadley launch has got it its been a struggle for the cars Beyond The Arc only the second made threepoint field goal two of 11 for louville but Clemson only one of six hasnt been much Applause better both teams ranked in the top 20 and down went lock and he took a shot and the 611 senior on his back and holding his forehead and his eyes only played 18 minutes because of foul trouble last night against SMU hes been able to hang in here tonight stay away from that but lets take a look well we look at the three by Bley on the other end a great screen away from the basketball the delivery from heurn to Hatley allowing him to knock down to Applause Music Applause three Chase Music Applause hunter hunter gets it in the air off the 10 but theres going to be a foul on the Applause deck to go in half loing a lot of credit he and Ian shein have absolutely been all over the offensive glass throughout this game wman second both teams with six offensive rebounds so wman to the bench Tori back on now for Pat Kelce Jaden Zachary gets it in we talked about tayori guarding locked in at 7 ft gives up a number of inches in height but playing with that heart goes up trying to affect that shot locken cant Applause follow Clemson now with seven offensive rebounds but yet only four Second Chance points not able to capitalize nine to shoot here for Louisville Edwards is had a tough time in this first half but hell nail that one hes hes had success as outside of going to the three when hes been attacking the basket hes been able to be successful offensively Hunter under two minutes before halftime Lockett flips it up and gets two more Locka cant allow tayori at 64 65 to guard him down there as a sevenfooter if youre Clemson you go to that match up every time theyre going to put a smaller guy on locking on the Block locking is 11 Edward swishes that one and he had been old for five and he is 13 hes already taken 12 field goal the tips Edwards absolutely wants to get into the ACC tournament championship and a foul before the shot check out locking at 611 going inside to the big belly you cant allow a smaller guy to guard you its simply about getting to your spot and shooting over the top Victor Lock and taking advantage of his size on the interior Clemson back to the bench and Dell Jones a freshman to check in and locken whos really been working overtime showing it heads to the bench hes had a good first out he really has and playing with great energy especially on the offensive glass gaining extra possession for the Tigers approaching one minute Chase hunter oneand or Applause no kicked out for heurn he wants to operate in the paint Little Fall Away yes love the match up between these two all ACC guards Chucky heer Chase Hunter both taking a turn guarding each other Chucky one Z he was able to stop Chase and get a bucket and comes up with the steal took a look at the clock backed it away Louisvilles biggest lead of the first half at five heon complaining to Tony Anderson hes get fouled by Chase Hunter and Chase Hunter just fouls at half court he already got away with one hes too valuable to give away opportunities like that this is why Chucky heurn is the ACC steals leader and one of the top in the country his anticipation he understands where passes are going and often times jumps into passing Lanes well before the passer even delivers the basketball hes number eight in the country in steals first two games of the season for Louisville he had 13 steals I dont like that play by Chase Hunter Obie he picked up his second foul out there 40 ft away from the basket trying to take the basketball away now its going to Music be its going to be Louisville Ball but 174 seconds before halftime and that is a play where Ted Valentine did not want to call the foul its the reason why they gave it back to Louisville because it looks as though that basketball went off of Louisville but contact is what forced it sheflin is second foul last shot time here for the Louisville Cardinals Chucky heurn hit the gamewinner last Applause night heurn time to get off one here it comes he cant nail it and now the he by lockin in off the backboard and the first half so Louisville winds up with the biggest lead of the first 20 minutes 33 28 hard fought we expected that between these two on field she paid for those glasses very fashionable R away in the second half Chucky heurn with a little stop and pop around and out and shein grabs another rebound he has nine in this contest and a whistle immediately in the opening seconds and thatll go against Javon Hadley hell pick up his first Louisville with only six losses during the regular season three of them coming against top 25 teams number two Duke number four Tennessee number 19 Kentucky Music Applause heres Wiggins with a miss that barely nicked the iron lets go over to Angel PR update well guys if you were wondering what or OB rather if youre wondering why Cory had to speak a little longer during that halftime break its because Clemson locked out of the locker room for an extra 5 minutes that was something that coach was frustrated with and as you know going into the half with a deficit you want to get in there you want to talk to your guys that was something that he was visibly frustrated about not getting to his team on time he absolutely was oh Angel and you saw me running around trying to find someone in facilities to unlock the door for the Tigers on my way back Zachary bulling inside and itll be a blocking foul uh Chucky heurn whos beside himself is second and Zachary going to the rim and has been a physical game but you are allowed OB to lean in with the shoulder the problem comes in if if the arm extends thats when it becomes offensive foul you still are allowed with the shoulder to be able to lean in and dislodge a Defender Zachary drops in the free throw so its 3531 the bill Lille picked to finish ninth in the ACC wound up the number two team after going 824 last Applause year and they are highly relevant again Edwards will kick it out heres Waterman shot got it and thats what Waterman does he was three of five from three last evening versus SMU and now steps up and makes a big one for what has been a challenge for the cards throughout this game wiggin wont shoot it Hunter will yes yes sir from threepoint land man they moved it beautifully they really have one of the best threepoint Shooters in the ACC Chase hunter gets a wide open look and Cashes in theres a guy who takes big shots for the Tigers he did it in the Duke game that we had in the last half minute of play practically a big layup to kind of seal that one well hes been the guy that makes the plays for them and not just this year hes really done it for the last three seasons for Brad Brownell as a matter of fact the last time I checked he had 13 makes at the end of a half whether its the first half or second half 13 makes for him going into the locker room often times to be a sealer of the game yeah Brad says hes a big time player thats what your guys do when theyre Big Time Players Edwards on the Move lock and trying to stick with him shot clock down to six and a whistle now Obi at the end of the first half I told you I did not like Chase Hunter reaching at half court that picked up his second foul here you go were 17 37 remaining he picks up his third foul just playing defense and again thats a normal common foul hes trying to slide his feet as Terence Edwards goes down the foul is called but if he doesnt pick up that foul at the end of the first half hes not in foul trouble right now le missing a layup itll go the other way and its Clemson ball and their top player on the bench in fou trouble with over 17 minutes left here in this ACC tournament Applause semifinal Wiggins tried to bounce it picked off adley the drive stopped great hesitation yes nice Patience by Hatley to get lock in the shot Blocker in the air and then be able to get the clean layup but Hadley do it it on both ends of the floor the Ste defensively turning into the bucket on the offensive end now nobodys been a breakaway yet but Louisvilles up by six but its danger time for the Tigers having to manipulate without Chase Hunter on the floor as Wiggins turns it over trying to drive Baseline turned it over seven times out 16 times last night Obie Im not certain that Brad Brownell can spend a tremendous amount of time with Chase Hunter on the bench with those three fouls Chase Hunter is now in his sixth year at Clemson Brad Brown now may have to trust him to stay away from getting that fourth foul and inevitably the fifth foul downstairs and a foul two as Hadley made it and then he got drilled hell be heading to the foul line but think about the last points for the Clemson Tigers was the threepoint field goal by Chase Hunter and all of a sudden with Hunter off the floor has been backto back plays by Javon Hatley won the steal in the layup and then off of the cut the nice find Terence Edwards celebrating the threepoint play of his teammate and this the biggest lead of the contest for the Cardinals 4334 you mentioned a danger zone here for the Tigers Music Applause Jones bouncing for locken on the high post back for the Freshman off the fake a twopointer follows his own Miss right back up no he missed a pair Edwards was the hot hand in the first half eventually Zachary hounding him lot of contact lot of contact there and a foul OB Chase Hunter back at the scores table Brad Brownell recognizing he cant go much longer without his star on the floor this is the foul with about 18 seconds remaining in the first half Chase Hunter commits his second foul now he has three and hes going to have to play foul free e e e e e ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by principal let our expertise round out yours faces and the emotions tonight in our second semifinal Clemson and Louisville lson Tigers ranked number 10 and in the top 25 Louisville Cardinals are number 13 so a dynamite semifinal and right now Louisville the upper hand 43 to 34 and Louisville started out ob one of 10 from three they made three of their last four now starting to get some Rhythm on the offensive end of the floor which is a bad sign for the Clemson Tigers that was a violation couldnt get it in 5 seconds 5sec call but the best thing you could do there is take the 5sec in comparison to turning the basketball over and more importantly you dont waste the time out on that possession Jones will draw the foul with 1541 to go give you a look at the big 12 bracket in championship week by the way thatll be heers third foul so Houston with a great performance against BYU just ran over them right now its Texas teeken ER Iona theyve got a two3 going on in their semifinal and the Houston Cougars a season ago won the Big 12 Conference of course Kelvin Samson was coach of the year but they did not win the Big 12 tournament Championship Jamal shed was injured in the game so when you think about what Houstons trying to do this year theyre trying to have the complete sweep shein looking for the follow but not there for him and Chase Hunter right in the mix fortunate not to have picked up his fourth foul getting tied up with Scott Scott back for Edwards dropped it for him he cant sink it rebound tipped right to shein Hunter playing with the three just lost it there locket hit the deck he freed it somehow smart play by lock and just throwing it up in the air allowing his teammates to be able to go really with a jump ball JayZ able to come up with it Dell Jones picked by heurn and a foul to you cant play with the basketball in front of Chucky Music Heber in shefin coming in unable to get it but look at Chase Hunter with the arm in there very fortunate not to have gotten that fourth foul recognizing his level of importance with this team thats got to be offensive F and it is indeed with 1448 to go here in the second half its one thing to allow physicality but its something completely different to just be blatant with it as you see Scott just two hand pushing locking in the chest his third fou so now weve got a number of the Stars playing with three fouls both coaches going to trust their veterans to be able to stay on the floor to stay out of foul trouble locking on the high post hell find a shooter in the corner I breeder couldnt hit it and another whistle as they bottled up heurn and Hy Breer will pick it up to 65 Jr originally from Floyds knob Indiana sounds like it is right next door to Hickory hey shooters shooters come from out there H breeder with the reputation of a shooter had a good look on that possession unable to knock it down Applause Scott that masked man back to Applause heurn adley had a huge game the first time they met he straight on really good look rebound tipped around and a terrific job there on the Baseline to try and save it drori was able to do exactly that Tommy morrisy looking to take Valentine for some help on that call the Tigers thought it went off tayori after it bounced off one of the Clemson players to go out of bounds no Waterman the 611 senior back onun now for the Cardinals and itll be Louisville ball and theyll go to the Baseline at Ley 32 in the first meeting with Clemson draws the double locking came over to help swung out to Waterman shot clock at five Edwards Jr got to get a shot in the air lock and collects the board Clemson has been able to get a couple stops but the problem has been on the offensive end not getting anything going Zachary gave up a wide open layup to kick the basketball out Clemsons gone four and a half minut without a point and Ted Valentine has a foul here to stop the clock at 1325 to go and ruths the 68 freshman returns now for Pat Kelce and Hatley who has really been going as you mentioned that 30point game one of four Louisville Cardinals to have a 30point game this season along with Chucky heurn rign Smith and Terrence Edwards Jr locken Scott with some tough defense stuck right with it and its going to be Cardinal basketball on top 4334 score has been stuck there for a while ACC tournament semifinal number two Duke is into the championship at 830 tomorrow night Dicky V will join Cory and I courts side Applause heurn trying to operate and just flies that one wildly out of bound and heurn was expecting for Kai Rose to stay in the corner even as he changed directions and Ruth coming out of that spot again heurn gets the turnover but thats one where your Chemistry with your teammates ruths The Freshman has to stay disciplined and stay in that corner giving his teammate an outlet Chucky to the bench for spell tiger scoreless for the last 5 and a half minutes the last field goal was the chase Hunter threepoint field goal made travel well tip you cap to Louisville with the defensive pressure theyre bringing and thats what Pat Kelce has told us time and time again they were a good team in the nonconference but they became a great team in conference play once they picked it up defensively Ted Valentine on top of that Edwards Banks it in smart play by Edwards attacking Christian Reeves who just checked into the game for the first time we didnt see Reeves in the first half Reeves a big at 72 once again Lille forces the turnover and Chase Hunter getting frustrated because it was very physical for him trying to get to the rim no call on that possession Edwards leaning in kind of got dragged along there by Zachary literally had his hand on his hip and just pulling him OB I can tell you that Pat Kelce wears the physicality of his team as a badge of honor he does not mind the game being physical because he feels as though his team can be just as more more physical than anyone and right now youve seen the Cardinals trying to play through the physicality in comparison to the Tigers who have been looking for calls Edwards makes the first seven 99 at the line his son Trey was born on February 15 and the next day his proud father scored 15 against Notre Applause Dame so a N9 nothing Run for the Cardinals they lead at 4734 and 6 minutes without a point for the Tigers Hunter trying to end that Edwards coming out of the pack lost the ball a collision for that and is going to be a foul Tommy morsey came in I believe theyre going to get Waterman for that one Reeves had a angle on the basketball got to it first Waterman coming in for the foul OB but weve got a couple the great football programs getting it in it almost looks like the grit iron here on the hardwood Music e e e Music well quite a battle last night and Chucky hipper ended it against Stanford at the buzzer with the game winner Louisville their first ACC tournament semifinal appearance and theyre trying to make the most of that and for the Clemson Tigers that was a gritty win against SMU they rallied late and won that one by three both coming from behind to win their quarterfinal games and when you consider both these teams with a chance to play against the Blue Devils in the ACC tournament Championship Clemson already with a win over Duke but can truly gain even more respect and possibly boost their NCAA tournament seed with they win over the Blue Devils in the championship tomorrow Lis will of course want some get back from December sh onto the opposite side to finally end that drought and the difference OB in shefin went to the basket to score in comparison to trying to get a call thats the way the Tiggers are going to have to attack the rim from here on out because they this is allowing this game to be physical and Brad Brownell concerned about why thats a foul and you see I shein running back down the floor with the cut on his leg Im not sure hes going to be able to do that much longer though when infection control sees that theyre going to send him to the sidelines OB not to mention Cory Alexander who never misses on those and Hy breeder picking up the foul so its Edwards at the line and another one coming he is 18 and now he is going to have to come off and attend to that bleeding yeah once again infection control has him but you look at Ian shein Clemson players with 1000 points 800 rebounds and 200 assists throughout their career youre talking about some Legends Trevor Booker who was a stud and then you think about horse Grant with along with tree Rollins Elden Campbell Dell Davis youre talking about some of the best big men ever in the ACC history not just the Clemson alone well you know you talk about all those good players but theyve won 27 games its a program record theres a lot of conversation at Clemson that this is the best Clemson team ever I can tell you what theres they this is one of them but theyre is some competition you go back to the 1990 Squad and there been some great teams at Clemson but you absolutely can throw this team in the mix well theyre an elite 18 last year shein with a dribble down trying to get room to operate sticks another Basket in smart play by shein that close to the basket you want to go through the contact he has a double double now with 12 points and 10 rebounds and Clintons going to need to feature him more on the offensive end when he can win that battle they also need Chase Hunter whos playing with three fouls Edwards picked up the dribble Scott back for Hadley seven to shoot Hadley chest to chest with Zachary Zachary batted it away the shot one drop right at the buzzer and if youre shefin right now carve out some space on the interior again shefin not this time but a whistle yeah theyre going to get Victor lockin who puts James Scott in the back on that possession Brad Brownell tells Victor to calm down wants to have a conversation with them right now locking having words for the officials Brad Brownell making sure to let him know do not cost his team by getting a technical foul they picked up his second personal Scott to the line for a one and one and foul shooting for the big sophomore a challenge banked that one in but only 42 at the line well call that ATM yeah yeah deposit deposit yeah banks are not open this late how about that he made the Applause pair 5138 Applause Zachary Baseline High breeder into the paint lost his footing slipped a bit got it back and he scored smart play by high breeder however Hadleys able to get out in front of traffic of course Chucky heurn will find his teammates whenever they have an opportunity Zachary quickly to the other end for two and SP play by Zachary recognizing Chucky heer with those three fouls you want to attack him the same way Chase Hunter is being attacked Edwards just lost it lockin comes away with it somehow got it to Zachary point guard High breeder and was it knocked away from him and it was it was deflected so itll be Clemson ball 926 on the clock Brad Brownell talking to Victor locken letting him to calm down and dont foul dont commit a foul because youre frustrated in strong and He will draw a foul the big fella 70 at the foul line I think youre exactly right your observation about Pat Kelce he had a glint in his eye when he told Angel at halftime this is going to be very physical in the second half it was in the first half he was liking it he loves it and when you think about Pat Kelsey OB you go to a shoot around hes in the plays hes running around hes playing basketball actually setting screen on his guys when you play for a guy like that his energy is infectious even his assistant coaches everyone has a role in motivating the team coming through the tunnel on the way here its the noisiest tunnel youre ever going to hear when the Louisville Cardinals are coming through Pat kelse has absolutely had a significant presence in rebuilding this program and the excitement and the energy back into what has been a blue Bud well thats it and that that was Jim bims point the other day and that was 100 correct what he did in building this program back to respectability and relevance boy when you pick the right guy to do it they certainly did it makes such a difference the Cardinals hit a home run with Pat Kelce and he is a perfect fit for that program James Scott by the way picked up his fourth foul for Louisville so hes in in big trouble zipped into the corner and a threepointer on the money by Waterman and lton just fell asleep not recognizing that Waterman is a dead eyed threepoint shooter hes already knocked down one earlier in this game you cannot give him that much space uhoh time here for the Tigers lock and got it boy they needed that basket but what they cant afford is trade threes for twos adley cant finish Waterman and hell be headed to the line thats the spot theyre in right now they cant afford to be trading Hoops here with 840 to go and a trip to the championship game tomorrow night on the line hi breeders third foul Waterman came in really scuffling at the line weve got you covered on selection Sunday starts at 600 Eastern on sport Center recently guys but look at the field of 68 and at 800 the womens field of 68 revealed with Bracketology complete breakdown at 9 Eastern on ESPN 2 neither of these teams are going to be concerned about if theyre in the tournament is simply going to be about where do they go who do they play early but right now both more concerned about trying to have a date with the Blue Devils tomorrow and ACC tournament Championship entry for Lockett spinning spinning following his own Miss and thatll be a foul itll go the other way Ted Valentine jumping in with the whistle now theyre going to have to be separated locking getting heated and Lockett will pick up his third as we March to the other end you mentioned the Duke Blue Devils into the championship game at 830 tomorrow night Dicky V will join us here in Charlotte Victor lockin unable to get the first one to go and then the two hands in the back of Noah Waterman gets him a foul and thats going to be the third personal foul on locket by the way just in case you were wondering John shy did say after Dukes win over North Carolina earlier tonight Cooper flag will not play definitely not not play the championship game theyre going to go over and take a look at the monitor well take the break 822 to go here in our second Music semi e e e e p Music well Louisville able to do this go to 26 6 18 and2 in the ACC despite these guys missing and Cas prior early in the season when they got off to a really quick start they made it to the final of the battle for Atlantis thats when he got hurt blew out that knee but he was playing really well theyve actually been a better team after that injury and when you consider case and prior with an opportunity to come back next year youre looking looking forward to this Louisville team still being very productive a season from now getting him back into the lineup of course theres no certainties with anyone coming back but Cas and Pryor with the opportunity to come back and Javon Hatley with the new ruling from the NCAA regarding guys who played a year in junior college Hadley could be back as well so Im sure these are two guys that Pat Kelce would love to have back and fold a season from now its a shame those guys arent having any fun in the bench definitely have fun when youre up 13 right now looking at a chance to play in the ACC tournament Championship Game Hunter yep it hung on the iron and drops through still a lot of time left in this game after the comeback we saw earlier tonight anything is possible anything North Carolina 24 down almost tied the game against Duke at the buzzer adley gets into the painted area still working Waterman kicks it out for Edwards Edwards with 19 points he wants more round the back wants to shoot it got it in the air but well short great job defensely by Hy breeder on that possession not falling for the pump base Zachary gets it off quickly and air mail by Clemson hi breeder trying to get back Roose with the slam and this is the biggest lead tonight for the Lille Cardinals as they lead by 13 great vision by Chucky heurn off of the air ball leading Kai roof to where he was able to get out in the open dump putting the basketball ahead of traffic Zacharys pass it does get to Hunter but he cant hit the Applause shot Louisville with a full head of steam here in the semifinal Edwards on shefflin tough shot wins it back heres Waterman around and out another fight for the rebound and its shefflin to dig it out Lems has had a double of a time scoring in the second half Zachary slipped down he went shefflin saved it but hes on the line or there was a foul on the plate it was a foul Tommy Mory called a foul and that stops the clock at 620 to go and thatll go against the Cardinals Noah Waterman OB sport Obie we showed the missing players for Louisville but we did not show Rain Smith who led the ACC in threepoint field goals made per game this year at three and a half when you consider the reason why lble is up 13 in this game its because of their depth they have more gods that Pat Kelsey can rely on to be able to go out and play Heavy minutes no rain Smith thats okay we put Noah Waterman into the game into the starting lineup hes knocked down two threes but more importantly theyre an even better defensive team with Noah Waterman on the floor and thats been the mantra for Pat Kelce all season long its about the next man up and this team has got gotten better you saw him in the Bahamas early and this team has gotten better as the season gone along winning 20 of their last 21 games hot coming in so is Clemson theyve won nine straight thats on the line Applause tonight at burn will take his time Applause here and shot clock down to three cant cash in and its Tapped Out of Bounds and were going the other way with 549 left to be played here in this semifinal but look at tayori coming in from the opposite side trying to come up with that offensive rebounds we get a look at rain Smith but tayori coming off the bench gives Pat Kelce that energy and all the effort that you need to be successful and theres no drop off when they go to their substitutions Zachary pulls up to Fire noome and another whistle underneath and thats going to be four on Victor lockin so the 611 senior From Russia with his fourth Hunter has three hide breeder with Applause three and Hadley goes to the line you want the Fife Wing from Colorado OBU go back to the game was 38 to 34 Chase Hunter picks up his third foul he has to go to the bench and just like that the Cardinals go on a run by time the Brad Brown El can get Chase Hunter back in the game two minutes later theyre now down double figures and the cars have been able to Main Ain a double figure lead ever since that was the time the offensive faucet got switched off too that was absolutely it because you need Hunter on the floor for the offense to flow in the right way for the Applause Tigers long one Hunter will knock it down from threepoint land and thats why you need him on the floor hes the one guy that can truly create his own for the Tigers well as we saw in game one nice reminder theres a lot of time left just under five Applause minutes adley hes got Zachary gets by him on a strong Drive draws the foulley very much a glue guy for the Cardinals good passer good rebounder he can stick the threepoint shot and plays under siiz against bigger players if youve got Ry Smith in the lineup Hadleys really at the four spot but plays under siiz very strong played at Colorado a season ago with three draft picks and moving to Louisville this year and is fit in perfectly with Pat Kelce as his hard no styles allows him to be one of the toughest guys on the floor at all times well the Cardinals so many great teams at Freedom Hall and at the Y Center and their fans in Louisville they love this team Zachary with a bounce speed for shefflin and a block Big Time play out of the sky by tayori and another whistle 4 and 12 minutes to go tell you what when l is a good program as they are again its great for college basketball ratings on ESPN it absolutely is and Obi thats a foul I dont care how you slice it you can allow guys to play physical but you cant allow fouls thats a foul on that last possession their fans love to watch him and love to fill up the y center its one of the great buildings in sports to see a game there are very few environments in in college basketball like Louisville especially when its going well and a very knowledgeable educated fan base they love their basketball of course in the state of Kentucky the largest television market in the country for college basketball they lead at Applause 6452 and Le will try a three and and it goes down but you talk about all the different guys for the Cardinals that can beat you we mentioned theyve had four different players throughout this season score 30 points in the game the first half it was about Terence Edwards the second half has been about Javon Hatley who is now up to 19 points on an efficient six of eight from the field two of three from three he is bns exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by T price invest with confidence e e e e e todays experts at work brought to you by principal and when you think about experts youve got to talk about Chucky heurn the great vision to see his teammate Kai ruse getting out in transition off of the Miss shot and placing the basketball right in front leading him to the rim the dunk B Roose and the Cardinals are out and running but how about the line from Chucky heurn only nine points in this game but five assists and six steals over be by the accs defensive player of the year as mentioned came in number eight in the country in Steels and adding to that total Hunter at the Applause line of course there was a lot of debate about who should be the ACC defensive player of the year it went to Chucky and there was debate about who should be the ACC coach of the year and it went to Pat Kelsey and Im not mad at either one of those but there of course were very viable options Applause otherwise three and a half minutes to go and Chucky heurn hit the deck and the foul will go against Chase Hunter four on him now along with 14 points for the tiger star and heurn to the line where he hits 85 he had a game early in the season against Florida State where he made 17 foul shots it is late were pushing midnight not everyones going to make it now tomorrow night just one game and it starts at 830 this one didnt get under way until about 1000 I tell you what my guy here is enjoying what hes seeing from the car he is wide eyed and ready to celebrate but still 3 minutes and 20 seconds away from that Wiggins looking for a b shot and that goes down nice play by Wiggins going off the bounce and using his size now the Tigers will try to pressure get the basketball out of the hands of heurn and he gets a timeout so well take the break as well we have just over 3 minutes to go in our second C final e e e Music yeah you Applause did he coming up in sports center right after this one the ending of the North Carolina Duke game you have to see to believe plus the Cavaliers seek their 16th straight win and Cooper cup has found a new home for the upcoming NFL season sports center with David Lloyd and Michael leaves on ESPN in the ESPN out with 3 minutes to go here and a tie up on the play and thats the best thing that could have happened for the Tigers out the timeout and Pat Kelsey preparing his team for the pressure Edwards falls down allowing Tigers to get the hands on the basketball tying it up possession arrow in Clemsons favor going back to the Tigers underneath their basket Zachary gets it in Hunter attacks no adley comes away with it hes double up and fouled and if thats Victor lockin thats going to be five thats five on lockin so the 611 senior from Russia is done for the night with his team down 6956 and Hadley to the other end of shoot foul shots and Chase Hunter just unable to finish as lockin gets over but you see that right arm get around underneath Hatley smart play by Hatley and for Victor lockin when you know you have four fouls at that point just use your 611 7ot size just stand there with your hands up and dont put yourself in a predicament to pick up that fifth foul thats what bob Knight used to say you know you got him stuck at the Baseline dont reach yeah youve got another Defender with that Baseline helping you out Zachary trying to get him closer but cant rebound batted around loose again hun went down on his knees in a whistle I believe theyre going to get tayori for that one Hunter had the Applause basketball so 242 to go Chase Hunter getting in after the basketball he gets possession as tayori comes in with the foul and allows Hunter to get to the free throw line an opportunity to put points on the board without the clock running 86 at the line Gori second by the way and Waterman back on for the Cardinals Obie it was a great offensive start for the Tigers Chase Hunter got the steel to start the game off gets the dunk early they go Applause up I believe 72 early in this game but Louisville has clamped down defensively the tiger shooting 365 from the field and 323 in the second half Clemson forcing to turnover 70 58 Hunter back for Wiggins Chase Hunter again off the fake got it so back to a 10point game the pressure has bothered Lis quite a bit broke it that time ahead to Waterman and now turn over and the foul on Watermans going to send JayZ to the line could we have Deja Vu once again OB we saw a tremendous comeback the North Carolina Tar Hills down 24 at one point in the second half and had a chance to tie the game at the free throw line at 72 Waterman fouling out number five 2 minutes 11 seconds to go two shots for Zachary and a miss on number one got to take care of these opportunities especially at the free throw line to set up your pressure and if youre the Cardinal right now now youre going to have to have someone outside of Chucky hurn be able to handle the basketball because the tigers are going to try to take him out Zachary makes a second ninepoint game and a fast whistle there by Tony Henderson and a foul against Clemson and theyll get Zachary for that one and thats going to be the fourth on Jaden Zachary thats the area of concern for Brad Brownell if you have to foul down the stretch youve got Victor lockin whos already fouled out Chase Hunter and Jaden Zachary both playing with four fouls so if we see free throws again for the Clemson Tigers most likely they will be substitutes at the table to be able to come in on the defensive end of the floor senior from Atlanta Edward shooting two made number Music one at 25 yesterday in their quarterfinal winning gets the pair and in this one he is 21 and the Tigers take a timeout so well break for 30 seconds Louisville 72 and Clemson 61 Music back in Charlotte and a happy Saturday to you just after midnight so later on today at 830 pm we will have the championship game of the ACC tournament Duke is already in and one of these two teams will join him at 830 along with myself Dave OBrien Cory Alexander and the Hall of Famer Dicky V looking forward to having Dicky V with us for the championship game tomorrow and Nicki V has seen the Clemson Tigers play against the Blue Devils we saw that back on February the 8th but he has not had the Lal Cardinals and the Duke Blue Devils the one and two seeds in this ACC tournament this year the two teams met back on December the 8th but that was a completely different Cardinal team than what were seeing now Obie I believe theyre much better and also have to remember that there will be no Cooper flag he has already been been announced by John Shire to be out in the championship game great opportunity for the cards if they can finish this one off Hy breeder will scoop it and cant finish but a whistle to the 202 showing and Edwards with the foul I breeder will shoot now this is the area right now I may have to get both Chase Hunter and JayZ out of the game both of them with four fouls you dont want to put either one of those guys in a situation where they have to fou defensively Brad Brown now had sent Dell Jones to the scores table but brings him Applause back Hy breeders second he is 16 for 16 at the line for the season hard to pressure OB as guards and you cannot pick up a foul they break it for Edwards throw up yes sir and Scott with a dunk thats the way you have to attack if youre going to get pressure dont wait and pull the basketball out go ahead and take the two points because thats the only way you can increase the pressure got to find that masked man out of the corner swished in by Wiggins 7466 still time here for Clemson and a foul by sheflin great foul by sheflin right there it was going to be another easy bucket for scottt and again if youre going to have to send someone to the line you would much prefer it be Trey ory in comparison to Chucky heurn or Edwards so the senior will go to the line 69 his first free throw tonight too Applause strong a couple of Misses here would really open the door again for the Tigers we had an amazing ridiculous come back by North Carolina in game one so would it be as Yogi said deja vu all over again Zachary Hunter a quick lift got it threepointer and a timeout Clemson executed to Perfection got the look you wanted Chase Hunters able to raise up and knock it down weve got a sixpoint game OB 117 remaining and Jaden Zachary was never taking this to the basket it was only misconception to allow Chase Hunter to come up two screens and knock down to three from the right wing to make it a twopossession game there is our reset either side has a foul to give Louisville with two timeouts one for the Tigers and the Cardinals own the possession arrow with 117 to go the the tigers are absolutely going to come after the Cardinals with full court pressure but you have to remember both the guards H Chase Hunter and Jaden Zachary both playing with four foul be interesting to see if Brad Rell brings those guys back on the floor right now knowing that theres a possibility that they may have to foul my mama told me strange things happen after midnight well see 117 to go Louisville looked pretty safe about 10 minutes Applause ago urn and nearly stolen away and there is a foul on the play and the foul is going to be on Chucky hebburn wow after Jane Zachary did a great job of stripping the basketball from his hands now JayZ will go to the free throw line with an opportunity wow to score with no time running off of the clock great hands and this is why Brad brell will not take Jaden Zachary and Chase Hunter out of the game and he drops in the first one four fouls on heurn by the way great Hands by Zachary to strip the basketball down and then in going after it gets the foul he makes the pair fourpoint game and they press Applause again Edwards trying to get out of there knocked away stolen away Hunter trying to keep it alive knocked out of play by Louisville itll be kumson ball with 104 to go and Chase Hunters cramping Applause OB trying to stretch out that right leg after going for the loose ball Applause 7571 the lead was 15 with 328 to go Hunter on the drive got to go and now you can pull the pressure back you dont have to pressure all you need is a defensive stop Edwards needing help doubled up got it free to heurn this is a two point game another amazing comeback tonight here in Charlotte urn holding he made a giant shot last night got it downstairs up and a foul or wait a minute it was a tie up on the play the ball will go back to the Cardinals L will have it with 27 points three and that probably is the worst thing that could have happened for the Tigers because they were up against the shot clock they would have been guaranteed to get the basketball back and you see tayori got away with a little bit of a chicken wing on that possession sure did but with the tie up possession now the shot clock goes completely off and the Cardinals can keep it forcing the Tigers to have to foul well down the stretch we come the second semifinal that has run a very similar course in game one Duke had a 24point lead North Carolina came storming back who would have predicted that given those circumstances and they wound up Duke holding on to a threepoint win and how about this one Chase Hunter knocking down to three and then defensively James Zachary stripping the basketball away and then Chase Hunter coming up with the steal hustling after the basketball gets possession back and then Chase Hunter attacking the rim able to get the finish and just like that the Tigers within two points one possession but now with the shot clock being completely off the car is going to have to handle the basketball and take care of business at the free throw line the Tigers need a turnover or most likely a foul to get them an opportunity on the other end to tie it up 15point lead with 328 left for Louisville since then Clemson has outscored them 196 they have forced a bunch of big turnovers and how about the Clemson guards being able to pressure the way that they have both with four fouls and staying out of foul trouble that has been a huge ordeal one the reason graad brell knows his guys hes trusted them to stay on the floor and still be able to be a aggressive defensively without fouling so they have reset the clock to 282 and the shot clock at three oh now thats a Difference Applause Maker adley off the inbounds jumping and firing it never touched anything thats a shot clock violation and the Tigers have the ball best possible scenario we saw no shock clock I thought the tied up possession took the shot clock away but the officials going over and resetting it with only 3 seconds remaining was the best case scenario for the Tigers man so 24 seconds to go Obie we have seen Clemson in this scenario so many times throughout this season this was the case against Memphis we saw it against Georgia Tech it was a case against Carolina and right now rad Rell wants to talk it out what they want often times weve seen Chase Hunter go for the three and the win will Brad Brownell because we know Chase Hunters getting the basketball its not even a question as to whos going to have it oh yeah but will Brad Brown now urge Chase Hunter to go to the rim to put the pressure on the officials to call a foul or give them a chance to finish or will chase go for the three well he has been the man throughout his career he did it against Duke he did it last night when they needed him the most down the stretch he made big shots lets see if it falls into the hands of number one for the Clemson Tigers again with 22 seconds to go 13 times in his in the last two seasons Chase Hunter has been TR trusted with the ball in his hands the last shot of the of the half first half or the last shot of the game 13 times he has made a bucket none none of those opportunities bigger than the one that he has in front of them right now to tie this game and send it to Overtime or to send his team to the ACC tournament Championship with a Applause three Clemson looking to get it in and finally do I breeder bouncing up high for Hunter hes got the ball now 15 seconds left oh switching defensively Hunter quick move to his Right Scoop blocked Scott got a hand on it and a whistle with six seconds to go and a foul and Louisville with a huge defensive play and Brad Brownell in disbelief that theres no foul over won this call that is a foul OB its one thing to allow guys to play and be physical but this has to be called theres three fouls on that possession Scott fouls him from behind ory fouls him across his body and heurn misses the foul shot take another look no whistle on that heurn second and he got that one still time six seconds left threepoint game here comes Hunter looking to tie it flips it up there Louis with the rebound and they hang on to win it 7673 the Cardinals are into the championship of the ACC tournament and a
