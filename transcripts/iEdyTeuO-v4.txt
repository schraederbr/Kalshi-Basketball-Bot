Student section is jampacked GAME ONE BASKETBALL IS BACK JAY Alter and were going to have some fireworks today And we are underway as our ACC double header continues on opening night and its Louisville that starts with the basketball with the fivestar Mike Brown Jr One thing youre going to notice all game long States going to throw a ton of different defenses different types of pressures They thrive on opportunities to get out in transition and they love to force turnovers Oh they were looking for liftoff there to Javon Hadley This is a South Carolina State program under head coach Eric Martin longtime Bob Huggins assistant Take a look at the Bulldog starting five a team that was one point away from getting to the NCAA tournament Lost by one to Norfolk State in the MAK championship last year Held on to some players but its their pace of play which gives people problems They go inside to the true freshman Duran Hodgej Jr kicks it out to right Cant knock it down This is a South Carolina State program that has had a revival of their own first 20 win season in 22 years under Eric Martin whos the reigning Mak coach of the year and rightfully so A Bob Huggin disciple and you can see it the way they play toughness pressure defense and finding guys who can score on the offensive end of the floor A good defensive possession by the Cardinals and Pat Kelsey Louisville head coach told us Look weve got to guard hard without fouling As you take a look at the Cardinals starting five Javon Hadley the lone Cardinal player that started all 35 games last season back for Louisville And the first thing everybody thinks about is shooting And heres example numero UNO ISAAC MCNEELY COMES OVER FROM Virginia and theyre going to get shots beating pressure in the corners Now McNeely who led the ACC in threepoint percentage does exactly what he was brought in to do to open the scoring And Louisville is not shy They are going to let it fly And you can see why with the elite perimeter shooting they have cheering Bulldogs trying to answer Backto back misses for Deay Knights right MCNEELY FOR THREE GOT IT AGAIN COME ON JAY ALTER TWO FOR A DOLLAR ISAAC MCNEELY his job this year so much easier cuz he has all these guys that can create looks for him on the perimeter But fans of ACC basketball know McNeely well His three years in Virginia He fits perfectly into this Pat Kelsey offense Very strong defensive start in the opening two minutes Bulldogs still looking for their first bucket And Louisville has come out with the intensity that Pat Kelsey craves each and every game and hes getting it so far in the opener Not just in the game but in the shoot around I I mean for those of you who have not been to a Pat Kelsey shoot around they ought to sell tickets to that The energy is different for his staff and what theyre capable of doing And Isaac McNeely keeps getting loose on the backside of that press Thats got to be fixed if youre South Carolina State Bob and an easy put in Sedanda Fu the junior from Germany Played in German Bundesliga of last year This guys really talented Has a 7 foot3 wingspan Hes a lob threat around a rim as Ryan Conwell gets caught with his hands in the cookie jar here early Well this is the new age of college basketball You take a look at FR who comes in as a junior but like you said four seasons of professional basketball in Germany So hes a veteran He absolutely is and he played he was a big contributor at a high level but were seeing that throughout the ACC You cant blame the coaches because the opportunities there and players are really good around the world You look at what Tyson Ritter did at Virginia today So many different guys making an impact and the recruiting base just got bigger Heres Colin McKenzie Hands off to Jaden Johnson the Mak preseason player of the year misfires Jump ball Possession arrow stays with South Carolina State In the game for the Cards number 14 Adrian Wley Eric Martin We told you MAK coach of the year a year ago Regular season champs First 21 20 win season in 22 years just trying to keep going in the right direction Theyve won more games every year hes been at the house Trying to squeeze it through the back door and its another turnover How do you not love the defensive intensity by Louisville to start out this game Hands everywhere Communicating on switches Going to be really happy But this guys fast and open floor Goodness me How about the speed Hadley drills it from the corner All set up by Brown How good is that Chucky He gone Mikel Brown in You see the special talent that this freshman is Bulldogs trying to weather the EARLY STORM STOLEN AWAY UP AHEAD BROWN BACK to Hadley And its a 13 nothing run to start this one Welcome to college basketball University of Louisville cheering Could applause not have scripted a better start for the home team Cardinals And you see Mike El Brown He gets out in the open floor Such a gifted passer And you have shooters all over the place Oh and Javon Hadley he knows how to finish as well Grab your tickets with South Carolina and Weve used a free appetizer because you are seated in the Texas Peanut gallery legendary foodend congratulations One two one Two three four UD 1 2 3 Weve used the term music revival So Zach Bryan has that famous song change the end of the revival music word to V I L L E Her goal is simply to strive to have the number one culture in the country Were reviving the community itself renewable basketball back to its rich history of you know getting to the tournament getting to final fours and national championships cheering music The revival thats what year one under Pat Kelsey was all about He has this fan base believing dreaming again of championship expectations entering year two And you look at that its first hard to believe that Louisville ever only won four games in a season 27 in year music one under Pat Kelsey Pat Kelseys got the fan base forgetting those last two seasons Thats the excitement level thats come with this coaching staff and what theyve been able to accomplish And the good news for Cardinals fans and to be honest with you too Jay ACC fans is the fact that year two for Pat Kelsey traditionally has been an explosion year A 19 win improvement the biggest in all of college basketball Hes not going to be able to do that Theres not enough games but they are hoping to get back to ACC championships and final four expectations Their defense dialed in to start this one Good fight from South Carolina State to steal it back and a foul called Kobe Rogers Thats one thing you have to realize if youre Ali Khalifa you get a defensive rebound that outlet pass has to be on the money to Kobe Rogers Why South Carolina States going to sneak back up and try to get some of these turnovers And Eric M Martin lets him float up that direction Well this is Rainal Wright the junior from Englewood California He was a late addition to this Bulldogs roster You see the number 30 He doesnt even have a name on his back of the uniform all the way into the one thing the Bulldogs did very effectively in MAK play a year ago when they won the regular season was get to the foul line and huge point of emphasis for Pat Kelsece today to keep the Bulldogs off the free throw line and dont let them disrupt the the rhythm of the game Right They get to the free throw line they make shots they set up their pressure and it puts you back on your heels a little bit Now that Mike Browns out of the game whos going to be your pressure breaker right here So right now its Kobe Rogers and he draws the foul Louisville theyve started in a great offensive rhythm though before South Carolina music State was able to set up their press Five for five shooting all five assisted Browns got three of those assists That could be hard early in the season right Tio To find that offensive chemistry particularly so many new players coming in Yeah it can be And I think the exhibitions are certainly helping Thats true Here right I mean its changed a little bit to where the exhibitions arent closed door and as a player that really helps establish your rhythm quicker What a pass by the hot hand First miss of the night You mentioned the exhibitions two highprofile ones against Bucknell and Kansas You know if the Bucknell game counted Louisville hit 23 threes in that game That would have been a program record Im just going to This may be a not so hot take Jay That records getting broken with this team this year The three transfers that came over Adrien Woolly whos number 14 guarding the inbounder right here shot 41 from three Ryan Conwell 42 Isaac McNeely 42 This team can shoot the basketball and theyve got playmakers to get them in position This thing is just a really talented roster and Pat Kelseys going to put them together Shot clock down to 10 Elite defense to go along with that perimeter shooting we were talking about Cardinals force another turnover and Woolly will get two after the foul You were just talking about Adrien Woolly sophomore out of Tuscaloosa Alabama Comes over from Kennesaw State where he was the Conference USA freshman of the year and was a first team allconerence member in the Conference USA Look this is a guy at 65 200 lb Plays with terrific pace and I think hes put on even more weight since coming here to Louisville can really shoot the basketball understands how to play without the basketball to find creases but physically imposing when he gets into the paint able to draw the foul I like how decisive theyve been here early Jay on the offensive side of the ball They know theyre seeing pressure Sometimes the best way to put out fire is with fire Thats how theyre playing right now cheering playing with comp confidence and command Great composure Sure In the opening five minutes and certainly in control of this one Theyve only let up a point Right trying to shake free Tenny with the shot clock down to two draws the foul Think Tenny might have gotten away with one roots little too close on the contest but as a veteran leg kicker when it came to getting shots off Well done on Tennibbees part I I like the impai roots You look at him I think hes grown an inch since coming to campus I mean hes every bit of 69 610 wide shoulders This young man continues to improve who came out of IMG Academy was forced into action a little quicker than I think Pat Kelsey and his staff anticipated with all the injuries to Kasem Prior and some other guys Uh hes a young man who has talent cheering Well the ceiling is skyhigh Talking with his head coach Pat Kelsey they totally believe that the sophomore Kenny Roots has some incredible basketball ahead South Carolina State two points both from the foul line on separate trips So still yet to make a bucket from open play They are 0 for six from the floor The Louisville defense the story so far in this one The give and go results in a foul You know its interesting You see Ali Khalifa coming into the game Ball goes to him at the top of the key immediately and his specialty is a passer from the top of the key You see quick slip bounce pass right here earlier you had Sandanda Fu in the game whos getting to the rim for a lob but just such a terrific feel was a terrific passer at Charlotte then at BYU then just understands how to throw his man open Pat Kelsey told me last season he said I cant wait till this guy comes back for us because he is the best passing center in college basketball Now Pat Kelsey is prone to hyperbole but Im not going to disagree with him on that one And they have such quality depth feels like at every position for Louisville but particularly at that big man spot when Prior comes back 100 And you know Kasem Prior gives you some versatility as a scoring fiveman from the perimeter So they can just throw so many different looks at you on the offensive end of the floor Not sure quite whats going on over here on the SC State side I think they were trying to get a substitution in there and the officials have just come over and clarified that that was not an opportunity to sub but now they will get it James James Morrow the junior from Jacksonville Florida checks in Well nothing has come easy so far in the season opener for South Carolina State going against this Louisville defense Its relentless pressure and when you can sub so many guys and you have 10 11 guys that are going to see minutes theres no pull away Im not sure what I saw right here A foul called against Louisville Thats his first 15 foul Male back in for the Cards replacing Wy Theyre going to give it to the Bulldogs underneath their own hoop Tennay into the lane into contact Well defended Khalifa poked it away and its deflected off a Bulldog So its Louisville basketball Ali Khalifa I I I have to brag on this young man He look his body has completely changed from what he was at BYU for Mark Pope a few seasons ago this last season rehabbing and clearly that has paid off How about the first bucket for the fivestar freshman Mike Brown Jr flying to the hoop just silky smooth He can beat you so many different ways including as a passer Mororrow that goes begging South Carolina State still desperate to find their footing in this one McNeely cant hit it Say this McNeely is going to have opportunities this season Saw what Re Smith was able to do McNeely a little bit bigger See how this carries through And this is what makes them really dangerous too So many different guys that can initiate the break as you see Ryan Codwell drive the f draw the foul But Mikel Brown shifty is an understatement Uses his eyes to manipulate the defense and finds that little creasing crevice Fakes Tene out of his shoes in a silky smooth finish This man is talented Just carrying over what he did last summer for Team USAs U19 team in Switzerland Well you see that and then you combine it with the fact that he won the threepoint contest of the McDonalds AllAmerican Games Hey if youre going to press out on him hell blow right by you So difficult to defend And hes not very wide Meaning if he comes off a ball screen and you see him won the gold medal he was the best player on Team USA AJ Deansa ended up winning the most outstanding player or best player of you know the World Championships I I I dont know how that happened because Mikel Brown Jr on what he did at that tournament was second to none He was fantastic He was efficient and he just had so many wow moments that you sit back and you watch youre like man this kids 18 19 years old What the future is going to be for him I think what separates you at the point guard position is you can defer when you have talent around you but you can also take over And we have seen that early in his career with that Team USA performance and early in his Louisville career as well Well just a talented individual and that and the floor is open because they have so many good shooters Louisville already starting to separate up 212 as we step aside Oh my god Tear Oglesby Jay Alter with you at the KFC Young Center Louisville already in command A 212 lead South Carolina say 0 for8 from the field Four turnovers And Louisvilles got nine points off of those turnovers Six field goals six assists So many different ball handlers on the floor and now theyre trapping it My goodness Another turnover And were going to talk all night long about how good Louisville is on offense Tio but their defense has really been what has thrown the first punch in this opening seven minutes There hasnt been one uncontested shot And another foul called Conwell got Hods Jr up in the air Got the Brahma full in the game 16 Velis Zugis You were working on that all afternoon and you nailed it 10 out of 10 Ive been working on that The inlaws are Greek Got to make sure that Okay Yeah Zuger is 53 in white Another one of these internationals brought in by Pat Kelsece Watch out And he slams it home right on Q applause The guy looks like hes cut out of stone He could jump a little too What a play Terrific roll Better finish Eight nothing run over the last two minutes Louisville Theyre in midseason form Battling for every ball Shot out of a cannon to start this season McNeely cant finish it And a foul on the rebound Terrific play by Zubes Youre going to see him on the floor a lot But terrific pass by Muel Brown And dunk on you from Greece with love Zugus Hes a better athlete than I think the Louisville staff anticipated when he came over This is a guy who has played significant minutes with the Greek senior national team And the head coach of the Greek senior national team Vanil Vasilus Spanulus one of the greatest players in Euro League history says hes the next great Greek captain So there are not better Theres not a better recommendation for a young talent than him But look at the mix and match Mohamd Kamar from Sagal red shirting this season But all three of those guys on your right Sandanda Fu Ali Khalifa Zugris these guys all can attack you in different ways and thats what makes him so dangerous Man the pressure defense delivers again up court in a hurry Brown the floater leaves it short Pull up pop Hods Jr misfires South Carolina State still looking for their first bucket from open play Their two points have come from the free throw line Hadley draws the foul Javon Hadley will be at the line when we come back Louisville so impressive to start this one a 232 lead nearly midway through this first half Be sure to tune in to the Pat Kelsey radio show at 939 on Monday November 17th Clear Fall Dodgers and Coach Kelsey talk everything basketball Dont miss the Pat Kelsey radio show Monday November 17th from 7 to 800 pm Brought to you by Roosters a fun casual joy All right folks Were up here in section 105 for Mikes car wash of the game going home with road D in section 105 Everybody going home with an ultimate car wash Compliments of Mikes car wash Lets go for section 105 again Dont forget its Louis Tuesdays every Tuesday during football season Get 5 off Mike Cares from Louis Tuesday at 7 1 2 3 4 Hello My fault Now Louisville off to a strong start which is encouraging Teratogans because you look at that early season slate eight days from now you got Kentucky then at Cincinnati at Arkansas Memphis and and Tennessee all before December 16th Thats right That is a loaded slate And my goodness Im happy that the Cardinals have a little time before they get to play Tennessee again Obviously the beginning of last season didnt go according to plan but Pat Kelsey talked about these early conference challenges are huge for the development of the program Louisvilles always going to get better towards the end of the year but being able to test yourself early in the year like they are going to provide dividends towards the end of the season I cant wait for that Kentucky game though My goodness you want to talk about an atmosphere in this place Well Pat Kelsey told us they went to the Bahamas last year and thats really when they found out okay we got something special here So its those early season tests where if you come out victorious in them and play well doing it you can look around that locker room and go Yeah we are every bit as good as that number 11 ranking we can compete for an ACC championship a Final Four run Tell you what if this games any type of predictor 242 is a heck of a way to start Make a statement Oh this defense has been incredible South Carolina State struggling to get open looks Another contested shot Misfires cheering Theyve missed all 11 theyve taken in this first half And that is a testament to the Louisville defense Great pass wide open Usually Hadley will make you pay from there Good transition defense Pat Kelsey was preaching transition to us when we spoke with him before the game Louisvilles been dominant on both sides of the ball Finally a tipin finish First basket of the night for South Carolina State Comes 9 and 12 minutes into this one South Carolina State last year number one in their league in offensive rebounding percentage They live with those extra opportunities Conwell knocks it down Ryan Conwell the transfer from Xavier Game looks easy when everybodys making shots huh Well he comes in as a threepoint specialist over 40 the last two seasons very consistent scorer to add to this talented roster Well opening week for college basketball season continues right here on the ACC Network Friday night Indiana State at Cambridge indoor to take on Duke and then NC Central at North Carolina Tar Hills looked pretty good in their opener earlier tonight Excited about watching Duke this season Camboozer and their exhibition against University of Tennessee was fantastic I talked to Kevin Love about him the other day Really excited about the player Boozers going to become I said he reminds me a lot of you Kevin goes I dont know Hes going to be better than me And I said man hey Kev you need to relax because I will tell that story And you got it in 10 minutes into the first game You take a look at the preseason first team all ACC and youve got two Louisville Cardinals in there to go along with Boozer who you were just talking about Both those guys Conwell and Brown you see it early why theyre so highly touted But Darien Williams at NC State comes over from Texas Tech a guy that can really score the basketball plays the 34 inside out and ACC Barkley Im going with that Hows that Youll take it Most people only know Barkley as the uh commentator We got to get these kids on YouTube to watch some highlights for them to understand that those kids need to start playing 2K or something because Barkley was a prop Right now the Louisville defense has been a problem for South Carolina State 25point lead midway through this first half but theyve got backto back baskets after going nine and a half minutes without one Open look Rogers That rattles in and out Offensive rebound keeps it alive Good ball movement Another great look Tip in wont count Thats a goend on Fu I I want to take another look because Spru was so high above the rim on that tip end Were going to take another look at it right here Is it outside the sim My I think they might have missed that one Hey first game for everybody screaming and we have our first review Were have to throw the rule graphic up And youre right Tio And we dont have a great angle on it from where were sitting but that replay showed that this will very likely be overturned We have to step aside Well be right back Time out by Louisville to challenge the basket Correct So we do have a challenge by Louisville So as you can see the officials are over at the monitor That is Jerry Heater and Trey Stein First challenge new rule in college basketball this season where were going to take another look at a potential offensive goalending call Sandanda Fu was so high he had to double pump his hand to get up there I thought the ball got outside the cylinder Were going to be able to take another look at it right here Look at how high this sevenfooter got Its close Youre right though Tio He does have to push it back into the cylinder into the rim After review the play on the floor is upheld Basket interference screaming All right They didnt get the looks that uh the Louisville faithful thought they got So and again the call on the floor was a goalend So you need that indisputable evidence that it was indeed not a goalend And the officiating crew felt like they didnt get it Louisville sets up their fullourt pressure Its been relentless all night Another turnover there right on Q Well the last thing South Carolina State has needed tonight is to give Louisville extra possessions Got him The turnovers are piled up and Louisville makes you pay Cany Ruth with a rim rocker Terrific screen on the backside by Ryan Conwell They worked on that during shoot around trying to get an easy bucket against that high pressure full deny of South Carolina State Heres Woolly Its a nice beer switch South Carolina State You get by the first one the next guy just pops up but you got to continue playing That was close Roots going back to the rim Swaned out of his hands Youre going to see a baseline out of bounds set Louisville was working on this today at shootaround Just a terrific screen by Conwell Really laying the wood and he finds roots to be able to finish music Nice Bob O Tough take Count it Plus the foul Adrian Woolly all muscle there and one opportunity We talk about being physically overwhelming The strength coaches at Louisville phenomenal these guys look like they could play defensive end At least half of them do I mean you see the body size comparatively speaking whether its Woolly Zugas Roots has put on significant weight I I mean its really amazing to see the size collectively of this Cardinals team Well they have imposed their will in this first half A 346 lead Mismatch on the block South Carolina State cashes in They got McNeely posted up We are in the bonus Although thousands piled up in this first half James Morrow who just had the bucket hes got four of South Carolina States eight Coach Eric Martin said Mororrow is going to be the guy that takes a leap returning to the program after only averaging two points a game last season And look Louisville Jay weve been saying it very much in the conversation to make a final four this year Thats the type of talent this team has However South Carolina State one point away cheering from getting to the NCAA tournament themselves They have pieces to compete in the MAK just overmatched today against a Louisville team thats really playing well The ball movement is in midseason form right now for the Cardinals McNeely step back three Missed it Offensive rebound but given away And again the transition defense right there for Pat Kelseys team communication really really good on that end of the floor McNeely though hit his first two threes The last two hes taken hes been off balance Sometimes his shooters you tend to make things harder than what they need to be as Maro No dice there Well defended by Khalifa Louisville was looking to run again and Khalifa behind that pass from McNeely Time is out on the Louisville in command 368 in the main system Im over

music big on South Carolina State You look at the preseason poll Terrence Olesby Duke 1 Louisville music 2 Those were the only two teams out of all 18 that even received a first place vote I think theyre in tier one of the ACC as far as talents concerned music But that second tier gets really interesting too NC State North Carolina I would throw Virginia in that mix as teams that can make real noise come March Uh you look at the right side of that graphic though Yes Virginia Tech music today Thats your sleeper Thats my sleeper They got a guy named Neoclas Abdales Greek national team player 69 point guard eight points tonight nine assists playing the point at 69 That that guy can really go and they added Ammani Hanssbury from West Virginia whos just an all toughness guy Uh this is going to be a really good team I thought they were picked entirely too low You are very dialed in on the Greek national team for opening night here Theres been so many guys coming over from Europe and different parts of the world If youre not dialed in its almost impossible to keep up right I mean uh Abdales Zuganis those guys played together on the U20s Uh this guy Zugus in your screen he is a guy that has been uh touted as like the next Greek guy Abdales had he gone to the NBA draft last year would have been in that early second round conversation Quick shot Im not sure about that one like he would have been selected and he goes to Virginia Tech Gives them a solid bonafide decision maker with the ball in his hands Uhoh Almost another turnover The Louisville defense the story of this first half South Carolina State started this game 0 for 12 from the field That is the first time a team has done that at Division 1 basketball since 2020 H Houston Christian at TCU McNeel a three BURIES IT ISAAC Mcely just knocked down his third of this first half Look at you Look at you Walter Mcley Fantastic stuff Hey back on balance right Yeah Uhoh What do we have here Hes been letting it fly That was his sixth threepoint attempt in this first half A call number 22 Thats his first So the officials are going over the previous play is under review Taking a look at the previous play the McNeely three Fans of ACC basketball that know McNeely well from Virginia where he led the ACC in threepoint shooting a year ago Theyve heard this story but indulge me Comes from Poco West Virginia Yeah he does Where his mascot was the Dots So he was a PA dot has a jersey hanging in his dorm room The polka dots we have the call on the floor stands Louisville will have two shots So they call the foul against James Morrow for a push underneath So after the shot goes up youre going to take a look at Morrow underneath McNeely knocks it through Its crashing in there on Roots So since the balls already let go now Roots going to be shooting two foul shots to add insult to injury How about a fivepoint possession Hey and sometimes its hard for these guys coming up playing against Louisville in game one Theyre trying to be just as physical but the body size just isnt there and sometimes you overcompensate Didnt look like there was anything super malicious there but cant do that I think its a combination Youre absolutely right on the body size but also the quality depth Like right now for Louisville there is no drop off between their starters and those that have come off the bench None And McNeely is the leading scorer with nine but nine different scorers for this Cardinals team to make up 40 And we have pressure still bringing the trap Nice job South Carolina State handling Now you have to find some way to create some space Louisville has been suffocating so far Whats the best way to do that You got to have somebody create off the bounce or you want to set a ball screen If I were South Carolina State Im trying to set a ball screen with Khalifa being the hedge guy Bruce lines up a three Too much on it Offensive rebound keeps it alive for the Cardinals Uhoh Great rotation Brutes this time nothing but the bottom of the net Come on Jay Alter Unselfish play by the Cardinals Offensive rebound leads to a chain of events thats tough to guard and Cany Roots who continues to improve Hes got a chance Im telling you able to knock it down at the end of the possession And another turnover on the other end Thats the type of night it has been for Louisville Getting it done on both ends Look at this pass Hangs in the air Baseline drive Baseline drive Well it wasnt really a baseline drive It was more of a lane line drive but such a talented player Understanding where the defense is 43 and five here in the first half You understand his overall impact Weve been raving about it His potential to be a special player in a Cardinal uniform You see why here early Khalifa driving to the hoop Stripped Deep three in transition Way too much on it for Colin McKenzie Louisville continues this fast pace that a foul is called Louisville will get two from the line Week 11 ACC Network Saturday football lineup kicks off with SMU at Boston College and then its Syracuse at Miami The night cap Florida State at Clemson Terrific triple header here in November Overlap season is here to we got basketball tipping off Footballs down the stretch of their season And nobodys busier than Jay Alter Thats for sure Hey I want to go back and and talk about the challenge situation which is a new rule So they did challenge the offensive interference Louisville did They lose said challenge and this is new They lose the challenge Now they are relieved of the ability to make a second one and a timeout is c is charged to Louisville So this is a bit of a feel thing I think a lot of coaches are still trying to figure out how exactly to implement this in their game plan very different than in years past trying to move it forward and big thing you have to have a timeout in order to to call for a challenge So So that would be one reason to do it early right To make sure that you still have the timeout available but I agree as the season progresses coaches will definitely manage that challenge differently And youre trying to speed up play throughout the course of the game I theres nothing worse than sitting through a game and you know this as well as I do and it takes we have six or seven reviews for the officials who get the call right the first time 95 of the time anyway So I I I applaud the the officiating crews for being able to put that together Uh its going to make for a better product all around Man McNeely on the floor to rip it away gives it back to South Carolina State You have to love the hustle from the Virginia transfer Look at the bench for Louisville Pat Kelsey we we showed that the infomercial if you will about the revival The infomercial Thats culture Thats whats changed from before when he was there Oh the intensity You can feel it And its a fan base that loves that What fan base doesnt But this Louisville fan base particularly suffering through those two seasons that they did they so enjoy a team that they might not win every game but man they are going to give it everything theyve got and they have done that in this first half And nine different Cardinals have scored including all five starters but the defense continues to be the story with the turnovers up to 10 in the first half for South Carolina State And this has been quality basketball from the preseason number 11 team in the nation But think about if you told a Louisville fan during Pat Kelseys press conference when he got the job in just one season youre going to be number 11 in the country I I mean they have all the resources and ability They just needed to hire their third choice right laughter Thats what he said Well thats not me saying it Thats him saying it And then he had the great line right after saying thats okay I was my wifes third choice Uh hes known for a oneliner or two Oh unapologetically himself Oh no Thats the first mistake Ive seen Mike El Brown make Really took a rush three on the left 45 early But outside of that hes been pretty clean and how hes played When you talk to the scouts and the first thing they talk about is what a gifted passer he is but that one just got away from him And weve seen weve seen glimpses of that so far I was speaking with ESPNs national recruiting analyst Paul Biancardi earlier today and he said this is the best freshman class that he has covered in the last two decades And thats coming off of last years class with Cooper Flag Conan Nipple all these guys that have gone and made a giant impact in year one in the NBA This class is even better and its deeper Its a crazy thing And Brown is a big part of that So you think about it Brown was ranked number eight in the SC next top 100 players Number eight And hes going to be a lottery pick Its a debatable ranking Debatable I I I would have him slotted a little bit higher truth be told Probably in the top five but I I mean the ability to cover so much ground The first time I saw him play was with team load to North Carolina and he was only about 59 510 and he was still scoring Then all of a sudden he grows 56 in youve got a real problem on your hands because he has the size to finish the athleticism the quickness but hes also hes always been this small guard and now hes taken all those skills into a cheering 63 and a half 64 frame Its dangerous dangerous dangerous The ball skills are next level Weve seen glimpses of it in this first half Hard foul and Owen Bronson Jr just colliding with Javon Hadley Ran right into him 14 fouls in this first half against South Carolina State to go along with 10 turnovers Oh man uncomfortable And thats the thing you got to keep your head on a swivel when it comes to handling the ball against South Carolina State Theyll sneak back and try to get a steal and Hadley a little bit shocking the only Cardinal player to start all 35 games last season had that extra year of eligibility You has said he wants to finish what they started last year for all the teammates that didnt have the extra year of eligibility to continue what Pat Kelsey and this Louisville program have done and talking to Kelsey he said just makes everyone around him better He embodies the type of player that Kelsey wants at Louisville You know what hes great at too Jay And and this is something I might get a little wordy here verbose if you will like he makes the next right play as well as anybody And what I mean by that is he knows what spot to get to without having to coach some of these instincts into him Oh thats not a good move And he bailed out Might have been a foul But trying to split when guys are playing in tight its tough I will say though right hes been aggressive Five points gotten to the line You know when you play high pressure teams and high pressure situations got to have a guard that can break it down a little bit Hes been the one guy that has found some success Say all that theyre three for 21 from the field though First team in division 1 basketball to start a game 0 for12 since Houston Christian in 2020 And I think that says more about how Louisville came out defensively than it does about this Bulldogs offense But points have been at a premium for the road team tonight And this is going to be a Bulldogs team They have a lot of transfers too Like theyre going to get better as the season goes on Today physically just a little bit outmatched but they get into conference play you know theyve got to load up on these games to uh generate some funds for the program pay the bills Exactly Right So thats part of this Just you run into a buzzsaw with this Louisville team that has so many guys that make decisions Great press break leads to an open three Its good My Brown Jr Not bad He was the guy that broke the press Great passing and got the ball back Louisville continuing to run here Ruths Oh great screen UHOH BROWN A RACK ATTACK THE FIVESTAR MIKE BROWN JR cheering MY GOODNESS Mike Brown coming off a great screen from Zugish Just fantastic offensive basketball applause They are on their feet at the KFC Young Center Louisville basketball under three minutes remaining And you have seen liftoff from the highly touted freshman Mike Brown Jr If you dont know his name now now you do Man absolutely special Able to knock and hit my man on a flare screen Ball fake GET UP YOUNG FELLA GET UP Lums got 51 points since 1969 Tshirt if you want a tshirt on your feet and you Watch Gotcha Oh were looking forward to it Taylor Joel and Luke have you covered at the half So many teams starting their season tonight and and I think the story they just nailed it The freshman Caleb Wilson what he did in North music Carolina Mel Brown Jr has taken over the last few minutes here in Louisville You know what the crazy part is 5113 Theres not a single player for Louisville in double figures It has been basketball at its highest form Sharing it shooting it Unselfish play A beautiful ball movement and another slam dunk finish Up 40 Exhibit A The number 11 team in the country to start this season flexing their muscles here at home The defense on display That was Kobe Rodgers at 63 getting up for the block cheering What a defensive play Kobe Rogers coming over on the weak side This is a guy whos a big time player in division two Decides Im going to go play for Pat Kelsey Understands his role as a defender Red shirted last year to get healthy Hes going to be a quality piece for this team with so much quality depth We have not seen a drop off between the starters and those that have come off the bench tonight for Louisville Good defense there collapsing in the lane Louisville keeps it alive though This ball needs to get out Give me a high ball screen Let your freshman go to work right here Shot clock at five Great pass Skipped it right to Rogers who couldnt connect on the triple And I want to I I want to highlight something thats not going to go on the stat sheet Were going to take a look Look to the left part of your screen right here where Mike El Brown is Uh Zugurtis understands his role A blind screen This is not a play call This is a veteran player understanding his role and how to get his superstar open Hes played alongside some really good players in Greece Hes playing alongside a really good player and Mike El Brown Jr Thats something that he brings to the table thats not going to show up on the stat sheet But you know what It does affect that plus minus because his teams going to be better when hes on the floor doing those little things just like that Well this Louisville team in this first half of the first game of the season they already look like theyre in midseason form And its those little plays right that can separate a team winning a championship 100 Nice play A foul called on the putback attempt Pat Kelsey has to be thrilled What what do you say to how theyve started their season right Hey I you know you you have a quick shot on the left 45 You have a play where Kobe Rogers gets into the lane and probably could have pitched out and maybe one turnover that youre going to be upset with Outside of that like thats three very vague details Like theres not going to be a whole lot in this first half that theyre going to be able to go back for the to the film room and be like I wanted that better You could not have scripted it My goodness much better for Louisville And I think it was important to start real fast tonight because you have that incredible first season under Kelsey 27 and 8 18 and two in ACC play You go all the way to the conference championship game and you want to just keep the momentum going the feelgood factor that has come back to this program and thats exactly what theyve done so far in the opener McNeely Hes usually money from there Foul on the ensuing rebound A little embellishment there But McNeely I dont think hes shot what seven threes today There hasnt been a a difficult one of the bunch Theyre all catch and shoot Hes wide open His teammates are creating for him Like you do a game last season at Virginia hes coming off flare screens Hes having to get his feet right Hes having to turn his body Like he shot 42 doing that And while hes only three of seven right now which everybody will take those percentages dont be shocked if hes up in those mid40s just because the quality of looks that hes getting playing alongside Conwell and Woolly and all these guys is just different than what he had last season Goodness Rejection at the rim Fu says no And another foul a frustration foul there against Jaden Johnson the Mak preseason player of the year This first half has not gone to plan for him in this visiting Bulldogs team This is a historic first half Tio the last time Louisville led by 35 or more at halftime of a game 2014 Who was the coach then the great Rick Patino Thats it Hey he might he might be seeing Louisville in a final eight game Thats right Sander Fu though I mean comes from Bronswagen top level in Germany I mean he had good numbers there Averaged 12 points six rebounds several blocks I mean this is a seasoned guy classified as a junior But you saw it I mean hes picking shots out of the sky Contested three off the mark That is the first half it has been with Louisville dominant defensively pouring it on offensively 4 seconds left in the half Why not another three Isaac McNeely beats the buzzer and Louisville pours on 59 in the first half of this season Doesnt get much better than that Isaac McNeely with a cherry on top of what could be described as the b first half Louisville seen in some time My goodness that ball just continues to move Isaac McNeely feasting on corner threes This Louisville teams different J Alter 16 ACC teams opening their season tonight Louisvilles one of them Theyre up big Lets get you into the studio with Taylor Tannon Bombing Company All right ladies and gentlemen were down here on the court for our wild progressive show We have Dakota with us Hes going to have 30 seconds to make a layup a free throw a threepointer and a half court shot You do all that Dakota you go home the brand new car online How are you feeling about this game tonight Stoked Hes stoked Were stoked Lets try to get away Make sure no part of your body crosses the line during each shot Lets put the 30 seconds on the clock and you can go ahead and get in position for that first shot On the count of three lets get it 2 You have so many guys that can attack you in the open floor Uh just a nightmare to prepare for Thats what I was thinking If youre getting the the scout right youre Kentucky Youre playing eight days from now What a game thats going to be You cant just shut down one or two guys The quality depth coming off the bench Such balanced scoring Conwell leaves that short from three And then the defensive intensity Its one thing to just do it on the offensive end but theyre doing it on both sides of the ball in impressive fashion You have to keep the intensity up though and it looks like they are so far Nice look ahead GREAT PASS AND THE FINISH FROM HADLEY Mike Brown Jr Another assist Sandanda Fruit Terrific hit ahead pass and the pretty lefty pass from Mike Brown Jr Hes like a quarterback with that quick release Just being able to make that decision with such fluidity My goodness Heres the fivestar freshman again All eyes have been on number zero and he has delivered some jawdropping moments in his collegiate debut Hadley tried to squeeze it down to Fu on the block Knocked away Nice advanced pass An Sandanda Fu getting the ball off the rim pushing it himself And then look at this pass How quick and fluid and easy is the finish for Javon Hadley You talk about Javon Hadley I think one of the major benefits is now you have a guy in the starting spot that they can rely on Another easy look for McNeely FORGET ABOUT IT FORGET ABOUT IT McNeely making it look easy too His fifth triple in his Louisville debut Hey Isaac go over there and stand still Its all you got to do with so many shot creating guys man South Carolina State Eric Martins going to have a lot to talk about No this is not going to define Eric Martin season No not at all Not at all And you want to talk a guy about a guy whos done a fantastic job Had a really hard spot at South Carolina State but goes to the MAK championship last year Was a good player in his own right Played at Cincinnati Oh wow OH WOW MICHAEL BROWN JR carving up the Bulldogs And youre going to want another look at this please Knifing through the defense and rocking the rim What a freshman You might see this on Sports Center later tonight D my words Splitting music the defense How talented is this young man My goodness You better cut him off Front foot two hands doesnt matter Give me one more look please Jay Alter How talented is this guy Up up and away Louisville up big Here is the door How long do we have to talk about Keep going Come on Open up music All right Now with the season opener Louisville is a runaway train and Mike Cal music Brown Jr is the conductor 11 points six assists and we are getting a full display of the Mike El Brown Jr show I I mean so explosive so smooth and it almost sneaks up on you I dont think either one of us were expecting this kind of effort at the rim but just a special athlete I talked to his father Chris who was his coach in high school at DMA Academy at Daytona Beach This is a guy that his dad has raised him the right way Hes worried about the right things The only problem that Louisville coaching staff has with him is hes staying in the gym too much and theres a law of diminishing returns when it comes to working hard and they think hes approaching that He works incredibly hard Go when we got into the gym he was the only guy out here two hours before tip off Same could be said before shoot around today They show up to shoot around about 20 minutes beforehand and hes in a full sweat I mean getting after you know the crazy part is is its been such a well balanced effort We havent even talked about Ryan Conwell all that much and hes preseason first team all ACC and with a made free throw hes in double figures The depth is absurd and theres no such thing as an announcer jinx NC State Well not tonight dude Huh laughter You take a look at Conwell hes been very consistent You Indiana State 41 from three Xavier 41 from three And I think he will fit in very perfectly in the back court with Brown I think hes happy to let Brown take all the attention Hell do his thing quietly And youll see him at times when the competition goes up theyre going to go more you know two guard front Theyre going to have multiple ball handlers Conwell more than able to be that guy as nothing can go right for South Carolina State right now A testament to the Louisville defense Wow Brown finds McNeely Cant finish it from three Jump ball on the rebound Possession arrow with the Bulldogs You mentioned with Brown Jr the explosiveness on his way to the rim just his way up the court too You know I mean its like he slithers up and down the court and like I I dont want to Snake has a bad connotation but the way he moves through the defense and how he navigates through spots He just slithers around the court cuz he handles the ball so well But I mean just a different type of athlete that just covers so much ground You know what too is you you talk about a guy thats going to go in the top 10 you know more than likely Um the ability to create space and create shots for other players is at a paramount because you need ball handlers that can put pressure on the rim at the NBA level Hes going to be able to do that with consistency and hes only going to get bigger and stronger Thats a great point I mean at the next level the NBA isnt looking for a guy that can put up 30 a night Theyve got guys on their roster that can do that Its Can you do those other things Uhoh Hadley the steel and the finish applause You know back to Hadley having a guy whos been in the program two years hes a guy that If you have a young point guard Mike El Brown Jr you can throw it to him and take a deep breath Hes your settle down guy That left hand hook is not working today But they battle back for it and Florian Tene there to clean up the spill Uhoh Tennov Bay lost the handle that time So that was South Carolina States first made basket of this second half Just their fourth made field goal on the night Thats how good Louisville has been defensively swarming And if you get past one you got to see four other bodies quick fast in a hurry They rotate so well And the thing is if you cant get by that first one its like theyre running into a brick wall at times because the physicality that Louisvilles guards play with not just their bigs And every coach uses that word culture but I think youre seeing it with Pat Kelseys team They dont look at the scoreboard They dont play to the scoreboard They are playing hard every single possession on both sides of the ball You would never know this is a team thats up by 52 make it 54 plus the foul Canai Roose will be at the line for the and one when we come back Also a great story about family and basketball fans Please welcome your 20

basketball season is always special for Paul Knob senior and junior There they are the Knob family Theyve had season tickets to Louisville basketball since Freedom Hall opened in 1956 That was nearly 70 years ago The last 15 years obviously being here at the KFC Yv Center at Louisville basketball It is in their blood Paul Seniors uncle Johnny Knob He played point guard for the Cardinals team that won the national music championship in 1948 Responsible for that banner right there And get this Paul Senior is celebrating his 82nd birthday tonight with the season opener And he had him a beverage too music So good on him Hey Im so happy you do this Jay Like this is what makes college athletics great Its the relationships Its the the ability to go to game with Pops Like awesome Awesome stuff And talking with Paul Jr earlier today he said his two boys Carson and Trenton they are ready to carry the torch Already obsessed with Louisville basketball Theyre looking forward to hitting the 100redyear mark of those season tickets being in the Knop family And what an opener that the Knob family and all Louisville fans have enjoyed here so far at the KFC Yum Center The scoreboard is not broken It is 727 and they are relentless as ever on the defensive end What has impressed you most about the performance tonight Tio That they have 72 points and we just got done with the under 16 Like were theyre on pace right now I I Im not great at math but this looks like a 130 ball game I just an incredible overall performance by this team and how Pat Kelsey has promoted his culture with the revival And I said at the beginning of the game consider it revived Oh absolutely I mean my goodness is this team talented Did they play with physicality Woolly a little too physical yet still 14 Woolly Thats his third team Whats incredible about what Pat Kelsey did a year ago 19 win improvement biggest in all of college basketball is they go 27 and 8 make it to the ACC championship and yet theyre going to do even better this season Yeah theyre even better And thats the mark of a program that has something to sell I I mean hey look theres a lot of factors why kids choose certain schools and Im not going to get into all of them but I am going to say that you know Louisville has a fan base that is thirsty not just for the bourbon that comes out of this fine city but for success at a high level or baseball bats or whatever it may be here in Louisville Im more of a ponies guy Arent you Yeah But this is a fan base that is hungry to win It Its a city that loves hoop and jerseys that are red and black are selling out around this town And that has to be a huge reason this brand that is Louisville has some serious serious cache at this point WOW OH HE BLOCKED THAT WITH two hands Can I Roots doesnt like jump shots He takes them cheering Are you kidding me Dominant performance Look at this Were going to take another look at it Try to get cute and spin around my guy No sir not here Not a little Tikes hoop folks Thats 10 ft And he just ate that shot Ruth has been very impressive tonight Absolutely he has Hes taken that step forward from freshman to sophomore year like Louisville was hoping for Hes got a chance I mean hes put on good weight You can see across his shoulders I I mean hes physically matured I think this is a guy the only reason hes not starting is cuz hes got a guy in front of him named Javon Hadley who is Mr dependable reliable He understands everything as far as rotations are concerned And Roots is still developing in that matter Sure But Pat Kelsey raved about his longterm potential It might not be all that long term though You know whats scary is Louisville still has to add Jason Prior to the mix Priors cleared medically but still working his way back to game action And youre going to be able to go 11 deep with no drop off in quality Hard foul off the ball Heres Prior B number 32 Hey thats a talented young man too 610 611 Came from South Florida Wellveraveled ACL injury in the Bahamas last year I mean they were really high on that young man Previous play is under review They were really high on that young man prior to the injury Theyre going to review for a flagrant foul here This was off the ball Yes Kobe Rogers basically got lifted off of his feet And if youre South Carolina State I understand that youre frustrated My goodness I mean theres not much you can do Were going to take a couple looks at it right here Look off the ball Kobe Rogers just going through Might have been a little embellishment I dont see anything thats more than just normal basketball but look at this acting job laughter Well he felt the contact I mean its not like there was no contact but I dont think its a flake I dont think that reaction The call on the floor is confirmed Common foul out of bounds White Thats the right call Call is upheld Confirmed Basketballs a physical game but there was a theres some showmanship happening right there And going back to Kobe Rogers who you know this is a guy who went undefeated in division 2 in Nova Southeastern They play a crazy style of basketball down there and he was terrific for them Transfers to College of Charleston or excuse me not College of Charleston now just known as Charleston Plays for Pat Kelsey red shirts last year and follows Pat Kelsey up to Louisville And he is a highlevel defensive player and backup point guard music And look you bring in all these different bodies across up and down this Louisville lineup You have to have guys that are music willing to buy into your role And Roots has a little blood theyre fixing but you have to have guys that are willing to buy into their role Rogers the consmate teammate They rave about his personality and this is a guy whos completely bought into the overall success of the program not just you know individual And you have to have some of those guys that carries over that culture that are willing to buy into those things and it bleeds into the other guys that are transferring in or freshman that have high expectations Those things rub off in a positive way Man 32 is just running into everybody Another hard foul off the ball That one raming into McNeely Now you have me curious A moment ago you said Kobe Rogers played in a crazy system at the D2 level over South Eastern What what made it so chaotic Its way its wide open And of course the division 2 level the players are smaller the floor is bigger so to speak but they advance the ball quickly Try to play in the first 5 to 6 seconds of the clock Find shots quickly And defensively a lot of traps a lot of trying to speed the game up Theyre basically rigging the game to their liking And if you havent watched them Eric Spolstra has gone down and worked at Nova South Eastern to try to figure out what they do and why theyre successful at their level Like theres a lot of guys that admire the way they play and Kobe Rogers a beneficiary of just knowing how hard they have to play it WATCH OUT ROOTS HAMMERS IT HOME KENNY ROOTS Another dunk to add to the highlight reel This is Louisvilles night in the opener To put a stamp on everything the offensive efficiency and how theyre able to acquire shots Its just different than what you see normally Well South Carolina State theyve upped the physicality in this second half And Louisville has responded It has given them energy despite the lopsided score They are still in attack mode but Isaac McNeely hits some shots puts it on the deck easy reverse layup He Ive never seen him more comfortable You know Virginia hes coming off stagger screens off the baseline having to really work for shots and hes going to have to do more of that as the season goes along as the competition goes up But that all being said his job has never been easier cheering Another wide open look at time a misfire Thats his first 13 How about Kai Roots The athleticism Get him over in the corner Cross over Get downhill Yes sir Forget about it Can Ruth got has a chance He has a chance And I keep going back and saying it Hes got legit size for a wing shoots a decent ball from deep Talk about big versatile switchable players They are craved He fits that billing Tough Well theyve been contested jumpers all night long and that one finally goes for South Carolina State Only six made baskets all night and two of them have come in the last minute We were saying at halftime to this is a South Carolina State team that could very well end up in the NCAA tournament if they win the MAK which theyre very much in the mix to do Went to the championship game a year ago preseason number three And you know if they made the NCAA tournament theyd likely be a 16 seed Louisville Theyre playing like the one seed right now against Eric Martins team up big 7621 As we step aside officially licensed Adidas jersey and number are on sale now This is shall go 3 kick round Ducky Look at 2 Well we have a special freshman here at Louisville Kentucky and he has lived up to the billing Mike El Brown Jr a little inside he shows his athleticism A little outside shows the threepoint stroke He has been so good with the ball in his hands attacking the rim using his eyes to manipulate the defense Oh and I need one more dunk for good measure Mr Alter My goodness what a finish Uh top 10 freshman in his class I think hes better than number eight or whatever Hes ranked This guy is special Those are all great highlights Thats not even talking about what he does Passing the basketball getting into the lane putting pressure on the defense Mike Brown Jr is a problem And buddy is he fun to watch on TV Its even better in person Well hes going to have the headlines but this has been a very balanced team performance but no doubt about it Mel Brown Jr everyone had their eyes on number zero for his collegiate debut And he has showed out Its legal Heads up play by Ryan Conwell to keep that alive Great ball movement That was poetry in motion Everything but the finish I dont think he caught it cleanly there You know every pass is difficult WOW Oh my goodness Tough take and a hard foul And a hard fall Florian Tene hit the court Came down very hard I think he needs to hang out down there for a second Thats a tough fall Thats his second 14 applause Tenn from Martinique France Transferred from Central Georgia Tech You see him trying to use his body Hadley is just a wall And Tenebay just lost his balance going up Hes walk this one off That one looked painful So Tennay doing well to try and walk this off after just a hard fall after the main bucket and the foul So now Tene has to come out of the basketball game because the medical personnel came out on the floor Louisville gets to pick the foul shooter And they go with Noah Treadwell Treadwell the true freshman Yep From Middle Georgia Prep You know one thing Eric Martin Bulldogs head coach told me earlier was he really likes his true freshman Treadwell and Hodgej So they backed off Treadwell and put Hodge down there Well those are the two true freshman And Haj misses He he said you know one thing with the portal is these top programs arent going after as many freshmen as they once did Certainly in that second tier and he feels like they were able to capitalize with Haj and Treadwell as Zugarus answers on the other end with an and one opportunity of his own Just another smart play Zugrus sets a flare screen understands his guy jumps out to switch flashes to the bucket and uses those shoulders What did you say in the first half Chiseled of stone Chiseled out of stone I tell my children that I had shoulders like that once upon a time Im lying to my children which wouldnt recommend I mean Zubris looks like he could play tight end tomorrow Yeah big dude Not that Louisville football needs the help The Cardinals having a terrific season on the grid iron Both the football and basketball teams ranked right now in November as well as the womens program who tips their season off with Yukon tomorrow entire athletic department on fire Yeah really looking forward to continuing this opening week at College Hoops Marquee matchups all over the place and then 8 days from now Louisville and Kentucky That is going to be a spectacular spectacle as Fu slams another down Not for nothing here Interesting lineup Hadley at the three You have Zugris and Fu innov at the 45 So youre going super big This is a lineup that Louisville might use a little bit later in the season as things get a little bit more physical through that really tough nonconference schedule that Louisville has And with that bigger lineup you take a ball handler off the court And Pat Kelseys team this is really the first time all night theyve struggled with this fullcourt pressure Albeit South Carolina State they havent had many opportunities to set it up because you can set it up after a make Conwell flying for two Conwell Conwell makes it look easy doesnt he and he hasnt had to use it today but one of the tendencies for him both at Indiana State and at Xavier last season he puts his shoulder on the defender and is able to create and carve out so much space cuz physically just so strong up ahead Hadley cheering Easy throw down Defense to offense that has been the recipe for Louisville in this opener You know this is the first game that counts But you know Louisville played two tough exhibitions one against Bucknell one against Kansas And you have to feel like playing those D1 opponents particularly a top team in Kansas has helped this team be ready out of the gate Man they were loaded for bear today and the notable early games You look at that slate Kentucky at Cincinnati at Arkansas Memphis and at Tennessee Those five games are going to be so critical not just for Louisville and Pat Kelsey but the ACC as a whole Well I mean you look up and down there at Kentucky I mean Otga Ways back Cincinnati West Miller brought some talent in Uh December 3rds going to be interesting Darius Akuff is another freshman point guard That matchup right there is going to be really intriguing Ak more of a scoring guard the kind of guy that thrives under John Calipari Hows it going to be seeing those two freshman square off I think Arkansas is going to be really good too But Louisville if theres 10 teams better in college basketball you got to show them to me because I dont think so Wave off the basket for a moving screen You know for the Louisville fans it still are upset that they were grossly underseded in the NCAA tournament which they were Those are the five games in nonconference play music that can get your seating higher All right card fans I want everybody to get on your feet Were going to do a little ch here Everybody on this side over here is Alison What do you GOT OVER THERE WE GOT cars inside Kick us off All right here we go One two three Car cheering cheering cheering You know what to do Heat Heat Heat Heat Opening night into the 2526 season music here in Louisville This is something you just dont see all that often For Louisville weve said not a big drop off between the starters and the bench South Carolina State the bench is all they got right now The starters are combined 0 for 14 shooting In the last 30 seasons there have only been two instances of a division one team getting no points from its starting lineup I I have no words Yeah heres the thing You think they were loaded for bear ready to play They wanted a game that counted 58 to zero And heres the thing If youre coach Eric Martin what do you take from this game The check from Louisville and you go home Yeah Like thats like you I dont think you bring any of this tomorrow I mean you burn the tape Hey look I was a division 2 assistant coach for like half a season Then things happened I couldnt be there anymore We played Belmont Hold on No no no no Theres theres other things Okay Yeah it just it just didnt work I had to take care There were some family things that that occurred but we played Belmont and got our breaks beaten off and it was like oh my goodness It was just unbelievable You dont take anything from those games You shake them off you get ready for the next one South Carolina States going to have a lot to play for in their league I I think you just burn the tape on this one And Pat Kelsey might be thinking you burn the tape too right You dont want to inflate these guys knowing that you have that challenging schedule ahead You just turn the page and say produce it again And that was Pat Kelseys final message to this team is every possession has to be the most important possession of the season And they have played with that mentality since tip off with no let off Well theyve got one more game coming up against Jackson State which will be better than South Carolina State And then they have Kentucky after that So this Thursday on the 6 Jackson State then Kentucky the following Tuesday You know litmus test early in the season so incredibly important not just for Louisville but before the league and weve talked about it before well talk about it again several times but your cake is baked as a conference by January so you need to be able to win these games in the nonconference Louisville giving themsself the ability to do that by loading up that schedule cuz theres a theres 10 seconds yeah theres your film 61point game Even Pat Kelsece is not letting his team have it for that turnover You know for me Tio I do agree with you with your conference How the conference is going to be viewed is baked in by January Well you have your seeds basically as a conference locked in by January So you know last year the ACC did not do great in November and December In my opinion thats a tough move in my opinion There were a lot of teams in the ACC that could have seen some success in the postseason but not given that opportunity Great play by the freshman on both ends Derwin Hodge Jr I just think across the board the league will be better I also dont think its been as down as people think it has the last few years but I do Well the proofs in the And hey look I Im with you on that right Like I think the ACC was better than it was given credit for last year That all being said the way its selected for the NCAA tournament those are the rules Everybodys playing by the same set of rules And I really its not just Louisville that needs to play well in the nonconference Its the perceived and Im going to emphasize perceived bottom of the league that has to take care of business as well against some of the lower conference opponents that theyre going to play in the nonconference That has to be taken care of But you got that ACC SEC headtohead challenge the first week of December Thats really what let the ACC down If you look at the metrics that was it right Just a couple of bad days and then became a narrative for the entire season So youve got to excel in that challenge this season 100 So many teams tipped off play 16 ACC teams in action And the nothing but neck crew as soon as we go final well take you around the nation and tell you how the ACC fared opening night You know we flashed up the top 25 You Duke Louisville and North Carolina Im with you I I think its the the middle of the ACC that is so improved with NC State quick turnaround I think youre going to see Miami be very impressive Hey huge on Miami and what Jay Lucas has put together Uh all those transfers coming back home really You you look at Trey Donaldson originally from uh Florida Uh Malik Renu from Florida Ernest Duday Jr comes from uh TCU Was it Kansas before that like big and overwhelming wins I mean you look at this game tonight the the collective size of this Louisville team like Miami is going to be able to do that to some teams and they have a freshman named Shelton Henderson We talk about freshman being the reoccurring theme of this season They have those guys too And it comes to a point to where like especially in the postseason are you physical enough to win some of these tournament games And Miami is going to be able to Good ball movement again through everything but the finish there So a 57point lead 518 remaining Lets take a look at the first year coaches cuz I think youre going to see not quite to the extent of a Pat Kelsey what he did in Louisville but instant impacts with Ryan ODM Will Wade and Jay Lucas in particular I I think what were they calling it Luke Hancock talks Luke Hancock was talking about Will Wade and what all they were doing up there and were going to have another open situation here ONEHANDED JAM The reckoning at NC State And heres the deal too like they have talent So you you ask yourself like who could be this years Louisville NC State Thats who could be this years Louisville Yes I thought Will Wade was absolutely phenomenal at ACC media day Of course he was man Will Wade was on staff at Clemson when I was being recruited and the guy can charm Like he is accessible Hes smart and perfect fit for NC State The toughness factor of what all theyre capable of being We have a timeout on the floor Time out South Carolina State South Carolina State usually the timeout I I think look again lopsided scoreboard But I think if youre Eric Martin you go lets final 440 Lets come out of here with something Well just try to run some offense And the problem every time theyve tried to run a baseline out of bounds or some sort of set Louisvilles been so music physical with them Its been hard to stay in their actions In this second half a little bit better 17 points in the second half 15 in the first But hey look a lot of these things youre at South Carolina State you have to play music some of these power four teams And why is that Well you need funds for the program So youre going to take some lumps to be able to build up into music what youre going to be during conference play This is a great way for these programs to make money for the rest of the season No doubt And then look their season comes down to the MAK tournament 100 Its a one bid league It always it always has been at least music in recent memory And you know this is a team thats going to be able to force turnovers They have sized especially on the back side of that press relative to the rest of their league and the little things creating extra possessions with offensive rebounds getting out in the passing lanes causing turnovers Theyre going to be able to do those things in their conference just havent been able to do it here Will shoot one Well if you want to talk about a team that has forced turnovers tonight its been Louisville They have forced 22 turnovers which has led to 33 points off those turnovers The intensity from tip off got up 242 and just kept that foot firmly planted on the gas which is easier said than done Every coach preaches it right but Louisville has executed IT TONIGHT WHAT AND THE THREE PLUS the foul A fourpoint play potentially for Fu How about through Were going to take a look at this Just very businesslike No celebration Of course Im near 7 ft and going to knock down threes How impressive has he been Look no reaction calm composed Next play looks like a guy whos been playing pro ball in Germany for four seasons Yep replacing him When youve been playing with 30 year olds for the past four years the reactions are a little different Hes impressive though Yeah And its the perfect blend of his roster construction for Pat Kelsey Youve got your internationals then youve got your freshman then you got your transfers And hes blended all three of those categories so brilliantly And he told us I really really like our team And and boy after watching this performance I agree with him You know what You you failed to mention probably the most important piece of this and thats the returners Javon Hadley Kobe Rogers Kenny Roots those guys that are carrying over that culture and and and a lot of times too like the coaches can talk and talk and talk about something When it gets back to the locker room thats when your culture really needs to set in And you talk about those three guys right there Yeah it was Hadley who saw game action last year And people forget that Khalifa Rogers and Prior they were part of that culture even though they didnt impact it on the floor I agree with you You do have that sense of hey we were part of something special a year ago and were going to take another step this season and Kenny Roots another one who is one of the returners for the Cardinals But I I just feel like for the newcomers the fresh faces if you will Pat Kelsey has pushed all the right buttons in this roster construction cheering I love a foul down 50 Why 60 60 excuse me laughter I Im with you You said it about 20 minutes ago If youre South Carolina State and theres been way too many frustration fouls in this game you just got to take the check and run Theyre up to 24 fouls committed in this game Well thats good Jake cuz I like sitting here and talking to you Hey Kobe Rogers welcome back Guy sat out last year You just saw the graphic Miss time

the basketball court and then back in for four field hockey games tomorrow Good look for Rogers and another foul called You know the second half the physicality been evident from South Carolina State And I think its just given Louisville an extra effort despite the lopsided score because South Carolina State keeps getting after him You know they havent throttled down here Well I think I think Zugus I think he just made that way Uhoh applause Bring the people to their feet Cole Sherman checks in Isaac and Sherman is the Louisville native in his senior season Has it here Everyone left in the arena wants Sherman to go up with it You know that ROOTS HOW ABOUT ANOTHER HIGHLIGHT Real slam Canny Roots has put on a show He and Mal Brown Jr might have enough highlights for the season just in the opener No question Athleticism on full display Living at the rim today South Carolina State does not like to possess the basketball at this point Its a nice pass though Back door cut Sherman That would have been for 101 They give it right BACK TO HIM CARRIES IT THIS TIME GIVE IT TO THE SHERMANATOR ARE YOU KIDDING ME The walkon puts Louisville over a hundred in the season opener cheering applause Get him another one So youre always looking for a note on the walkon right Whos got it here Cole Sherman Ive been handed a note that says according to his bio he hates cereal laughter but he loves making threes They got to give my man more love Big serve LEFT screaming 45 POINT AT THE BENCH And listen to the crowd thats still here THEY LOVE MY MAN AND ALI Khalifa happy as a clam Oh man thats not what we want to see Yeah hard foul under two minutes remaining in this one Two more walkons have joined the party here Spencer Le who actually followed Pat Kelsey from Charleston to Louisville Played two seasons for Kelsey at Charleston Yep And then Will Hanky who wears number 33 because of Louisville great Jordan Wara wore that number Man he was a tough cover You never had to cover him No Well I was on I was on the staff at Clemson whenever he was here and Chris Mack was the head coach He was just so versatile as a fourman who could really shoot the basketball And now Max at Charleston Yeah they traded head up Coach Schwab there Uh Hanky by the way another Louisville native and his freshman season cheering So you got to give Hanky some a shot here because that would be his first collegiate points And this is what you get in the final two minutes when youre a Louisville team that had the intensity from the opening tip separated early kept their foot firmly planted on the gas Sherman is not happy that his foot was on the line trying to get a leg a shot Hey Kobe the the responsibility held by Kobe Rogers at this point of the game could crumble a man He is responsible for getting these guys shots The guys that work harder than anybody throughout the course of practice The guys that are on scout team Kobes got to get these guys looks man Its on him I have a feeling that this is not going to be their only game action of the season Theres going to be several games like this And theyre coming My goodness what a performance Well this time last year this would be Patrick Anteneelli time our our colleague and dear friend Debbie Antonellis son who whos now excuse me whos now full scholarship Francis Marion in the state of South Carolina their starting point guard and could be an allconerence player in their league cheering shout out to Debbie well shout out to Patrick well Patrick too cheering but Debbie such pioneer in this industry thats for sure one of the alltime great one of the alltime greats So if youre Pat Kelsey you go into practice tomorrow What do you say to these guys Dont get fat and happy because it gets tricky real soon Like like you have a game coming up Thursday against Jackson State Clean up a couple of things and then its going to get a little difficult All eyes on Kentucky and what will be a statement game early in this season for both programs Both programs thinking championship expectations this season Time to let this sleeping dog lie Leg A good look Would have been the second walkon to knock down a triple in this one Louisville needed a little leg right there Just a little long applause You rarely see a walkon follow their head coach in a in a transition right Like two years at Charleston coming over with Kelsey to Louisville Culture guys I mean it it obviously matters so much And you look up and down you know not just the walkons but the staff that he has like Pat Kelsey big on loyalty you come and play for him Hes going to do what he can to keep you around Rogers adds three more Make it 104 the season opener for Louisville No drop off in ball movement when the walkons come in either Baseline drive drift Extra pass by Sherm who gets an assist My mans filling up the stat sheet And Miles answers This is the best possession of the night for South Carolina State in a game dominated by Louisville They look every bit as good as that number 11 suggests preseason And I think its low Im going to be honest with you Jay This is a top 10 team in college basketball They proved it today The
