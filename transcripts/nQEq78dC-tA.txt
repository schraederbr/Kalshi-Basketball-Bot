Traveling green for the Vikings The home whites for the Cardinal Stanford 21 wins under Kyle Smith last season And Stanford also dominant here at home They went 17 and three at Maples including nine and one through the ACC Here on their home floor as AJ Roi wins the opening tip and Stanford controls Starting five for Kyle Smith and the Cardinal as AJ Roi in there a transfer who began his college career playing for Kyle Smith at Washington State Down low there is Rahosi Hes denied by Travon Minot the Big Sky defensive player of the year last year But the Cardinal recover and it is Ibuka Okori with the game in the seasons first points Well its big play because Stanford was rejected on the very first play Stayed with it scored end of the shot clock He is a supremely talented freshman Kyle Smith already a couple of weeks ago named him as the starting point guard for this team even though he had not played a minute of college basketball Shot clock rolling down and a three up and in from Keon Kenzie Jr Well they can shoot threes Stanfords going to have to get out to the threepoint line Stanfords pretty good defensive team this year but you got to cover out on the threepoint line Down low to AJ Rahosi up and under and the rebound grabbed by Keon Kenzie Jr for the Vikings Solid year last year for Portland State They made it to the Big Sky quarters where they lost to Idaho as Idaho had a good win against Kyle Smiths former team Washington State on opening night in college basketball last night as a foul called against Stanford and its on Ibuka Okorei Heres the foul You can see the contact and he knew it Okari knew it right away He Thats kind of a no no You got to let him go a little bit He tried to back out of the Yeah too late Spearman our lead referee in this ACC crew with Jeff Pawn and Adam Floor working this game Terry Miller Jr Shot clock down to 10 for the Vikings cheering Splitting a double team down the lane The scoop is off from Jaylen Henderson for the offensive rebound Terry Miller Jr for a put back and official stop play to maybe check the shot clock if it had expired before Miller on the putback It might have expired Heres one more look at it That is Jamal Spearman on the right with Jeff Pawn on the left Theres an air ball but it was a takeaway after the exchange of possessions So theyre going to go back Okbara had the rebound and got it taken out of his hand So well see what the referees determine on this play It appeared there was still one on the shot clock when the shot went up but it didnt draw anything Theres a shot Didnt hit iron Potential timing issue Checking on it Doesnt hit potential timing issue is what Jamal Spearman alerts us to And my only thing is that I can think of Ben in this situation is look there was still time on the shot clock but did they stop the shot clock in the process of that possession that maybe would have been a shot clock violation Well there was no call to determine that So theyre going to have to go back as the officials are now at the monitor So theyre at the monitor checking to make sure the clock was correct Were just over two minutes in at in Maples and an early 52 lead for Portland State Should the basket for Terry Miller Jr count But this is a very tough opening game for Stanford because you have a team thats a veteran group and on top of it Ben they are expected to compete for the championship in the Big Sky Its no Montana who was picked as the preseason favorite and the Grizz will be here on Saturday to take on Stanford but Portland State is right there with them No this is a talented league and if theyre one of the top teams in this league I mean just last night you know former Bear former player of mine Alex Privile went out on the road at Washington State knocks off Washington State So thats a huge win for Idaho But thats the nature of this league Roxy Its gotten better Big Sky has improved every year And this Portland State team is is no stranger to success Theyve been knocking on the door every year So uh Stanford does have their hands full This theyre going to pressure theyre going to play hard and theyre a confident group And Jace Coburn the head coach of the Vikings in his fifth season at Portland State and take one more look at that last sequence And theyre trying to determine the clock issue We have a timing issue It should be 1804 on the on the game clock Baskets no good So basket is no good which means the shot clock would have expired So the shot clock expired and thats why the basket gets waved off And the timing issue gave Portland State too much time Yeah Move But when it doesnt hit iron that thats that was key Break for Stanford by the way because that ball was taken away So its a 32 game and youve seen this I understand the fr frustration from Jayce Coburn because his team is just playing the shot clock but its happened a number of times And if its a shot clock issue where it should have expired then they go back to where the the game should have been and thats why the basket got waved out Ryan Agarwal missing a three And heres Portland State with the ball Gambling for a steal was Agarwal cheering Terry Miller Jr hits a three Just a 27 threepoint shooter last year And Miller puts Portland State up four Well he may be 27 but he shot that with confidence Its last touch by Agarwal but a foul on Portland State And a hold is whistled inside against the Vikings Yeah you can see Jerry Miller I mean he steps out and its a late challenge by Agarwal so he puts it down and and when youre a confident player Roxy you got to take that shot and and he shot it extreme confidence Here is Chismak Par Harvard transfer powering his way inside could not finish And the rebound pulled out by Travon Mayot who was a sixth year senior who spent three years at South Carolina and now his third year at Portland State Path to the lane Jaylen Henderson lays it in and Kyle Smith wants to talk things over Not happy with the start from his team Well hes also having a word with the official maybe on a moving screen cheering Interesting 82 Portland State the 82 just over three minutes in You can see the frustration as Kyle Smiths face has actually turned Cardinal I think Yeah it has But hes I think hes disappointed because this is the second game in a row now Theyve gotten off to a poor start happening as Oregon as well They recovered against the Ducks from that poor start Trailing by double digits early as I Okori hits a three and the freshman is all five Well theyre fortunate that young man is is showing up because hes hes playing with confidence as well He had 17 against Oregon and now an offensive foul whistled against Portland State and the illegal screen is on Travon Minot Well heres a drive and the kick Thats a good job by Abara Gets to the rim gets help and he kicks Good spot up in the corner You know I think Stanford just got to get their their their theirelves as they did last game Roxy They just got settled defensively but theyre not guarding the way they did you know uh the other night against Oregon Theyve got to play that same level of defense against this Portland State team Buuka Okari the quick penetration and Chisumakara fouled and one counted for Akara Thank again Buuko Cororey getting to the basket because he made that play happen Watch the drive the help and the drop off to a very strong Hara at the rim Thats a great play Foul is on the freshman from Gresham Oregon Braden Baron and the and one free throw for Chisum Akara And Stanford has tied the game Youre playing with Ibuka Cory You got to move without the ball Hell hell find you Hes Hes really good with the basketball Heres Terry Miller Jr out of the double team Shot clock down to 10 for the Vikings Keon Kenzie Jr way off on the three Here comes Ibuka Okori in transition mismatch Benny Geler watched by the 610 May not that means somebody else has a big mismatch inside And a trip and thats the second foul on Travon May and thats costly for Portland State He was the Big Sky defensive player of the year last year Game knoded at eight Ben Braun and our ACC Network crew Roxy Bernstein with you and the consistency for Kyle Smith Ben a lot of returning players from a year ago As a coach how much easier especially going into year two is it for Kyle Smith with so many key guys back Well you want to have veterans Roxy when you can step in if you put veterans in your lineup it makes it easier because theyre there also to help their younger players So incoming players young players freshman transfers those those veterans really have been on the farm as they say and they can help their players adjust So its huge for Cal Smith and his staff Now of course Maxim Reno is off with the Sacramento Kings in the NBA right now And then Josiah Celler is elected to hit the transfer portal is at St Johns And Jaylen Blakes after his grad transfer he was sensational for Stanford last year But nine scholarship players back and then you add a transfer like Jeremy Den Smith whos on the floor right now Hiden Cam just does no he doesnt beat the shot clock and thats a Stanford turnover Thats good possession for Portland State I thought their defense was very good They stayed on the floor stayed disciplined and gave Stanford some fits Key contributors like Benny Geler back Chismak par Ryan Agarwal as a steal here is the freshman Ibuka Okorei to the basket and count it Theyre calling goalending on Portland State and a foul which means an and one free throw for Ibuka Okorei Well I I agree with the foul Not sure about the goalend that might have been on the way up in my opinion Um but I definitely you can see the foul now as the shot goes up Does he get it on the way up I guess he got at the top Thats close but no argument And this year one of the new rules in college basketball before if you wanted to ask the officials had a goalending call or a basket interference call been made on the floor it can be reviewed Now it still can be reviewed but it has to be a coachs challenge You like the NBA rule you get one challenge per game You must have a timeout to be able to challenge And if youre successful on your challenge you get another one Roxy you better have a good video guy on your bench I can tell you that One challenge to review You look to your video guy You look to your assistant say What do you think And they got to give you some on the spot advice So you got to be uh you know be careful about your challenges Cory now with eight of Stanfords 11 and a foul is called and the basket counts for Portland State Ive been impressed with Portland States ability to get to the basket and they turn the corner and they just put their head down and they go and theyre a very aggressive team Youve got to stop them at their point of attack get them early I thought Stanford did a much really in my opinion a much better job against Oregon early on the ball screens and and the dribble weaves and the handoffs Youve got to get that ball stopped and I know Kyle Smith will talk about that with his team And one free throw miss by Jaylen Henderson Onepoint lead for the Cardinal cheering Jeremy Den Smith a division 2 allAmerican last year at Cal State Dominguez Hills Theyre pressuring way out on the floor Step back Aara and a tough three and the rebound batted free by Cameron Grant Stanford gets another chance and a block is called on Terry Miller Jr Well very fortunate to get that ball back on an offensive rebound Roxy because Portland States pressuring Theyve got Stanford all the way out towards the 10second line and had to settle for an outside shot But great hustle by Chisum Mcbara to get the loose ball and then draw a foul Stanfords got some size advantage inside Theyre going to have to use that They tried earlier on their first two possessions to go inside and theyre going to have to go back there I think thats where they can really gain an advantage First foul on Miller Thats now six on Portland State Thats a lot And so you can get the bonus awfully early Stanford last year set a school record for free throw percentage 789 leading the ACC Its a big plus for them last year Thats a staple for Kyle Smith and his teams through the years They can get to the line Buuka Okori darts down the lane and he has 10 already Yeah they hes just been a oneman wrecking crew for Stanford My goodness is he attacked the rack He is so quick Last years New Hampshire Gatorade player of the year the fourstar recruit for the Cardinal First true freshman point guard to start an opening game since Tyrell Terry and just the second in Stanford history Well Roxy thats a good possession for Stanford Thats how theyve been playing And when they play defense at that rate theyre going to get some extra possessions This is a good defensive team that Stanford is going up against as they were the best defensive team Portland State in the Big Sky last year Yeah they were tough They were very stingy Aaron pass Chismakp parr racing up the floor and he glides in and the layup Well hes added that to his game Roxy Defensively hes been all around the ball Hes made steals did it in his opener Hes doing it here again 10 for Okorei five for Apar They have all 15 and Stanford has their largest lead on the drive and the finish Jaylen Henderson My goodness He stepped up on the elevator ride Roxy and he jammed it down over the top Nobody up in the Ozone up there Transfer from Louisiana Tech Explosive and a three from Jeremy Dent Smith Well thats how you thats how you answer a big play You come down and just knock down a three like nothing happened These teams are really going in No something happened We saw it laughter It was that was that was special I dont know if the production people at Sports Center are taking notice but that could be has seen top 10 dunk from Jaylen Henderson cheering Seven on the shot clock out of bounds to the Vikings Well both both teams can attack the basket So when you catch youre going to have to really get there Lets take another look at this one again Oh I I mean I saw it and I still dont believe it Heres the Heres the takeoff And thats just I mean all the way over the top with with connection to the ball Nobody was stopping that It was so nice we had to see it twice Shot clock rolling down I dont think Portland State realized it And Kelsey Fipps driving but a shot clock violation and it goes to Stanford Youre right Roxy Shot clock awareness Thats your your guard your point guard You know it cant come from the bench or the coaches Theyre all the way at the other end of the floor They they theyve got to talk to each other and know that somebodys got to remind their teammates hey short clock Lets get it up Nice drop off from Dent Smith AJ Roi cant get the roll underneath and its ripped down by Kelsey Fipps Here comes Portland State Henderson Jaylen Henderson launching a three and the long rebound falls to Aiden Camman for the Cardinal Roi and a foul will get AJ Roce to the line for Stanford 1812 the Cardinal are up and 10 points for the freshman Ibuki leading the way early for Kyle Smith leading the way for the Cardinal in their season opener And Roxy he can shoot it So hes a threat So makes you hard to guard but he plays with a tremendous change of pace I mean he has different gears He plays fast to slow and then slow to fast He explodes the basket and gets there on time Really hard to guard Four of five from the floor for Okori and a Stanford sixpoint lead and the Cardinal with AJ Rosi at the line Josie last year a second team division three allAmerican at Claremont Mud College and one more for Roi was from the North base from Sanelmo walked on for Kyle Smith in Washington State was there for two years then dropped down to the division three level now has rejoined Kyle Smith here at Stanford for his last year Well thats quite a journey Shot blocked and then stripped Jeremy Dent Smith with a quick hands took it away from Travon May not Deep three from Deb Smith and the rebound tipped out to Travon May not Here comes Portland State Jaylen Henderson in transition and a foul will get him to the line Number 25 First on Den Smith Jace Coburn the head coach of Portland State in his fifth year 13th overall at Portland State He was an assistant worked at the junior college level where one of his mentors Mark Adams the former coach at Texas Tech whos now at Old Miss was the guy he gave his break at the collegiate level Well and he told me today Hey coach I remember you at Arizona State Got a start there Uh just many years back used to go and attend games but hes really paid his dues Roxy Hes played you know paid his dues as an assistant Big part of their success and to see him now hes had success as a head coach but hes put his time in Hes a hes a fiery guy and his teammates or his team takes after his personality went to Arizona State as an undergrad Got his degree but as he was working a job in addition to coaching high school basketball while he was going to Arizona State he made a point every day with the the guidance of Herb Send who was the coach at Arizona State at the time He allowed Jayce Coburn to attend practice every day So he was in the stands absorbing Herb Sak running his practices on a daily basis then implementing that stuff with his high school program and thats what helped guide him to this spot now in his fifth year at Portland State That was a good era as you know at Arizona State So its a good time to model a veteran coach like Herb Send But hes hes paid his dues Coach has shot clock down to five Jaylen Henderson got away with a push off No he didnt And the foul on Henderson is first It was very subtle Roxy but the official problem is it was right in front of the official Theres the theres a lean in and the arm a little bit of both Of course I thought you know Stanford sold it too So uh if youre going to commit those fouls dont do it in front of the official Do it somewhere else Fourpoint lead for the Cardinal They have led by as many as six cheering And a foul the second on Keon Kenzie Jr and Stanford in the bonus and Chisumakpara will head to the line Yeah I like what Chisumok Parara is doing Roxy Hes not settling He can shoot the three and hes really improved that Hes shown that But hes really catching knifing the ball Hes catching the ball on the move which is an important skill He doesnt wait for the ball to get in his hands then attack the defender Hes catching the ball the pass meeting the pass and moving And thats how hes drawing these fouls One for one from the line and one and one for Akara 69 from the line last year And hell earn the bonus Well weve brought this up but you know Kyle Smith doesnt mind seeing this young man get to the line He knows he can get there because he did it for his team at at Harvard He was really tough and and very agile and adept at getting the ball and getting to the free throw line His sophomore year at Harvard Akara made the second most free throws in the Ivy League that year Came off the bench the majority of last season Got the opportunity to start this year for the Cardinal His last year of college basketball is the pullup jumper missed by Jaylen Henderson That one deflected by Sebastian Tedor Here comes Portland State The freshman pullup jumper A tough one banked in straight on by Alex Dri Didnt call it but didnt have to It went down And a trip as Benny Geler went crashing to the deck And they get that one on Colt Ness Well I like Stanfords ability now to come down and and and attack because theyve got the bonus the remainder of the half But you know look at Kyle Smith wherever hes been and Ive had a chance to follow his career all the way as an assistant through Colombia through USF Washington State where hes coach of the year in the Pack 12 and what hes done in his first year here at Stanford Just a remarkable job Um you know but when you watch him its so painstaking because Kyle you know hes such a perfectionist He wants things to go well but hes he pays attention to detail His staffs the same way and and his teams improve They get better Its one of the again staples of his teams They they seem to get better every year even within the season One out of two for Benny Geler who last year was an 89 foul shooter Academic all ACC pick last year as a Cardinal Back up four Stepping into a three That one rims off for Sebastian Tedor but a foul on Stanford going for the rebound inside And theres the challenge Roxy that Stanfords going to have to face Kyle Smith talked about it at length He said Look were were a good defensive team but were not were not great unless we can secure rebounds And you know obviously this is a very aggressive team Portland State but you got to put a body on on your opponents and go up and secure rebounds even if it means the guards got to stay in Second foul on Aiden Cam and hell sit with the two fouls as AJ Roi comes back for him Stanford a little bit shorthanded up front as Donovan Young still battling that leg issue Hes day to day and no Evan Stinson tonight in the season open Hes a little bit banged up dealing with a little bit of a back problem but hes day to day as well And the quick hands and Stanford with a takeaway Transition Ryan Agarwal thought about it Good pressure by Portland State Chisum Aakpara powering his way through and count the basket A goal Well thats good patience Thats a great step through Really nothing going on until Apara excused to step through That was an up and under Got his defender up in the air Stepped through Got it off the glass Goalending Thats thats just a good move You can see showing the ball You show your you show your defender the ball and then you got up and under and was able to get the ball off the glass Really smart for post players Use a glass Trvon might not touching it while it was on the cylinder and using a strength to out muscle Mos Downing Rivers down low Portland States attacked the rim almost on every possession They go inside again through the double team Count it and one Terry Miller Jr for the Vikings Yeah hes a load Roxy Youve got to get a a body on him They try to get two and three guys down there Once you get position that deep watch he pounds it on the glass He gets all the way The help comes late Too many dribbles to the basket Benny Giler trying to get down Hes late And and obviously uh you know postto double didnt happen So Millers too tough I mean you allow him to get Terry Miller to the basket hell destroy you So Miller the end one free throw Now Kyles Miller I mean Kyle Smiths disappointed He wanted that double team to come a lot earlier Not on the catch certainly on the dribble You can get down there on the first dribble Third dribble too late He cuts the Stanford lead in half as Miller was granted an additional year of eligibility Thats that JC rule where theyre not counting those JC years And so he got another year from the NCAA because of it He was second team all big sky last year and a stoppage and a whistle underneath referee Paul Floor Well this is keeping Stanford in good position just because theyre able to draw fouls I mean a lot of time left in this half and theyre going to be in the double bonus I mean quick and two for Ibuko Cororey whos now two for two from the line and 11 points for the freshman And Miller not getting a long break Jace Coburn getting him right back in the game Well we talked about this before Roxy Its one thing to get to the line but Stanford can make free throws They one of the better free throw shooting teams So end of the half theyre in bonus late game situations Theyre going to really be a load the way they can shoot Theyre theyre very adept shoot free throw shooting team Accorey has half of Stanfords points In case youre wondering whats the most points in a freshman debut Its 19 And Aorei the way hes going will break that Ramming it home Travon May not for Portland State And its not just about Miller They got Minot And why not Hes tough Step through Chismak Par lost control And here come the Vikings Sebastian Tedor three Theyre feeling it Roxy Portland State They you can see the confidence and their coach is up on the sideline Hes into it Theyve tied the game but Ibuka Okorei reclaims the lead for the Cardinal Well he just stays so calm when hes on the floor Doesnt matter what the score is Doesnt matter whats happening momentum wise he just puts his team back on the map I I love to watch him him operate 17 against Oregon last Thursday Now this is the first official game as Ryan Agarwal had it and then knocked down and Portland State steps on the sideline It belongs to Stanford but the Vikings are hanging right in there with the Cardinal Twopoint game 713 left first half seasons in a while for the Vikings 19 wins last year finished third in the conference And Portland State one of the favorites along with Montana to win the Big Sky this year is Ibuka Okori missing a three and the rebound grab by Portland State and Travon May May not one of three players on this Portland State team as we talked about Terry Miller Jr earlier as the foul on Chisamak Parr of Stanford is second but one of three players for Portland State that was granted a sixth year Yeah that doesnt happen very often once Now you can talk about three Uh thats a lot of experience Thats those are guys that are veteran players that have been out on the floor So tough to play against that type of experience May not Jaylen Henderson and Terry Miller Jr deflected It stays with Portland State They were all granted a sixth year by the NCA two of them because of the junior college situation where May not was a little different where he had to apply for a sixth year because of some hardships in his life and some real tough times especially when he was at South Carolina and the NCA agreeing and allowing my not to have that sixth year because of it Well Im all for the NCAA allowing young men to get opportunities Now coaches are going to try to go out and take advantage of that rule as well because it it it behooves you to go to junior college if you cant get an extra year Corner three and that ones too strong from Kelsey Fipps and Stanford controls Here is Ryan Agarwal Yeah Can Stanford find some other guys Roxy that you know to score They 22 of the 26 points have come from Aorei and from uh Apara and they havent had much scoring otherwise Cameron Grant missing a three Still Stanford clinging to that twopoint lead Jose Downing Rivers transfer from Missouri State former junior college national champion And Stanford picks up the loose ball Jeremy Den Smith Now the pullup three and the rebound ripped down by Sebastian Tedor for Portland State Nobody stopped the ball and all the way to the basket Mos Downing Rivers Moses right down the lane and we are tied Well Kyle Smith didnt call that timeout I think I think Chase called the timeout but thatll give something on both ends to talk about Thats just you dont see that happen very often against the Kyle Smith Stanford team and transition Just nobody stopping the ball Just you know no communication and uh its early Roxy This is you know opening night and so if those things are going to happen theyre going to happen early in the season But you got to talk about it because thats one thing you dont want to give up is transition baskets Kyle Smith and his team leading by as many as six here in the first half And again we alluded to the the minutes and the players back for Kyle Smith Yes they lost a lot of production Certainly with Reo Sers and Blakes gone But over 50 of the minutes from a year ago returning for Stanford Theyre the only team in the ACC that returns more than 50 of their minutes from last season Well thats impressive So you got to make that work for you That veteran uh look should help you But again they just got to find a couple things now offensively a couple other options because theyre getting uh two guys carrying the load for first appearance for Oscar Hilte the freshman from Belgium whos been dealing with some back spasms had made the start in the exhibition game against Oregon but coming off the bench tonight Here he is down low Hell underneath and uses the window Somehow finagles that one up and in Oscar Hilt Well I like that You know that came out of the timeout Roxy I like that uh approach You got some size and mismatch down there You know go to work And you got the team in double bonuses So go go down low And there is some question if Stanford would have heel Tay in this one as a foul on the drive will get Kelsey Fipps to the lineame first on Cameron Grant Yeah you can see how difficult it is to contain Portland State They they really get to the rim I mean they turn the corner and if you dont help early you know getting help to the basket late not going to help you You got to get the ball stopped early And I thought that Stanford such a good job in their first game getting early stops on the ball Um but having a little more difficulty with Portland State in that regard Spins out for Fipps Southern California native Sophomore who red shirted its first year at Portland State Averaged two points a game Shot just 52 from the line Zabuka Okori gets a breather Fipps goes one for two A lot of different lineups out here so far You you see teams making adjustments Stanford throwing a lot of different players out So chemistry an issue early in the season Nice pass by Grant to a cutting Agarwal Ryan Agarwal gets his own miss Creates some space tries to reverse using the rim to shield the shot from the shot blocker And a smart play by Agarwal will get him two feet No thats thats a heads heads up play Its a veteran move I mean got the offensive rebound He loses it Gets it back and hes playing against a post guy thats pretty much just has his hands straight up and youre playing against post guys that put their hands straight up in the air You got to spin off their body just what Ryan Agarwal did First on Sebastian Tedor and one more for Agarwal Gets his first point of the night the junior from Texas 10 points five boards in that exhibition game against Oregon for Agarwal Well if youre Stanford now you again youve got to get some stops because Portland States dangerous Theyve got Terry Miller just inserted back in the game And hes a load Theyre going to have to start with him find a way to guard him keep him off the low block Agarwal who came off the bench early last season then started the rest of the way started 29 games for Stanford a year ago Threepoint lead for the Cardinal as Henderson challenged by Benny Geler and a travel is called against Stanford that goes right back to Portland State They had two guys on the ball and again youd rather have two guys fighting for it but they didnt communicate Actually had three guys on the ball and let the big guy get his rebound I always say guards get out of the way Big man had it But you know thats a good sign You want three guys securing trying to secure the ball Heres Terry Miller Jr Spin move and then a foul going for the rebound Its the third on Travon May not and that is a problem for Jay Coburn in Portland State Well thats huge You dont want your big fella your defensive sawward to get that third foul this early in the game And hes over the back Not a lot of contact but enough And coach talking about it like man you could let that one go By the way Jace Coburn the rare coach its still wearing a suit on the sidelines No tie No time I had to point that out Now in this day and age would you have gone with the the pullover or would you still worn a suit You know I Ive asked myself that too Roxy I I dont know I I like to I used to like my wardrobe I I had an ensemble I mean when you have an ensemble you spent a lot of money on your wardrobe You wanted to show it off I cant I had a clothing contract Roxy I didnt have I didnt pay for that I always had a clothing contract Most coaches didnt I did Dont ask me how but I did I think Pat Cat Riley had one too Loose ball Geler fighting for it with Jaylen Henderson The arrow belongs to Portland State Big possession 339 left in the half Stanford by Smith laughter Well hes got a lot of things that hell discuss at halftime but you know his teams got a lead and theyre playing against a feisty team This is a good Portland State team Portland State deep in the shot clock throws up a prayer loose ball hustling for Ibuko Cory and Stanford controls Ryan Agarwal and a tie up Its a Stanford ball Roxy the difference in this game so far now has been at the free throw line Stanford getting there 14 times Thats the margin of of their lead Uh neither team has a lot of assists Both teams having success driving the basketball and finding ways to score to the hole or get fouled Brian Agarwal had it knocked away and Portland State comes away from the pack Jaylen Henderson and a corner three in transition is way off from Keon Kenzie Jr but kept alive Second shots Shot clock down to 10 for the Vikings Ibuka Okori the steel Hes everywhere Good give and go and Benny Geler finds Okorei and the quick burst by the freshman and the rebound pulled down Alex Dri for Portland State and that one deflected out and a turnover committed by the Vikings Thats 10 turnovers by Portland State Thats something Stanford did well Ben in the exhibition game against a good Oregon team Now the Ducks were playing without their regular point guard in Jackson Shelstat in that game but they forced Oregon into 19 turnovers in that exhibition game last Thursday Well that was huge And and limited themselves to to zero or turnovers throughout most of the first half A Cory to the bucket Well hes so powerful to that to the rack Roxys very strong with his right but he can use either one But hes just had a whale of a game Just a tremendous first half for the 16 for Ibuka Okorei and way off with the leaner from Dri and AJ Rahosi and Dri and the held ball Itll go to Portland State Eight on the shot clock No reset as there was no change of possession Uh Portland States done a good job crashing the offensive glass and coming up with some a couple of offensive rebounds Short clock here Roxan Have to really pay attention to Terry Miller Got to guard him Play him inside out again Eight on the timer Jaylen Henderson gets inside and off balance And there is Ibuka Okori for Stanford pulling it down Good defense by Stanford Did a nice job And Okori tried to scoop and the rebound pulled down Sebastian Tedor for Portland State Final 90 seconds of this first half Nice pass by Miller and a foul and went sprawling to the deck and slow to get up is Jaylen Henderson That was a really nice give and go I mean pass and really quick basket cut Heres the high post though Just a push pass off the catch You know coaches work on that teams work on that Thats a tremendous play Foul was on Benny Geler and Henderson collecting himself and ready to go from the line That basket cuts so hard to guard because you have to turn your head to see both man and ball and when usually you lose sight of one Too strong from Jaylen Henderson the senior from Witchah Preseason all big sky Henderson Second year at Portland State after year at Louisiana Tech Well hes hes shot some threes in his career He put up 170 a year ago So he can shoot it but he can also drive it Hes aggressive Heres Stanford now Roxy you got to try to get back on the glass You know youve got free throw advantage and youre got the other team in the bonus Wide open look Too strong from Cameron Grant AJ Roi on the offensive glass And the put back by AJ Roi his first points as a Cardinal Hes nifty Roxy Hes very adept around the basket Hes had the ball there several times this game Finally was able to make it make make it score And a steal for Stanford The Cardinal working on their largest lead And the miss by Jeremy Den Smith Pull down Portland State About a 12sec differential To the bucket The layin Keon Kenzie Jr again Transition defense Heres Stanford Now you can play for the last shot and only give Portland State about a 3second differential to come out and score So you want to exhaust this clock Benny Geler on the drive Gets to the basket and Benny Geler lays it in Five seconds Dri and a steal and chucking at the length of the floor Way off from Jeremy Den Smith but Stanford has matched their largest lead Seven points up on Portland State and a strong close of the half by Stanford Nice finish by Stanford They extended the league but they had to work This is a tough assignment for them Portland State theyre playing with aggression play that forced the turnover but you dont want to make him selfinflict it So interesting Now Stanford with the ball Roxy theyre going to have a chance to increase this lead uh and see if they can you know again maybe find some other ways to score Little bit of a tweak in the Stanford lineup to start the second half Theyre going big with AJ Roi and Aiden Camman along with Chisumak Par up and under by Akara who lays it in and the largest lead for the Cardinal Yeah I mentioned that coming out and that that didnt shock me to see Stanford immediately find the mismatch and go right to the rim and they did it Stanford with three bigs on the floor Offbalance tough fadeaway Keon Kenzie Jr A wild shot and Benny Geler back the other way inside AJ Roi and he goes at Travon Mayot who was playing with three fouls and he caught him in a defensive position and now its a double figure lead for the Cardinal You see the size paying off for Stanford Both possessions inside to the post plays with results The lob at the rim and it rims out on the alleyoop to Travon Mayot Back the other way Ibuka Okari and one Tremendous start to the second half for Stanford You couldnt have drawn up this start any better than what Stanfords done Theyve come out defensively you know I mean in transition gotten the ball up the court first two possessions in the block down on the block to score I mean theyve gotten there but theyre dangerous If if you turn it over theyre going to make you pay And a free throw good by Okori And he is now tied the Stanford record for points by a freshman in a Stanford debut Well we said he probably would break that record today and we were right At least we think were right Hes Hes got one more to go And Stanford has blitzed Portland State seven straight to start the second half And a travel Yeah thats a good call Uh you know and again Stanfords defense really is digging in Its you know you look at the offense and that theyve scored they theyve converted every possession but its defensively where theyve really hurt Portland State Theyve theyve gone out pressured caused turnovers and thats paid off coming into tonight and which now Aorei has tied it The record was held by Zire Williams who scored 19 in his first game with Stanford as a freshman That came at the Maui Invitational the co year when the Maui Invitational played in Asheville North Carolina Yeah No I remember I remember uh back back in back then Well thats thats an unfortunate foul Inadvertent but nonetheless a foul And thats the third on Terry Miller Jr Hes got three Travon May not has three And some real problems for Portland State Strip from Okorei And here comes Colt Ness for the Vikings Left open Sebastian Tedor Three Good ball movement by the Vikings Thats a great job You went for the steal you got burned Didnt get it Had a tough time recovering And thats a block And the second foul on Colt Ness Well this big lineup has given Stanford the edge this half Theres a hunch that Kyle Smith had He said before the game he can play big if he wants He can play big play small He chose big and its paid off Benny Geler and the rebound falls to Chisum Parara and a foul and if thats on May not thats four cheering Well hes not going to like the call but thats an offensive rebound again The size really hurting Portland State Stanford has the luxury of playing big when they want to and its paying off Four on number four and Travon May nots going to have to sit for a bit and the first is good by Chisumak Parara Im sure Chisum Parara likes this rock He gets to play the three a little bit maybe step out knock down a couple of threepoint shots but hes been just a a real thorn in Portland State side to the basket Hes been so tough inside Thats two games in a row where hes been delivering for his team Now four for five at the line 12 for Apara and the Stanford lead is 13 Drop off and missing the layin Keon Kenzie Jr and a foul in frustration going cheering for the steal after missing the layup Well its been a little tougher now for Portland State to score because theyre going over bigger longer players So again not only offensively is Stanford taking advantage of their size theyve made it work for them defensively I always like bigger guys starting Roxy and bringing off smaller guys Its just kind of the way I like to play And I think its theres some advantages to it You know big guys sometimes dont they need to warm up a little bit get them out there early let them play and then guards come off Guards can come in game play anytime So I I I like this move personally and it and its definitely worked for Stanford Third foul on Keon Kenzie Jr Danny Geler And thats an offensive foul crashing into Terry Miller Jr And the second on Geler Right idea but left his feet Well now the Stanfords going to go with a substitution Benny Giler will take a seat but thats a good start for this unit I think Stanford might have discovered something here I mean Cayman came in and now hes starting and this is a this good lineup Deep three And a stroke from Sebastian Tedor His third three tonight Yeah you better get out and locate him Hes Hes found his range And And they calling it out of bounds or a foul I think they did not call the foul Just said its white ball I not sure Yeah Im not sure what it was Theres heres the post up No foul was called and it appears okay the call was made that Terry Miller Jr was touching the basketball while he was out of bounds Thats why its a baseline throw in for Stanford Yeah I thought both players were out of bounds depending on who touched it first But lets play on I like theres no foul call in that possession You dont you hate to see Miller pick up a foul Now hes playing with four But Jamal Spearman may have done him a favor Yes Well Stanfords making Portland State play defend inside Thats a smart move And stepped on the sideline Thats a Stanford giveaway as Jeremy Den Smith was out of bounds Well hell probably say he was forced out but theres no such move as a force out anymore That plays been eliminated from all levels of basketball If youre Stanford you better locate the threepoint line Stepping out for a three Rattles off for Terry Miller Jr and Stanford pulls it down Offensive foul on Dent Smith Called for the charge Yeah its the second time a Stanford player has left their feet gone airborne Got to jump stop or you got to go straight up But he had a drop off underneath too That was a right pass actually However the charge took precedent Good job by Portland State getting in the right position They they they scrap They they want you to drive it Then they get in the passing lanes and driving lanes They do a nice job And theyre getting another foul on Jeremy Dent Smith And thats his third That looked like it was a a pretty lot of ball there Ah that was a pretty quick whistle Jeremy Dent says All right I might have charged the last time Ill take that But I that was pretty clean A lot of whistles early in this half Early in the season you always get a high number of whistles right As the new rules are being enforced the way the game is going to get called this season and players have to figure it out and they ease their way in Yeah its always its an adjustment period open for three and a stroke from Alex Dri Roxy Stanfords got to get out to the threepoint line Theyve really given up that lead by allowing threepoint shots to be taken and scored Sevenpoint lead for the Cardinal as Portland State has cut a 14point lead in half Six straight now for the Vikings And they come in transition again Jaylen Henderson hits a three Timeout Stanford And its a fourpoint game Nine nothing run for the Vikings Now youve got a Cory back in the game and hes been a factor Every time Stanfords just really struggled hes put the ball in his hands and made something happen Along with Ben Braun on our ACC network crew Roxy Bernstein with you The opener for Stanford and Portland State It was a 14point Cardinal lead It is now four and Stanford a turnover Well and Cory just you know talked to Agaral said Hey stay in that corner I was going to find you big fella Kyle Smith and the Cardinal trying to figure things out after theyre up 14 Portland State has come roaring back half and for Stanford to get control this game again Ben what do you need to see from the Cardinal Well defensively theyve got to stop the penetration Theyve gotten burned on penetration and then overheld and gotten beat by threepoint shots this half So just contain the ball stay on your on the on your feet Trying to back door lob and theyre calling an illegal screen out top and the push on Alex Dri waves off the alioop attempt and the second on Dri Well Jay Coburn clearly doesnt agree with the call No that probably would have been a look I mean heres the back screen Here it is The back screen and a move the last second Yeah thats a foul Thats a good call by the officials No question about that And now if youre Stanford can you take advantage of that turnover And a foul inside I really like what Stanford just did on this last possession Thats how they started this half Roxy they are going back to trying to gain that dominance inside I mean para on the block Portland State doesnt have an answer for that And Stanfords in the bonus for the rest of the night They were the first half That is the seventh team foul and a one and one for Chisum Apara Yeah you dont want to depend on outside shots to get you back in this game You have guys inside that can score A par I mean he can live at the line if he wants to and Hiller in the bonus now Five for six of the strike And here comes the he artillery again Rox theyre going big I mean theres theres no question theyre going back to the lineup that started that run I I think thats a good move Question is can they is it can this big lineup contain the penetration of the quick Portland guards Portland State guards Well find out 14 for Apara one off a Stanford High at 15 last year against Boston College Three off the mark from Alex Dri Thats better defense by the Stanford Cardinal AJ Rahosi and Aiden Cam on the weak side and the put back by Cam Well thats the advantage of the size Roxy Your your post guys are trying to help out now Theres loose offensive rebounds available on the glass First points for Camman tonight and Stanford has pushed the lead out to eight open for three Thats way off from Colt Ness The strip and Terry Miller Jr with the hands for Portland State defense by the Vikings Good active hands and Okori hustling back Knocks it out of bounds It stays with the Vikings That was a good save That was a good penetration and find in the corner Cory had presence of mind to go to the corner and break that up That mean thats Watch heres the drive and Aorei knew just where he was going to go with that ball Sometimes when youre a point guard you you kind of know where that balls heading but hell be on the bench probably through the next TV timeout They cant afford to sit him for long Sebastian Tedor Terry Miller Jr Three but he can do that Thats not a fluke Hes tough inside but hes very capable from the threepoint line Second three for Miller tonight Portland State has made five shots on the floor in the second half All five have been outside the yard And thats a kick And theyll put 20 back up on the shot clock for Stanford Well Stanfords you know their bread and butter early in this game was to go inside and theyve got the size to do it Lets see if they go back try to get a post up and take advantage of that bonus situation Fanny Geler trying to turn the corner Lo lost his footing and a tie up and it belongs to Portland State You can see the quickness from Portland State Roxy Theyre very quick Theyre moving their feet Theyve got a lot of quickness on the floor And its not an accident when you have the best defensive numbers in a conference No they work hard defensively and they buy in to what Jayce Coburn who is a defensiveminded coach wants them to do and they theyll press you Theyre relentless with their pressure Thats what they do They learned from one of the best defensive minds in college basketball and Mark Adams Terry Miller Jr the miss and Stanford pulls it down And a whistle off the ball and thats four on Miller Well I like again that Stanfords using their presence to post inside and thats where they can really hurt Portland State You you can see it as an early post up uh here and theres a push I mean they you dont want to let people get post position on you whether its a high post or low and youre taught to deny that area but you got to keep your hands in your elbows and your arm bar has to be into your body Once you extend it the officials will get you AJ Rahosi hits the front end of the one and one One more coming for Raosi And thats again the fourth foul on Miller Well thats a big loss if he he has to sit because he just knocked down a three and he has to sit long Hes knocked down a three and hes hes a guy that you have to def you know design your defense around AJ Roi hits both the unconventional free throw stroke but it works and Stamford is up seven So Miller is on the bench now with his four They have brought back Travon Mayot and his four fouls Travel on Jaylen Henderson Turnover number 16 of Portland State Thats a good call Good help side by Stanford They forced the drive and then he came over there and helped which caused the travel See if Stanford can take advantage of the turnover on this end of the floor Earr pass and a steel Kelsey Fipps glides to the basket That crosscourt pass Roxy is a no no If youre going to throw that it better be hard That was a floater Picked off Hey Jeremy Dent Smith three Well hes capable Roxy He hadnt hit his first couple but he shot that with confidence He can put the ball in the basket Great find by Benny Giler last year Dent Smith Cal State Dominguez Hills season scoring record and he was a 35 threepoint shooter and a wild shot And Jaylen Henderson struggling to get back Den Smith nearly made him pay with his second three in a row with a back tap and a heady play by Benny Geler Oh thats a great play by Benny Giler He He chased that ball down and got it right back to his teammate for a reload Chismakara off balance and the rebound tipped free Here comes Jaylen Henderson for the Vikings just bulls his way to the basket Runs over Geler and the foul is called on Benny Giler Portland State to the line 1056 to go Eightpoint lead Stanford Portland State the opener shooting I mean theyve gotten some some guys to step back and get very comfortable uh at the threepoint line They Its come off of penetration has come in transition and theyve been very comfortable from three Stanfords got to get out to the threepoint line but theyve got to contain the ball at their initial point of attack Theres the stats You can see what theyve done now in this second half Night and day Five out of eight Stanford only one out of three Theyve made six field goals in the second half You saw five threes The other was a dunk Well they theyve got to do this now Portland State with Miller sitting out Thats thats an advantage for Stanford if they can take advantage of it Foul trouble for Portland State Four for Terry Miller Jr whos on the bench and four for Travon Minot who was on the floor right now Its deflected out The hustle by Keon Kenzie Jr Theyre trying to go inside to Chisimok Parara but great defensive move by Portland State to get around in the post knock it out of bounds Got a little bit of a short clock Now if youre Stanford you got to try to get the ball back on the block Score to the basket if you can Theyve got an advantage Okori fading away 21 for Ibuka Okori And the new freshman record for points in a debut belongs to Ibuka Okori Hes so powerful to the basket Uses that glass to perfection Offensive foul Thats the fourth on Alex Dri Roxy Look at the body control here of McCory getting to the basket He gets by you with your body Once he gets his hip by your hip its over And hes able to get it off the glass Really uses the window Thats a skill Heres Ibuko Cory again Chisamak par in the lane Boy has he been aggressive to the basket Hes gotten in the lane Nobody on Portland State can keep stay with him at the rim Hes just big too big too strong 10point Stanford lead Back to double digits And the most points for Akara in a Stanford uniform but he has fouled Sebastian Tedor who gets to the line 16 for Agara 21 for Okori And just past the midway point of the second half a double figure lead for Stanford Although Tedor headed to the line for Portland State Well if youre Stanford you dont want to start fouling and put Portland State to the line where they can stop the clock and pressure a little bit You know make make them continue to play against you Knock down contested shots They had a couple of shots that they gave up that were uncontested Big difference between contested shots uncontested shots Sebastian Tedor hits both He has 11 Jaylen Henderson leading Portland State with 14 Well Stanfords two big weapons have been Aorei and Aara to the rim and off the hands of AJ Rahosi was fired into the post by Chisumakpar Stanford a turnover and he was open and when you post guys are open rocks you got to get them the ball right away He had big time position You got to you got to find a man when theyre open and maybe take a little bit off that one That That was a rocket So now Jayce Coburn rolling the dice Hes got both Trarevon Minot and Terry Miller Jr on the floor with four fouls a piece Well only one can foul out first So its you know you got to play to win Roxy Im Im okay with that They came up here to play and to win Theyre not here to play close Theyre trying to win this game Left open Sebastian Tedor and the rebound tipped to Terry Miller Jr The kick out on the reload Jaylen Henderson the miss and Jeremy Den Smith pulls it down and pushes for the Cardinal Transition three in and out for Ibuka Okorei And a foul going for the rebound on Stanford Team foul number six on the Cardinal Yeah its good call by the officials First on AJ Roi Well you know its always a gamble when you play your two you know better players and theyve got four but if you sit and they Stanford increases this lead youre going to wish you had played them Im Im with coach on this one Play them Heres Miller looking to back his way in Deep three too strong from Sebastian Tedor and AJ Rahosi gives way to Ibuko Okori on the rebound for the Cardinal Good possession by the Cardinal defensively They stayed grounded left open in the corner Three Ibuka Okori Well I I like what Jeremy Dent Smith did He knew Okaris got a hot hand and he got got his teammate the ball And the bump the second foul on Okorei Yeah he knew it He just got there late tried to draw his hands back but the body contact took place One and one for Jaylen Henderson You know and this may be a little counterintuitive Roxy Wouldnt be surprised to see Stanford maybe if theyre fouling like this go to a little bit of a zone which will maybe call off the fouls but then you have the danger of playing against a team that can knock down the three But funny how some teams shoot it better against man than they do against the zone for whatever reason The good news about his own is youre usually in position out on the perimeter to guard but then you give up rebounds and maybe some offensive possessions there One and one for Henderson Five for seven from the line and one more coming for Jaylen Henderson Well Stanfords going to a three guard lineup Theyve got three small guards in and well see how this plays out Henderson hits both If youre Kyle Smith you know that Minot has four although they have taken Miller off the floor for the time being Would you look to attack him and try to get him out of the game Yeah you can do it either by the post up or the drive And the bump and its the third on Colt Ness And its Jeremy Den Smith that will go to the line after the timeout 757 to go Stanford up nine on Portland State in Maples Thats his third personal team for Ibuka Okori the New Hampshire native setting a record for the most points by a Stanford freshman in their collegiate debut Well and Roxy hes done it from everywhere on the floor Hes knocked down threes Hes gotten to the rim Hes hit the pullup So hes an allpurpose player Really really has a lot of gears that he can play and and he shows you how effective he can be Hes hes a special player The move aside Zire Williams the new record holder is Ibuka Okori And two shots for Jeremy Den Smith Well Stanfords going to continue to live at the line if they can because thats a way to stay you know keep this lead intact Last year the D2 AllAmerican led Cal State Dominguez Hills to the national championship game at the Division 2 level Hes got eight points in his Stanford debut tonight He averaged 19 a game last year for Dominguez Hills Hes a strong guard He can do a lot of things as well Good compliments of Cory and Benny Geler And thats way short from Colt Ness I buo Cory weaving his way through traffic Benny Geler three And how about a Cororey giving a time up to his teammate Benny Geler who was due Benny was due to hit a three Stanford has matched their largest lead now Terry Miller Jr barrels his way inside and the flip Terry Miller and you can see how easy it is for him to score He can use either hand inside outside player Last touch by Sebastian Tedor Stays down here with Stanford Stanford doesnt have to be in a hurry Roxy Theyve got the ball in the lead yet You dont want to go into a deep freeze either But you got to you know maybe uh massage the ball a little bit But heres the last three Benny Giller was feeling it I think he was maybe happy and gracious to get that open look hasnt had many nor has Stanford had many open looks AJ Roosi in the lane rattles and goes for AJ Roi He gives them some presence inside Roxy hes 610 and all is 610 and can go over either shoulder Hes a load down low and athletic 645 remaining as Portland State have another run in them Kelsey Fipps Jaylen Henderson drives The fade away from Henderson And the rebound tipped free by Benny Giler but grabbed by Sebastian Tedor for Portland State And then gliding in The miss from Jaylen Henderson The tip wouldnt go and Stanford pulls it down Jeremy Dent Smith down the lane and a foul will get him to the line You know Roxy this is a different look from Stanford and I think you know its its its interesting to see but Stanfords not sitting on the ball Theyre pushing the ball in transition Miss takes place theyre taking advantage of their quickness their ability with their size to rebound get it out and theyre getting some advantages in in in transition before the defense gets set One more for Jeremy Denith Second foul on Kelsey Fipps And there is Terry Miller Jr coming back for Jace Coburn And Portland State down 14 to Stanford with 612 to go Well theyve got to get back in this game Uh certainly defensively stopped stopped Stanford in transition but theyve got to find ways to score Theyve been in a little bit of a drought Nine now for D Smith And the Cardinal have their largest lead of the night led by seven at the half Portland State cut it to four here in the second half And Stanford has pushed it out to 15 as Portland State has made just one of their last nine from the field Kelsey Fipps hits a three Thats the danger when youre playing with Miller in the game Roxy Youve got to go down and double him When you do youve got three open threepoint shots and a whistle and its an offensive foul on Stanford and theyre getting it on AJ Rahosi Well again thats just you know thats a turn here where youre giving up the ball Dont want to turn it over but heres that that look to the basket And here is the the foul up top But you know if youre Stanford now this is still this games not over You got to play through the through the end of this game A corner three and the roll for Sebastian Tedor What do we have Rox We have it under 10 now Single digits Fourth three for Tedor tonight and the Vikings come away with it Six straight for Portland State and Tedor stepped on the sideline Well thats a break for Stanford I dont look now He hits that shot in the corner dumps it inside Thats a twop possession game Huge turnover for Portland State A break for Stanford 18 Portland State turnovers tonight But on the other end Stanford uncharacteristically of a Kyle Smith team Theyve turned it over 16 times and 10 here in the second half Yeah And thats thats beyond what has been their you know their game They dont usually turn it over Den Smith deep three Jeremy Den Smith Well we wondered where the scoring was going to come from Roxy I think we might see a culprit here A good culprit I might add Three threes for Den Smith and Stanford steals it ahead to Benny GELER WIDE open for the layin Timeout Portland State And just like that Stanford goes on a burst and a 14point lead Thats huge Roxy because without those turnovers and the transition baskets this is a tight game very big turn of events for Stanford But they made their own music breaks by getting out in transition getting some stops and turning it and converting in transition for easy score Five really with ease no strain on his shot And Kyle Smith has given him as he should the green light and its paid off But now you got as I mentioned earlier youve got a Stanford team on the floor now that also shoots free throws So thats going to be an advantage for this team if they can maintain the lead late game because theyre going to knock down free throws And Stanford also hitting their shots from the field 63 in the second half They gone four for seven from three Now you see a little bit of a zone look for Stanford Theyre theyre going to try to avoid fouling Make them take some clock to attack Theyre in the zone Terry Miller Jr and the jump hook rattles out and the rebound controlled Here comes Benny Geler for the Cardinal Yeah I like the zone by Kyle Smith Chisumak Par had it poked out of bounds Thought he was home free in the hustle back by Colt Ness You know Portland State shows you their medal I mean that should be a layup but thats just great hustle by Portland State Theyre all over the court A par underneath and then had his shot changed and Portland State comes away with it Jaylen Henderson shovels it inside and the slam Travon May not All right If youre in the Big Sky Roxy I you got to watch this Portland State team They are explosive They can score on you in a hurry Jeremy Den Smith and the offensive rebound Aiden Camman had it knocked away Here comes Ness for Portland State And a pretty move by Colt Ness Timeout Stanford Yeah at this one This games a long way from over If youre Stanford Roxy you must take care of the basketball number one not turn it over and use the clock Use the clock You got the the time on your side Dont quick shoot it If youre Stanford you either get a draw a foul by the drive or the post up and get the ball in this guys hands I think so Thats thats paid dividends No question Back door Benny Geler hangs and a foul is called and a block Thats a smart play by Benny Giler He was being overplayed Got to the basket and drew the foul But thats good That took up that took up time and got them Great pass by Abara I thought that was a great move Benny Giler able to draw some contact So you eat up some time increase the lead at the free throw line and now get your defense set and try not to stop the clock on this end Travon May not is fouled out Thats five on the big man Yeah thats a loss because hes their defensive anchor Its tough to score on him Uh a break for Stanford but I I commended Coach Coburn for playing his guys They they were in this game to play Uh they werent going to decide this game without their best players being on the floor And Benny Geler nails the first free throw Well we talked about it You know I hope itll play out but Stanfords got some guys that can nail shots down the down the stretch if they get to the line Keeler hits both Hes in double digits with 10 And Stanford with four players in double figures led by the 24 from Ibuka Okori Theyre in the zone again Tough three in the corner and a hit for Sebastian Tedor Yeah got to live with that Hes knocked three of those down already You know if they hit that shot you got to commend them Thats just thats tough shot Five threes for Tedor Fuka Okori finding Chisuman Par How about that play by Chisum Pora Tedor again and here comes Portland rather Stanford back the other way Benny Geler skipped to the bucket missed the layup its last touch by they say the Cardinal it belongs to Portland State well Stanfords not sitting on the clock Roxy theyre trying to push the ball the new look Stanford theyre saying look youre trying to crash the glass on us Were going to push the ball out coming back out at you And they have heres a zone again Kyle Smith will play zone Benny Keeler The steel took it away from Sebastian Tedor Love the look Roxy Changes up the momentum changes up the attack Something a little different Great call by Kyle Smith and his staff Chismak par up and under Akara draws the foul and one Well hes feeling it Roxy Hes knows that he cant be stopped and checked down there Look at him on the crossover Loses the ball Gets it back Just keeps pivoting Keeps his pivot feet down draws contact Well hes made a living down here Second Portland State player to foul out Alex Dri is done for the night Well this is again you know talk about Chisum Parara Hes not shying away from contact I think a year ago he hurried himself kind of avoided contact Hes embracing contact now and hes being rewarded by getting to the line the second year in this system Ben and the second year of playing for Kyle Smith How much more comfortable is he Well he is I I mean you can see just in his play hes he knows his role Hes been giving some freedom Hes given the ball at different spots on the floor and hes taken advantage of it The teardrop and the roll for Jaylen Henderson Timeout Portland State Just amazing what a a difference a year makes I think Aiden Keman the same thing Hes hes stepped his game up Uh Benny Giler stepped his game up You know you you gain a lot be from a junior to a senior sophomore to a junior You know a year under your belt really pays off music for you and and you can see the the comfort level Plus you have a new coach new system whole new staff So thats an adjustment period But Kyle Smith has given his players uh freedom 21 wins last year for Stanford and for Kyle Smith and a tremendous season a year ago A seven win improvement from the year before and the most wins for a Stanford team since the 2014 2015 season when they also had 21 And Benny Geler is bumped way outside Well Kyle Smith you know hes I call him the professor Hes hes hes able to do things you know uh analytically Hes always been ahead of the game uh he gets the most out of his players I mean what he did at Washington State was nothing short of remarkable Uh Pack 12 coach of the year one up there and uh you know just really played well Had had some really good seasons there Phenomenal last season before he came here to the farm but hes always done that And hes put together a veteran staff You know you talk about Eric Revano and Jim Shaw These are guys that have been coaching for years And Ive known these guys Theyre theyre respected as some of the top coaches in the country Danny Geler hits both free throws Now five of six to the line 12 points for the senior from San Pedro in Southern California and a 14point cushion for the Cardinal A three Terry Miller Jr and the last timeout for Portland State with 67 seconds remaining Roxy teams in the Big Sky are going to get a copy of this game and theyre going to see Portland State and theyre going to know that its nice to have guys that have been given opportunities Their time will come but when you when your team needs you you step up you do the job Thats what team basketballs all about Fullourt pressure for the Vikings 8473 Stanford as the Cardinal trying to win their 15th consecutive home opener And a foul before a second was able to tick off Yeah this lineup on the floor for Stanford you get you know get used to it because if theyre in a position that Kyle Smith and I joked about if if theyre up in games this lineup can salt games away Theyre these three guards theyre not going to make a lot of mistakes Theyre just not going to turn the ball over And I think theyre all very capable of knocking their free throws down Theyre 80 plus percent free throw shooters so that really works in Stanfords favor One more for Ibuka Okori Well you can now start thinking a little bit Roxy about our big matchup on Saturday in Montana That should be a heck heck of a match up here down the farm Two really good basketball teams Losing control Colt Ness leaking out Benny Geler The drop off and it falls off for Jeremy Dent Smith And it wouldnt go for Ibuka Okorei the lob and the layin Sebastian Tedor with 19 to lead Portland State Well Portland States not going away Roxy Theyre not going to probably get back in this game unless a miracle happens But theyre playing hard This team really gets after you And a foul before the inbound pass again on the Vikings And a hold And its on Kelsey Fipps Yeah No officials are trying to say Look thats a hold now Stop arguing But again you know youre talking about three veteran guards I mean you you two veteran guards and a freshman whos playing like a veteran Uh what a game hes had We I dont think we can talk about that enough I mean you mentioned setting a freshman record at Stanford Thats a feat But just when Stanford was struggling Roxy it was it was Abuka Aari that kept him and his team in this game Huge outing for the freshman 26 for Ibuka Okori tonight Seven rebounds as well for the freshman and Den Smith hits both I think well have an opportunity to interview this freshman Roxy Hes hes earned that Stay tuned Hes done everything else tonight Why shouldnt he talk Stay tuned Terry Miller Jr the drop off Sebastian Tedor hits another three Yeah you you you dont want to relax against this team Roxy Thank goodness for Stanford Theres enough time on the clock to hold out but if youre up on Portland State and you think the games over these guys can come back on you in a hurry I mean they really are showing you their arsenal of knocking down shots Tedor first Division One game tonight Couple of years at Ran State Community College in Tennessee and recruited to Portland State The Dallas Georgia native has had a strong effort tonight Six threes 22 points seven rebounds and a bright spot for Jace Coburn and Portland State with the performance of Tedor tonight Now this was a good game for them to come play Talk to coach and the staff I excellent game for them They they gave Stanford all they could handle and this will be a good game moving forward And a foul on the other end of the court A hold on Tedor as he grabbed and theyre calling a flagrant one I think Teddor he grabbed Aiden Cammon which means intentional two shots and the ball for Stanford a flagrant one Thats an automatic Yeah thats just an automatic They want to put somebody else to the line and you know its the old Hack Yeah but thats the only chance they have to get back in the game They they have to stop the clock Roxy and hope Stanford misses free throws So its worth a try But its two shots from Cam just a 48 foul shooter last year Thats why they wanted to foul him But the problem is it was not a basketball play They just grabbed him way away from the ball Yeah theres a way you can play but you know thats you know thats that that percentages dont lie And he came away with with one for two but like you say now he gets the ball out of bounds Thats not much of an advantage You gain the point and the possession So uh but this is you know this is what you have to do sometimes You stretch the game out you foul you hope teams miss free throws Got a smart play Blocks your friend Denny Geler and has his shot blocked and its out of bounds It belongs to Portland State and theres 128 remaining Well its a turnover Roxy but its a 30 second turnover You live with that Games over you just dont want to give it back But this is a good win for Stanford They played against a really game opponent in Portland State And there are a lot of teams not going to want to play this Portland State team But Stanford can come away also saying we we earned this one again Next up for the Cardinals a foul is called on Ibuka Okori and free throws for Portland State with 119 to go Again Stanford will play along with Portland State the other Big Sky favorite in Montana the Grizzer here on Saturday afternoon Well were very familiar with Montanas head coach Hes had quite a run at Montana former Cal assistant but done a great job there I mean his teams in the running every year and hes going to bring a really good basketball team here to into Stanford on Saturday afternoon Travis Dur who was a great point guard for Montana in his day and longtime assistant to Mike Montgomery Yeah they they really uh people around coaching know about coach Travis Duri Hes done a great job And the rebound last touch by Portland State 108 remaining 10point Stanford lead Again the Cardinal will win their 15th consecutive home opener Tonight wasnt easy Portland State and forcing Stanford to call timeout but it wasnt easy Portland State came in here and battled and made some runs Well they did And you know Roxy we need to give that some mention I think again 15 straight home games 15 straight home openers Home openers Thats Thats still pretty good And they went nine and one at home last year in the ACC Yeah No thats thats a good record And you know people would love to have that record at home And Stanford now will just look to milk the clock and watch the time tick off and the Cardinal 8979 Knockoff Portland State 15 consecutive home opening wins for the Stanford Cardinal and the freshman Ibuka Okori 26 points seven rebounds
