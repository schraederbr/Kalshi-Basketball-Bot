they dont just beat teams they beat you down and theyve scored 99 a game in their last three so a major test for a banged up struggling Miami team well see if the canes can give Duke a shot to start here they begin with the ball on this Tuesday night in Coral Gables no Matthew Cleveland for a second straight game for Miami they do have Lyn Kidd who is questionable with the ball right now finds AJ State McCrae and his threepointer off the rim will not go grabbed by KH kiple and down the floor comes Duke with a starting five that weve got to know so well James Proctor kiple flag and malat a Duke team 243 151 in the league their lone loss a couple of weeks ago at Clemson their other losses this year Kansas and Kentucky KH kiple opens the game with a three the dime for Cooper flag I think we know what KH kiple could do he showed us that early in the season but but youve seen the growth from malawat youve seen the growth in terms of the added responsibility for a guy like seon James and thats where this team really step to and do a higher level Divine uku freshman point guard freshman Jalil Betha with State McCrae Johnson and kid pre transfers for Miami no Cleveland not going to get Nigel pack back this year it doesnt seem rolling into Lin kid who has been a double double machine of late he feeds Johnson out of the double to three for UGA chuku is missed and the offensive rebound to Johnson into the body of Proctor tries to bounce at the kid to takeaway here is Tyrese Proctor flag canle same spot this time missed and its chased down by Duke proor all right lets not miss the fact that Cooper flag recognized Ken nipple hit his first shot who does he go right back to K nipple thats maturity right there 18 years old with maybe the highest IQ in the nation among basketball players he hits a three by the way hes a 40 student so his IQ on and off the court is Elite and its six nothing Duke hes like hes like a walking cliche to be honest and and I mean that in the nicest way possible flag up to 37 from three after struggling to start the year Betha misses a deep one in here comes proor second best offense in the country for Duke and a rare turnover here be Thea anticipated back from muku and Duke So Good In transition into kid hell score it over the top of followup the key with what Miami did was they they had a quick hitter they had space to throw the ball inside and there was nobody there to dig down Miamis going to have to capitalize early just quick hitters are probably the best way to score two one of the best shooting teams in the country kiple gets another great look hell fake out of it and then be fouled by state McCrae Milestone game for John shy its his 100th game as the Duke head coach 7821 record the best record through 99 games of any headit coach in ACC history and probably does not get enough credit as James turned it over committed a foul for how well he has maintained the standard set by Mike no Duke Coach has ever going to get enough credit for what they carry and what theyre responsible for Coach Kane never got enough credit for his greatness if anything that he was despised for how great he made that program and John sh is not going to get enough credit for carrying the responsibility the way he has to maintain the identity of the Duke program this Elite mindset in terms of doing everything right with discipline thats a thats a great responsibility that I dont think we really appreciate Johnson and the mod fighting for his own miss the tripped Away by canle and Johnsons whistled for the foul the hardest thing was John Shire was just like right in front of us so I couldnt say too much you know I wanted to be complimentary but you dont want to floss too much while hes sitting there you think hes listening you think hes paying attention to anything youre saying Im a loud talker man we could ask him right now Proctor driving and Proctors layup is good first bucket for the Junior from Sydney Australia thats a thats Proctor being the beneficiary of great balance on the floor meaning all five are a threat so youre not getting much help that that paint was wide open he attacked no contest on the layup now one point away from a thousand career Miami has scored the ball well this year but struggled in ACC just 16th in ACC games offensive efficiency but Thea out of control in the lane lost it and its a turnover Duke will take over Phill Courtney took over for Jim lenu stepped down one day after Christmas interim head coach in his 29th year as a college basketball coach awfully trying season for Miami 6 and 21 Jim Laren is stepping down before conference play even started kiple fading away left a short offensive rebound to malawat flag driving flag determined to get to the basket and there is just about nothing you can do when he has that level of determination know that and good footwork you know he wasnt out of control to the point where they pulled the chair he didnt travel just simple fundamental things he does at such an elite level hes got five of of 10 for the Blue Devils be Thea kid has a height advantage on Proctor will pass out of it ston McCrae way short and an air ball turns it back to Duke going to to be a let down after being Illinois by 43 doesnt look like it Duke has passed every test and they passed the opening 5 minutes or so lock it out and stay in the moment again no official word as flag sets up Patrick gungo who misses the dunk but multiple reports indicate that Jay Lucas will be the next head coach here at Miami after Jim Lena stepped down at the end of December so uh John what do you make of Jay Lucas what do you make of this situation its a bit of a strange one with Duke com its a very strange one and you got to look at it this way it definitely favors one team more than the other Duke is in the this this key point of of what should be a stretch run this is a final four National Championship level team you dont want any distractions you dont want it to be about anything other than this team in their potential right now for Miami that information coming out certainly helps right it gets some hope as to whats going on in the program and maybe start the process of of building a team so I think its unfortunate for Duke and I think John Shire was being very measured in his words 132 his team leads Tyrese Proctor had that last three and he has just gone over a th000 career points congratulations to the junior for hitting that Milestone State McCrae who hit a th000 on Saturday has it back defended by flag and Gung intercepts a pass down the floor with flag a bobble and and then a finish wow the body control up with the right finish with the left I going to stop saying wow but at the same time like its deserving thats six assists on six field goals and a 152 Duke lead flag gambles UGA chuku into gangba theres a foul against the Duke freshman Yeah you mentioned the assists and the way they share the basketball and they are so connected theyre so unselfish they really do play for one another which has been one of the more remarkable things when you consider the the young group that they have surrounded by experienced guys who are really checking boxes and the boxes are needs right role players with experienced guys it does remind me of that Anthony Davis National Championship team where you have a young group who is willing to grow together because of their unselfishness and I just think thats what continues week in week out to elevate the ceiling for this Duke program freshman Divine uku thought he might be a red shirt candidate this year but all the injuries hes become a regular starter hits both and its 154 Duke is 6 for9 Miami is one for six Isaiah Evans on the floor hes LED or coled Duke in scoring in the last two 17 in backto Back Games flag around a Gung M screen Evans knocked away and last Touch by Isaiah Evans good defensive play by ukuku shot preparation wasnt really there I think he looks up he realizes hes got space but when your feet arent set theres just less rhythm in the Music shot Kip Proctor will take a seat Caleb Foster who was awesome late in the second half gets some early playing time today James returns as well Miami with a freshman Austin and Schwarz Off the Bench Paul joob Bay as well sophomore from France Schwarz misses a three batted around by Kyrie huy and kept alive for a Jo Bay Applause finish Evans M Donalds AllAmerican freshman whos really come up live aate Duke with three freshman on the floor right now a sophomore and a senior in James heres Foster driving and spins in home eventually like waiting for gdau with that thing hanging on the rim Cooper flag was kind of in a camouflage roll right just staying off the ball he actually took himself out of the play which ultimately opened up the Baseline for Foster joh Shire might say the first Domino on that play you my bad told us that earlier today its all about being the first Domino of thats a pass a cut just taking up space I think my point was dont be the dont be the one that dou the no dont be the one that doesnt fall 10 of a second to go after the block by Patrick he is unavailable again today and Miami commits a shot clock violation they had a tenth of a second to go they could have tried to tip it in but they didnt so Cleveland missing a couple Nigel pack preseason First Team all ACC right there has been out since December 10th left knee issue theyve had a couple other injuries in addition but those are the two big ones of late and its just a season where Miamis great dreams of bringing experience together with some good young freshmen really were toppled from just a couple of games into the year leading to the resignation of their head coach Jim LGA I think its also just a reminder we talk about the reality of college basketball that its its year to year in so many ways I mean you see the banner 2023 that was just two years ago this is a final four and now youre just fighting for relevance to make possibly the ACC tournament I its its a challenge on a whole other level when you lose players like that Matthew Clevelands worked really hard I I did the Notre Dame game I I give him a lot of credit he fought to give his team an opportunity to pick up their first win in ACC play had a stretch of seven straight 20point games at one point Cleveland but he is out tonight Miami very underman eight scholarship players available in the game step back three Joe Bay and flag with a rebound after he had scored the last bucket Kimble says he going to stay with Miami thats what youre talking about that is how quickly things can change in this game winning is fragile in college basketball today why is that well I mean you look at the rules around free agency whatever you want to call it you know guys playing at four different schools going to the portal the second things dont work out asking for more money if they do winning is fragile in college basketball these days hugu chuku Scoops it inside theres a finish for Kyrie huy transfer from Idaho State well Jim Len mentioned some of the things that you just mentioned when he stepped down he said after we made it to the final four 18 months ago the first time I met with the players eight of them decided they were going to put their name in the portal and leave I said dont you like it here they said no I like it here its great but they had the opportunity to make money someplace else that was from Jim Arons final press conference here and you cant fault kids for it so so lets not say it should be any other way it just is what it is and and youve got a navigate the new challenges and hope that at some point theres some form of stability that gives you at least a framework or guidelines or boundaries that allow you to establish a system that works going forward well beus 3 makes it an eightpoint game and Evans three answers to balloon the lead back to 11 amazing what happens when you just break down in terms of your assignment you got to understand your personnel Evans wants to come off and shoot that three if you switch and dont switch up youre going to get beat Dukes best threepoint shooter at 46 freshman uku for the Freshman Schwarz very skilled shooter as well Evans stopped that one be Thea hoists it and scores it with a little glance down at the two bench I dont know if you want to take it that far I didnt know if he thought the shot clock was about to expire he got that thing up quickly well had he not he wouldnt have gotten the shot off cuz they closed hard W oh and freshman for freshman three for three punch for punch on these last few possessions yeah Im not sure if the Thea wants to wake up the Duke bench let alone the Five Guys on the floor evens is Ill tell you if youre not there hes chucking and I love every bit of it hes the kind of guy that if he gets into the game and hes hitting great keep feeding if he not so what you got 10 other dudes who can do it actually burst onto the scene with six first tap threes against Auburn December 4th but since then Dukes seen him grow as an allaround player defensively hes picked up things you saw him cutting and slashing in the Illinois game as well to the basket well you do certain things that almost forces a coach to look to play you more but then a coach can say these are the things you have to do if you want consistent minutes and hes answered the Bel du its six in a row for the field Miami three straight guku lost it knocked Away by Proctor you know thats the thing though you look at players that have great potential you know you could do a lot of little things really well its hard to get significant time you come out and hit six threes first half against alurn you almost have to play a guy but at that point the coach is going to say this is what weve got to focus on on making you better defensively this is what I need you to be if youre going to be such a threat from three I need you to move I need you to take guys with you I think hes hes really soaked up the coaching really well and hes been a great asset to this team Johnson tough catch for Schwarz hell fade back and miss a three thats tipped out by Lin kid Betha Johnson kid and malat re stays with Miami T to shoot Bea another deep one that was almost a really good possession offensively there was was so many good things even some interior post passing and then malawat just wipes it all away 72 eraser Evans oh boy wow Isaiah Evans with a look at the Miami bench this time it appears the Hurricanes of woken the giant the 66 freshman from fville North Carolina Bea actually strug Shrugged at his bench kind of like I was there and he was canle on the deck and hell be called for a foul as he ended up undercutting Johnson I mean that just elevating over the top I mean youre there hes there its a good contest hes all balanced defensively you would say for the most part if that shot doesnt go in you would commend the defense but the shot Falls and you feel like you should have done something different if anything you just have to run a guy like Evans off the threepoint line make him be a dribbler and you can say that all you want but you got to just play against it to figure out how to do it Proctor smacks that away back to uku you know you were a good player in high school when your jerseys retired and youre a college freshman thats Isaiah Evans Betha looking for a third three hes got it its a great opportunity for Betha to just learn how to be the guy its a responsibility thats hard for most players but but at this point hes got to be it why not maybe thats why not off the side of the glass I still like it well beas hit more threes today than the entire Illinois team did on Saturday they were two for 26 not going to hit that too another big block by maloos pretty good back and forth shooting here Duke by a do it on the road perfect from the field beas hit three threes its pretty impressive when you think about how much those guys have grown up since that picture right what they were playing against compared to what theyre up against now and the challenges they fac I mean theyre like young professionals quite literally were not going to use the cliche theyre not freshman anymore which every coach loves to say once the season gets to February but theyve been through a lot yeah kid scores it Lyn kid second theyre still freshman cuz they havent played in a postseason and theres nothing like what it takes with short prep to figure out who you are in a postseason situation win or go home situation nice drive by kiple Duke is 12 for 16 they have not missed consecutive shots in the first 13 minutes of this game I think the concept of that cliche is Ultimate like more is expected of you now but you still not what youre going to be once you get through the whole season which also includes potentially that that last game you lose kid from Johnson Working on malawat whos already blocked two got it on the rim and then James could Music control so Duke shooting 75 today here the previous three which included 100 pieces against both Stanford and Illinois and am measle 80 at Virginia though 80 at Virginias like scored 100 against anybody else with their Pace 99 a game shooting 57 oh nice catch by Paul Newman our statistician Cooper flag tip it right to Paul best hands just off the court tonight FIS at the lake behind his look nuts too look at Newman with the reaction how much is this guy getting paid ho step back three for Schwarz no and then James was out of bounds I think going back when you look at the Duke numbers you have to consider the fact that the reason why the numbers continue to get better and better as they get more and more familiar with one another they understand each others Tendencies they know when to get the heck out of the way when somebodys making a play they know how to feed the guy when hes starting to find it I just think the more you play together the more you know your team same goes for coaches the more you see guys play through Dynamics and kind of sometimes those playground Dynamics DC EST establish themselves just get better and better and thats what Dukes done six to shoot for Miami uuku cut off by malawat and oh boy they got bailed out by a kick there thatll reset the shot clock from 1 to 20 we had Duke wford very early in the year one of the things we talked about then this is such a skilled team great collection of talent can they give us something thats really fun to watch can they find this great aesthetic level of basketball this flow this Rhythm that we know can be there that you dont see much in college probably even better than we could have expected at that point and and frankly theres a part of me that believes if they were not as good defensively you might see more of it um I think theyre so stifling defensively they have to create their own Rhythm on offense the Thea flag just missed the the box out there Bea into the corner for Johnson an airball do you understand that point I do understand that like when youre so good on the defensive end you cover so much ground its hard you have to go ahead and turn around and create your own Rhythm offensive look Syracuse had to do that with their Zone Proctor pops it out of the air gets it back from kiple and leans in to draw a foul on Betha Tyrese Proctor with a steel and a chance for two at the line its Dukes third steal of the game six turnover just to put a cap on that point I want people to understand if youre a really good defensive team youre stifling you actually slow the game down to the point where its hard to get shots against you and then you have to get out and want to play fast and space the floor and create a good Rhythm offensively well its hard to do that when the game itself is lacking Rhythm because of the strength of your defense I hope that makes sense coming up at ESPN 2 after this game a super Tuesday top 25 match up for the SEC Mississippi State which is playing its 10th of 13 games against the top 25 team welcome to against number six Alabama Mark Sears backto back 30point games for the Crimson Tide another one of the most fun teams to watch in the nation should also say too like no question the SEC its ridiculous you know we say top to bottom it really bottom to top theres no easy night in the SEC T of top 25 teams but theres no guarantee that next year going to be like that theres just no guarantees I think thats what we should get excited about if the ACC want to get excited about no guarantees the SEC will be as good next year no no no like accs going to be better kid spinning and flushing ly kid has six did a good job feeling the defender on his back they werent sure if he was going to play took a hard fall on his back late in the Virginia Tech game game flag from gangba that three is Off the Mark kept Alive by gunga first consecutive misses of the game for Duke Joe Bay was out of bounds swipe it off would have cut the lead the nine but he was on the sideline Miamis done a good job fighting in this game you watch them on defense theyre scrambling well theyre late on some closeout Dukes getting some shots but all you ask this group to do is compete just go out and compete give yourselves a chance make plays Evans not sure what happened there maybe Jill B got a hand in there he didnt have the grip and Bea lays it in hes in the double Figures its a second time Evans has lost the ball on the way up down the floor to GBA got set kid was in position gunga gets his Miss and kid just Bear Hugs him as gunga rolls it home thats a timeout foul you know that right thats like I need a break foul you just kind of wrap up to say no no no no no timeout like in pickup thats what you do right when youre tired of fighting in a pickup game this is what you do if youre a l kid youre like no no Im tired just stop for a second problem is Gung is a beast and powerered through it everybody whos a like played at the YMCA knows exactly what Im talking about cuz cuz if you played at the YMCA its likely that youre not in the best shape possible and after 30 seconds in a possession youre done in need a break no the problem is you try to foul him before he gets the shot up the YMC you just and probably hell be tired enough too that hes not getting it on the rim either true Gung with a threepoint play 611 250 freshman Manasses Virginia lead is 13 for Duke 8 one on the road 15 one in the lead uko get that out out of here seon James into the front row I think thats another thing to point out with with Duke defending the ball you dont have to send secondary Defenders over to contest shots theyve got such great length at the guard position whatever that is anymore guard position six Cooper flag seon James these guys are monsters uhoh flag with a takeaway UGA chuku to defend thats smart a very smart foul by uku cuz he could have been on Tik Tock real soon six foul on Miami Duke will have possession when we come back in a 13point lead ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball presented by Progressive brought to you by Discover it pays to discover yes you are exactly right the problem is I never found a coach that was willing to just let me Chuck it where were you when I needed you coach oh that would have been great combination he never would have let me do it either proor great bounce pass from flag and flag follows after the rejection to his point though the guy thats willing to take tough shots is such a difficult matchup anytime hes out there you you cant help off of him you have to help up you got to play 30 ft out when you have so many other weapons on the floor I just think Isaiah Evans makes everybody elses game easier with the space he creates on the floor going B got position early on Betha who commits a foul his second you make a great play on defense you feel good about it maybe celebrate for a second Cooper flag comes downhill again I I got to give Miami credit they havent had Nigel pack no Matthew Cleveland question was whether L kid was going to play at all and theyre competing thats all you can ask it is just get out and compete and I think theres a part of this fan base right here that appreciates what theyre seeing in Duke they appreciate a high level basketball team in Koopa flag like your first pick of the draft and all that stuff but they also appreciate the fact that their team is competing against a great team and malawat just walked by hes huge right hes 72 250 and he feels every bit 722 G 15 lbs of muscle this season alone he looks great Schwarz freshman passes up a three Miamis 0 for eight and three outside of Betha whos gone three for six deep in the shot clock here swords from inside half court that is the shot clock violation you know what though great defense at least the shot clock violation allows you to get your defense set sometimes you take a bad shot late where its a long rebound run out or a turnover that leads to a dunk we say shot clock violation at least its not a turnover I mean technically its turnover but I get what youre saying whatever Evans uhoh Evans drills it he 43 in the first half so you watch that shot go down now pay attention next time down floor how far out they come and pick him up pay attention to anytime the balls driven his way theyre not leaving him goes down as another assist for flag is third flag and Evans have combined for 24 Miami is combined for 23 Schwarz over flag threes are getting deeper and deeper for Miami uku with another offensive rebound KS have 11 of those Joe Bay and he get hit from behind there by Cooper flag who is called for his first foul again the willingness to just catch and fire makes you so dangerous right a little good like a mini rub screen there kind of like westw ER running by gronowski like pick play and he just pops back somewhat flare and if youre not there hes catching and firing which means next time out youre not leaving him so then watch the driving lanes open up Evans in the last five halves hes played 12 for 16 from three and 47 points is that good thats good I just think its its the impact it has shotmakers have such an impact on a game and its far less about the three points that they put on the scoreboard fre throws good snaps a 100 du Brun by Joe B says the impact just the space they take up the attention that defense is have to pay him yes look it almost makes it to the point where you can play 404 oh boy gosh they are giving this guy any daylight thats a mistake they should be guarding Isaiah Evans from the moment he steps out of the hotel five for six from three hes got 16 in the first half and malawat knocked it out of bounds off of ug chuk move I mean thats thats ultimately on Miami to say hey I dont care dont let him catch it just Square I mean you cant I mean look youre going to switch you got to switch up into a shooter heres Proctor all alone missed it another great look from three Dukes now 8 for 13 from out there theyre up to 15 the country at threepoint percentage that number is going to jump after tonight Schwarz hoist Schwarz hits I think you look at those numbers for Duke though and you understand they get high percentage looks and they have a good Rhythm into their shot because of the playmakers all over the floor this is really smart Duke so good going two for one at the end of half they dont get the basket there uku tough Music finish T Valentine stops play as the ball was getting away the two for one is great because its something thats discussed everybody becomes aware of Duke does have a timeout here they use it or lose it going to wipe down the basketball Applause first and Duke will take the timeout like tyrs brought up in the tunnel so final possession of the half for Duke and malawat is fouled be a one and one Schwarz picks up his first Duke has been relatively healthy this year too well thats thats really helped because it helps you build continuity with the group you have it also helps you you develop rotations that you really like and almost identify new rotations you can play with based on different situations health health is a great thing to have because it actually gives you an idea of what youre really working with they dont have Malik Brown right now he dislocated his shoulder left shoulder in the first half against Virginia they would like to have him back for the ACC tournament yeah theyre confident that when he comes back it it wont take like the relearning curve isnt too bad hes been banged up a couple of times gunga miss the first couple of games of the year a left foot injury that had lingered coming into the season thats about it Mason Gillis missed a game with illness otherwise theyve been healthy hopefully theres nothing serious with Proctor and Duke will commit a foul they had some to give James second though they do a good job of staying out of foul trouble their ability to switch so many positions but scramble well they they rarely get too far behind the play they have one more to give Schwarz driving it floating and scor I tell you what pretty good first half for the Freshman Bean Schwarz near the end of the half at a couple of baskets but a great first half for the fres fought for 20 minutes but to do that for 40 it it is consuming in a variety of ways the cumulative effect of Dukes length the pressure they put on you with so many weapons on the offensive end I think thats ultimately what wears teams down so James with Evans canle flag at malat and seon James didnt take shot in that first half opens the scoring here in the second nice that they get him on that flare screen with a wide open side of the floor and allow him to make a play and be an impact early again no Matthew Cleveland tonight for Miami Lyn kid who is questionable is playing and kid around watch a fine finish he has eight Duke hustles it down the floor flag drives it into kid and malow watch will be called for a push off off in his first foul thats one like 6 months from now Cooper flag is going to kind of come to more of a power stop get body into the defender and finish and get that add one you can tell like as great as hes been theres still room its not an insult just means hes going to get better hes one of the five youngest players in college basketball this year as is his teammate malat who collects that rebound kiple from James and kiple stepped out of bounds so Duke turns it over for the seventh time wonder what percentage of times guys on the Baseline dribbling actually step out of bounds or like literally get shoved a bit Im going to go like 80 slight shove little hand check the good thing is you make a claim like that that really nobody could sh what percentage of those slight chubs are good defense versus actual fouls is the followup question Johnson three and canle with a rebound Duke 99 points a game in the last three on Pace for 94 based on their first half flag is fouled on the drive thats number two on Brandon Johnson Coopers parents are here tonight Ralph and Kelly and we saw them chatting up Kevin Love earlier Miami Heat player who was at the game tonight Kevin Love looks great too know was it La when he was a freshman at UCLA hows hows he lost weight since his freshman year kiple splashes a three the ninth for Duke KH kiple 38 threepoint shooter in a season High 25 against Miami the first time these teams met Duke won that game by 35 never Trail and they have not Trail tonight like con nis guy who came out earlier this season youre like wow man hes hes something else and Cooper flag just kind of did his thing and then every other game youd see someone new emerge whether its Isaiah Evans then you see the potential in seon James and Cooper flags just always there putting up numbers just so many weapons Evans step back James swats it theres ugu chuku at seven rebounds in that first half the Freshman point guard and that Balls thrown to nobody it was deflected you go through Trends with Duke players and I like to do that building boards how many games in a row in double figures shooting streaks there arent a ton with Duke because somebody will score double figures three in a row and then you know kiple will have three and theyll still win by 30 well the best teams the game determines who the best player is on that tonight now look Cooper flag is on a in a different category because he does a little bit of everything but Im talking about leading scores State McCrae wrapped it around for a bad Miss by Betha flag driving flag fouled flag Applause finishes like if youre going to double the post Isaiah Evans might be your leading score K kiple might be your lead leading scorer if youre going to let this guy dribble all the way to the block youre just dang in trouble like got to stop look simple things sometimes you you have to do the simplest things with against the best players stop the ball right see man see ball like maintain position keep yourself between your man and the basket like little things like that that that gives you the best chance possible against Superior players threepoint play for Cooper whos got 14 that was his first free throw attempt of the night uku who committed the foul dribbles himself right in into a mess James with a takeaway canle down to flag back to kiple driving malat hell finish four of the five Duke players touch the ball on that possession championship for their legendary head coach Freddy Johnson do you think they just drive around all day with with that all we do is win win win playing did we just have to pay for that cuz I kept saying I hope so not into kid working on malow watch kid is in all kinds of trouble got another Rim the other advantage that they have with malow watch is you dont really have to help you dont have to double really at all but you dont really have to help you just contest the shot its a tough shot you dont overh help you get the rebound you run out and go James thought about a three drives it malat tries to tip it in with the left hand heres UGA chuku hes got his ninth rebound Corner three for Schwarz Miami 4 for 20 Saturday Illinois did not hit a three for 24 minutes started the game 0 for 17 Evans three and a rare Miss just a second of the game from three kipo cleans it up and gets fouled what you think about that defensively that they rarely chase the play they got great length they communicate very well because they communicate well they scramble defensively as as good as anybody College in Miami all the way at NC State Saturday big win over W fars they get Syracuse tomorrow maybe Kevin keis team will get hot again I mean again go back to us talking about the 2023 final four Banner sitting up here I mean look at North Carolina State terms of the fragility of winning its its probably how its going to be and until things get changed in college basketball where theres at least some boundaries or I dont know some accountability as to what the foundations going to be and how to build a program let alone just a team meanwhile you have Lille which has basically become inverse Miami two years ago they were at the bottom not only of this league but of college basketball and now they look like a real tournament content seven seed right now according to Joe end of the shot clock kid I mean these offensive possessions there is just nothing going on I I think I think thats thats a good point though Louisville likely doesnt get enough credit for the way theyre playing and how good they are because the ACC is perceivably down right and granted I understand why but but we should be able to celebrate Louisville coming back from somewhat obscurity I mean frankly it felt like a circus there for a while Foster just into the game had it stolen by UGA chuku with a finish freshman has been a bright spot this year for Miami a year where they didnt even know if he would play out of Sugarland Texas on top of that Clemson deserves a little love Brad Brown L very respected coach in the game its good to see that team playing well I mean if we get Clemson Louisville in the ACC tournament semis which is certainly possible Clemsons never won the ACC Louisville was dead program the last couple of years talk about a matchup that would be uh of two teams who be so happy to be there I dont mean that as an insult two teams that would find such joy in the progress theyve made kiple off the inbound hits a three I think Carolina is a dangerous team you know theyve been trying all season to figure out how to be a small lineup how to play small and I think theyre starting to figure out youve got to have space on the floor hard to do with Elliot kadu at times and theyve started to find out how to play small In Pockets right not not consistently enough but theyve done it in pockets and it makes them dangerous they put up 90 plus again one at Florida State last night good win for them canle knocks it away from Schwarz actually that may have hit the underside of the basket so its a Miami turnover Sonic Blockbuster Saturday on ABC once again what a game we have in the SEC Janai brewman number one Auburn in Lexington to take on 17th ranked Kentucky one Eastern on ABC Auburn and absur 142 in Quad One games and that will be a great atmosphere for Mark Pops Kentucky Wildcats at home Janai brw right now seen as the likely runner up behind Cooper flag for National player they are both having just ins insane insane Seasons like just play 14 Quan One games sounds like torture how many more will they play too I mean I know they could play I dont know about 14 more 10 more between the SEC tournament NCA tournament end of the year is wild heres Foster and if tyres Proctor is going to be out and hes out for the rest of this game Caleb Foster becomes a really important player for Duke let go well you dont have to be tyres Proctor just like Isaiah Evans doesnt have to be tyres Proctor just be the best version of yourself Foster get in at the end of the game in the Illinois game scored 12 and seven minutes Betha with a tough shot High pointed by Johnson but the is screaming for the ball instead he finds Music kid kids an experience dude hes played a lot of basketball thats just going to be too easy good that is that is losing interest in the game if you get beat that badly no communication Im watching the body language from from Miami this second half hasnt been the same as they competed in the first Bea sets up Schwartz long two foul will go against Cooper flag here actually is going to go against Foster down below picks up his first and this has been one of the deals of Miami this year they have competed early in some games and then that we saw it against Virginia Tech Saturday have fallen apart late theyre obviously very underman they have eight scholarship players available with no Matthew Cleveland and ly Kidd B Courtney told us was really banged up and really wanted to play and worked hard to get out there tonight Hui cant finish defense go J to 20 to six run to start the half and James makes it 22 I mean I dont know how you stop that like great body control sit down good balance and then you just look at him and its a monster you do it by stopping the ball early thats again one of the mistakes Miamis made not stopping the ball get it inside the art first time was six to shoot Bea and another shot clock violation Duke has locked this thing down defensively 192 Duke Blue Devils I know in the crisen family growing up there was a Duke North Carolina divide yeah well Joe was a Duke fan so naturally I like Carolina Im sure uh Joe will be if not watching it live I dont know if Penn State plays on Saturday Im sure hell be checking that out your brother who assistant coach at Penn State right now especially that group Bobby Hurley who sewing to Bobby Hurley you know Jersey guy but I think we appreciate even even if I was a Carolina fan I appreciated greatness right like just want to watch some of the best play and perform and maybe this Duke team is in that rarified air as kiple finishes hes got 15 its early to say yet but you look at numbers Ken pomoys database offensive and defensive efficiencies kind of college basketball stats gospel Ken poms database goes back to 9697 this is the second highest net rating offensive and defensive efficiency of any college basketball team since 9697 the only better net rating 9899 Duke so I I know were still in February but thats just statistically cumulatively thats thats where this Duke team is at right now it doesnt tell you everything but it certainly points to something and that somethings pretty darn good its pretty darn balanced and its probably something that everybody out there would like to replicate if at all possible Darren Harris on the floor for the first time with under 11 to play and a tough shot made by state McCrae transfer from Samford who got to a th000 career points last game Paris another top recruit who barely plays on this team again no Tyrese Proctor he injured his left knee at the end of the first half hes out for the remainder of this game Foster James drives it had it taken away State McCrae with another Block its a five on four for Miami Betha hoists a three and before the shot betho is out of bounds so he has really struggled since hitting those three early threes body language is is something thats for real if I was a coach I would really focus I would do film sessions on bad body language kind of like the um what was Tony Robbins you are how you feel well in a way that your body language dictates a lot of what you do and how you do it on the basketball court right now Theas body language is pretty broken and I get why Mal watch knocked away from him and Ted Valentines got a foul somewhere in there its against Betha his third its hard to make a high percentage of shots if you mope right like we talk about having a short memory as a shooter you know you dont want to think about the last shot well you also dont want to carry frustration with you body language tells me a lot about a team not just the guys on the floor too guys on the bench ESPN Thursday Prime Time womens basketball double header Duke Carolina Cameron indor UNC 13 and3 in the league Duke 12 and four and then South Carolina rank six heads to Oxford take out a good old Miss team ESPN and the ESPN app Shake Shack shout for Shake Shack on the free throws here and malat goes one for two no Shake Shack for anybody that was the loudest these folks have gotten in I dont know tonight do you like the new trend now everybodys got if you know there miss free throws you get Shake Shack or ChickfilA or nuggets or something why is it always food in this country how about a headband shout for a headband is that what you want I dont know Im just saying something like what if it was hey Two Shots you get a Fitbit whos cheered for that amazing uh amazing promotion that would be probably more costly than a chicken sandwich that nobodys actually going to get theyre just a cheer for its the idea of getting something for free Kevin right if he misses two free throws I could I could get some fries well Virginia Tech does a dang slab of bacon St great for three did they I think its like like like whatever you call a pack of bacon I think you get a whole pack thats a big commitment thats serious like you take out an insurance policy for that type of commitment flag good F malat and Deni once again State McCrae with some good defense at The Rim Johnson for three airballs it grabbed by Joe Bay and he will miss it rebound to Flat 27 the lead for Duke facing Gillis pretty quiet game for him Harris no Gillis with a rebound Cooper bumped and no shot he is fouled beforehand its funny you say that about Mason Gill is that pretty quiet day for him its like yeah but his impacts different like sometimes hes going to get open threes and hell take him and you know you can knock him down but he does so many little things that make you a winning program that its impossible to point them all out and some of them are not even what you see in the game in the live game its a lot of what you see in the locker room the leadership the experience the guy came from a really successful kind of polished program like Purdue theres a lot for these young guys incredibly talented guys more talented guys than than Mason gills to learn from a guy like that go guys the mix of transfers they got seon James and Malik Brown who were hungry to win who had not been to NCA tour theres value in that and then theres value and Mason Gillis who made it to the national title game a year ago too its a variety of perspective persectives too you know its the roster creation is something that its probably the best job John shires done and then once you get him you have to figure out how to maximize the potential of the group I think theyve done a good job with that as well helps to have Cooper flag it went two for two there so no Shake Shack on those free throws no fitbits no headbands kid misses Im just thinking about whats the funniest possible giveaway he misses two free throws you get a free gym membership C nipple with a three Dukes 12th of the game God you want to talk about something no one Laughter uses if he misses two free throws your first week in Planet fitnesses on us the Judgment free zone bro boing malaw deflects it and a foul against ston McCrae Duke deflection Duke domination Duke demolition 77 have 13 here in the second flag the projected number one pick hes been that basically for year kiple has made himself into a projected Lottery Pick and he has some and uh there are more and more thoughts that Isaiah Evans could be an NBA Prospect as well with the way he shoots it with his size I mean frankly who is in an NBA prospect on this D team Malad too youre an NBA Prospect youre an NBA prospect its true though and I think whats remarkable is you kind of look down the the bench you say well whos the most important outside say Cooper flag and its its probably not another prospect its probably more rooll guys thats ultimately what is right now by the way yeah theyre in his Zone Mason Gillis at the back end of it State McCrae short its a great its a great chance to try things look at the length at the top of that zone though and just think about passing around that I want to see some diamond and one in the last seven minutes malok flushes flag with a fist pump his sixth assist and the big man with a second basket its just good thats just good playing right its not always running a good play its its good recognition K canle kind of screens down good flash good F Cooper flag can pass over the top of anything 16 is says 2 seven makes for Duke best assist rate since assist came an official statistic in 8384 they assist 60 of their B this is good stuff yeah good screen over here you know ly kids tired man he doesnt really fight over the top not enough ball pressure thats a good quick hitting action it also keeps a double away from Cooper flag and a nice elvation for flag malat and kiple who have probably seen their Knights come to an end flag with 16 kiple with 20 malawat with six four rebounds two Steals and a block and just altered a bunch of other shots too beia another tough take for him Miami just doesnt have really anybody who could facilitate the offense right now I bet fans want to not like Cooper flag its just hard not to appreciate it you know he just competes doesnt really send it in your face and I think you appreciate the way he plays Harris driving knocked Away by uku patha back for Johnson hell lay it in its good to keep competing if youre Miami I mean thats I know it sounds like oh simple just go compete its harder than you understand when you consider the fact that your entire identity as a student athlete maybe not everybody but your entire identity is kind of rooted in what you do and the outcomes you can create on the basketball Club its tough going by a nice little wrap around Foster Patrick gungo with nine I mean Miamis lost his coach Jima resigns theyre not going to make the ACC tournament probably unless they win out that doesnt appear as it its going to happen so youre left in kind of basketball limbo here State McCrae you know theres a new coach coming in reportedly its one of the guys on the other sideline Jay Lucas for Duke I dont know which of these players are going to come back Ted Valen time just the floor after tripped up just Johnson up top and a nice finish by be theres a highlight for the Hurricanes well Paul cells on Saturday in the Duke game got tripped up by a fan so Im hoping we dont have another referee incident here injury incident yeah Ted Valentine going full parkour on us parkour Gillis banks in a three number 13 for Duke maybe not by Design there off the glass but tell you when hes making shots hes another weapon as a floor spacer again hard to help off of and typically in his role if hes on the floor hes the guy you would help off of and Miami the worst threepoint defense in college basketball this year 39 Evan prives it Duke has hit 62 from three today 13 to 21 the 1 time Miamis allowed double digit threes I also think Duke can play a little more freely on the offensive end because they trust their ability to defend the more you trust what you can do on the defensive end the more you free yourself up to play confidently on offense Lyn kid again battling through injury today gotten it out 14 for Miami at 29 minutes played I know Bill Courtney really appreciates that l kid did the work to get on the floor today you can see him labored a bit as the games gone on Foster another step back three Fosters two for two from deep I mean these are like Applause layups Dukes largest lead in ACC play this year how about that kid it was 8954 for the first time these teams played and itll be 8954 if late kid its a free course their dad Carlos national champion at Duke and our colleague with the ACC Network yeah I think the recipes there to bring in big time talent to be a part of that Brotherhood they have a Duke frankly its like a lineage Gillis misses a three you bring in young talent and find the right people in the transfer I mean the not just the right players the right people and and theyve got that right now I say Mason Gillis Malik Brown seon James they got the right people skill sets there yes but you got to be the right people to play the role correctly John sh told us today Id really like to just get one transfer year in the future now he may lose half his team the NBA need more than that sounds ideal Foster Strokes a jumper Duke is in the 90 again well maybe what hes saying is I wish I didnt have to you know lose five guys every year that I need to replace but its just its the reality that these days huy on the lob Corner three for State McCrae under two to play Fs got Cameron Sheffield off the on the floor number 13 in the corner previously played at rice and heres Sheffield with the ball as it knocked away Ugo chuku gets tripped up by Foster dont forget next up on ESPN two big one in the SEC Alabama and Mississippi State Mark Sears Josh Huard two of the best scorers in the SEC thats Z run ESPN 2 heard the uh George of Florida scores Mickey Harrisons in the house owner of the heat the Georgia florame Georgia was up 26 down to seven would be a major upset in the SEC Georgia squarely on the bubble yep that game is on SEC network right now Gillis with another takeaway thats Dukes 20th a new season high and Gillis misses a three well Duke may not get to 100 again tonight huls lob and J is there to push it back in somewhere along the lines here in the second half it kind of became a little pickup offall and John Shire did the right thing and getting some of his guys out of that game I said that thats when thats when guys get hurt you got to be careful talked earlier about Tyrese Proctor out left knee injury has not returned to the bench shefield for three it was Spencer hubard at the end of the game that againsts still anoy its Cameron Sheffield the graduate student here at of Aletta Georgia his first threepointer in two years my man behind whos been yelling the whole game in favor of Duke is saying yeah I dont even know who you are God bless him I dont know if people could hear him they probably could based on the fact that hes breaking the Guinness World Record for decb 9458 did find out hes an orthopedic surgeon and another Jersey guy of course thats right Dukes next game Saturday Florida State thatll be an ACC netw night game then Wake Forest on big Monday and then they go two Carolina in the regular season finale so fun stretch run for Duke Gillis is fouled which is exactly what Miami wants to see with 127 to go and free throws coming the foul against Paul joob B how about this for Duke go this is the sixth time in the last eight games where Duke has not trailed and in one of the two games where they did Trail they Trail Virginia for a minute 54 the only other game in that search is the loss at Clemson but six of the last St on they havent trailed for even a second I think its hard look its impossible to be perfect right we understand its impossible to be perfect I think its hard to keep getting better without having some struggles so its not a bad thing that they go they lose that game they kind of regroup and figure out how to get a little bit better its hard to keep finding ways to improve when you win by 40 38 the margin right now Duke forces a season High 20 turnovers theres a rem rocker by Joe Bay pardon his French 9760 your final score Duke averaging 99 a game in the last three they get to 97 tonight and they keep on rolling 60
