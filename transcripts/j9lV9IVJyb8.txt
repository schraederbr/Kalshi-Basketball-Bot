change aside Clarence Armstrong Ted Valentine are the officials Lively and omir on the chip and its Duke ball to get it started Applause and the Freshman Tyrese Proctor whos been doing the bulk of the ball handling and has been doing an outstanding job in the recent weeks Jeremy roach moving off the ball more into more of a scores role recently for the Blue Devils but hard Hedges to start the game and any time that Derek Lively is second sets a ball screen hes going to exit out of that ball screen quickly so if you stay on the ball too long youd better have a good rotation Lively took advantage of a slower one outstanding starting five Isaiah Wong you know he was the player of the year in the league dont forget about Jordan Millers second Team all ACC does a little bit of everything and does it awfully well the turnaround goes for Wong Isaiah Wong is not the only one on this Miami team but hes as good as anybody at creating his own shot Jeremy roach and Four Freshmen in the starting lineup for Duke Kyle filipowski despite rolling his ankle last night scored 22 points in only 16 minutes they ran away from Pittsburgh so quickly that John Shire got a chance to rest filipowski down the stretch a bit and everybody in Blue Devils Nation happy to see him out there starting the game tonight Duke early on trying to get ball reversal and then theyre going into the post Duke is a bigger team theyre bigger and longer Jim larenega at shoot around today talked about defending the rim they even worked on freethrow blockouts today because of Dukes outstanding ability as an offensive rebounding group and even if you get a good block out Duke can reach over the top and tap it back and you always have to be aware of that Mark Mitchell is 77 free throw shooter missed them both and now we have an injury Shadowmere is down he rolled looked like he rolled that right ankle boy and that has happened its happened to four or five different players in this tournament unfortunately just in a wrong place to the wrong time landing on somebody elses foot and this is a tremendously important player for the Hurricanes theyre starting fiveman in North Shadowmere just on a simple missed free throw and barely a minute into the game and it looked like it was his right ankle and it probably came down on somebodys foot yeah I came down on Derek Lively the second foot and rolled it over and that can obviously be very painful and its really scary for a player again we just mentioned a similar thing happen to Kyle filipowski last night a couple of Florida State Seminoles had it happened to them its one of these things Armando baycod had it happen to him earlier in the tournaments Matthew Cleveland uh one of the Florida State players who had it but unfortunately omir at least at this point not putting any weight on that foot getting help to the bench and theyll have a closer look at it but that is a very tough start for Miami in this game and North Shadowmere third in the ACC in both rebounding and offensive rebounding averages about 10 rebounds a game close to three and a half offensive rebounds a game and hes sixth in the league in Block shots well that is a a costly injury to start this game for Miami so Anthony Walker a 69 junior is into the game hes actually a little bit taller than omir but hes not nearly the inside physical presence or rebounder that OMeara so its a much different looking group right now for the hurricanes on the drive Scoops it up and in pretty reverse well you have to keep looking Poplar away from that right hand drive he is a strong right driver and I think basketball fans will remember that Big Time righthanded Drive dunk that he had in Coral Gables against Duke and Walker is called for the foul stepping out to hedge lookup Poplar is an unbelievable athlete and an Above the Rim finisher but just using the rim to Shield off the blocked shot from Derek Lively the second coming from the backside he is the only starter for the Hurricanes averaging fewer than 13 points per game and hes got a lot more in him than that he averages eight its just hes playing with a lot of very talented experienced offensive players as philipowski has called for a travel good job there by Jordan Miller the Lefty hes given up some size to Kyle filipowski but hes such a fundamentally sound Defender hes fundamentally sound in every aspect of the game and you could argue that youre looking at a first team all ACC player and Jordan Miller that may be the best player in the league Jim larenegger a few weeks ago said he felt he was the most underrated player not in a conference in the country and he started to get more recognition in recent weeks as Wong dribbles it off his own foot but its stolen by Poplar only to come up short in the last game these two teams played Duke turned it over 21 times and 10 of those 21 turnovers came from Tyrese Proctor and Jeremy Roach and philipowski just using his Superior size and strength to bowl his way to the rim and to thank for the first month of practice the Duke coaching staff is a little worried that Kyle filipowski was not physical enough hes overcome any of those concerns meanwhile again this does not look good at all for norchad omir and we will try to get more for you weve got an update now heres Holly well no chat or May or very carefully we want to make sure that they get in get in three of that I did read the lips of the athletic trainer they dont think its broken but they do definitely want to get better Imaging and take a better look at that so he will not play tonight but well keep you posted if hes able to play tomorrow if they were to win boy what a shame a terrific player tremendously popular with his teammates a transfer from Arkansas state was the Sun Belt Conference Player of the Year and defensive player of the year and again only quote only six seven J but is tough and physical and hardnosed as you get in this conference thats a big loss for the hurricane well he gets deep post position hes a terrific lob threat hes got a Miamis version of bam out of bio and to have him out of the game is a really big blow to Miami yeah they dont have a backup center if you will again they bring in Walker but hes really kind of a wing its really a five out situation right now for the hurricane and it gives them an opportunity to spread the floor and attack but the the biggest concerns on the defensive end Miller well he got by philipowski but he couldnt get by Lively Derek Lively the second is so active his length his athleticism his ability to recover a guy who over his last 14 games has blocked 41 Shots including eighth against North Carolina member of the accs all defensive team what a great matchup between Wong and Tyrese Proctor professionally hes a great defender long a little strong and a long jumper and its down to Mitchell Mark Mitchell quietly has been playing some very good basketball in recent games for the Blue Devils shooting at a high percentage double figures score another reason why they come in here having won seven in a row Applause so good out of that short roll that was an excellent pass out of the short roll he gets out of the ball screen action quickly and Tyrese Proctor is really starting to shoot it hes always been a good shooter didnt start off shooting it well this season but talk about a player improving throughout the course of the year only 18 years old and to your point 31 from three on the season but 40 percent in his last 14 games and now roach is down no call was made but I think the referees are going to look at this and see if that was a basketball play he took one in the chops Isaiah Wong got him in the chin or the nose well get another look going with a break with a Timeout on the floor and well see if the officials that Jay mentioned are going to have a look at it as well on the Move by Isaiah Wong right there the right elbow into the face of roach before he went up and made the basket question is whether it was excessive there was no call on this play but after looking at it Jay they have decided that is a flagrant one on Isaiah Wong yeah I think the determination was made they felt it was excessive I dont know where they looked whether the defender was in the cylinder all that stuff but uh whatever they decided its two shots for Duke and go back to Duke having the ball after the score but the basket count right thats one thing we were discussing amongst ourselves the basket still does count for Wong roach makes him vote so Duke by two and theyve got the ball and Proctor brings him into the front Court guarded by Nigel pack you have to think Dukes going to want to attack inside without omir being in the game will take advantage of their size the lepowski spins and turns it over Miami in transition packed for three and phillipowski down with the rebound for the Blue Devils a great opportunity for Miami in transition just mishandled the ball on that pass to Isaiah long Miller deflects it and its out of bounds to Miami Jordan Miller doing a nice job defending philipowski down on the Block and thats the fourth Duke turnover already even though Miller is giving up a lot of size and weight hes using his quickness and hes breaking contact with philipowski when an offensive post player gets contact into the defender the offensive player has a huge Advantage if he can break that contact and use your quickness and get around Poplar or you see athletic but he lost it off his fingertips knew that Miami was going to retain possession so he just kind of shielded off a couple of Duke players Derek Lively comes over and he does a good job of using his chest to go into the offensive player and with his length and presence you always know where where he is Whitehead is checked into the game for Duke philipowskis gone to the bench shot blocks at four long over Lively and white head down with a rebound Whitehead is a player you have to be with him on the catch hes the best threepoint shooter on the floor 41 on the season despite a couple of injuries this year that have cost him a total of eight games Dr finds him close out by Wong right hand will score anyway hes taking it into the paint he is a bucket getter talk about a versatile player he can knock it down from Deep he can drive it hes strong athletic Applause whos a difficult cover Duke by four six minutes in the Blue Devils have won seven in a row and are clearly playing their best basketball of the Season Millers surrounded finds Poplar boy Miami Jay has had some pretty good looks that they havent been able to knock down the Tariq Whitehead was injured early on in the season but he just Fades to the corner gives a little juke move and gets in with that lefthanded Drive hes a threelevel score he can get to the rim he can shoot from the midrange and hes got deep range as a threepoint shooter and hes battle tested he played some highlevel basketball as a high school player Harlan Beverly has made his first appearance of the game for the Hurricanes fourth year Junior out of Detroit and also number four Bensley Joseph hes a real Bulldog very good tenacious defensive player back up point guard for Miami what a split roach to kick Proctor of the three duke by seven but what a difference in Tyrese Proctor in his last 16 games hes averaging over 11 points a game shooting about 38 from three but theres no hesitation now when he gets the ball hes got some room hes putting it up boy a Top Shot over a couple of Duke Defenders thats who he is hes just a tough shot maker his middle game is so impressive 16 points per game to lead a balanced Miami attack this season right hit driving again Mitchell cleans it up but cant finish it the Duke is really lifting up the Miami defense Beverly turns it over Whitehead excuse me Derek Lively the second cause that with his presence that would have been a shot that you would think that Beverly would take to the rim every time but he I was a little bit worried about getting it wiped away it took widely a while to get going this season but hes turned into one of the better defensive big manic in the nation the last couple of months Applause Music Jeremy roach is really good off ball screen situation to give him a little bit of room on the Hedge Walker comes out a little bit too far doesnt stay connected and then Tyrese Proctor was ready to shoot as soon as that ball arrived and there arent many players in the country going to go up against the shot blocker like Derek Lively the second and have that ability to get that shot up and over the top his body control Isaiah wands is just so good Jacob grandison and Ryan young a couple of grad transfers in Off the Bench for Duke now Young And Touch and threw it out of bounds a little miscommunication between him and roach fifth turnovers committed by the Blue Devils and Ryan young had one and one in the post he should have just backed his Defender down and taking that instead of passing it out you know if the second Defender comes at you then pass it out both of these teams obviously securely in the tournament Joe linardi has both of them as a five seed right now so each of them with a chance to move up you would imagine if they could win tonight and then maybe win a championship tomorrow is Jordan Miller makes a bit of an off balance shot but look comfortable doing it to bring Miami back within three he was completely in control of that that was novitsky tied up off one leg Jim larenegas who said raving about his fundamentals shooting passion dribbling anything that needs to be done he does well Granderson and Miller the rebound well you knew that Dukes defense is going to be really good in this tournament but their offense has been so impressive Joseph in off Off the Bench and he ties it up with a three and that early offense is going to be important for Miami to come down if you get a look in transition take it because its probably better than what youre going to get later on against Dukes defense with their length roach hops stepping into the paint and here come the kings in transition looking for the lead off the rim from Beverly Tracked Down in the corner by Young another opportunity Miamis had three or four really good looks that havent gone so far well theyre doing a great job of pushing the ball in transition after they get a rebound great post out by Young and a pretty good job by AJ Casey not to foul a little hesitation and it goes for long then he got a foul on yeah Wong is okay Miamis got the lead and hell be at the freethrow line with a week come back its a 90 run right now for the hurricanes well Jordan Miller theres an outstanding offensive rebounder hes 67 just a really pretty shot the Lefty off the right foot and then Bensley Joseph in transition pulling up from Deep Miami journey in life and doing it at seven feet tall looks like both is on a pretty successful Journey Kyle filipowski certainly appears to be on his way to a career in the NBA and if youre a seven foot freshman with good enough ability to play to school as good as Harvard theyre going to have some opportunities coming your way as well shot clock at three Casey got it off but didnt draw Iron and a shot clock violation on the canes Applause Jordan Miller still guarding pal filipowski Applause and the philippowski can duck into Lane get a little cross screen 67195 guarding seven foot 2 30 Applause and thats why philipowski is going strong to the rim every chance he gets well they got him in the middle of the floor and phillipowskis really good on that short roll and oftentimes when a big guy sets a ball screen theyre going to roll all the way to the basket a hard roll to the rim but philipowski can roll short catch it and then be a playmaker from there for himself or others so theyll hit him short rather than wait for him to get all the way to the rim so watch him set this ball screen hell get out early and hit him with the short roll and he was able to get all the way to the basket using that space But you try to you know stunt at him and slow him down or you have to commit if you want to commit then he can make that pass to the open shooter Applause I know out of seven Footers that theyre hitting on short roll shovel pass to Lively extra pass to Mitchell now theyll work on their spacing a bit philipowski when he gets the ball in a relocation pass you always have to be concerned about his initial shot pay soft charge just always under control you just cant seem to speed up Tyrese Proctor well he he plays at a pace that the situation requires if he needs to blast off that ball screen to get to the rim he will if he needs to take his time hell do that so he can make the right read lets look at Poplar with a corner three in Miami back on top and Miami does such a great job of spreading the floor and even though theyve got so many shot shot makers they are really good at sharing the ball they average about 15 assists per game and statistically and in terms of a lot of numbers of the efficiency numbers of 10 Palm as well Miami the best offensive team in the ACC this year but Duke goes back on top of the three from Jeremy or along two excuse me from Jeremy roach I think the officials are getting concerned when players are making baskets theyre looking at the other badges you might see something happen there when uh when Jeremy roach made that he had something to say to the Miami bench it was right up there I think well look at Poplar when he knocked that shot down had something to say Nigel Packers got unbelievable range with a deep three to put Miami back on top this is a tough group there without one of their best players right now in North Chad omear out for the night if you werent with us twisted his ankle looked pretty bad in the first minute of the game he will not return but this is a a veteran together confident group while hes seeking to move into the championship game tomorrow night and anytime a player goes down you know everybody says next man up mentality but it gives others an opportunity to step in and play Troy Mitchell shot that with confidence Jimmy and hes been doing everything with confidence over the last half of the season and especially as you mentioned his last five games hes shooting about 57 percent from the field averaging 13 points in Miami giving up size at every spot on the floor look how far out they run their offense that gives him a lot of room just takes multiple dribbles to get to the basket but this team can really score will bring it over nobodys gardening Mitchell and that cost the Hurricanes Jim larenaga cant be happy with that you want to pick up the ball but I think Mitchell even got hit when he went up and still completed the play so five quick coins for Mitchell to put Duke on top by three I think does such a good job with their defense theyre not a turnover forcing team that gets out in passing Lanes but they really protect the paint it is tough to get to the basket against this crew Nigel Pax going to try and hes going to succeed well a creative finish over Derek Lively the second I mean just getting to the rim isnt enough youre going to have to do something creative to get it over or around these shot blockers Isaiah Wongs been waiting to check back in for several minutes we havent had a whistle in a while but Miamis still right there just down by one here Lively knocked Away by Casey got it back and finishes well thats where knocking it away might not have been the best idea what a finish by Derek Lively II with his maturation as a player he was the number one rated player out of high score had an injury to start the season didnt have much continuity but his maturations really been impressive and John shires patience to bring him along hes turned into a a really confident player a little bit Poplar having to take Kyle filipowski thats a tough cover hes trying to front him and now hes got rich and I switch back so Millers got him nice play by Casey bounces back to Lively Mitchell again hes got eight going to think that shooting was a question mark for this Duke team the last two games they have been Deadeye Shooters yeah they put 96 up on Pittsburgh yesterday shot 62 percent and said an ACC tournament record with 27 assists in the game foreign by Mitchell but then he lost it right back to the Hurricanes Miller wide open and buries a three when Miami just makes you pay off any sort of broken play situation its a great awareness of where their teammates are on the court this is a a willing passing team and weve gone about five minutes I think without a whistle forces it up and in its got a unique ability to drop contact and still finish plays hes not an explosive leaper but he is strong Joseph his second three of the ninth and again its a onepoint game Bensley Joseph shoots 38 percent from three now hes made 31 of them on the season what a steal how about that play and hell finish Bensley Joseph outstanding tonight Off the Bench for the Hurricanes the ninth lead change of the game already and Miami is back on top Bensley Joseph is nowhere near as big as norchado mirror but he has had a big impact thus far in this game terrific job getting that left hand in the passing Lane getting the deflection and taking it the other way for the finish in Miami feeling it semi Kansas Iowa State all Kansas early Kansas offense clicking on all cylinders versus a tough Iowa State D over the Big East semifinal Marquette Yukon this one is delivered coach and its an offensive shootout Alex Caravan with a corner three tied at half lets take it back to the fellas Dan and Jay in Greensboro Jordan could have sworn I saw you here yesterday now back in the studio anchoring our coverage to look at the SEC mens tournament a couple of quarterfinals have been played tonight Alabama and Missouri have it Advanced a m Arkansas going on in the SEC network Kentucky and Vandy if Vandy can get that one how about the kind of the second half of the season the Jerry stackhouses team has Jerry Stackhouse is a great coach I mean I dont think anybody in the SEC if the country runs better stuff offensively than Stackhouse puts together roach has it knocked away do you Dan think that uh that Wojo and Tom crean have had enough of hearing about Jordan cornette being the alltime leading shot blocker at Notre Dame has that come up every now that might have been that might have been the first segment done in the studio without Jordan mentioning that discuss amongst yourselves fellas how about Reese Davis and his Don Draper suit Ryan Young couldnt finish it but he will head to the line for two River iray who is into the game for Miami a guy who plays sparingly but again nor Chad omir suffering an ankle injury in the first minute of the game will not return so Jim larenegas kind of trying to Bob and weave his way through it with different lineup combinations to see what works just trying to steal minutes wherever he can and get some of his uh his Prime Time Players a little bit more rest when he can Hollywood news well guys good omir had an xray here on site and there is no break in that ankle so really positive news see if he can return here quickly so it wont play tonight remains to be seen if Miami plays tomorrow but obviously they have to win tonights play tomorrow but really if youre the hurricane shes got to be thinking about the NCAA tournament and just hoping that omir can get back as close to 100 as possible for that yeah the bigger picture and really the issue is going to be ligament damage is there any a missed by Walker Applause no philipowski no Lively in the game right now for the Blue Devils deflected by Walker shot clock didnt reset its down to nine Whitehead steps in around and out young the offensive rebound that is his greatest skill and a held ball is the call no basket a held ball and the possession arrow gives it to the hurricane that was just a fantastic play by Nigel pack to get a hand on that ball and youre right Ryan young one of the best offensive rebounders in the country seventh in the league close to three per game and he gets it on short minutes is it just for you know being in the right place at the right time what makes a guy whos not a great leaper a great offensive rebound well he gets one he gets great position so he follows the Flight of the ball and he positions himself in order to to be in the area of a rebound I wouldnt say hes an outside of his area rebounder but most of the the best offensive rebounders are really smart with the way they play the Flight of the ball you know a shot comes from the right corner you position yourself on the left side because most of the corner shots are going to go long things like that thats why Bob Huggins you know you have the shots on the right side he gets his offensive rebounders to the left side of the basket boy pretty uh tough play there from Walker he just kind of nudged filipowski out of the way made the basket as filipowski argued for an offensive foul when youre playing against physical defense you have to be physical on offense thats the only way youre going to combat physical defense and the foul in the corner on Wong and Isaiah Wong is saying that Whitehead kicked his legs out Applause I think Derek Whitehead is one of those players you shouldnt have to close out to him you should be there already and he did kick his legs out a little bit but it was more in his natural shooting motion I would say very little contact but still you have to give the player the opportunity to land oh the white head at the line the second foul on Wong and it looks like hes going to be coming out well find out after the next free throw Music and indeed Jim Miller and anger will sit him presumably for the rest of the half as Joseph comes back in Applause Josephs been outstanding tonight and limited minutes off the bench for Miami it was so fast with the ball Miamis done a good job in limited opportunity to get the ball up towards quickly Whitehead knocks all three of them down Joseph only averages about Five Points a game hes already got eight Miami ball 17 on the shot clock forget our second semifinal tonight Clemson and Virginia the top four seeds advancing to the semifinals Virginia won the only regular season matchup it was just 10 days ago beat him by seven in Charlottesville Poplar slipped somehow found Walker shot clock at five Walker gets it off chipped out by Joseph but it finds Whitehead and the Blue Devil Ill tell you Joseph sticks his nose in there and rebounds at both ends of the court and if he cant get it hes going to knock it away just a sophomore from Arlington Mass Applause a really good job by Jordan Miller a fighting Kyle phillipowski for that low cost Proctor no Lively yes when you go to block a shot that is going to open up the offensive glass for Derek Lively the second you have to get a rotation right into his body easy to say hard to do timeout Jim larranega one more look at the Lively dump his second dunk of the night Jumping Jim larenegger did not want to see happen tonight fires up the Blue Devils fires up the crowd Dukes lead is four last minute of the half that means they get the ball first to start the second half so if Miami can get a score and a stop but if Duke can get a stop and a score this game looks a little bit different Miller driving on Whitehead turn around got it wow what a play its the big time individual play that was well defended that was just big time offense against really good defense three years George Mason and now two with the Hurricanes Whitehead no filipowski with a rebound Whitehead again and he got this one like clockwork offensive rebound leads to an open three the best time to shoot a three five or six second difference between the game clock and the shot clock here at the end of the half and Miami can take it all the way down to zero before they shoot it on the shot clock and still have time for an offensive rebound opportunity Dukes fans getting to their feet here in the Greensboro Millers got to force it up three seconds Proctor from 65 feet away wide ride and an entertaining first half comes to a close with the Blue Devils holding a fivepoint lead on the hurricanes always some good shooting in this game well coach youve got a noticeable size Advantage inside how do you take advantage of that well theyre theyre very physical theyre very athletic they make it hard for you to pass it inside but we need to continue to do it as a strength of ours I thought we had some big time rebounds uh to really cut the lead cut the lead down and then to get the lead and thats something were going to have to do here in the second half they have some guys that just keep hitting clutch shots in Miller and Wong what do you do defensively on those two in particular stay the course theyre really good players theyve had some big time shots the Big Time Players the biggest thing we cant give them run out some transitions well those two really good players Miller and Wong combining for a bucket for Miami and Proctor just answered with a three on a great pass from phillipowski yeah Kyle felipowski was a terrific job along the Baseline by Nigel Pratt to cut off philipowski but he had to run a long distance to get to Tyrese Proctor and hit another open three now Lively kicks it out to Mitchell who draws the foul the assist for philipowski by the way his fourth of the game already hes got a tremendous skill set for a guy as big and as young as he is and as we know North Shadowmere is not going to play again tonight now he is back out of the bench came out just a minute or so ago with that right ankle heavily wrapped up and if youre a Miami fan all youre thinking about is hoping that the medical staff can get him ready for Thursday or Friday whenever Miami begins its running the NCAA tournament without Amir in this game youre without an outstanding rebounder that gets you doubledigit rebounds every game and against Duke and with two games before this one he was averaging 13 points 12 rebounds and a couple of blocks Miami last year got into the dance as a 10 seed and went all the way to the elite eight again this is a tough experienced group were hoping romier is going to be healthy in the next few days long with a deep three to get him back within five and an excellent Defender Tyrese Proctor was right with him got a hand up but youre worried not only about the shot with Isaiah long but the drive talk about a threelevel score one only played 11 minutes from the first half missed a couple of minutes at the end after picking up a second foul but sat at the scores table for over five minutes while the game went on without a whistle just one of those things now well win three from Wooga Poplar and theyre back within two well you go for that ball and Jordan Miller comes away with it and Duke has to keep Miami out of the open floor they are really dangerous when they get ahead of steam and its not just running to the rim they run to the threepoint line Anthony Walker getting the start in the second half in effect the fiveman although hes not really but that means hes got a deal with Derrick lightly the second who shows some nice touch and Derek Lively at this size hes not getting into wrestling matches in the low post he uses his quickness good pass out Walker wide open this is the three in filipowski down to the rebound for Duke I think Anthony Walker when hes in there hes going to have to act as a screener because Derek gladly is not staying with him so hes not going out to guard him so he needs to set some screens and free up his teammates yeah Walker just two for 20 from threepoint range on the season deflected but philipowski just too big but Duke did a really nice job when philipowski was being fronted by Jordan Miller they just got the ball to the right angle you dont try to force it in from one spot get it to the angle where you can feed him and he can just hold the defender off Applause boy Miller just so Shifty and creative in there lost Mitchell just long enough theres not enough pressure on the ball to take away vision and youre right Miller behind the defense just cut right to the other side of the basket and then used that shot fake to get now look Miller Millers trying to get around in front so just throw the ball to the right angle to go high low just really smart by Mark Mitchell to get the ball to Derrick Lively the second to make that pass thats a hockey assist right there for Mitchell I really think basketball should do that absolutely but before they do that give a guy an assist when the shooter gets fouled and makes it yes thats true well they shouldnt even have to make the free throw isnt the quality to pass the issue rather than what if a guy misses a wide open layup why do you punish the guy that made the great pass you cant keep an assist if theres no basket an assist hes still assisted roach no assist necessary on that one I think you should give an assist to a great screen that frees up the drive weve opened Pandoras Box here right here sixpoint lead Purdue Jeremy roach has had some big big scoring games for the Blue Devils hes been their leading scorer in seven of their last 11 games and Miami could use some offense from Nigels past and he is capable of providing it Miami trying to hang in without omir and theyre knocking down shots from the outside Jake oh Miami is an excellent offensive team and this team can really shoot it the little jab step creates the space Isaiah Wong knocks down the three without a dribble and in the open floor thatll make you popular in Miami assist not shown theyre all kinds has done enough to get in who knows obviously an element of the unknown Joe linardi still has them among the first four out but their net did climb from 6151 after their win last night as a rather unpopular call amongst Duke fans the foul on Derrick Lively the second oh no they give it to philipowski apparently Applause not on lively on philipowski the hand on the elbow of the Denver lets go to Holly well guys as you know Isaiah won the ACC player of the year and I asked him today what does that mean to him he said Ive been through so much adversity my freshman year I didnt think I was good enough to play in the league I really wondered am I good enough on this stage but my mom my family everybody had my back she said there were games I wouldnt score there were games I would leave the gym and think I was terrible but I just kept working and now think of that almost quitting as a freshman thinking he wasnt good enough to be the best in the League this year this young man is proud of the adversity that he fought through and that he never gave up Holly thank you fourth year Junior if you will thats the way they designate them at Miami so because of the covered here hes actually got another year coming to him if he would like right now hes thinking about trying to help his team into the championship game over the ACC tournament if he can well hes just really good on defense taking away a flash post by Mark Mitchell from the corner Mitchell stumbling chipped up no good and its down to Miller Duke was playing volleyball on the backboards on that possession its so hard to keep off the glass thats a tough one step back three from the corner for Nigel pack that he left well sure Applause they never know which guy is going to have the hottest of hot hands but wait a number of turnovers lets doubledigit turnovers now for dude yeah Miami doing a great job on deflections and Isaiah Wong a great job in transition mom loves it and its down to two and he may have had doubts as a freshman but theres no doubt any more about Isaiah Wong and there hasnt been for some time gets the deflection takes it the other way and goes right into the chest of philipowski knocks him back and finishes that with the left hand what a big time finish look how he never took his eyes off the rim thats incredible concentration through contact 12 lead changes in this game Duke up by two Miami known as a great offensive team but their defense theyve been disruptive its been a lot of deflections here in the second half roach had to pick up his dribble and then a reach in foul going against the canes and when Miami on these ball screens decides theyre going to stay with the ball and double you just cant let him split it and Jeremy roach did a great job of splitting those two Defenders roach missed a few games with a toe injury Midway through the season and when he came back a bit of a shift in rolls as Whitehead knocks down another three speaking of guys who were injured and as they will tell you in the Duke notes the Blue Devils 16 and one this year when they have had their entire compliment of players now theyre not the only team to deal with injuries this year but between roach and Whitehead most notably theyve been shorthanded a fair bit well that that Buckhead by Whitehead was made possible by Derek Lively the second the cut that he made to the basket now watch Lively here and then watch Whitehead Lively is going to get a little screen from Whitehead and go to the basket everybodys worried about Lively with the lob and that puts Whitehead wide open for the three really well executed they put three along the Baseline one out top they can its always not always but its usually the same alignment that they can do different things out of and I think for out of bounds plays if you run the same alignment youre not giving away what happens use different alignments then its easier for scouting right the defense knows okay heres the alignment we know whats going to happen like football you want to disguise some things at the line of scrimmage absolutely yeah even though there was no need to bring up the sadistic ground acquisition game its nothing more than a crypto fascist metaphor for war thats two Pandoras boxes that weve opened tonight if youre keeping track at home this is the beautiful game it is played by Superior athletes with high IQs another deflection its out of bounds as Proctor went flying as Ted Valentines signal which way the ball is going well we know theres a Timeout on the floor I missed that maybe the ball bounced out of bounds yeah balls out right there before Wong touched it I think yeah because Wong was never at about him Timeout on the floor one possession game between Duke and Miami Music some people say the Barry were involved in a threepoint shooting contest yesterday as Cruz said why werent you so that was the video game he didnt want to get involved shooting threes with those perimeter guys Miami getting aggressive trying to trap make something happen theyve gotten a ton of deflections in this game and theyve turned Duke over 10 times Applause Ki made four threes in last nights win over Pitt and he extends the Duke lead to six right here you just have to guard him all over the floor well most big guys you have to guard him within a certain range well you got to go out to 24 feet out there guard Kyle felipowski missing Mr shot tonight five for five including the three 11 points five rebounds and four assists for the freshman the Rookie of the Year in the ACC and it wasnt even close in that voting when a guy hasnt missed a shot you tend to think he should get more shots Applause Whitehead a nice look Proctor misses the three and Beverly with the rebound for the Kings but Dukes floor spacing is so good why do you think and theres clearly a better team than they were earlier this year other than as Juan knocks down a three other than the Freshman getting more experience why else have the Blue Devils improved I think Dukes defense has improved greatly over the course of the year its been good throughout the year but I think the emergence of Derek Lively II has been game changing and now having Tariq Whitehead healthy where he can play significant minutes I mean this is now a stretch four you didnt have to stretch the the floor earlier on the season you could give up some open threes to Duke and not fear them and now you have to get out to these threepoint Shooters and its open up opening up driving lanes for Duke and a driving lane taken by the sevenfooter philipowski whos now six for six I still maintain that if you havent missed need more shots in and out for Wong on the three in the back come the Blue Devils led by Proctor and Proctors emergence taking over the point guard position now Jeremy roach can play off the ball and Proctor has been so reliable with the ball his first Miss of the night but a good look hes so good and hes picking pop situations Applause long with a long two rebounds philipowski Nigel pack getting ready to check back in for Miami Jeremy roach produced the one thing Duke doesnt do that traditionally youve seen from Hadoop teams defensively is theyre not the type of team that forced a ton of turnovers so their turnover margin is not among the best teams in the country they just turned it over themselves for the 11th time and a foul on lively it was all ball up top but it did look like Bonnie down below now he got bodied yeah John Shire doesnt like it may not have seen it but from our vantage point it looked like the right call well the officials this year have been holding their whistle until the play completes like this heres the foul right here thats the foul and then he got it afterwards but because the whistle wasnt contemporaneous with the foul he knew it was a foul right away they just give the time give themselves time to let it play out contemporating I got better words than that bill lapowski having himself a night Isaiah Wong the conference Player of the Year deep into Miami close a drop of tertiary or physical and they are excellent defensively and how they guard Virginias half court offense mover blocker they call it sides is going to determine whether they move on to the final because Virginia is really hard to guard when they run that Clemson has never won the ACC tournament and they are an original member of the conference they have been to the final twice trying to get there with a win tonight but theyve got their hands full with Tony Bennett Squad and how long has it been Miami won it 10 years ago now yes yes its amazing it seems like yesterday outstanding team Shane Larkin Henny Kaji I mean they had Jim larenega had a phenomenal team right here they were big uh that team would match up pretty well with the size of Duke Applause theyre older now but Im glad you got there yeah thank you it took you a while yeah roach contested shot from the elbow and phillipowski got held lets check in with Holly winning the Conference Championship this year is no surprise Justin Miller told us that when they made it to the elite eight last year they knew they could be special so he and Isaiah Wong got together and said were going to be special this year were going to get the guys together so all the newcomers everybody has been getting together at their house Justin Millers house all season long to watch the Marvel series The Avengers Captain America Iron Man they have kept that tradition up here at the ACC tournament where they all got together in Justins room yesterday to watch end game theyre staying together they love each other and that chemistry is really showing up on the floor this year for the Miami Hurricanes thats great stuff Holly thank you they did not have a player transfer out of the program after last year they lost three to graduation but they brought in a couple of transfers Nigel pack North Shadowmere and you can see when you watch their games or even more so when we get the opportunity to watch Jim larenegas team in practice and this is not to say group or anybody else isnt but you can see what a together group the hurricanes have nice drive finished with a left hand for Proctor well theyre also a uh a prolific Uno playing team that card game and Jordan Miller is apparently the most proficient at playing Uno Applause Duke has led throughout the second half but Miami stand close tipped back out by Miller Walker yeah thats uh Derek Lively was timing him up from the getgo and if you get an opportunity to go against Lively you got to take it right into his chest right into his chin if you try to avoid the block shot hes so long he just goes and gets it knocks it away as long as Walkers reaches its not as long as Lively hes third block for lively Corner jumper per pack or pack he is very difficult to deal with on Cuts because he goes from slow to fast in a heartbeat cant go under screens with Nigel pack you have to chase him over the top roach no but a foul might have been packed from behind it is first on him thats so hard when somebody just gets by you like roach got five pack you have to trust your help side to put pressure at The Rim the last thing you want to do is is foul just make him make that tough too over your teammate very good year for roach John Shire whos spoken often about how much was on his shoulders at the beginning of the year because with the exception of maybe you know the grad train the two grad transfers new to the program Jalen Blakes who doesnt play very much the rest of the group all freshmen as the freshmen have grown maybe a little bit less responsibility for roach but in the first couple of months he was asked to carry the load in a number of ways to this team and the most important player was he had to handle do all the ball handling responsibilities so he had to play point guard and then when he gave it up operate as a two guard and look to score but now he does handle the ball at times hes a really good pick and roll ball handler and very good at making reads off off ball streams but Proctor has taken the primary ball handling duties off his shoulders and thats made him more of an offensive weapon Applause long back into the game for Miami creates the space that is Isaiah wall how many times ACC fans or Miami fans see him do that create a little space knock down a jumper from the Baseline this came off that little Iverson cut up top and hes going against a longarmed really good Defender and Mark Mitchell and just knocked him back a little bit able to go up with that midrange shot theres not a space or area of the floor that Isaiah Wong is not a dangerous scorer 229 for Wong young to Mitchell you got to get more pressure on the ball to keep that but being thrown in over the top to Ryan young and Young when he draws when he draws defensive attention hes a good passer out of that and that was a really good pass to Mitchell double figures now for Mitchell for the sixth consecutive game good job by Whitehead to stay down on all those fakes from Juan Casey with a reverse the Freshman from Chicago and its again a threepoint game and went to Whitney Young High School in Chicago a lot of great players have come out of Whitney Young but that was a a really nice job of getting to the other side of the rim how about this Jay Duke shooting 57 percent Miami right at 50 percent two teams playing very well offensively both these teams can make shots and Duke is emerging as a much better and proficient offensive team in Miami without norchado mirror net is the alltime leading shot dont think Jay knew that we that cant be confirmed thats just a rumor thats been going around for years how about the year Shaka smart uh and a marketer happened by the way and how about whats going on in the Pac12 the semifinals are going on tonight including over on ESPN a big one coming up Arizona Arizona State the Sun Devils the bubble team and remember they beat the Wildcats in Tucson on a half court shot a couple of weeks ago so thats going to be all kinds of fun you know to Mojos question I have heard quite a bit that Jordan fournette is the alltime leading shot blocker at Notre Dame but thats actually the first time Id heard it mentioned by somebody other than Jordan Cornett so that was interesting Roach in some traffic looking for help kicks it back out good shot fake Proctor misses the three we got contact underneath and a Duke foul evidently going against Ryan Young Miami keeping this to a one possession game and Im not saying Miami would turn down getting a run and taking a lead but without norchado mirror in the ball game he was injured in the first minute just after the first minute you know for Miami to keep this to a one possession game to have a chance at the end and I think thats what Jim larrenink is thinking right now Miami raising up theyre an old 23 set and theyll give him a little extra space to make some cuts without Derek Lively in the middle Miller the spin and the finish and a chance for three what a play by Jordan Miller this really smart set run by Miami and Jim larenega they draw Derek Lively away from the basket get that Baseline Drive and then Livelys got to come down from the top and then hes going to have to block the shot from behind and got the body contact and still the finish and Jordan Miller is just a big time player Im not sure theres a more complete player both offensive defense in the league than Jordan Miller second Team all ACC although we missed the free throw that would have tied it up so its duped by one less than seven minutes to go Applause good help there to shut a roach down now they got him trapped and they wouldnt let him split it and on the alternating possession it is Miami Bowl one of the better traps that Miami has put on when Jeremy roach picked up his dribble he couldnt pivot through it because Miami really tightened that trap up it was essentially shoulder to shoulder and they wouldnt let him through and their Four Hands on the ball right there maybe six if you got Jeremy Roach Miamis been swimming Upstream a lot here in this one they have trailed more than they have led but theyve got a chance to reclaim the lead on this trip Miller will try another rebound for filipowski Duke really hasnt had many opportunities in transition a quick Outlet the Tyrese Proctor contenta essentially just walk it up and get into something Mitchell lefthanded gets inside left it short hey look at poplars done a nice job on the glass undersized and a game full of big guys hes really battled Nigel pack the transfer from KState good look for Casey Roach The Rebound after that little staggered ball screen up top Miami just throwing back for the reversal and the atmosphere picking up mostly from the Duke fans right now as they continue to lead by one and another tie up no a foul was called two officials had a different signal Ted Valentine from what I saw was getting ready to call a held ball AJ Desai called a foul on Wong yeah I saw the signal for jump ball but Applause bonus now roach to the line for one and one Proctor will get a breather Whitehead returns Applause both these teams good freethrow shooting teams he took a shoot about 77 78 as a team thats numbers two and three in the lead number ones warming up in the hallway Clemson Clemson like four of their five starters shes over 80 percent a missed front end but it is still Duke ball and Anthony Walker is livid Jim larenaga didnt like it either they thought it was off Lively Applause Applause yeah they might be right and now a foul on Long is that number four on Isaiah one yes it is at two in a row boy what a big play thats just a huge play were a possession of the ball and that call was a big part of the same play looking for Derek Lively coming off that little screen for the LOB and just Isaiah Wong didnt give Tariq Whitehead the opportunity to land thats the second time hes been fouled shooting a three in this game and as soon as it happened one of the Miami assistants one of the most important jobs that ingame staff has is to to make sure the head coach knows how many fouls that is and the look on Jim larenegas face when he was told it was number four he thought about it for a while but he has sent mensley Joseph to the scores table and hes going to take Isaiah Wong out of the game maybe just till the under four yeah I think thats probably right you cant keep him out for too long yeah they bring in a tenacious Defender but they lose some offense and Josephs knocked down some shots very good player but he hes not Isaiah Wong yeah Wong has what 14 in the second half and hes been strong Whitehead six for six from the line and all six free throws coming from those two threepointers he was fouled on a rose doing a really good job making it difficult for Nigel pack to catch the ball and a foul against Duke Applause Kyle filipowski called for the foul and then the Miami players were yelling for a technical when he threw the ball down to the other for the court that went all the way into the crowd yeah filipowski went and got the ball himself brought it back I think theyve probably got a delay a game warning for that or something yeah third on philipowski Poplar at the line Applause this feels like the kind of guy next year if some of the older players move on that Poplar might jump from an eightpoint A game guy to a 16point a game guy next season yeah because therell be more shots available hes a really good player just an elite athlete and hes a good Defender played a lot of baseball more baseball than basketball into a Midway through High School then he decided he wanted something more exciting and rewarding you were a big Dodger fan back I still am I love baseball Applause but that was in desperate need of a shot clock theyve got a pitch clock desperate need Applause two point game 4 40 to go how about Poplar at 65 guarding for Lebowski now Miller switches on to him philipowski the spin hangson hits how good is that he has got games and he is taking advantage of smaller Defenders that are doing a good job trying to stay in front of him but hes just going up over the top of Jordan Miller seven for eight on the night it wont go down for Nigel pack and after the under four timeout I think Jim larenega is going to have to get Isaiah Wong back in the ball game and just hes just gonna have to be smart but you have to have his offense on the floor to make this final push in regulation its the second time tonight hes had to sit because of foul trouble when you look at Jim Arena not just the job hes done in Miami but throughout his career what a rich Journey hes had through the game he played at Archbishop Malloy High School in New York got the best whistle in basketball by the way he wears one around his neck but he never uses hes got his own Wizards its remarkable how loud that thing is theres the Jackson at Archbishop Malloy played for Dave Gavin at Providence drafted by the Pistons and on the nation Smith Hall of Fame finalist ballot for the first time foreign lead this is as big as its been in a while Poplar Walker beautiful offense from the hurricanes and you can see the baseball in Poplar he had a head first slide after making that assist he covered about 15 feet on the slide alone knocked out of bounds still Duke ball with 3 42 to go how hard is Bensley Joseph played in this game a berth in the final is on the line here in semifinal number one in Greensboro Music ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by New York Life over 12 000 agents there to help guide you through lifes happiest and most difficult times there are all kinds of products sharing the ball more and more importantly we just got to know each other what everybody could do well said that was the turning point of our season that meeting changed everything and if they get a chance to go to the ACC Championship game in a weird way theyll have Miami to think Holly thank you a timeout Now by John Shire so well step aside for 30 seconds Duke looking to inbound 3 42 to go up by four three Mariachi here you need parts eBay you know Pals committed here then you get them in on offense but Wong whos got four fouls still on the bench with 3 42 to go pressure Applause Proctor picks it up in a tough spot and a held ball the arrow gives it back to Duke but of course if that would have happened again Miami gets the next one but it is still Duke basketball and if it happens two more times Duke gets it thats true and so on and so on I dont mind the arrow because who wants to watch jump balls its so difficult but I I think the defense should get it anytime theres a tie up you know why I said that because my mother said to me a few months ago what is it with the I dont understand the arrows just you know in case you want mom in case youre watching you know shes watching yeah hes probably disappointed in your shirt tie combo roach a little bit short pack could not keep it in bounds and as one would expect with nor Chad OMeara going out of the game just after the first minute in the first half you know Duke has dominated the glass and they have been a handful on the offensive glass no call and a bucket for filipowski Miami bench wants an offensive foul Duke bench wants a flop neither of them happened but its a bucket for filipowski now 17 on the night and now Wong will come back into the ball game Miami has the ball you put him in for offense here but look theres no question that there were two feet on the floor facing the ball handler Teddy Valentine making a move but deciding against the call Applause all right philipowski from the getgo has realized hes had a significant size Advantage tonight and hes taken advantage of it at every opportunity hes such a skilled player you know he can set a ball screen he can get out of the ball screen to the threepoint line he can roll to the basket he can post he can step away shot fake and drive I mean how many seven Footers especially freshmen have that kind of skill set there and hes hes physical and hes a committed rebounder I mean he has been a load out there for Miami to deal with if you havent been with us all night long and you want to see what Jay means heres what Jay means well Kyle filipowski has size and hes got skill great feet and he is physical on both ends of the floor but hes really good on those short roll situations after he sets a ball screen he can roll to the basket make it hit him short and then he can make a decision whether to take it one on one or if he draws two Defenders can pass out of it and usually intelligently hes got a few turnovers in this game but hes made so many positive plays on both ends of the floor long back into the game for the hurricanes Applause step into the corner guarded by Proctor shot block inside 10 turn around Miller again off one foot and hes brought him back within four well you talk about a guy that has got gain and thats Jordan Miller and he was aware of where Derek Lively was Lively was shading over toward him to try to get up and block that shot here gets it over Miamis aggressive and trapping and looking for Steals and theyve gotten deflections in this game and theres one right there into the back court shot clock down to 10 roaches good off ball screens goes right by long but rejected by Walker they have numbers our roach hustles back into the play they didnt take advantage of it crossover by Wong pull up by Wong and rebound phillipowski his 10th not many offensive rebound opportunities for Miami with North Shadow Mirror in there he gets three four of them a game on average suffered an ankle injury a minute and six seconds into the game and Miller battling philipowski down the low post roach for three he is so good in that spot on the left side where he can go to his right off of a ball screen Pat lays it in how did he get that up and now hes shaking up what a fantastic drive by Nigel pack Applause well he gets up and in a lot of pain right now Miami already down one significant player there hoping pack is okay whatever gear that was he just shot through there got a little bit of body contact went to the deck but still made the shot but Jeremy roach this little throw and get ball screen and when hes going to his right he can be really dangerous almost dropped coverage there by Isaiah Wong late recovery to the shot if hes up on it roach is really good at turning the corner and pulling up for that midrange jumper all five players are all five starters rather than double figures for the Blue Devils tonight more pressure from Miami boy you can use philipowski so big to help get the ball up and then the Finish By Whitehead textbook there from the Blue Devils breaking the pressure to score and Tariq Whitehead has been fantastic in this game and right now Anthony Walker is all over the place at both ends as they get a quick bucket and a trip to the line Miami got the ball up towards so quickly well you cant celebrate a basket in this game he went right at philipowski filipowski was sideways to him so no chance of a vertical contest the body contact was an automatic foul and still Walker able to finish its just a great pass ahead from Bensley Joseph and thats a big time take and finish by Anthony Walker two good teams Applause and right now Joe lunardi with each of them as a five seed as Walker makes it a fourpoint game right now its about ball security and expecting contact and getting fouled Music and a roach and a foul is called against Miami looks like it when it gets popular thats going to send Mark Mitchell to the freethrow line Mitchells a good freethrow shooter shoots about 77 percent yeah I just got him got his arms locked in there almost half the ball but pretty good for Mark Mitchell to get two hands on that thing 15 foul two free throws for Mitchell dont forget Clemson and Virginia still to come in our second semifinal tonight this is where make or miss here Duke wants to take away threes let Derek gladly the second protect the basket and you just dont want to foul stop the clock and put Miami at the free throw line Applause so Lively back into the ball game to do just that protect the rim Mitchell 77 percent on the season just four for seven tonight Music Applause Music Miami does not need a three here I think you want to attack the basket if you draw multiple Defenders then you can kick it out for a step in three half for three sure Miller The Rebound in and out and Mitchell Has It produced roach into the front Court hes fouled and the Blue Devils fans on their feet Im not sure that first three by Nigel pack of course he can make that shot hes an outstanding shooter but I think you attacked the basket there and extend the game a little bit give yourself more of a chance to win it if Duke is able to hang on obviously they go to the championship game but no matter what you have to be impressed by the fight that Miami has shown in this game without North Shadow Mirror who got injured in the first minute of the ball game Twisted an ankle and out for the rest of the game for Miami to put themselves in a position to have a chance to win late I mean this hurricane Team Battle now I think Miami has to take a three long will we had a whistle now we had a timeout call by Jim larenega Applause and thats fourth foul by Isaiah Wong was huge you know he got in back to back plays after a controversial call on whod the ball go off of and then he picks up his second one and two consecutive plays and then had to sit out how many minutes I mean it must have been four or five minutes yeah sat out several minutes uh and he found Whitehead it was one both times right on the white he had threes and Whitehead made all six of those free throws now Isaiah Wongs done a lot of really good things uh in this game as well Duke leading by seven if they win it would be their eighth consecutive win Miami has scored um the Duke normally holds teams below 70 Miamis a very good offensive team but Duke as we continue to see growing by the week at both ends and and you know they might go into the tournament a little bit under seated or undervalued because theyre better now than I think their season body of work yes thats exactly right there are seasons by its almost like when you look at their their shooting percentages I mean Duke shoots 33 from three but thats not been there for 7 certainly that not been their percentage in the ACC tournament and this team has grown so much offensively in the last two three weeks but especially in the last week I mean were seeing a different offensive attack from duke or that Pittsburgh game was a clinic and this isnt far behind to put up what they have 97 96 last night and then they got the 83 in this one Whitehead lost it on the way up Joseph misses the three we try to rebound Walker long no Pat fouled inadvertently by Lively and thats number four on Derek Lively the second but just 10 seconds left in this game so the issue no longer really endowed here in this one Tariq White had just a freshman but that last time he had the ball that was one to pull back out make him failure you used a little bit of clock he didnt have the clear path and didnt have complete control of the ball normally he would have been able to dunk that thing in but how about the job John shires done not just this year but late in the year his patience with this team has been really impressive and I think one of the most impressive things was how hes brought along Derek Lively the second I mean Lively was harshly criticized early in the season he was the number one player theres John shires parents howd they get such good seats they must know somebody must know somebody but Lively was criticized being the number one high school player and I think that Duke staff did a really good job of of working with him convincing him hey you got this like lets do what you can do and hes hes just blossomed into a gamechanging big guy roles have been solidified you know whether its in the backcourt with proctorman roach Lively up front now I need to talk to you about some solidifying of roles I had a foul to send Proctor to the line the Proctors had a really good allaround game in this one defensively hes an excellent Defender really good ball pressure gets deflections and Steals and then hes been excellent in running the team nothing for the Hurricanes to hang their heads about in this one is as you mentioned just a short while ago for the NCAA tournament everybody that came here in the ACC wanted to win the ACC tournament championship but for the NCAA tournament theres a theres a bright spot here one North Shadow Mirror gets a little bit of time to go back and and Rehab at home but also Miami gets a little bit more rest they get to go home when theres no no Spotlight on them and they get the they get to really start preparing for the tournament with the final rebound of the night and the Duke Blue Devils are headed to the ACC tournament championship game Applause eight wins in a row for the Blue Devils as they hold off a stubborn and talented a Miami team tonight by a score of 8578
