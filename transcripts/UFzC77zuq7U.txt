no for I hope it doesnt cuz I Ill be wrong real quick here a little history lesson just the second meeting all time between the Bears and the Cardinals the other one was 16 years ago this or 15 years ago this march by the way NCAA south regional in Jacksonville at Veterans Memorial Coliseum despite Raheem Buckle scoring 20 Cal won 77 62 and Cs going to get the first foul black she with the foul after at Le chases down the re the tip and puts foul number one on black year with only four seconds into this game inbounds to Hadley heres Edwards out front to Scott Louisville will look to create Tempo early heres he fresh off the 37 on Saturday went back to Scott theres a turnover ball rolls out collected by heon Chucky from behind the line spins out Soko the rebound so thats the first three hes missed in the last two games is what were saying heres the cow lineup keep an eye on Zero The Freshman Jeremiah Wilkinson has had a terrific rookie campaign for second year head coach Mark Madson Javon blackshire dumps down to Soko double team quickly here is Wilkinson out front with eight to shoot against heper oh hesi and got to the Lane couldnt finish rebound by Hadler look at the Cardinal five for Pat Kelce here is Scott who is that mask man yeah Edwards for three cards on the board thats a a guy thats kind of gone under the radar hes really been pretty strong this year on both ends of the Court he absolutely has coach Kelsey gave him a lot of credit for their increased defensive effort and after they had a team meeting talking about that it wasnt coach Kelce it was the team recognizing they needed to be better on the defensive end and they are tend to shoot for Javon blackshire jab step three good C in front they tied on the threepointer by black year its his 51st of the year and petrius actually got that first foul it was not on black year so good to see him staying out of foul trouble four seconds into the game yep however petrius will be in the mix rain Smith the front rim Miss Soko a rebound Monty Soko the numbers from his career at East Lancing to what hes doing in Berkeley a start contrast as hes been a nice Fit For What Mark Madson wants to do at the offensive end and he has been a weapon on the glass three ball Wilkinson Miss badley and carams away and here is teren Edwards Sun Bel Player of the Year a season ago at James Madison and hes had a great year here Scott a three and another rebound for sissoko and thats not Scotts strength however Pat Kelsey loves him so much he gives him the leeway to take a couple of those just to want make sure that he stays confident in this game blacker for the lead and it bounces in now this is the black sheir that weve heard about thats the best shooter on this team we hear them talking about it we havent seen it in person but off to a great start here and this is their fourth trip back and forth so you I think they made some adjustments rain Smith a three rattled out and slapped around by Scott out of bounds itll go to the Bears and Mark Matson who turned 49 on January the 28th is a of course twotime world champion in his playing career the Mad Dog 26 wins in the last two years and hes got 96 in his career he did a wonderful job at Utah Valley by the way he was a whack Coach of the Year won the regular season twice when Jim Nolton the ad hired him to replace uh Jared H yes oh no not Jared H Jared H was at Stanford when Jim Nolton brought him Jared has played at Cal before he transferred to Kansas back in the day uh he got a really good basketball coach despite Cory being educated at the Rival Well that thats the interesting part he is a Stanford educated guys P trus gets the put back the offensive rebounding which of course is a strength of the cow Bears it was a strength of Mark Matson especially during his time at St Edwards has got his second three so Terrence Edwards got all six of L those points here in the first three minutes and change but the part of that is Pat Kelsey told us earlier its interesting to see how teams take on the personality of their coach and of course Mark vson who played so hard was a great offensive rebounder got to the free throw line those happen to be the strengths of the cow Bears sto yakovich a three ball bounces away patrus gives Chase and heres Hadley on the run back for heurn Chucky working on Wilkinson Edwards has had the hot hand lately hell tee up another one nope offensive foul abubacar trayor and thatll be his first thats the first on the cards and so the turnover sends it to the Bears its important Cal gets off to a pretty good start which they have theyve hit a couple and theyve contained the defense a little bit so its this is a good start for them four minutes into this first half theres a double team on black Shi Soko well out to Applause collector for trayor is a weapon ending heres Soko one dribble strong to the basket couldnt finish kept Alive by hadron great job by trayor getting over and really stopping that freight train of Soko coming down the paint Edwards Quick Pass for Hadley Hadley recognizing going back to the basket not going to be the answer goes uphill D but it doesnt work out ends up being a turnover and hours a day he is just Relentless and hes detailed hes organized hes a winner thats High Praise coming from the Hall of Famer and I will agree with you but one of the things I love about in his shoot rounds everyone is involved he has me wanting to get off the bench and think I can play again and we all know thats no longer hes not that desperate heres heon sliding foul line and oh everything that was going in Saturday is out here on Wednesday doesnt not surprising that happens to players Wilkinson Bears leading by two Jeremiah three and thats off the mark look at sasoko with three white shirts around him battle to the end but that was one of the things coach Kelsey told us about they were going to have to double team him on box outs not when he catches the basketball but theyre going to have to send multiple bodies at Soko and as Dort comes into the game its similar its going to be similar treatment with him he basically had there the same guy and both of them of course massive size advantage against the Cs they had everybody on the boards thats what theyre going to do so you see M Soko sit down 34 in the blue is Lee Dort from Dallas the vanderville transfer and heres Chucky heurn against blackshire Kai Rose wears nine for the cards hes checked into the lineup for the first time to replace trayor Scott holding on the ball with five to shoot gets it back for Edwards hell fire for three on sto yakovich brse punched it out but right to Andre but this the second time that the Bears have had numbers and not taken advantage of give the cards great credit for getting back and setting their defense blackshire of two thats good Javon blackers got eight of Cals 10 great start for black here sure is heres heon winding through ruths is not a particularly strong threepoint shooter just 26 and the cars are getting a lot of threes and not getting much going to the basket which is something that they usually do Hadley trying to bully in STO yakovich and look at petrius Cory fighting for it couldnt hang on to it now Hadley the stick back and the foul is on Rus petritis but we talked about he was being the mix thats the second foul on petrius he got the first one 4 seconds into the game and you know hes going to be involved with all the physical play that goes on in the paint which of course now Mark maton with a tough decision does he take him off the floor with 1341 remain so here is Hadley at the line the fifth year player from St Paul Minnesota the first one is good dont forget full coverage youve already seen a lot of it today from Greensboro tomorrow nothing but net headlines another busy 4 game day at the Ali ACC womens tournament where already today we have seen Virginia win Boston College win and also Clemson Cory advance so Virginia won and Syracuse didnt right is is we have to bring that up no I mean I was just asking the question I didnt see the games so I was just asking West questions lets talk about petrius getting those early two you take him out but its so far to go you probably give him a little rest talk to him and then get him back in some coaches when you get two youre out for the whole half I never coached like that no you absolutely didnt you allow guys to play with three in the first but I do believe you have to get PES back in at some point I think so thats what Mark mson was worried about right there live ball turnovers for his Bears team heres he sliding all the way through and back inside and hell flip it to Scott caught it and put it back up and will draw the foul and Scott mishandling that that would have been his 67th dunk of the Season which hes second nationally but didnt handle the pass correctly now has to go see if he can get those two points at the free throw line first foul on dork coach almost a travel I mean it was close he he fumbled it enough that should have been an easy catch and finish for Scott who normally is shorthanded but playing with that mask and again looking down to the floor who knows if that actually abru his vision at all because it does protrude from his face you see the nose comes out has a broken bone above his lip yeah its a handable Lector look alike a little a little bit a little bit needs the the gate on the front though second one bounces away offensive rebound yep and now a sudden were going to do a little bit of housework here on the shot clock yeah shell reset to 20 seconds so now shell be at 16 lets see Lee Cel Ted Valentine teddy if 4 seconds went off of a 30se second reset then it should be a 16 and Teddys going to take full advantage of this to just make sure everybody knows hes here right tonight I just want to make sure everyone knows the voice of Jim beheim versus the voice of Cory Alexander love teddy you show it uhoh tell you what dork challenged the lob Bears lead by one Spencer mener Spencer Mahoney is the 69 freshman from Brooklyn whos in the game and theres the runner by DJ Campbell Noah Waterman the rebound this ball game does not have a lot of conversions but its got a lot of physicality another offensive rebound by dor and Roose misses on the three Waterman the rebound uhoh uhoh and the foul is going to be on Spencer Mahoney The Freshman from Brooklyn transferred from Washington State averaging about 5 minutes a game against the ACC hands Cal their fourth foul good to see Waterman jump right back up yeah going to have to deal with that left ankle he he definitely jammed it a little bit Yeah chaseing offensive rebound so Terrence Edwards has come back rign Smith goes out hes kind of hobbling goodness Terence Edwards has the only field goals made for the cards hes made two threes everything else of them has been from the free throw line heres heurn for Waterman hes not scared to launch it into a double team with Tucker and then thrown away away nice play by Campbell yeah great Rotation by Campbell recognizing anticipating and the drive he couldnt finish Cs missing a great opportunity here to get ahead and because Louisvilles not making anything this is the time when youre on the road you got to make those shots H bur off balance missed everything and heurn was trying to draw a foul on that possession Tucker was signaling to the officials that there was a fly on that one but ends up being an airball out of bounds as Tucker gets a hand in there this ginormous Jumbotron up here showing it to the crowd who is not pleased at all with the no call so not not the referees best friend that Jumbo Tron no its not christien Tucker playing in the ball game wheres 22 so some deep reserves off mark madsons bench here in the first 9 Minutes of this game heres Campbell C leading by by a point sto yakovich the shot fake oh nice pass back to Andre layup good first points for the sophomore from Carmichael California oldest play in the book coach the old give and go great job moving without the basketball by soyak Edwards Cal leading by three Edwards shoots from the top nine for Terrence Edwards Edwards with all of the field goals three or four from Beyond the threepoint Arc every field goal made for the cards is to credit of Terence EV Tucker heres Mahoney sto yakovich with 15 to shoot for Dort now Campbell Mahoney a three from long range tapped around Edwards the rebound and the crowd up encouraging the cards on the defensive end recognizing how important it is to get a stot oh what a scooping score Mark bson making sure the officials see him dont want to think that way sure but and and Smith with him and Smith having all his family here for the first time right those two guys are you know theyre thinking about that a little bit sure cards in front by two and a drive by Campbell and a kick for Wilkinson Jeremiah is scoreless so far almost halfway through the opening 20 but recognize whos guarding it its Edwards and back El he told us Dort to work Lee Dort and one oh my goodness it almost burned up on reentry as it dropped in the bucket really did and he has all reason to flex on that one and Im sure not Im not sure that Dort sees a lot of double teams but as he catches this one under the basket Chucky heer coming down and the double team is there fortunate to get the we wont even call that a a a fortunate bounce well call that a fortunate release prer answer thats what that was Waterman the foul his first D whos a 58 free throw shooter but look at that graphic yeah 66 of their points 494 points per game come from either in the paint or the free throw line that shows just not a very good shooting team peer on the drive trayor Kadir on the board with his first point cards back in front of point at 1615 sto yakovich trying to free himself from Hadley boy cards are excellent against the man pressure here six to shoot for Wilkinson look at the switch deep three off the back rim heurn the rebound Wilkinson hasnt been able to get into the painted area at all heurn a three from the front short and the run down by Music Campbell changes Direction in traffic fway on Waterman too strong rebound put it on the floor and draws the foul thatll foul going to be inside on Terrence Edwards his first third on the cards this is the way you have to attack The Bigs of Cal theyve got great size tayori going over the top sto yakovich coming off a career high four blocks last time out contesting but no match with tayori at The Rim how many shooting guards blocked four shots in a game thats highly unusual I tell you what I dont think his dad ever blocked four shots no he didnt his strength he never got close enough to the basket Lee dor Buck Lee Doran who had the threepoint play a moment ago is at the line now for two he had five in the game Saturday against Boston College and hes got his fifth straight game of at least four here tonight well and you think about how Mark maton trusts him to come in and the job of the bigs for cow isnt to be scores it is to put pressure on the opposing teams when a shot goes up make sure you have to have multiple bues to keep them off the offensive glass go get multiple possessions but what they both do relatively well is make free throws when they get their opportunities and thats a big part of it you get those opportunities there and you miss them with just empty empty trip right so those are big Mount Soko has come back into the game by the way to replace dor Cal back in front of point at 1716 he on the drive and turned over and once again C has numbers they take advantage of it Wilkinson stepped out of bounds the answer is no thats the third third time in this first half coach weve seen them with a 514 and they get nothing out of the possession do you know how long that out of bounds line has been there since the game started yeah yeah and guys still step out its something I explode when that happens I mean I it was a fault of mine I would take even good players out of the game because they did that its inexcusable here is Scott theyre not guarding him oh I love the no call on that yeah y Teddy Valentine right on top of IT Crowd here erupted Valentine did not blow the whistle Edwards shot F three over Mahoney rims out and heres the run down blackshire and now at the other end Mone oh and Soko follows the Miss but how about Soko not assuming that the bucket will be made continuing to run the floor and a really good defensive play to get that opportunity absolutely Chucky with the block yeah Applause Edwards he shoots to Tai and does he has been the entire offense it seems for louiso throughout this game five field goals for Edwards four of them from Beyond the threepoint Arc at the other end a bad Miss by money but a moment ago tell you what go the follow of the Miss and then Terrence Edwards tees up another three and were tied in Applause Louisville have to coach him for the remainder of this hat I just think you got to let him play if he gets it he gets it you know he hes he can help them get a little better position at halftime and thats what you want to do you got three guards out there for Mark Madson theres another three for Terence Edwards right out of the time out they get right to him and he knocks it down yeah P Kelsey recognizing where the hot hand is Edwards has all but one field goal for the cards this evening hes got now five threes and 17 points and a foul on Louisville will be on trayor as coach mentioned coming out the timeout is a set play to be able to get Edwards a look and the mistake is when the guys already made four threes you cant go under the screen you cannot give him that space you got to be there chase him make him go over the top four him inside the threepoint line threepoint lead now for the cards blacker got off to a hot start he had eight quick ones for Cal now hell try and drive Scott to traffic now Wilkinson the Lefty three and hes fouled by Edwards and hell get three free throws so Terrence Edwards Jr draws his second thats the fifth now on the cards with 650 to go in the first half and thats a huge foul because Pat Kels told us their defense took a tremendous lead forward when Terence Edwards took it personally started to become that defensive stopper they put him on the opposing teams best perimeter player the reason why hes taken the challenge of guarding Wilkinson whos been averaging 20 points a game since he got into the starting lineup 11 games ago so Wilkinson hits the first of the three free throws two more to go for the Freshman from pow Springs Georgia and this is the kind of thing that can kind of loosen him up and get get him going make a couple free throws thatll loosen him up maybe hell get get something going on offense substitutions Waterman and heer back real quick here remind you of the lineup tomorrow on ACCC network from the allly ACC womens tournament you see that middle screen thats the you see 1100 am Boston College Carolina 130 Georgia Tech Virginia Tech afternoon session Virginia Cal and then Virginia Tech that Virginia Cal match up thats me and Roxy Burns team baby Roxy and I used to have our friendly wager Edwards the Miss other way comes blackshire bears and cards are tied petrius for the lead chance you can see that one coming out of his hands it never had a chance he getting to the rim and if Edwards just attack him hes got two fouls right yeah Hadley a three bring it up somebody else makes Oney Im surprised Edwards let betrus off the hook recognize but both playing with two fouls maybe Edwards didnt want to pick up the offensive foul being overly aggressive blacks are picked up on the dribble heres Campbell tend to shoot DJ on the drive blocked by Waterman here goes Hadley in the cards heern back for Javon Hadley Hadley five in a row by Hadley the Colorado transfer they dont want to get into this they want to slow it down and Cory heres the real difference in this program and from the last two years this environment now is like a sixth or seventh man on the floor for the guys in white its starting to resemble the the Louisville that we started coming to when they enter the ACC in 20145 this is the environment that was created back then by Rick Latino and it started similarly with the defense and when the fans when youre winning the fans are a lot more active Hadley at the Block against Soko Scott couldnt handle it and over the top goes Campbell and DJ Campbell will get the first and the fifth against C Terence Edwards attacking both players playing with two fouls so Edwards decides not to be overly aggressive gets it out to Hadley way too much space from Soko is able to knock it down and then wman on the other end denying the opportunity by Campbell which turns into another bucket for Hadley in Applause transition heurn out in the middle of the floor sto yakovich has returned to replace Campbell Chucky drives through for Waterman too strong backside rebound for blackshire sto yakovich a catch and shoot three off the front rim petritis kept it alive Hadley took an inadvertent hand to the face I think that got knocked around and out of there with it comes heer kick back for Edwards shot fake step left three nope bothered by sto yakovich three on one heres Wilkinson and heper going to draw the foul sixth on Louisville and the First on Chucky heer but the crowd Here Wanting a call on the last shot we were blocked off so dont get much of a chance to see it so yakovich coming in the the crowd here is fortunate cuz if the whistle did blow that would have been a foul on Edwards for kicking out his leg and there was a foul going the other way fans dont always see those exactly they kind of see them like coaches bad Applause call you as you watch this again Watch Terence Edwards kick out the right leg that is not his natural shooting motion fortunately he did not pick up his third foul on that possession even though theyre booing they should be thankful that Teddy Valentine did not blow the whistle and wison miss free throws still a fivepoint Louisville lead you have to make those free throws on especially on the road you need those and when the crowd is going crazy like they are right now everything against you those free throws are the only thing that can calm him down Edwards runs it up with the right hand and recovered sto yakovich uhoh and now we got a foul on Edwards and Soko and Mark Matson goes to get him because sasoko did not take kindly to the leg that Edwards was kind of trying to trip sasoko with so heres the concern now Ed already has two fouls if this is a double technical which Im not sure it will be because it seems as so sasoko was the initiator but if they do go double technical here that would be the third personal foul on Edwards who has absolutely been the offense for the cards throughout this first half so well take a timeout four minutes even to go first half in Louisville cards by five Applause Applause Applause airport he is already Im going to give him a couple turns AE heres the ti you ready Applause anywhere Music conat airport over there tradition since 1969 find your Music best tshirt Music the Young Center in Louisville and you see in the bottom left of your screen Terren Edwards whos been called for a flagrant so thats his third foul its also the 17 foul on Louisville and one more look at this Cory again but he doesnt kick out he just steps up he tries to get up but in the path of sasoko its going to be a flagrant one sasoko gets the technical foul for going back over and approaching Edwards so its going to be the flagrant one which gives Edwards his third foul takes him out of this first half for four minutes remaining coach only the first onoko he really it was accidental I think when he start he was getting up and in process of getting up theres contact there so I mean maybe they have to call that but its a its a tough call and Edwards gets his third hes the hes carrying most of Louisvilles offense right now well I was impressed with Mark Manson got off there quicker than I can imag still move and hes one of the few coaches that can move Manny Soko thats true too move him backwards uh the Edwards th foul is compounded by word we got during the break two that rign Smith lower leg injury questionable to return so now all of a sudden this Steamroller of an offense not maybe having its sharpest first half and they got some foul trouble and potential injury looming and Rain Smith has a parents family here relatives everybody here for the first time we got a foul CL a on number 12 shooting shot all right so Ted Valentine gives you the interpretation we just shared with you so hes going to shoot the free throws on the technical foul yes and then sasoko will shoot the free throws on the flagrant and then the basketball will be given to C which is why these are being shot first so we dont have to crisscross the floor unnecessarily and heres blacker hes going to shoot the free throw you cant do that sooko has to shoot him he was the one that was fouled in the flag technical you can choose but a good try by black she but thats theyre not going to pull that one off its always tough for a big guy thats a pretty good shooter to go to the line when nobodys around and heres the thing coach those two points those two free throws are the first points for Chuck hurn lets see if that gets him going without both of his back court makes here four minutes remaining in this first half yeah and Smiths a big player for Louisville cuz he spreads the defense you have to chase him way out there that opens up some of those driving gaps so petritis blackshire Wilkinson Soko sto yakovich original starters for Cal on the floor meanwhile Edwards has gone to the bench Hadley heurn Scott Waterman and Kai root the Freshman from Washington a a defensive lineup right now for the cars but this do lineup absolutely cannot generate points the way that the starting lineup does sto yakovich still having a hard time Soko had a crack at the rebound heres sto yakovich for three and that spins off and a foul inside its going to be another foul with Soko doing the job on the offensive glass trying to keep him from Gaining extra possessions and he is stacking up the fouls on the cards especially on the front line look at Soko as he continues to work hes boxing out as though hes on defense and HB bur coming in two hands that was a little bit of a love tap that that kind of a Dennis Rodman move he just got in there and blocked out before the shot ever went up and Louisville has four guys back there but one of them still had a pushup one and one here for Marty Soko from Molly and he knocks down the first one and thats an area where Mark Maxon talked to us earlier he was talking about sasoko may not be the greatest offensive player but he gets fouled so much and does a pretty good job at the free throw strike but he gets there taking advantage of his opportunity yeah right around 70 just south of 70 starting tonight and rims that one out so hes two of his first four its still a fivepoint Louisville lead with three and a half to go here at the Young Center and now Zone defensively by Cy of course coach madon knows whos in the building Mr Zone himself going to show off his version is a little different definitely different here goes he on the drive took the contact and thatll be on black Shir and thats on the way up no that thats definitely on the way up Eric Lewis signaling early hes got a great view on that that the shot is already on the way up Cory the litigation of the patrons here is impressive though I tell you what they impressive they are all after and you you respect that from the fans you want them to cheer everything in the favor of their team of course its our job to be neutral and understand the reality of the situation strong litigation though yes it is strong and heurn hits them both hes got four all at the line its been a frustrating opening 20 minutes Chuckys over for four from the floor has missed all three of his threepoint attempts as well sto yakovich Baseline against Waterman cant find it again Andre is one for six now they give Waterman the job I mean the credit for doing the job defensively Waterman a shot F now a three got it thats why hes out there he can make three and now offensively getting the job done on both ends of the floor Waterman stepping up with Edwards and Ry Smith both off the floor making plays on both ends of the car Waterman four of his last 14 from three lead goes to 10 now for the vill feels like a pretty big two and a half for the Golden Bears blackshire with four to shoot on the drive shot fake in traffic draws the foul and its going to be on James Scott his first ninth on the card pat pat Kels talked about the def it turn around tell you what Louisville earned their keep on the defensive end here in this first half Cal is shooting 24 from the floor and the reality behind that the first 13 games is pretty much nonconference and Duke who they played in December you look at the last 16 games thats really the turn of the New Year where theyve been a new team on the defensive end of the Music floor during the free throws of Javon black Watcher Katie kresnik the Louisville trainer whos should be getting time and a half for the work shes had to do here this year was out tending to Chucky heon like the fight doctor in the corner theres Scott off the he feet and that would be dunk number 67 correct yep second nationally and thats a play they worked on today in practice with a little screen away when Chucky drives Baseline wide open dunk 67 of his 9 two field goals are dunks this Applause year back to 10 sto yakovich a three nope Roost the rebound C now two of 12 from the give me two of 13 from the threepoint AR coach if they were able to knock down a couple of these be a different game I like how you like how my gu finishing my sentences now respect that couple of years you guys got go Scott again Applause scottley 12point lead 70 seconds to go youre not winning on the road if you dont cash in some of those threes sto yakovich racing through traffic too strong cards might have two possessions heres heurn screen three ball right hes not going to miss him all night and remember the free throws he got an opportunity to see the ball go through the basket at the free throw line and all of a sudden it opens it up from three 7even nothing run Wilkinson trying to snap it cannot hes only got three free throws in this first half and the three ball is not the answer for the cow Bears y time at this point if your mark match you may want to tell your team take three three theyre also 17th and defending the three in conference play opponents are hitting 39 against Cal in ACC play theyre very fortunate that Louisville hasnt shot a great either only 33 4 of 12 from them yep Hadley a skip for Scott heres heord and thats an offensive foul on Applause Waterman man for Chucky he was going to make that one too thats 10 fouls on Louisville with 108 to go it is of note if you watch Louisville plate Noah Watermans been caught more than once on that during the course of the last couple of weeks well Watermans physical hes a physical player he doesnt mind getting a body on the screen however in todays game you have to allow guys an opportunity to redirect and avoid the screen yep heres Wilkinson out front against he 5 seconds left to to go Jeremiah hard drive to the basket fell off the iron sasoko at the horn blocked by Roose and thats that for the opening 20 minutes well what was a tight game Cal got sh so turnovers all that stuff Miss free throws the typ and it feeds right into the hands of the C theyre one of the best in the in the country at turning your turnovers into points on the other end of the floor its a good back door cut theres sto yakovich is second field goal of the ball game yeah nice execution for the Bears out of the halftime break and they needed a bucket right there just head tohe remember now you got Edwards on the floor hes playing with three Waterman is out there with two fouls rain Smith still not on the uh not available for service he was listed is questionable at the under eight Mark and theres a foul on petritis thatll be his third on the post move by Noah Waterman but I love what Pat Kelsey did on that possession you seek out the mismatch Waterman is going to have a height advantage over any of the guards but then when you have petritis trying to defend him at the fourth spot hes able to see over the top finish through the contact not only get a bucket but put the third foul on petritis who missed a lot of the first half playing with those two so Watermans not really a post guy too much so thats a good bucket for them to get hes more of a shooter than he is a post tough cutter and hes got six points playing at his fourth School BYU Detroit Mercy Niagara and now at Louisville college basketball the new world right coach free agency sto yakovich who has really really struggled starting the last six games coming into tonight following a hip injury and illness heres Wilkinson a pullup jumper hes having a frosty night from the floor as well and Hadley the run out with the rebound Applause heres Scott couple of dribbles now Edwards and Terence Edwards working through traffic lost a handle on it shot fake and then that ball got kicked with 11 to shoot hell reset to 20 and stay with the cards well were going to get a long look at Louisville tonight trying to win for the eth straight time and for the 18th time in the last 19 games and theyll need to win tonight to stay even with Clemson who got 21 from Corys guy JayZ tonight in his homecoming game at Boston College theres heurn dropping the three hes now in double figures heurn starting to see a bigger basket now knocked down four free throws and then that led to him getting his first three and now knocking down his second three here to start the second half and one of the better point guards in the country not just in the league in the country blocked off the window by Scott sokos recovery wouldnt go and Edwards fortunately he got away with one there got Soko on the left wrist playing with those three fouls it didnt get called look at Scott set the screen and then Edwards skip it heres Hadley Terrence Edwards will fire over stoak he got 20 even more fortunate he didnt C get CAU for that fourth foul because he gets to stay on the floor to knock down the I think hes had a great year I dont think you anyone will fault you for that one think its going to be tough for Conan nipple on the first team youve got a number of other options as you mentioned Edwards you also got to thank jir Watkins at Florida to stay there number of different guys who have had big years but that fifth spot is going to be interesting and I honestly in my opinion I think its going to come all the way down to Saturday after Saturday games before you can truly vote to see who that fifth first team member is well if FJ Davis has a big game and they be Duke they the hell be the fifth guy theyve been on the run at the end of the year too right yes hell be the fifth guy and by the way Ian shefin had a terrific finish for Clemson Ian shefin had a very strong year and again as we talk about all of these Awards its not only ACC play it is for the year and I think thats what people have to consider when you look at this lural team theyve only lost one game in 2025 yeah thats the Georgia Tech so what theyve been able to do in 2025 has been amazing but they had five losses in November and December well and by the way the race behind Duke which if you get a win tonight by Louisville Clemson and Louisville will be neck and neck with Duke Carolina obviously Saturday night uh Stanford is here you and I will be here at the Y Center for that Clemson has Virginia Tech at Little John all of a sudden you got three teams right there at the top who are automatically in the event at regardless of what happens in Charles but if Im not mistaken Louisville has the tiebreaker because they beat Clon head that is correct yeah Edwards another three sto yakovich trying to keep it alive Scott gives the cards a second chance okay WD if North Carolinas able to beat Duke and they all end up 18 and two and Chucky gets in the lane and Chucky didnt even hear the whistle he didnt even hear the whistle he didnt know he got fouled he was on his way back defensively after the crafty move where he fooled everyone thinking that hes going to run go back out run offense gets the bucket jumps in and hes going back defensively before he realizes they hell be going to the free throw line with an opportunity for the m one so hes got five in the half 12 in the game and the free throw makes it 13 hes five for five at the line by the way so to finish my point if Duke loses yes at North Carina yes Louisville Clemson and the and the Blue Devils all end up 18 and two correct whos the number one seed Javon blackshire knocks down the three first of all youre asking me to do math again which as you know is very dangerous well we know Louisville has the tiebreaker over Clemson Clemson would then have the tie Breer over Duke right and Duke would have the tiebreaker over Louisville it would then go to whoever the fourth place team is they would go then since the headtoheads all in that same it would then drop down to whoever finishes fourth and we dont know who that is because thats to be a battle between Carolina SMU and possibly Wake Forest down the stretch correct so we know we know nothing and and again and and Ill say this Cory weve talked about this intermittently throughout the year for a league that has taken a beating nationally yes the top three gim legit and maybe one or two others could factor into this before were done in Charlotte well Dukes going to be number one and I I love Clemsons team and this team you cant really deny what Louisvilles done this year Campbell three got it DJ Campbells 14th three of the year is his first bucket tonight but it is still an 18point Louisville lead and that was fumbled out of bounds by Kadir trayor so itll go back to the Bears back to back threes for the Bears after black here knocks down one he splits the Trap kicks to the ballside corner Campbells able to knock down the corner three ball and then the turnover allowing the cars to be able to get another bucket as black Seer starts off off the second half the same way he started off the first 80 run by Cal heres heurn into traffic feeds Edwards hell wind back into the lane and score 22 now for Edwards yep 22 now for the junior or fifth year player transfer from Atlanta who played at JMU a year ago where he averaged 17 in the sunb conference player of the year Applause Campbell three ball back rim too strong patrus kept it alive here goes Wilkinson right back into the lane couldnt finish sasoko will a sokos got his second field goal in a half dozen points he just stays around that backboard thats all hes doing the 12th offensive rebound for the Bears in this game out yeah only nine second chance points that theyve been able to convert however but I just think coer flag does everything on the court offense and defense he doesnt have to score to be a pivotal factor in the game and thats there many guys like him now how many of us are thinking that that could be a possible National Championship matchup between that we rematch from the teams weve seen earlier in the in the second annual SEC ACC challenge yeah I I think its its as likely as any other combination at this point blackshire out of the corner for three Javon blackshire now warming up hes got eight here in the second half 18 in the ball game yeah blacks really played very well tonight outside of that stretch where they went eight and a half minutes to not score at the end of the first half hes really been a catless for the team offensively yeah hes got his 10th double figure game against the ACC Hadley a kick out with 10 for heer back to Hadley a mismatch against Campbell whos fighting for his life at the Block Hadley got the offensive rebound press 20 for the cards and heern will gear it down here a little bit Frank Anam eBay checked into the ball game there goes heern on the drive and hell draw the foul and end up into lap of our camera guy right there on the Baseline so blackshire will draw the foul and for Javon the gr transfer from Grand Canyon and Oakland that will be his is second and the third on the Bears thatll put heurn at the Applause line so heon will shoot a pair here six Beth free throw shooter in the ACC misses the front end nice dont forget weve got uh gymnastics for you Sunday on acc Network Elevate the stage youll get to see Alabama Cal Michigan State in North Carolina at 500 theyll be working in bars beam Vault and Flor on acc Network and streaming live on the ESPN app are you blaming me for all that I I was asking you what you what do you know about bars being I thought was blaming me for the curse on H I think thats probably true but Im you know I dont believe in that stuff okay great just but but you did yell out nice well Chucky believes in it thats why he just he thought you jinxed him okay Ill apologize later perhaps Christian Tucker play briefly in the first half and Hadley stole it and here goes Javon layup good head hes got nine now well Tucker was destined to turn that one over because Chucky almost took it from him right and so once Chucky gets away from him Hadley absolutely rips him right out on the island at half court was able to go down and convert it into the easy bucket 15 to shoot for dor petritis all the way along the Applause Baseline back for blackshire oh between the legs got Roose in the airart and hell shoot two thats a vet move crafty Javon blacksher yeah Tucker having problems with Chucky is able to reather it and then of course Hadley just comes over and picks his pocket goes in for the easy layup Chucky was expecting to dump was already jumping with Hadley Hadley choosing to lay that one in they got a non ball handler bringing it up and they made him B so 24yearold Javon blackshire Jr in his sixth year of college basketball knocks down the free throw and Noah Waterman back for the cards to replace Javon hat effective game for black year six of eight from the field four of five from Beyond the threepoint Arc 19 points for him now an opportunity to get to a dub just his second double figure game in the last six here tonight and now hes tied his season high he had 20 against the orange and hes got 20 here now 16point lead it stays with 90 seconds to go or Im sorry 13 minutes and change to go and all of a sudden a foul on black itll be his third its the fourth on Cal Chucky really straightened it out he started slow but hes been really solid ever since number Z they probably didnt hear you at first cuz I had my hand on your cough button because youre over here killing his cough drop right now Im trying to keep my throat going here its a playing under durest playing through pain Edwards feeds water oh blocked to Dort at The Rim but we got to see did Dort stick his hand through the rim to block that one Louisville thinks he did it was close heres sto yakovich on the drive lost the handle got it back blocked by Scott and followed petritis one thing about this cow team and we talked about them taking on the personality of their coach they do not quit they continue to play hard the entire 40 minutes regardless of whether theyre up 10 or down 14 right about that heres Edwards digging in from the left and scores this is a smart play by Edwards yeah using his size to be able to score on the interior hes got 24 he had 27 and 10 assists against Miami last month Music 16point game again black here on the drive slapped out of there but it hit heurn it will stay with the Golden Bears so we see as Dort challenges this dunk attempt by Waterman where is his hand its hard to see from that angle here it is look at our camera guys I I told you that went through that should have been a Goten I saw that from live action I knew that we had to check that one I cant believe you caught one right there you go see you said agreeing with me would make you wrong I know I know careful hey everybodys right once and a while even a broken clock twice a day right twice a day almost 8 minutes gone second half heres Edwards in traffic and they crash the glass dorts got it you know Will Chamberlain used to call the lane the office it was for him CU he used to do work I tell you what you do not need to go in there tonight unless you expect to come out with some sort of ail my gosh and give this officiating crew a lot of credit theyve did a good job of allowing both these teams to be physical Campbell out of the corner knocks down another three the threepoint shooting is absolutely picked up for the Bears in the second half could be too little too late but they have got it down to 13 well what Im going to tell you now Jim and I were in blackburg last week yeah and we saw a game eerily similar to this didnt we Jim oh yeah if the games arent over itll be hard against Louisville but but we saw Louisville lead 12 with 8 minutes to go against Virginia Tech right yes and all of a sudden the hes crawl back can cow pull the same trick tonight well find him being on them for every play so theyre not going to I mean they they can lose a lead thats possible but theyre not going to be mentally losing a league they just might get outplaying a little bit I am proud of you for recognizing shoot around earlier today Im making up for all those shoo rounds I never went to you know what but you you absolutely have made up for it as an announcer showing up a shoot around very attentive yes and of course all the coaches love seeing you coming in everybody wants talk to you about the zone go yes let me also let me also say youre not making up for sh rounds that you had because they were never scheduled this is very true heres sto yakovich in traffic another offensive rebound though and a hell ball is going to go to Cal here Mark Matson I think was looking for a foul from our veteran crew headlined by Ted Valentine with Lee Cassell and Eric Lewis here tonight on the whistle in Louisville I love how you say headlin I think Teddy was old when I was coaching I think theres Theodore on the Baseline perfect initials TV y built for absolutely and sto yakovich and petritis and thats one of those turnovers you got an opportunity to get it to 11 maybe even 10 with a three and you give the basketball back they havent been bad with it only six turnovers in the game but they come at crucial times when youre trying to make a run sure dudakovic is a guy people were talking about being one of the best players in the league one of them in January I was I was there well injury injy took him out and illness took him out for four games and after those four games he hasnt been able to return the Music form for to shoot Edwards on the attack and a foul is going to bail out the cards here Reus metrius just picked up his fourth with 1001 to play it it seems like its a 20point game its not its 13 if you could just make a couple buckets and get a couple stops you get under 10 then you can start thinking about winning Im not sure if the staff recognizes that is patriss fourth foul as and they got a rovic is having a heated conversation with the coaching staff over there he and Adam mazari are having a conversation about I think the offensive play over here on the misread with petrius that resulted in the turnover but I love the fact that hes now being coached up yeah heres petrius off the Louisville giveaway Campbell this is Wilkinson for three and off the mark and he just has not had a strong performance in this game youre talking about an all rookie member will be for Wilkinson averaging 20 points a game in his starts the last 11 games coming into this one and theres the dunk by Roose so the Freshman from DC on the board off the heer assist they like you has all year Chucky heurn just makes the plays to get people buckets heres blacker now with the lead at 15 again for number 14 Louisville Wilkinson at 16 ft shot at 15 that kind of night for Jeremiah Wilkinson fellas Kentucky heurn attacking the paint the nice hesitation and then just easily drops it off has a choice of teammates to give that one to Hadley missfires on the three sto yakovich the rebound hes back in the game to replace bet tritis but look at Kai Rose getting up doing the job defensively pressuring 94 ft Campbell tried to recover his own Miss lets see where this ends up yep there goes Edwards flying up and scoring never mad at the short two points but however when you got your big man running that hard coach I believe thats one thats SC has to get the hammer home okay Edwards is just a scorer tonight hes putting the ball in the basket 26 for Terrence Edwards Jr blackshire T to shoot and a three from the front back rim Miss Campbell trying to find a seam and hes fouled by Kai Roose itll be his second and the third of the half on the cards and Roose getting more minutes the injury to rain Smith yeah and Roose doing a very good job we saw him with the dunk on the offensive in the floor but more importantly seeing him 94 ft picking up I gu Frank is checking in the game coach Syracuse guy my guy here comes Frank ansam and back into the ball game and there rain Smith you see him still sitting on the bench there for Louisville came out to lower leg injury was listed as questionable in the first half and has not played since exiting the game early tonight to be honest with you has a strong contingent of family and friends in the building making a very long trip y its unfortunate for him but hopefully its not going to be something that keeps him out long they will be here all the way till March 25th so well have the opportunity to see him at the ACC tournament as well as at least the first round of the NCAA tournament there theres a look at rain whos from olstone in Tasmania and his mom Penny and others are here made the 9000 M TR Campbell and you have to look at this Wilkinson and sakovich are two for 19 yeah out front Roose a line drive Kai Roose by the way 12 of 47 coming into the game tonight from three uhoh cramp for Wilkinson nope over by Cal uhoh up there it is the Bears want a time out this is how you run the fast break you learn early you give it up you get it back especially when youre playing with the dynamite Point go state right now who beat pit earlier tonight if Notre Dame loses at home to Stanford and the Wolf Pack win in Miami on Saturday and Notre Dame loses to Cal the law the wolf kicks in and NC State would replace Notre Dame and the Irish would not go to the ACC the Irish have not been good at home but I would Id like them to beat Cal if it comes down to that Saturday yeah well Cal is going to go to South Bend tonight after the game theyre going to travel so they will in South B for a couple of days getting acclimated so thats not Applause fun well I mean you know you got to play the game Saturday Coach yeah well you dont have to get Applause thereor heres the drive by Edwards tend to shoot for the cards alive oh Chucky he just shot from the hip on that one well he he saw the Advantage but he didnt throw the ball high enough to be able to get it over the top of Campbell who was guarding Scott that one you just throw it as high as you possibly can allow Scott to go get it uncharacteristic turnover for Chucky 17point lead it is for Louisville 70 to 53 cars LED 15 at the break and let me tell you to see the Bob Koozie award list and theres no Chucky he burn on the list tradical I dont know who is evaluating that but when youre talking about point guard play right this season in college basketball Im not sure that theres been one better than Chucky hurn and when you look at this list I love Mark Sears I love Jones these guys are shooting guards yeah Clayton of course has had a sensational year at Florida as well as Smith and Zigler but when you look at what Chucky does offensively six assists per game but also scoring more than most these guards do youre talking about a dynamic point guard who has his team playing their best basketball late two of those guys on point guards maybe three but definitely not two by the way Terrence Edwards is up to 29 on his seventh three of the of the night and the foul on Soko thatll be the seventh on cow with 554 to so free throws coming career high by the way for Edwards is 30 as a member of The Dukes at JMU he got 30 against Georgia State a year ago in sunb play well hes made it look easy tonight hes had good shots and hes knocked them down and Hadley will go to the stripe after the Soko foul and Lee dorts going to come back in tell you what Terrence Edwards is helping his all ACC candidacy here down the stretch Cory he really is and when you consider what hes been able to do throughout this season look at the last nine games averaging close to 20 a game and thats going to go up 29 and Counting right now his season high with the cars was 27 yeah Miami so hes already passed that one up but the job that hes been doing defensively if you think about what hes done this game alone Wilkinson hasnt been able to get anything going you got to give Edward a tremendous amount of credit on that as well P trius couldnt finish the second chance for Cal off the offensive rebound by the way the Miami game was a game that heern did not play in heres the turnover now blackshire at the other end oh nice shot and layup by Javon blackshire way to avoid the foul ever playing in foul trouble just jumps right over the top of black she to make sure his Black Shear Smiles on the way back Terren went Edwin Moses on black shirt 20point leap for the cards Hadley on the drive fouled by petrius thatll be it for Rus petritis you know nobody listening knows who Edwin Moses is no coach coach its late we got folks that remember Edwin Moses I doubt it just cleared him there you did with good form so petritis is done Applause and Reus checks out with 507 to play and a 20point Louisville lead and here comes M sasoko back two big guys wow theyre going to play Dort and Soko together here Cory well we mentioned that earlier when we were talking about the way Mahon struggle when he got his opportunities in the first half was 0 for three 0 for two from three right and so we mentioned that Mark bass at some point may go with the two bigs on the floor but Ill tell you whats going to happen every shot is going to come from the three perimeter players but its going to be an issue trying to keep those two guys off the offensive glass if they dont make them Waterman and sissoko were already locking arms over here Jim before the first free throw was theyre going to get opportuni to rebound because Cal cant make any shots so therell be rebound opportunities when you got WI in Stak if its two for 22 theres going to be some offensive rebound opportunities cadir tror 25 and the White Checks back in for the cards all right so lets see how this offense works with Dort and sasoko get get a shot up thats get it on the glass and now we got Scott and Dort locked up and see one thing for certain is you cant see sooko now a peacemaker but you we saw we saw Scotts head moving but you cant see if hes talking because hes got the mask on right and so now theyre going to go over and look at was there anything extracurricular the officials going to check the monitor on the action between Scott and Dort on the last possession yeah so before they go to the monitor a quick discussion with our three officials Music starts early with call the floor is a common foul on zero the play is under further review so you do see a SWAT there from dork but the question is does the foul beforehand with Scott grabbing Dort proceede Dort retaliating so this is a better angle for us to be able to see you see the swipe through but then so now thats a little extra you you see the the slap down over the top by dork later thats what got Scott temperature up a little bit but the the original foul I can see that being called on Scott but would not be shocked if there was something extra so the crowd gets a look at the review and well show you what we have here this could be similar okay so watch theres the foul right but afterwards is there something additional from Dort that warrants a technical F were find out all right Music so all right so Eric Lewis has sorted it out and he has said that I was exactly right coach I need you to say that I was right a couple times tonight thats above your average but thats exactly what it is a common foul on Scott but then theres going to be after further review we have a common foul in white zero and a dead ball contact technical foul on Blue 34 that will result in two shots for white in possession of the ball all right so there you have it so now heres my next question did Teddy Valentine get demoted as Lee cell takes over the microphone or is it just based up who call I think they both no I think they both like to come to the microphone so they just split it up well if Im grading them Im going to go with lee lee did a little better job on the mic than Teddy did on his first time Teddy Teddy got a lot going on tonight Teddys running from Mar in Louisville hes talking to the p everybody hes built quite a constituency in the building I can tell you that hes hes not at a loss for words here is Edwards at the line first game I ever had Teddy he gave me a technical on the first play down the court Im sure you deserved it and I I said Teddy he said I just wanted to show you you cant yell at me I said Teddy I wasnt yelling at you I was yelling at that guy over there he said I dont care thats the only technical he ever called on career high now for 31 for Terrence Edwards and the crowd applauding the career high so the technical foul against Dort that was the free throws and now Louisville gets the ball because the foul was issued to Scott right but theyre not shooting theyre not in the bonus yet so so theres not going to be free throw so the technical foul thats it so the guy fouls them and nothing happens theres no penalty and then they get two shots in the ball thats good that means you cant retaliate coach dont get upset about being fou it didnt look like he did that much I wouldnt even call it Waterman coming up on four and a half to go and knocked away and Soka runs it down Applause so heres Wilkinson whos had a rough night from the floor so is STO yakovich for that matter Jeremiah the three and thats good its good for him to see one go down remember there will be a game for the Bears Saturday in South Bend and so again at this point in the game youre starting to build for that next one trying to get some confidence going after whats been a struggle here inside Scott missed the layup going to get a foul called well take a Time Out free throws for the cards who lead by calibby at sou in to see the Irish I tell you what I do not like James Scott coming back on the floor without his mask now again I understand he was upset on the last possession but after the timeout I wanted to see him come back on the floor with that mask on if he didnt need it he wouldnt have been wearing it from the beginning yeah I Im surprised so Scott got the backand of the opportunity not many people have been able to play successfully with those masks on rip wouldnt takeen off coach no rip was one yeah Rip Hamilton mhm would not take it off I know he made a lot of them against me I can tell you that I remember theres the drive Wilkinson couldnt finish it got knocked around got his own rebound back up in traffic hell draw the Applause foul now so those of you James Scott thats fourth foul by the way sixth on Louisville Scott suffered an injury against Miami to his mouth had some teeth knocked loose he had some oral surgery done he was wearing the mask its padded around his uh kind of below the nose around the mouth and that kind of thing but for him as Cory said to take it off because reality behind it is if he were in a position where he didnt need it yeah he wouldnt have worn it for the first 36 minutes to this game correct and so you know if Im on the coaching staff Im like hey heres a reminder put this mask back on we need you especially down the stretch of course a big game here on Saturday with Stanford coming in Maxine REO who will be a first team all ACC performer looking to end his regular season his last regular season the right way and heading into the ACC tournament both the Cardinals both the Cardinal and the gold and bears in fact all three of the new members of the ACC will be in Charlotte next week which Im Im happy for when you consider the travel Im just not happy about the fact that there will be players who participated in the ACC this season that dont get an opportunity to play an ACC tournament thats a bad thing if you you want to expand expand but once you make that expansion everybody needs to be in the tournament and it can be done its a little more cost a little more money maybe a little more time but it h you have to allow teams to play in the tournament agreed thats a privilege thats part of it when you go out and youre recruiting players and you get an opportunity to say Hey listen you have a chance to play in the ACC the most traditional Rich conference ever and when you think about that playing in the ACC tournament the granddaddy of All Conference tournaments you want to have that opportunity yeah its for the players period and were going to get a foul here in the final two and 1 half thats saw Jeremiah Wilkinson so Mark Madson at his bench now sees his rookie send Terrence Edwards to the line whos got a career high tonight and hes two for two at the free throw line Edwards has been terrific and he was terrific early when Louisville didnt have a whole lot with him he scored them all yeah likewise Cal got Javon blackshire going Edwards eventually got some help Blacker didnt get a whole lot of help early he really did not but he made five of the first six field goals for the cards and four of those were threepoint field goals so when you consider it really he was the guy that was the Catalyst offensively but continues to do the job defensively for the cards as well Tucker for Wilkinson a three from the right ouch short that shot hurts and with 215 to go it is a 17point louv the lead and I think the cards can look ahead to a 17th Conference win and a 24th overall here Edwards it rolled off the iron and Dort tried to make the save and its out of bounds itll stay with Louisville well what a night its been for Terrence Edwards 32 Points 11 of 19 seven of 11 from three court now coach if we follow your theory yes like with Chucky having 37 last time out struggling a little bit today offensively are we going to see struggles with Terence Edwards on his senior night on Saturday no I dont think so I think that happens sometimes but I dont think it will okay hes locked in right now well Wes and I will be here doing that game so were going to quote you Ill on that one as well Im predicting he comes out has a real solid okay game couple of free throws coming bredford still forget ACC championships on acc Network continue on Sunday at 800 the ACC Wrestling Championships from Cameron Indoor Stadium at Durham coverage of the finals starts at 800 Eastern on acc Network and always on the ESPN app and meanwhile somebody from Notre Dame made a three to put him up with 18 seconds to go and I dont know who the player is that cover covered Notre Dame this year Cole Serta whos been playing a lot here late off of Micah Shrewsberry bench we saw him in the briefly in that SMU game a couple weeks ago didnt score but did play well his suns out so they needed to go to somebody yep Chucky heons done pretty good night 16 points seven rebounds five assists for hurn all league First Team point guard sir yep no no debate here is Tucker for Dort out of a double team of Anam and he sails it in the seats yeah could be tough to get to that one one thing that Louisville does they they double team quite a bit and they get back and recover they dont usually give up like a guy cutting to the basket they do a great job of D and getting back to their man and that hurts low post trying to score yeah they work on their double team their post traps and whenever you have a coach with the energy of Pat Kelsey you dont have a choice but to play with that type of energy and what he said today in the shooter round before the shoo or after the shooter round that they practice that trap every day even early in the year so that its ready its not something we just put in for a game thats something you have to do whether youre doing that or pressing you just cant put it in for a day or two you have to kind of work on it most of the Year Edwards to the line for two more remember now peon had what 37 here on Saturday mhm hes trying to catch up with Chucky yeah Terence Edwards knocks this down hes going to have 36 tell you what if Terence Edwards comes out and has a performance anywhere near like this on Saturday he could be that fifth member on that first team all because again you consider that Louisville is absolutely going to be a top three team but could be the champ could be the number one seed and so when you look at that this is an opportunity for him to make a name for himself and be on that first team Poss absolutely youre right re Ball Deep Wilkinson too late yep eight for Wilkinson the half 11 in the game hes got his 13th straight double figure game but its a 17point contest yeah the problem is with this one it took him 15 field goal attempts to be able to get there only made two of them Hadley on the drive bounce it in Hadley 10 and the half for Hadley hes got 17 tonight Campbell skips it Mahoney a three air ball so Spencer money misses from deep and Notre Dame has just beaten Stanford so Notre Dame will go to the ACC tournament and the darling of last year NC State will not get there that is correct number 33 d so the field for Charlotte has been determined before the final play date in the regular season calendar but seeding still not determined a l to from one Saturday let me tell you we are a long way from seting all right lets just hold it out here and let it go no were not going to do that no sir well you got to get one of the guys that hasnt played a shot yeah we got eight m our man Patrick Antonelli is on the floor Logan Sherman is out there our Cole Sherman and Spencer leg have all come on the floor with 30 seconds to go and youre ahead at home you just hold the Applause Music ball and theyre out there with aacar trayor by the way and Aiden M will not get a trillion nope Aiden M by the way tonights his 24th game native of Charleston he played 12 games a year ago did not attempt a field goal coach I like that kind of restraint man who knows his role I think Cory went 12 seconds in one game that he didnt shoot it was like unusual absolutely 12 was a great number to go to by the way coach Matt dler going to check in for uh Matt dler is going to check in here for Cal hes a senior from Oakland hes playing for the fourth time this year I think when before he decided to go to Virginia he had in his contract that he would take the first shot contct well you know verbal verbal contract Ill stop you at the LIE coach keep telling it cuz thats
