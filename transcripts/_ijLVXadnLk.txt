The Patriots and the Hokes Dorne matched up with Adabio at midcourt and we are underway in Southwest Virginia A rare meeting Two teams that like to get up and down the floor Both averaging over 80 points a game If you like offense this could be the game for you But theres some defense Tyler Johnson making his presence felt the block and come away with the ball And you have numbers on the other end Theres the starting five Dorne drawing another start in place of Laauo Hanssberry coming OFF THAT BIG NIGHT IN Colia picking up where he left off Gosh hes stronger than Adabio but quicker than Allenbach Thats a tough matchup for George Mason in the starting five for coach skin Talk about the great guard play and theres the 611 Riley Allen Spock in the middle Yeah he hes been a nice addition but a very athletic team and a team that can play a lot of different ways They can play big or put Presley at the four and play small Here is Long Maryland transfer All five starters for George Mason have transferred into the program at different points Five on the timer Long with three cheering Great defensive possession that time for Virginia Tech Hands buried WATCH OUT cheering Too quick for the big guy Too strong for the other guy Coming off of a 22point outing in the ACC SEC challenge Allen Spock can hit the three Not that time Kyler Johnson with a big rebound Dorne got out there and contested Allen Spock on the three Johnson held scoreless George Mason is really good Five on five on both ends of the floor Dorne chance for a threepoint play That the international connection Hbury a mix up there on the ball screen Hansspir says Thank you very much Bench loving it And the crowd snorts enthused early Heres Dorne 33 on the year Makes it 7 nothing Hulks First true road test for George Mason That was a concern of coach Skins when we talked to him pregame Coming off of a win against Cornell in which they scored 99 points Presley a career night against Cornell Not that time off the window Nice contest at the rim His rebound running the other way Awfully good in transition cheering Johnson didnt establish his feet There is the head coach of Virginia Tech Mike Young Its been a busy week for his hokes down in the Bahamas and then the quick trip to South Carolina Yeah he said that was a really tough turnaround and uh weve talked about this stretch of for Virginia Tech and a lot of big games a lot of tough games and I think theyre learning a lot about their team but this will serve them well in ACC play Patriots looking for their first points Skip pass corner three front rim off the mark Yeah the Patriots with Ellington already in the game Thats a little better matchup for them against Hanssbury in my opinion Dorne lost the handle Allan Spock the defense inside Dorne getting more and more minutes because of Tony Little being without Long drills the three Hes 54 on the year from distance Long and Mincy both shooting over 50 I dont know that Ive seen that in a back court George Mason not only do they make a high percentage of threes they also take the right threes cheering Dallas coming off a season high in rebounds against the Gamecocks Bedford open Dorne second chance opportunity The offensive rebounding is something Virginia Tech has done much better this season than they have in the past Number two thats his first Well George Mason coming off of a fantastic year They almost won the A10 falling to VCU in the title game Tony Skins doing an outstanding job at his alma mater Yeah 120 them 27 last year and tied for the A10 regular season title Almost the NCAA and of course hes very familiar with the NCAA as a player and a coach and having success there Yeah a lot of success Im sure well go get into that later Hanssbury gets it back finishes with the right hand Hansberry kind of had that feeling that he could have a big game and hes off to a great start for coach Young cheering Allen Spock that time is true Yeah And that was not a good job by Dorne He knows that Allen Spock is a threat to make that shot Coach Young very unhappy with Dorne on that play A transfer from Sanford makes it a threepoint game Early offense for both sides Dorne great catch and hes going to draw the foul Allenbach with the rebound Itll be Patriots basketball when we come back Off and running on a Saturday Thanks to Mara And there you see before injury after injury Toby Low he does a lot on the floor Yeah down 15 points down seven rebounds But Coach Youngs really think he really thinks okay offensively He really misses the defense and the rebounding though Glad to have you on your Saturday afternoon Off and running Third ever meeting the Patriots and the Hokes late in the shot clock Hill Ball State transfer inside They go to Ellington Misfires Yeah Gerdock in for Dorne He was paying a little closer attention to Allen Spock laughter of Dallas tries to find Gerak Itll stay with Tech for Virginia Tech I thought it was interesting We talked to coach Young earlier today Mack He said hes told his guys Hey just be yourselves Nobody needs to do anything more without Toby on the floor Yeah Yeah Yeah Just just be the better version of yourself and uh everything will take care of itself and and several people have Weve talked about Hammond uh uh shoot has played a little more minutes and both Dorne and Gerdak also getting some more time and uh a couple young guys but but play them well cheering Johnson late in the shot clock SPINS FIRES YES BEFORE the horn Got the mismatch right there A little bit quicker for Johnson against Allenbach on the ball screen cheering Three reserves on the floor for George Mason Troutman like a starter Corner three Hill high arcing Not that time And theres Tyler Johnson Yeah Hookies have done a great job on the defensive glass Shoot Handsberry Hes hot early again Miscommunication on the ball screen that time George Mason has been really good on the defensive end in the half court That time there was just a lack of communicating Cory Mincy leading the 810 in scoring nearly 20 a game He can really shoot it the step back shoot with the hand in his face Theres a strong rebound from Nick Ellington the Murray State transfer Yeah really good Long athletic posts Kind of old school scrappy Shoot did a good job of contesting that shot by Mincy though A Dallas through contact Patriots take it back Matt quickly wrapping up the Toby Laauo conversation for the Hokes offensively How is it most different without him on the floor Well it most of the time its different because both Gerach and Dorne are down low So their men are going to be down there Takes away some driving opportunities but also gives the Hokes a chance to establish a little bit more post play Hooks by five George Mason team can score 83 a game And the baseline jumper You bet Jari Longari from Satan Hall to Maryland now at George Mason Yeah missed last year with an ACL but a really talented player Mincy and Long have been one of the best back courts in America so far this season Dallas guarded by Troutman Nice defense from the grad students Oh Troutman is so good He is a great athlete Ive done Troutmans games the last few years while he was at Nor Eastern and he can guard all five spots Hes that good an athlete and that strong and uh that was a tough matchup He got the better of AD Dallas on that play We mentioned the great guard play for George Mason Jiari Long you see his career breakdown Yeah hes been a couple good places played a lot of good competition and hes playing at a very high level right now for the Patriots Ellington Long will give and go Another possession late in the shot clock for the Patriots Theyll have seven to work with Yeah really nice job Again the Hookies are very active on the defensive end And I think thats uh going to be pleasing to Coach Young If the Hookies are good on defense they can get out in transition And of course that thats one place they will miss Toby Lew too He is so good in transition at finishing Step back three Ellington rejected Hanssberry meets him at the rim Got a couple backups in there in the post but both good players Conga as well as Ellington be the second guy off the floor Hanssberry a veteran play George Mason just four for 14 from the floor to start two for eight from distance Again they shoot 41 from behind the threepoint arc Yeah theyve been outstanding and of course led by the backcourt Mincy and Long Theyre trying to get the shot clock straight now I dont think it was 18 I think it was less than 18 but obviously we have our best people on it right Weve got Roger Ays Jamal Spearman and Kellen Milliner Oh apparently it is 18 Conga Hill brought hand in his face and a late whistle Johnson hit the hand Yeah Hill is a great athlete Uh could very well be a starter on this team Not a not a great shooter but you cant bail him out right here Hes shooting a fall away at the end of the shot clock Just go straight up contest the shot Wow He got him It was barely wasnt it laughter cheering George Mason 76 on the year at the line Hills missed some games because of injury Had a leg injury missed five games so far Not fully back in shape according to coach skin but uh but pretty darn good A guy who averaged 15 a game last year at Ball State Mack maybe whats most fascinating about this George Mason team nine and0 on the year is they dealt with significant injury Yeah And at one basic returning starter Braden O Conor and he got hurt in the very first game So all these guys are new You mentioned the starting five All five are transfers and theyre picking up full court now Back to a two3 zone Hammond coming off that big day against the Gamecocks Too easy Ball screen Nobody rotated up to help Hammond wide open Virginia Tech will take that shot every time Hill active early behind a beautiful screen sets him free to the 10 Yeah nice action right there on the back back side Van Hammond with 16 points against the Gamecocks Clutch both offensively and defensively Mason back to manto man paying a lot of attention to shoot Hanssberrys been featured often Johnson from the foul line Hell go to the line Fouled on the Jay Yeah he fouled the jump shooter on the other end This time its Ellington sending Tyler to the line Back and forth start first half Virginia Tech and George Mason to win both on the mens side and the womens side The Tech women with the big win over Florida shooting two Tyler Johnson was fouled on a jump shot for the media timeout Coach Mike Young after the game against South Carolina talking about Tyler Johnson he said you know he was quiet but hes not typically quiet He said typically hes pretty loud and he said that wont last long laughter Barton we got a good game This is exactly what we expected And I think what might be most interesting for those just joining us George Mason led by Cory Mincy averaging 20 points per game Mincy scoreless just one shot here in the opening nine minutes Yeah the Hogs have done a good job Been several different people on him right now Its Ben Hammond with that duty Theres Hill The defense from Sincere Jones who just checked in Loose ball Second effort Emanuel Conga Top 100 prospect out of Mount Zion Prep That was a really good play by him Virginia Tech had gotten physical in there on the contesting the shot and the rebound but Congo came away with it and in a crowd got that ball in the basket Shoot Oh good job by Long closing out on Shoot cheering Shoot has been playing really well among the leaders in the ACC in shooting the ball from long range Contested triple Jones fights unable to pull down the board Conga has it Yeah Jones is a guy you know the fans havent seen him a lot but hes got a lot of ability Hes just so young but he may get a little more of a chance with Lauo out and there is HAMMY STEPPING IN FRONT OF THAT PASS AND HAMMOND UP AND UNDER Just missed but he does draw contact Boy that was tough Troutman is one of the best defenders out there and hes long strong and fast and he got there to contest the shot but Hammond did a nice job of hesitating and watch him take it to the other side try to protect the basketball and thats how he was able to draw the foul What great camera work How much fun was that Lets go over to Tamara You see how fast he was going down the court It reminds me of our conversation with him during shootound today when I said Describe yourself Ben He said Fast pace I like getting the ball up the floor quickly And he did exactly that 100 Its his 20th steel of the year which is top four in the ACC Coming off a great game like we talked about against South Carolina Elite quickness quickly Biggest difference Ben Hammond year one to year two Just consistency He had great moments last year playing great more often this season Jaylen Bedford is set to check in at the scorers table Hokes by four Hesitating is Presley and under the basket Chance to convert for the Patriots You know we talk a lot about Mincy and Long but Presley he he might still be the most valuable player for this What what a great defender Hes a good decision maker He he likes to drive it but can shoot it from three Uh hes really a good player and he can play multiple positions He can music literally play one through four along with a guy like Troutman also a great athlete in high school track and field Ran the 400 meter 800 meter part of the long jump and the triple jump Not surprised just watching him play basketball cheering Makes it a twopoint game Shooting under 50 from the free throw line No problems there Looked good shooting those two 44 may be misleading Abdollis has been kind of quiet Jones a little short up ahead pass Ellington Presley through two defenders ties the game A really nice play again Head up in transition of Dallas Scoreless has taken just two shots Weve played 11 minutes and we havent decided anything Abdales straight away He wont be quiet for long Thought we might be hearing from him Thats the first triple of the afternoon for the Hokes Malik Presley with eight Allen Spock goes to work on the freshman Theres Hammond to help defense AND ALLEN SPOCK SOMEHOW COOL CALM COLLECTED He just took his time didnt he Looked a little old school Good footwork Its one of the first things I wrote down about him when I was watching some of their early season games Out of Providence Day School a fourstar went to Sanford now at George Mason Hammond from distance Its not that time and with the push off on the backside That is his second Everybodys straight up Allen Spock just takes his time Head on the rim Really nice Thats absolutely old school You see that in the wreck wreck you know department down the street Transfer from Sanford didnt go with bucky ball to Texas AM chose to go to George Mason and he is a nice piece for Tony skinpoint game eight minutes to go first half glad to have you Evan Hughes Mcc McCarthy and Tamar Brown

Blackburg His first points of the day Ben Hammond hasnt let him have any space Gave him just a little bit right there And of course Mincy backed up a little bit That was a long three First lead of the afternoon for the Patriots And the reach and foul on Jiari Long Yeah See how deep Mincy is Hammond just a little bit late Hammond watched the ball just one second too long and didnt get back out there in time to find one of the best threepoint shooters in America Bedford trying to find Hanssberry Well defended inside of Dallas looking for another triple Too strong Boy both teams are really making it difficult to get an open shot Mincy downhill traveled Now the Hokes have shot about 50 but they had a bunch of layups early in this half And a developing story of this first half Antonio Dorne on the bench with two personal fouls Yeah and the Hookies have gone smaller and uh well see that that you know thats a little chess match going on on the sideline between Young and Skin Hanssbury teardrop wont fall off the window and then Mincy tried to pull it in lost it Yeah Hanssbury was in between shooting it and kicking it to the corner to Tyler Johnson Didnt do either one real well You see he even looked to the corner just down to the side of his eye But an unforced error for George Mason gives it back to Virginia Tech down two of Dallas Skip pass Hammond Excellent concentration to keep that in play but George Mason able to finally come away with it cheering Hill guarded by Bedford cheering Three starters on the floor for the Patriots Theyre taking a lot of these possessions deep into the shot clock Yeah and thats because of really good defense Bedford Hulks love to push the transfer TAKES IT ALL BY HIMSELF and kisses it off the glass Really nice job Defense was on their heels Bedford kept pushing just 11 points over his last three games Bedford first points of the afternoon Mincy open Nice close out Theres the offensive rebound Allen Spock fouled Yeah hadnt been a lot of offensive rebounds but a couple critical ones and Allen Spock going to the free throw line Foul on Dallas Yeah a couple Patriots going after that ball and Allenbach creates a little space and ADA with the reach in George Mason only averages about 10 offensive rebounds per game Theyve got six in the first half Yeah for the most part Virginia Techs done a good job but uh there have been some opportunities for coach Skins team Theyre also accustomed getting to the free throw line often They averaged 28 attempts a game Top 20 in America Great guard play Entertaining first half partner Yeah and and we thought it would be You got really talented teams off to good starts and a lot at stake in this game Early season kind of resume builder Lets go to Tamaro Theres a foul Well get to Tamara here momentarily mismatch down low Quicker than the big guys like we talked about Stronger than you know if you get a wing stuck on him down there And now lets lets try again Tamara you got us Evan do you got me We can hear you Oh I love it Welcome to the party Tamara Well you guys were talking about this fun start to this first half against the Hokes and the Patriots Whats interesting to me is that in the Bahamas the Kokes had slow starts in all three of those games They were trying to dig themselves out of a hole Today its a onepoint game and they havent been in that same scenario and something coach Young talked about those first four minutes Any coach will tell you very important to a game Big crowd here on a Saturday afternoon Got a lot of big basketball games today A few big football games too No doubt The snow is not keeping anybody away No I think they heard the heat was on and the Patriots have traveled well Terrell a lot of lot of green and gold out there His trailing by one Bedford left wing three just a little too strong And then Hanssberry is going to pick up his first foul Yeah good execution Got the shot they wanted And then the foul on Hansberry Send the Patriots to the other end where you talked about the fact that they get to the free throw line This time itll be Presley They also averaged 21 makes a game 12th most in the country today Five for six at the line Play close games that can that can be a big factor cheering Theres Hanssberry Nice box out Yeah that was more like that 44 that we saw you know for Presley Made two really nice ones earlier though Hammond weaving his way through traffic drops it off for Hansberry and floats it in with the right hand What a nice twoman game Hanssberry buried his man underneath the basket Great post position First player in double figures on either side Hill dribble that almost out of bounds cheering Under 10 to work with on the timer Presley with three THE SOUTHPAW TO THE RIM AND theres Abdales with the block and then Hammond Big collision with Mincy Yeah both both people going for the ball Mincy just a little bit late I think Mincys a little bit frustrated not only with the call but the fact he only been able to get three shots off Hokes have been paying a lot of attention to him And what have they been doing well defensively Well ju just knowing where he is What a block by off Dallas The outlet pass right here Bang bang play but theres no question that that fouls on my little defensive back wide receiver situation right there We got pass interference on number three 15 yardd penalty 15 an automatic first down He can coach he can officiate and hes got jokes Matt McCarthy ladies and gentlemen Ben Hammond following up his great performance on Tuesday Four points in the first half Sinks the first as the Hokes earn the bonus Little football reference as a lot of folks around here excited about football with James Franklin being named the coach here Bit of buzz around uh Blackburg Big National Signing Day on Wednesday Huge National Signing Day Ois did extremely well The new staff in place or nearly in place Patriots down by three Northeastern transfer Troutman stripped on the way up off of Virginia Tech cheering And as good as he was at Nor Eastern when he came out of high school he was the third best recruit in the state of Maryland a top player for a long time Yeah he hes been fun to watch Uh played for Bill Cohen at Nor Eastern transferred closer to home cheering Look at Hammond Minc he gets it all the way out near midcourt Just three points Averages 19 Hand in his face Too strong cheering Hammond Quick and well read Its Troutman on the defensive end and hes fouled on top of it Back and forth first half Hokes by three We get that last media timeout before the half Messiah Troutman throwing to the free throw line cheering 89 on the year for the senior cheering Monty Hanssbury leading scoreer in the game with 11 Meanwhile its been balanc scoring for the Patriots Nine players have scored Yeah the Hokes have done a great job against MY That thats big news Virginia Tech with a very small lineup out there now Really Tyler Johnson sort of the center Hanssbury the four and of course Abdales gives you a little bit of flexibility being a 69 point guard even though right now Ben Hammond is directing this offense And for more on the top score for George Mason Cory Mincy heres Tamara Brown Mack mentioned that the Hokes have done a great job on Mincy and when we were talking to coach skin he said you know its funny like hes done great going from the Big South to the A10 Hes still a great scorer You think he would go down when youre when youre changing conferences but instead his point points average have gone up Guys in a big way Big piece this year for George Mason trying to get back to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2011 We thought from the very beginning that it would be tough for George Mason to match up with Hansbury and that has been the case Shoots so dangerous off those DRIBBLE HANDOFFS THATS WHY OH and Troutman did a great job of finding him in transition and contesting the shot It did not matter Good defense better offense that time for Virginia Tech shoot 44 from distance Fifth best in the ACC Hokes by six cheering High low pass not there Thats Johnson inside defensively Yeah battling a much bigger Ellington cheering And theres the seventh offensive rebound of the first half for George Mason Active hands from Johnson And Abdales comes away with it Hokes with numbers cheering Johnson extra pass Shoots Step back three Yes Time out George Mason Hookies are really good in transition Very unselfish And they found the open man Hokes by nine An 80 run for Virginia Tech over the last 70 seconds Jaden shoot big reason Yeah and and the both teams combined were four for 16 from three until the last 15 seconds and Jaden shoot said Ill get that percentage up Backto back threes A little separation for Virginia Tech here toward the end of the first half Now lets go to Tamara Brown Coach Young likes this combination thats on the floor right now with Tyler Johnson at the four and Ammani Hanssbury at the five because this allows Jaden Shoot to be on the floor more often Hes playing really well and you see in those last two possessions how he was able to capitalize Mincy stops the run cuts the deficit to seven Yeah he stayed after it He was trying to jump start himself Missed the first shot but got it back Another offensive rebound for George Mason Dallas guarded by Ellington Little bit of a mismatch Step back from the logo The rebound from Troutman Nice rebound by Troutman 5050 ball He came away with it Lets see what Mincy can do Reigning A10 player of the week Kicks it

70 in the second half in the win against Colgate WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DROP OFF PASS ANTONIO DORNE emphatic slam And again Hanssbury caused that They had to rotate to stop him from getting a layup and he made the nice pass to Dorne You havent seen the real Antonio Dorne yet This guy could really play Hes just getting acclimated to the United States game Only played seven minutes in the first half Picked up two fouls And there you see as theres a triple for a threepoint happy George Mason team outscoring opponents by 35 in the second half Yeah And and Bedford was on him that time really wasnt all that far off of him but you have to get up in Mincys face Ben Hammond did a great job in the first half for Mike Young defensively against Mincy Johnson elbow jumper rebound George Mason Long Allen Spock 10point game Their center beat everybody down the floor They recognize it took advantage This teams not going away now Theyre 9 and0 for a reason And almost a foul there from Mincy Bedford the right hand the floater No THE STICK BACK PRETTY FINISHED Tyler Johnson Yeah offensive rebound Something George Mason did in the first half Virginia Tech with a big basket there early in this second period long Better job by Dorne closing out on Allen Spock Reigning 810 player of the week Cory Mincy Presbyterian transfer Tough shot No problem from the elbow Yeah Bedford didnt get a hand up A little confusion on the ball screen He was in position just didnt contest the shot like he needed to And you knew Cory Messi was not going to stay quiet Theres the foul against the Patriots Theres

Jaylen Bedford step back three Hand in his face that time from Mincy on the defensive end cheering Abdollis the bounce pass Bedford Yes with the right hand And again turnovers hurting They havent had but six turnovers the Patriots have but seems like everyone Virginia Techs been able to convert on the other end George Mason was averaging a little over 14 turnovers a game first four Theyve been under 10 every game since Really good Both of these teams have been really taking care of the basketball Theres Hanssbury forcing a turnover As I say that Virginia Tech comes away with the steal Ansberrys got three steals in this game Johnson the corner three Its true cheering The extra pass Mike Young basketball 15point Hokei lead Largest of the game Bedford with a better job right there Staying with Cory Mincy Presley up and under Miss fires JOHNSON OPEN LANE WATCH OUT THE LEFT HAND TYLER JOHNSONS fired up Hogs have been good all year in transition And I tell you what Abdales didnt

a second half team outscored by eight here early and Hill too high on that crosscourt pass Yeah certainly the first time theyve been in this situation this season Well see how coach Skins team responds This is a good basketball team won 27 games a year ago Like you mentioned got beat in the championship game of the tournament And this is a whole new team though Only one returnee from last year And hes hurt right now Johnson has that taken away There you see George Mason looking to start 10 and0 already the best start How about Christian Gerak under the basket held his ground Hookies have numbers Hammond wanted to find shoot The bounce pass the give and go and Hill the right hand lay in Nice play right there Threeon one Unselfish Mincy gave it up Had the layup but his teammate had

for Mike Young Hill the lob Little too far behind Lets go to Tamara Brown who heard the last Virginia Tech huddle Tamar Yeah I was over listening in the huddle and the message coach Young had to this group was stay the course Youre playing great basketball Youre making great shots And they looked over at Gerdak who was checking into the game and they said there needs to be no drop off in rebounding You have to go to the guys The step back three Ben Hammond Nine for 18 50 for Virginia Tech And George Mason was the team c coming in that was shooting so well Long step back from the ACC stripe Doesnt get the friendly roll but a foul here Mack as much as weve talked about Tech offensively what have they done against one of the best backcourt duos in America Mincy and Long Its just been attention to detail knowing where they are knowing what the action is and how they were going to handle it And there have been very few open looks from that back court which which came into the game averaging over 33 points a game Coach Young not thrilled with the whistle as we see Roger Ays coming to join the conversation and you know a good official can say one word and the coach just walks away Thats thats what a good official does right there I think asking about if that was on the shots Yeah it looked like it was on the rebound Emanuel Conga the freshman Yeah very highly recruited freshman Conga and Gerock going against each other down low cheering Konga the only freshman thats seen minutes today really in that rotation include Devin Booker Its a lot of transfers and upper classman for George Mason Yeah but but Konga is a very highly recruited young man whos going to be a good player for coach skin He has 37 rebounds coming in second most on this Patriot squad Allen Boach back in for Conga A little zone action A little 131 You see the George Mason transfers Theyve brought in a lot of talent from a lot of great programs Hammond kick out to Bedford doesnt get the roll Theres Sincere Jones into the hands of Gerak creates positioning and is fouled on the way up Good job of battling in there by those two freshman Sincere Jones is another guy who who could get extra minutes with Lao out Theres the three and go get that rebound Jones after it Gerak the recipient clears a little space gets to go to the free throw line Hadnt been there a lot this year Of course Gerdak had that big 15point outing against Bryant Hes got seven points over his last five games including today We talked with his former high school teammate earlier this morning Ben Hammond reunited in Blackburg Yeah pretty darn good high school team Gak now eight for 10 on the year despite not many trips there Hes got a good stroke and I just ruined that for him Have to insert myself in there No such thing as the announcers Jinx No theres D Mincy the lob Allan Spock Guarded by Gerak Geraks not giving any ground Nearly a steal Instead Tyler Johnson who has 11 points five rebounds Mack Coach Young talks about how he affects winning Well take a look at the foul first Wow They may have missed that one They dont miss Benny but they may have missed that one Quickly on that point why does Tyler Johnson affect winning Uh he he hes strong hes tough can play multiple positions Left wing three off the mark of Dallas trying to set Shoot up but George Mason was very aware of where he was Dallas is looking for him Shoot wants it Right side of the rim Yeah good screen by Hansbury Got shoot as wide open as hes been really BEAUTIFUL BOUNCE PASS ALLAN SPOCK MISSED THE DUNK WOW Beautiful execution Hanssberry on the other end Too strong Back and forth High arcing triple You bet Jiari Long Yeah And going back and forth you sometimes lose where youre at That time Tyler Johnson got a little too far away from Jiari Long How much as a point guard are you keeping in mind Shoots having a day from behind the arc Oh 100 You Youre looking for him There they are looking for him HOKES WANT TO FIND SHOOT THATS WHY ANOTHER NUMBER THREE HIS six of the day A career day for Jaden Shoot All 18 of his points from behind the threepoint line Many up top the 61 for Allen Allen Spock that time gets it to fall Yeah nice job Protected the ball on the other side of the rim Smart play veteran play The junior out of Charlotte The extra pass Shoot Hanssberry of Dallas And the rebound Mincy turns Johnson was there Might have got a piece of it applause Hammond draws a whistle on Sipkus and were going to break snorts One of the best ways you can Our chemistry its getting better every single day I would trust anybody on this team with my kids guys He did say that Yeah great point Tamara How about that from Ben Hammond Matt Im telling you But I think uh they had a good conversation earlier and uh shes been able to share several Ben Hammonds Thats why shes the best How about that tough finish through contact out of the timeout Theres Cory Mincy a big reason why George Mason feels they could return to the NCAA tournament for the first time in a decade Yeah theres no question Off to a great start This is a wellbalanced team Theyve got lots of answers to all those questions that that coaches have and opponents will present but they theyve got scoring Theyve got balance Uh I I really like this team And again theyre going to get better later in the year when Braden O Conor returns Youve got Fat Hill coming off of an injury still getting back into form This is not a finished product for George Mason No Messiah Troutman still you know working his way back Sprained an ankle missed the first couple games Uh this team can beat you a lot of different ways on both ends of the floor Virginia Tech has been hot from three though and thats been the difference in this game Dorne lost the handle in transition Presley left hand finish Yeah Presley so good Dorne a little slow to get up Presleys hes a we talked about it earlier He he could be the MVP of this team despite the the really good scores that they have like like Mincy and Long and of course Allan Spock such a presence inside and theyve got depth Youre going to need that in the A10 which we know is one of the best mid major basketball leagues with some great teams at the top and also some great depth Oh yeah we saw one of them earlier this year against Virginia Tech VCU handled some business always good Dayton is good Played Virginia today Uh St Louis you know there so many good teams in the A10 No look Skip pass for Bedford and a foul on the Patriots Cory going against Cory Mincy We talk so much about the A10 Mentioned that George Mason trying to get to the NCAA tournament They were so close last year falling in the championship game to VCU But theres a guy who knows a thing or two about winning in the NCAA tournament There you see head coach Tony Skin who was part of the Final Four team 20 years ago 20year reunion Uh its fitting that they they have come up with another really good team that could go back to the NCAA And I know they have some some special events around that anniversary coming up He was so good That team obviously Jim Larenga the head coach and an assistant coach you might recognize the name James Johnson who would later become the head coach of Virginia Tech Exactly We see him regularly here on campus at Virginia Tech And Tony Skin missed the first game of that tournament but was a a big factor in them getting all the way to the final four You think about some of those old CA battles George Mason VCU DCU Old Dominion Richmond yeah UNCCW There were some great teams back in the day And you think about too the the Commonwealth of Virginia mens and womens side Weve seen some great final four runs in this state Sure have One of them right here in Blackburg when Virginia Tech women made it all the way to Dallas BCU been to the final four George Masons been to the final four Old Dominion women to the final four Couple of national championships in the 80s Mincy the shot fake Long lost it on the way up How about Hansbury active tightropping the baseline Boy its been a really physical game Both teams competing at a high level Shoot Thought about it You hear the oos and from the crowd Gach fighting for positioning Cant lay it in Gak take it on the veteran Allen Spock down low Drop off pass Allen Spock doubled Johnson nearly got a piece of it and Abdales does BEAUTIFUL BOUNCE PASS JOHNSON BRINGS THE CROWD TO THEIR FEET Or Abdales just makes the right pass at the right time He doesnt even have to score to be a big factor in the game Six points six assists three boards for the freshman star Ellington will be a big piece of this team with experience and the finish Boy I like him a lot at the grad student The transfer from Murray State Big lefty of Dallas Hanssberry The head fake Kurtak with one hand Almost tipped it to himself Hanssberry stepped out of bounds Neo of Dallas so creative in how he can facilitate Yeah If its in the open floor he will find the open man and hit you in stride Little bit of extra hang time for Tyler Johnson And Abdales after he threw that bounce pass watch him kind of curl at midc court there He Oh he knew He knew it was over Ive seen him do that in the half court Throw a pass and start to the other end Mincy averages just under 20 a game Good job defensively about shoot against Mincy that time Presley met by Gerak Stepped out of bounds Itll send us to the under four Immediate timeout The Hokes up by double figures thanks to 18 from James Shoot His last name Im sorry Careerhigh six makes from distance Dad jokes are the worst arent they We like a good dad joke Come on laughter Hes three points away from a careerhigh Against any zone youd like to get the ball to the high post The other possibility is penetrate Hammond late in the shot clock Johnson already in double figures Missed the straightaway look Yeah Mason is showing zone Playing zone for a couple passes then going manto man Virginia Tech recognized that Got a good shot but didnt get a second shot HAMMOND SWIPES IT AWAY TOP FIVE IN THE LEAGUE and steals HELL GO DEFENSE TO OFFENSE with ease Hes been playing at such a high level We talked about the game he had against South Carolina where he made so many big plays in overtime in that victory in the ACC SEC challenge Bench production continues to be a positive note for the Hokes today Yeah To 23 24 I think now Mincy long three on the way and true 51 on the year Hes got 16 points I think thats the first time Hammonds given one up and and I was miscalculating 30 points off the bench for Virginia Tech this afternoon Coaches like you youll take that number Shoot in and out Almost a big basket for the career totals There hes on the defensive end Knocks it into the hands of Hanssberry Mason trying to force the action a little bit right now Couple turnovers Uncharacteristic turnovers Johnson Hookies dont mind going deeper in the clock Spins on Mincy Stripped on the way up Hansberry Hammond The shot fake The teardrop wont fall Good job using the entire clock getting a good shot Troutman fouled by Ben Hammond Roger had the whistle We had a nice conversation with him before the game People tracking him all over the country arent they If youre not familiar with the Roger Ays ref tracker its on Twitter Over 3300 followers And we asked him about it He said Im curious to know who runs it I think he runs it Im just Im just kidding One of the best He is one of the best local product but uh hes been good for a long time As good as there is in the business Troutman met by Johnson And thats a whistle That could be 3 seconds And it is Yeah applause they kept that count going and it didnt count as long as he was making an offensive move As soon as he gave it up that was three seconds George Mason came into this game one of the one of 13 remaining unbeatens in D1 one of three mid major low major ranks Hes still going to have a really good season Learn from this in transition unable to finish the alleyoop And another turnover going the other way The Hokei faithful Good crowd here in the afternoon on a Sunday in December Saturday Its a weekend Yeah A lot of games youve got to call the womens game tomorrow You you know it all blends together 60 seconds to go One minute to play One minute to play shoots LOOKING FOR HIS SEVENTH THREE DOESNT GET THE FRIENDLY BOUNCE Thats true In the corner its the freshman Devin Booker applause and cheering Half second different shot clock and game clock and the equivalent of taking a knee in football Dribbling the shot clock out Unfortunately just a little bit of difference between these two Theyll take the turnover right here Or not Hammond all the way Rejected and the horn will sound For the first time in over two decades Virginia Tech beats George Mason
