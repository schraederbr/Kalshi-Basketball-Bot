G Davis against Ben Middlebrooks Bill Covington tosses it up Paul mcneel controls the way we go NC State in the road red here in central New York we check out the starters for Kevin Pats a second straight start like we said for Paul mcneel Dantes Styles and Jaden Taylor average double figures and styles has been hot recently coming off 22 and 10 in that win against Wake Forest where NC State was at its best offensively Nick Neils long two in go and Eddie lpin the rebound for Syracuse we check out the starting five for the orange led by Starling at 182 points per game the fourth leading score in the ACC jquad Carlos bounces for Jer Davis the fifth year senior the Delaware transfer with a size advantage on Styles now Starling on the drive couldnt get it to go but stick back off the offensive glass for Davis thats where the games going to be one tonight its going to be one in the paint going to be one on the glass s has that size Advantage they have not been a great rebounding team on the year so you know the nail and off especially on the offensive glass mic so to get one of those early off that Starling Miss is big huge Focus coming into the year for red Entre improve the rebounding going to be Paramount tonight middle Brooks missed it against lpin whos got another rebound and the orange pushes with J quad Carlos the hopster transfer for two in transition caros I like that little something early you know get ahead of that NC State Defense the ability to push for a Syracuse offense that again can struggle at times in a half court McNeil no hes missed his first couple he was 48th in our ESPN 100 for two freshman Starling loves to go in the right hand from the left side he missed that one andc state back the other way Jaden Taylor through some contact no whistle fouled twice nothing called for Jaden Taylor Syracuse back with it up by four in the first two minutes theres Lucas Taylor from righ he missed the jumper Michael oconnell says he got a piece of it the pack back with it oconnell coming off a career high 13 assists Saturday and he does get fouled and we go to the line red atrey year two after the 47 years of course of Jim beheim what do you make of where Syracuse is he chatted with red a little while ago well first of all theres no better human being I mean red ay is as good as it gets as a man in the profession look I think injuries hurt them early JJ Starling being out early now Donnie Freeman not being there I mean thats highend talent that has not been in this lineup consistently and and I think both these coaches are dealing with guys they got in the portal up trans transfers transfers coming from mid major programs who the adjustment has not been easy for you know and I think for red you know Jer Davis has not given them nearly the point production I think they were hoping for jquan Carlos Lucas Taylor I think the adjustment to this level has been more difficult for those guys than maybe they thought were going to get into that throughout the night the portal and the future for both these programs in particular with Syracuse and thats kind of the buzz around college basketball circles right now is what are you doing in the portal and whats your front off so to speak look like so Syracuse with it up by three first three minutes here at the Dome Carlos at the controls the cerebral point guard for Davis dribble hand off for Taylor shadowed by mcneel and now Starling around the lapkin screen Starling corner kick Davis it down and a good start for the orange he averaged 17 points a game and seven rebounds at Delaware last year hasnt been that kind of a score but theres a versatility to his game weve seen him post up early in this game and there he hits a face up three Middlebrooks goes spinning on Lin and Ben Middlebrooks has the first NC State bucket 610 senior in his second year with the pack after transferring from Clemson they dont hes not a back to the basket guy they dont throw it into him a lot but two post UPS to go right at Eddie lampin early in this game forc lampin to have to defend little Brooks comes out on l big key for Middlebrooks staying out of foul trouble as he bangs with the big bodied Fife senior Eddie lampin underneath just burrowing his way to the cup and thats what he does the best when he catches it in that mid post is that extended dribble I mean hell take 150 dribbles and if you dont come in double if you dont come with a second Defender hes just going to use that 265lb frame to bury you Styles a Miss its not totally dissimilar from DJ Burns in 100 Carlos round a couple of screens lkin going to work on Middlebrooks lkin still with it just pounding that basketball good hands from oconnell Carlos took it back five to shoot Carlos off the heesy foul Lin and its blocked by dant styles to help Defender what a reaction by styles Applause okell floater wouldnt go he got the stop from Styles couldnt pay it off at the other end for NC State and the lid on the basket for him so far well a quick shot and NC State plays fast you know but I I think if in that particular if theres not a layup not an attack to the rim a midrange floater for Michael okono you can work for a better one and NC State team coming off 85 points Saturday their most against a league opponent this year and then Starling in the midrange and thats where hes at his best you know that open side pick and roll from the wing him going middle pulling up at that foul line very efficient from there most productive season of his threeyear career second at Syracuse and focus number one Kevin Keats was telling us this morning had shoot around as you would expect for NC State defensively shot clock below 10 middle Brooks on a face up this time on lampin missed that Davis clears it so fast end to end great Rock great catch l in for two and a timeout NC State excellent start for Syracuse at home the lead is 10 the first five plus minutes Music and en Music Applause get Applause number Eddie Lins been a double double machine hes got four points and five rebounds already well just look at his size I mean hes going to be a monster when he gets it around the rim and hes very good with that extended dribble and look at him run the floor a part of it is Ben M Brooks is Picking Daisies Im not exactly sure why hes not sprinting back to fight Eddie lampin because thats one of the things Mike youve got to fight his catches fight his deep position and then make him work in that extended dribble but you see the production I mean he just hes really tough especially on the interior flip side of things for NC State feels like the offense was running through Ben Middlebrooks yeah I dont understand you know three three shots from middle Brooks early two of them post UPS against 611 265 part of the reason they havent theyve come away empty on a few of these possessions Kevin Keats goes into the bench here Dennis Parker Marcus Hill and Brandon Huntley Hatfields on the floor but we get a foul away from the ball on Dennis Parker Jr for Kevin keatss team look at that reaction says it all its been that kind of season for the pack at 4 and 12 following up last years run of the final four well you never know who you can count on uh this year I mean thats one of the reasons he goes deep into his bench cuz youre kind of throw trying to throw things at the wall and see what sticks whos going to make a shot whos going to play well he said theres not a lot of Separation on players three for 10 in our rotation Davis couldnt muscle it in past the high effort Dennis Parker and the pack runs Connell directing pass first point guard told he had those 13 assists Saturday career high he was Raven us a che around about how well they shared it as a team good pass out of the post from Huntley Hatfield and backed out to the leading scorer Marcus Hill a second game in a row coming off the bench for NC State midrange back iron and a battle on the boards and an offensive rebound to Hill backing down and Huntley Hatfield cleans it up McLoud comes over to block that shot and then just a wide open basket for the followup and then Brandon Hunley Hatfield reaches around and commits his first foul and thats its a silly foul for a thin NC State front line I mean that was one of the things Kevin Keats was talking to us about inconsistency so Brandon Huntley Hatfield has not played well the transfer coming over from Louisville and then staying out of foul trouble especially you know against this front line for Syracuse just a silly reach in trying to to deny nem McLoud at the elbow Kevin Keats told us he was very concerned obviously like we said with JJ Starling but then the physicality at the four and five positions for Syracuse compared to the pack 7 fo4 is some physicality from nahem McLoud with the bucket and the lead is 10 again for Syracuse nice pass nice job rolling to the front of the rim and keeping the ball High by McLoud theres Jaden Taylor gave it up for Parker stick a three and hes not known for his shooting but Dennis Parker steps up with only his eighth triple of the season they all believe these guys who come in Off the Bench all believe that they should be scoring State coming off their best game shooting the basketball made 133s and that win against wake the other day theyre most in the lead game in more than two years nice no look from Carlos and McLoud the hammer Applause theres Trey Parker one of those guys who likes to get shots up off the bench it is going to fly from Parker spun it out McLoud clears it so ninepoint Syracuse margin eight of 13 shooting from the floor and Nar a turnover for the orange just yet good Skip and heres Bell up where he left off especially in the first half was so good last week in the loss against pit Taylor got tied up good hands from Peter stovich and a held ball will give it back to Syracuse he McLoud having it set up on a silver platter nice weapon to have when you got 74 right at the front of the rim he dangles yeah he dangles there he is again S three good halves together coming here well we know the hot streak they got on last year its now its about getting it its amazing shows you where we are in expansion of these conferences that we have to show a TR of chances to get into the conference tournament yeah used to be a given no longer out of all 18 teams that we have the option to see there imagine that ninepoint lead for Syracuse and a kick on the feed from Carlos these bigs rolling down the middle of the paint have been wide open for Syracuse its one of the reasons that they are dominating the paint and scoring there so far is that breakdowns in ball screen defense I think its in part I I think theyre staying with the ball too long and I think the help side is not coming over heres Bell gives it up to the Freshman from Serbia movich and now Carlos off another screen Hunley Hatfield got back to my storage shot clock winding down Carlos with five to shoot between the legs step back tough shot and it goes for jquad Carlos quad Carlos its nice to have a guy especially with Starling not in the game a guy end of clock to go make his own shot create his own shot its an 11point orange lead with only two points from JJ Starling Parker wanted another and the rebound to Kyle cuff who pushes for Syracuse attacking in transition cant happen NC States defense has been not good to start this game in the half court and the N you had three guys back nobody stopped the basketball all the way to the rim one on three by Kyle C Parker for Dennis Parker and now Taylor little separation from Bell but the F not there offensive rebound run down by Dennis Parker driving on moud with the Applause reverse Parker can get it going I mean again these guys come off their bench believing they should score 66 hes got really good positional size McLoud missed the bunny Denis Parker with five on an average of 28 per game and only played 5 minutes off the bench Saturday against wake heres Hill the Lefty got it its a good thing he hits those shots and he does I mean he he wants to play in the midrange but thats a a long two off the dribble early in the shot clock its not usually how you draw it up its a lot of jump shots for this NC State team from twopoint range Bell on the Baseline Drive Taylor digging at it Bell Rises and connects hes such an important piece and red arrey was telling us pregame they feel like they found something with him coming off the bench in the last month or so he has been better hes shooting the ball better and its good to see him there he can get onedimensional M Cloud the block on Huntley Hatfield the orange pushes Bell might have got away with a push off there C no ice on the Applause reverse NC St in transition the hesi from Hill McLoud has made a huge impact on both ends C all alone got fouled by Trey Parker that was a good foul Kyle cuff cherry picking and and you made the point nem has done a really nice job since hes come into this game barely has to jump yeah just got to stick those hands up in the air when youre that size and then the cherry picking Kyle cuffs good foul you at least make him earn two from the foul line and so cuff to the line 78 this year har college basketball Sonic Blockbuster Saturday on ABC ji broom and number one Auburn in Lexington to take on number 17 Kentucky at rup Tigers lead Florida and Alabama by two games the coverage starts at one Easter in the SEC keevin Kats comes back with hockey Subs you know well Mike you got two hockey references in dangles is that a hockey reference it is yeah like a guy dangles oh you you sound like PK suban hockey Reinventing the world you dont own dangles come on four was a huge hit everyone knows that we got Syracuse Crunch fans listening all over its a takeway for cuse and heres Bell off the shot F Bell attacks and finishes with a foul thats more variety in Chris Bells game as well well he he put put it on the floor on the on the shot before theres the steal cuse has got some stuff on the break here in this first half and then teams are going to fly at Chris Bell because of how he shoots it show you he can put it on the floor you know he has not had a good year he has shot it better of late shooting 44 from three in conference but you know part of the inconsistency with Syracuse you got to stop JJ staring what are you going to do with Eddie Lin and then you have to take away Chris Bells threes so when youre that high on a scouting report Mike teams are going to fly at you and I I think Chris Bell is finding life a little bit more difficult when theres that priority on his three than he did last year hes got five of the 28 for Syracuse long one didnt fall for Brion pass the senior backup guard but another second look at it for the wolf pack okono comes to get it fifth year senior to the corner Styles way too strong the weak side rebound for Chris Bell and SE is just one of seven from threepoint range so far in this first half my SC not on the same page with Chris Bell and its a Syracuse turnover the first one tonight 2812 is the C lead here at the Music Dome and only the second one since 1970 so how does Syracuse close out this regular season and then what could they do in the conference tournament Dantes Styles way off from deep but another offensive rebound a gon pass got fouled by Chris Bell you know at some point NC States going to have to put their head down and drive the basketball they have been so threepoint heavy against the defense that has a hard time defending their paint and they have no Rim protection especially with nahem McLoud not on the floor thats one of eight from long range for NC State eight of the 22 shots from Deep pass with a runner Ron pass the senior guard Syracuse has not defended their paint well this year I I think I think you got to start putting your head down if your NC State and start testing that you said it they did it and you mentioned now this game might be one at The Rim and in the paint one way or another Starling backs it out we intend to shoot Starling and Lampkin only combined for six yet the 14point lead for the orange Starling drives kicks it out shot clock winded down Bells got to get it up short and the rebound hauled in by pass heres oconnell hiding behind the screen of Middlebrooks out high for Paul mcneel pass lets it Fly wide left style sword for the rebound but he traveled as he lost his footing its a good call it was a hell of a rebound yeah hes been a he has been a bright spot dant Styles you know hes finally come into his own 66 210 lbs and he had some really good moments this year was really good in that wake win the other day and that was a heck of a rebound un un fortunate you you lose your balance Kevin Keat said Styles was completely locked in focused on Saturday thats why he had the 22 and 10 and four triples like we said lpin bang it again with middle Brooks lkin got fouled and its rled out and he really Eddie lampin really wants to go over that left shoulder like I I think if youre middle Brooks you have got to you have got to get on that and force him back to the Baseline but NC State not bringing that double they kind of went over a few different variations at the shoot around the morning they wanted to double from the Baseline but if you never get him going back that way like we said Eddie Lins going to take 150 dribbles to get to his spot second foul on Middlebrooks so hell exit I want to go back to what you just said and what you saw at shoot around today for NC State so when when do you think the Doubles going to come and from where yeah middle Brooks has to get higher and that Doubles going to come from Dantes Styles not that deep send it from the low side you got on theine absolutely when when Eddie lanin is out a little bit higher than the paint in that mid post Ben mid Brooks got to shade his left shoulder forceing Baseline then you can run that double and rotate behind it well it was a split at the line for lampin lead 15 for Syracuse L by 16 in the first half last week against pit heres Bell commits his second foul itll put Brion pass at the line that was a big part of the conversation we had with Kevin Keats this morning when the double was going to come because he was so concerned with that physicality from the likes of Eddie Lampkin just pounding away at that basketball like you pointed out know the other thing for Kevin Keats with this start when you are a team that has not won a lot theres a maturity it takes to win a game and then go on the road and this is an NC team that has not played well on the road this year to go on the road and follow that up to validate that wake win with a win here tonight it takes maturity and NC state has not shown that at least in their start in this half those two wins they picked up recently both home wins its the team that has dropped 11 of 12 had a niname losing streak the longest of Kevin keatss tenure and trying to get the first road win of the Season here in central New York Starling Bell Davis lampin and Taylor Lins another foul and see State wanted a travel on Eddie lampin didnt get it theyve really gone heavy to Eddie Lampton especially with Donnie Freeman no longer in the lineup know there you overextend try you know Brandon Hunley Hatfields got to play better I mean enough is enough man I mean that was just lazy old defense youre not going to steal that ball and then you put your teammates behind you in a bad Music spot senior in his fifth game back from a shoulder injury forced him to miss five games total over a couple of different stints didnt go on their California road trip Kevin Keat said to him look you you tell me when the shoulder ready and uh Brandon Hunley Hatfield now back in but the minutes down since returning and Eddie Lin is good on both and hes had his way here in the first half with seven points and five rebounds Paul mcneel and Brion pass initiate for NC State pass navigating oconnell backs it out looking for somewhere to go its the ball screen from Huntley Hatfield oconnell back out for styles styles cant connect and dantz styles is over for three from long range Starling and ola Taylor moved it Starling aome good ball movement and run down and offensive Applause rebound Carlos directing Lin wanted it and Davis is saying lets go back to the big fella matched up with Styles big size Advantage squeaked one through Taylor couldnt pay it Applause off who steps up for NC State to get the offense going here late for first half mcneel a turnover Carlos the kick Starling Rises cant Barry it McNeil the rebound Hunley Hatfield directs approaching four minutes to play until halftime okon catch and shoot for Michael oconnell his first bucket love to see him get a little bit more aggressive I mean hes a table setter he wants to be that pass first guy hes coming off some of these ball screens in the paint I think hes got a shot like Conors got to I think hes got to be aggressive to score a little bit here second year with NC State after three at Stanford Carlos couldnt connect with lpin and the door cracked open here for NC State pass and hit from deep and NC State just looking for that shot to fall again I I I think you got to drop that I like I think youre open sometimes for a reason your NC stay youve got to continue to press the is for cuse to have to guard you in the paint Starling for lkin right down the lane just banging with hudley Hatfield he bodied him he is bullying this front line especially Brandon Hunley Hatfield in this first half just absolute bullying nine points eight rebounds for Eddie lpin in 11 minutes pass driving and what do you know draws a foul Eddie lampin I Love Lamp brick are you just naming things in the room and saying you love them I Love Lamp I Love Lamp I love L I knew it was coming like your setup I knew was coming that was well played where am I run so Syracuse in its last game last week they had a 16point first athlete theyre by 14 here on NC State with 252 to go until halftime and uh your guy straight out of Anchor Man Eddie lampkins having his way nine points eight rebounds hes been such a fun guy to watch throughout his entire college career and we asked red autrey about that pregame and he put it like this that guy no matter what you see you know is always going to be with you in the pressure moments in the Foxhole as he put it thats the type of guy he said that you know what youre going to get from him every day yeah hes had a hes had an interesting career in college you know TCU was on a very good Colorado team last year a very good offensive Colorado team and he ends up here at Syracuse and and when he Embraces who he is we we got here pregame he was out going around the world shooting threes I started to wonder what the game plan was but hes got a great personality and its uh hes finally I think come into his own Kevin Pats told us this morning he said Im going to tell Eddie lampin pregame please shoot shots from the perimeter because I hope he does that and I hope hes not bullying our guys down on the Block joke this that he was going to tell Eddie Lin thats what the scouts wanted to see that has not been the case here in the first half hes been on the interior as you would expect there Kyle cuff believe that a dozen cuff attacks missed it and okono rips it down for NC State heres Bryce fur freshman who reclassified he spins one out and its two of 12 from threepoint range for the pack when you bring a lot of guys off your bench those guys come in and they want to get their shot off so again this idea of wanting to drive the basketball weve been threepoint heavy those guys on the bench dont realize that theres a triple for Syracuse and its Lucas Taylor first points for Taylor and the second three for s Syracuse and the leads back to 15 seven different guys have scored for Syracuse in this first Applause half theres oconnell and now Hill summoned the ball screen around it cop shadowing him hill with a follow away that he gets to go marus Hill three straight games in single digits for Marcus Hill their leading scorer and we told you a second straight game Off the Bench you asked Kevin Keats how Hill has handled that and Kevin Keat said but outwardly hes responded well to it he can inject the offense for the wol pack Davis went down to the deck but he was out of bounds and good energy defensively from Bryce herd and it was a well time double you got Davis to spin Baseline you brought that double from the Baseline and you forced a Applause turnover so 115 to go in this first half here at the JMA d two teams right in the thick of it trying to make the league tournament at the bottom of the ACC its a foul on Lucas Taylor who was trying to run with Jaden Taylor so 16 fouls aside with 106 to go until half time thats blank comma man well leave out with the eight letters red is displ thats two uh Taylor so oconnell Huntley Hatfield Taylor Hill and herd the five on the floor for Kevin ke okell same spot missed it this time and cuff one arm the rebound for the orange Syracuse is really gapped up in the half court I mean they are know they are forcing that kick and its one of the Reas NC States taking a lot of free Taylor brocked it Davis kept it alive Lucas t on the dve toal and NC States had a hard time keeping the ball in front they have not guarded the ball very well in this first half 3 and 12 seconds separate the game and the shot clock here at the end of the first Applause half High middle ball screen from hudley Hatfield okell some of that aggressiveness you wanted from Michael oconnell and he sticks the jump shot Syracuse has got to go and then they take a timeout they use it or lose it with 65 to go well take it as well were back in 30 dont go anywhere Music Music Music what have you liked most about this first half for Syracuse Id like the balance and we mentioned seven different guys put putting points on the board for them tonight and theyve you know theyre up 13 with JJ star Ling 105 and only two points you know theyve ridden Eddie lampin at times these other guy and theyre you know defensively they have executed their game plan you know again it has been a team that hasnt defended the paint well waiting seconds Kyle C and it roll off and thatll do it for the first half here in central New York for the pack to begin the second half oconnell with post entry for Ben Middlebrooks going to work on lampin and a foul chance at three for Ben Middlebrooks and a good start for NC State 18 seconds out of halftime well they start the second half like they wanted to start the game they went to Middlebrooks three straight times to open this game on a post up he came away empty but they start the second half going right at ell Eddie lampin and how about that over the right shoulder with his left hand four combined points from middle Brooks and Huntley Hatfields in the first half and Kevin Keat said to us this morning weve just been inconsistent at the five maybe Middlebrooks can give him a lift here in the second half with the pack hovering down by 11 Starling comes to get it you said quiet first half but that in slow Syracuse Starling with a good look and Davis follows it upis this game can only be won by NC State if they start getting some stops together and and you you stop that first shot by Starling but you cant gather the defensive board middle Brooks had it roll off and Starling pushes for Syracuse in transition Davis whos got seven points gets back from Taylor and heres lkin face up physical play as these two continue to bang and middle Brooks reach the round fouls on the floor yeah you know and thats the third on that play I mean there are sumo wrestling down there what is Ben Middlebrooks supposed to do here you know youre supposed to call the first foul like theres two dislodgments and then Middlebrooks ends up grabbing him but youre supposed to call the first foul not sure what Ben Middlebrooks is supposed to do and a guy whos dealt with foul trouble all season sadd with those three and now this one goes on dant Styles its his second for NC State I mean its a collision every time its Lampkin against middle Brooks either end of the floor really and you kind of have to Kevin Keats was telling middle Brooks that this morning youre going to have to take it right in your chest but at some point that dislodgement has you know it puts the defense at a real disadvantage and this is not really on B middle Brooks at least with the third but it is the way its gone for him this year something Kevin Keats continues to talk about with Middlebrooks in the front court that in terms of foul rate per 40 minutes hes at the top of the ACC heat theres a bouncer nature to Ben Middlebrooks game but theres an unrefined nature to it at times and look he was a role player last year thats been thrust into that starting role this season mcneel that roll off shows some frustration Syracuse back with it Taylor now playing at his third School lamp in off the short roll no and Middlebrooks a strong rebound four points for boards for Ben Middlebrooks ell like he want to pass while he was in the air but he shot it Syracuse back with Applause it red Entre used the word deliberate with us pregame about how the pace has gone recently with their offense slow it down here and initiate in the half court Carlos Tribble again with it they said it was deflected and mcneel runs for NC State Jaden Taylor oh he plays hard for the pack mcneel knifing through top finish Paul mcneel hes going to stay aggressive now he is talented and hes going to be a really good player and I I think it was a great move by Kevin Keats putting him in a starting lineup and getting him some reps there down the balance of this season told us he found out 10 minutes before the game on Sat that he was going to start assistant coach Brett Nelson came over and told him and he told us it was amazing I just made the most of my opportunity Davis down to that basketball and hes got a chance at three these two guys keep ball pumps like air pumps in business yeah talk about giving the ball a headache but thats what they do if youre not coming they are going to use their bulk to bully you and thats the matchup that that Davis Styles matchup where Davis got about 15 lbs on on Dantes Styles hes now got three like Middlebrooks and so its going to be Styles who exits here and Kevin Keats will go with the two bigs together Ben Middlebrooks and Brandon Huntley Hatfield together first three minutes of the second half think about the guys that NC State Road offensively last season DJ Burns obviously and and DJ horn I mean those two guys you can ride them late whistle and a foul is called on Syracuse I think this year part of the struggle for Kevin Keats is you dont who you going to go to you just dont know I mean one game Paul mcneel comes out gives you 24 you know Marcus Hill can be that guy at times its just been no consistency for Kevin Keats to go to on the offensive end like he had last year hes come out and said it he said no disrespect to any of our players but we dont have a superstar on this team says we dont have the guy who can go get you 18 a game and I think an interesting question for NC State as a program going forward what do you prioritize in the portal is it the highend Stars you put your chips in the basket of a couple of really topend players or do you spread the money around and try to add guys and see who you hit on because it is a gamble in this day and age going after anyone in the P I think you go after highend and if its one or two guys in a game of basketball theres only five out on the floor at one time like if you have LeBron or Steph Im using those as examples that one guy can affect the game two guys can absolutely affect the game Kevin said they havent had that star power this year dbrooks on the Baseline with a jumper and hes got a half dozen and four since halftime 4431 the Syracuse lead show from Hunley Hatfield Starling Quick Change of Direction good hands from mcneel then a close out Taylor uses Starling go Connell on him heres a switch Starling on the drve got bumped Applause two hey are ESPN th Prime Time womens basketball double header starts at 7 Eastern with the Tobacco Road rivalry game with number eight North Carolina number 16 Duke at Cameron indor and then South Carolina rank six in the country is in Oxford to square off with Old Miss JJ Starling good on the Applause first Junior from nearby Baldwinsville just 20 minutes Northwest of here starlings get onuse Carolina so the lead 15 first four minutes out of Applause halftime Taylor runs off the screen got to specify which Taylor you got a lot of Taylor out there Jen Taylor with the entry for Huntley Hatfield over the left shoulder no kep the line by Middlebrooks bringing great energy here in the second half midd Brooks on the face up couple of jab steps spinning a double comes and a held ball will give it to Syracuse really nice play by Lucas Taylor steps in and earns possession for the orange feeling good hes up by 15 at home Music i like to thank you know our our staff you know John W hack Tor and them for for being Forward Thinking to getting a general manager as soon as we did because you need to be able to do that in this landscape of you know transfer portal all these things and I think um you have to your staffs have to grow and and we are and so uh you know I know were headed in the right direction and uh you know well be fine you know but you know I think Alex will do a great job um hes doing a great job um and well continue you know were building this thing we building it to be strong and to get back to what we all know this thing used to be and what we wanted to be you know I like to thank you know our our staff you know John W hack toor and them for for being Forward Thinking to getting a general manager as soon as we did because you need to be able to do that in this landscape of you know transfer portal all these things and I think um you have to your staffs have to grow and and we are and so uh you know I know were headed in the right direction and uh you know well be fine you know but you know I think Alex will do a great job um hes doing a great job um and well continue you know were building this thing and we building it to be strong and to get back to what we all know this thing used to be and what we wanted to be that was Adrien atrey three weeks ago talking about Alex Klein hired this summer to be the general manager came from the New York Knicks where he was a scout hes doing his best to hide from from us right now there he is um but general managers have been in the news this week with North Carolina hiring one highprofile and thats one of the big questions around here is kind of the the future now of this program good recruiting class coming in obviously but with that position what is Syracuse look like this being year two for Adrien arrey well I think the fact that Syracuse and North Carolina two of the biggest brands in college basketball no way tells you a lot that theyre going this route and it also tells tells you a lot that it took them this long to go to this route because I think these are two programs that were so used to their brand carrying the day I mean John Shire did it immediately when he got to Duke but again the fact that Duke has to have one brand doesnt matter anymore this is so transactional that it really and its sad to say it comes down to Dollar figures and you cant miss Mike like you I think hitting in the port right now is so much more important than hitting guys out of high school unless youre getting Cooper flag like you cannot miss in the portal and part of that is we talked about it with both these teams where youve got mid major guys coming out of the portal to your programs where they just were not ready for this level big question for all these programs but especially here at Syracuse going forward by the way Ben Middlebrooks with four fouls iss on the bench for NC State and those longrange shots still not falling for the wolf pack I think thats why maybe theres some Syracuse fans who say look its never been quicker to flip a program immediately in one year and thats maybe some of the angst and consternation for them and to your point you just got to hit in the portal youve got to hit in the port and you have to have money to pay those guys and I think you know coaches are coming around on that like I I you and I have both met Kevin young whos the coach at BYU who had no college experience came right at his the NBA spent all of his coaching time in the NBA hey so hes used to personnel management like hes looking at this Landscaping College athletics saying well yeah I mean this is what the highend Talent should be they should be compensated and hes ready to hit the ground running I think for a lot of coaches in college who have spent their life in college it has taken a while to come around to this new environment and I think youre starting to see especially these bigtime Brands saying look our brand or playing in the JMA Wireless Dome or the dean Dome like thats not carrying the day anymore and coaches will come out and say that to you as well I just had Kansas Colorado a couple nights ago and those coaches are talking about the same thing like the same things that resonate with high school players just doesnt anymore Kevin Keat is talked about that we went to a final four okay like that hasnt changed who they can get its about the money under gra one rolls off for Marcus Hill but an offensive rebound for Hunley Hatfield ish doof is into the game and he draws a blocking foul Jer Applause Davis getting some run here with Ben Middlebrooks with his four and now Gard Davis has picked up three for Syracuse six minutes gone by the second half hes had a good day so far 13 and six Hunley Hatfield on the face up on L there you go what you like it was decisive it was aggressive it was athletic it was taking the fight to the Applause Music defense triple hand off for JJ Starling uses the Lampkin screen Huntley Hatfield showed Starling kicks on the Baseline its Carlos just no protection at the basket straight line drive from that that left left corner and no protection the leads 17 for Syracuse one off what was the largest ACC lead at any point this year off the Trey Parker Miss Bell got to the cup biggest lead in conference play this year for Syracuse and its 19 in the second half Tre Parker back for du first year player from Quebec that was kept alive to Huntley Hatfield he backs it out for Marcus Hill NC State trying to hang around Applause no Lankin trying to establish early post position against to Davis and its last Touch by lkin Leading his case to Justin Quarterfield but thats not an argument Eddie Lin is going to win shows you playing with a motor do you know not giving up on the play ah he may have an argument I think it would stand up at a court a law I think it would too zeid your honor all right so Trey Parker doof Styles Hill and Brion pass the five for Kevin Keats sifting through those lineup combinations hes got both bigs in hes got both bigs out right now Trey Parker connects from long range in his first Points Guy who been quiet the last three games but put together some big stretches against Duke and out in California lkin has the size advantage on dof we get a foul call Eddie lampkins drawn his share of fouls tonight well thats where if you put two hands on him theyre going to call that a foul on the defense its the one where Ben Middlebrooks is taking it in the chest Im not quite sure what the defense is supposed to do l this guy is a load 611 265 describes himself as a great communicator he has said he feels like hes one of the best Talkers in the country he doesnt mean trash talking just the way he communicates for his Music team spin cycle and finish only five buckets since halftime for NC State down by 16 Starling will direct for the orange around the court great finish you know we asked Kevin Keats today what has been the most consistent part like what can you rely on game after game with your team he said look our our scoring and offense will go up and down but our defense has been solid it has not been good tonight Syracuse shooting 53 and these drives I mean theres been no help doof not enough Music deserve Kelly shoeer comes into the game and so does uh one of the best freshmen in the country Diana terazzi Music one of the top stories in sports we say congratulations goodbye to Diana terasi announcing her retirement from basketball bball after a simply incredible career threetime National Champion look at a Young Gino orama at Yukon the alltime leading scorer

between the formative years of womens basketball the formative players the Nancy liberman Cheryl Miller Lisa lesie Rebecca Lobo to the modern game to what we know now you know the Sabrina Jesus the cait Clarks Angel Reese like di Diana terasi to me is that bridge she modernized the game you know when I first saw her like you would watch her play in her early years at Yukon You be like man thats different the way she would handle the ball the way she shot it the way she her swag shes the great I mean obviously the winning and the numbers all tell its own story but just her impact you cannot write the history of womens basketball without Diana terasi what a career well said so cool to see the outpouring of Celebration just over these last couple days Syracuse just turned it over wanted a foul and T Styles Rises up and hes got backto back buckets and this time a chance at three his foul troubles taking him in out of the game and he hasnt shot it well up until this point but you know again he he has been productive for them hes their leading rebounder on the season given him about 10 points a game he has shot it well of late seven threes combined in the last Applause two again his career of course at North Carolina then Georgetown and now NC State who will extend the pressure down by 13 and a pick great read by Trey Parker cant knock it down and a rebound secured by KY C Syracuse with numers Starling on the gas Bell dropped it off lampin draws a foul sort of a microcosm of the night for NC State you get a bucket bad turnover L to that shot would have liked to have seen him attack the basket and a threeonone in the other Music direction shot this is an NC State team offensively for the season that has shot 32 from three they taken 17 threes in this game of their 49 shots from the floor theyve only knocked down three triples again sometimes youre open because the defense wants you to be and and I think the priority for for Syracuse tonight was they were going to be gapped up limit access to that paint and when thats the case those kickouts are there and NC State became a volume threepoint shooting team Eddie lamin just piled up another double double you look at the Syracuse annals in terms of records with double doubles l and keeps climbing last eight games coming in averaging 12 and 1 12 points and 12 rebounds styles again hes starting to cook its an 11point game with 10 the play Starling in trouble turned it over somebodys got to come back to the ball come to the middle of the floor I mean it caught off guard by this press and if youre NC State youve got to convert off of these turnovers this has to be your moment here and red arrey is sensing that so hell take a timeout well step aside were back in 30 seconds NC State on the move Music Music last time it was single digits 941 to go in the first half weve got 942 to go in the second half NC State trying to get back within single digits yeah two turnovers against the pressure Kyle cuff not coming to the ball you know sometimes a team will slap a press on like this and itll catch you off guard on your heels and thats kind of what NC state has done itd be nice they didnt convert convert off for the last turnover it be nice to convert out of the timeout here and Syracuse comes out in a two3 zone for the first time all game theyve used it 7 of the time this season used it a little more than that last week against pit Hill got a good look he missed it Parker to the loose ball Trey Parker attacks and Hill recovered scored and its down to nine NC States got the juice right now Davis got it into Carlos Davis breaks the pressure Bell couldnt hit it lamped in the offensive rebound Davis cut and Davis underneath muscles it in for an answer just cant secure a defensive rebound on the first shot you get that corner three a quick possession forced by the pressure cant come up with the defensive board 18 for Jer Davis Styles can he stay hot yes he can its down to eight M shot allows you to set up this press Styles has 11 all of a sudden for NC State Syracuse breaks the pressure to lampin going to work on hudley H just bullied him Eddie lampkins got that look in his eye Bon pass shot fake Styles hes red hot and backs it out for NC State keeps it in his hands Styles back iron kept Alive by Hill pass battles with Starling who ran it Applause down NC state has seized some momentum Syracuse trying to fend off the wol pack s and a half to go in the second half Lin feeling confident going to work passed out of a double starling met there by Hill staring connects and thats who JJ starlings been nice double to to stop Eddie lampkins momentum when he caught it on the Block end of clock late clock theres JJ Starling creating a but he had missed sorry Chris nine straight threes before that one fell for Starling Styles moved it Hill Applause Starling will slow things down for Syracuse just took some big punches from the Wolfpack as Syracuse stabilized go back to lampin throw it in there and let that create offense he had his hands on his hips set the screen Starling tried to drop it off but Hill was active Hill pushes for Applause Styles pass came up short I mean two straight possessions two threes from guys who should not be taking them Dan you play a lot of guys they all want their shots youre going to take a lot of bad ones youre on pass 0 for four from long range NC State as a team 5 for 22 Carlos was shut off and now Starling late shot clock you said it hes been the guy for Syracuse All Year Starling spinning and scoring doesnt even need a ball screen go one all one get to your spot rise up a disposition that just OES confidence right now for the Orange Hill off the bounce on Carlos good hands and it got called for a foul red ay is steaming Syracuse has stabilized thanks to JJ Starling hes carried that load all year right Mike there he is late clock banging a three down and then he goes work 101 Marcus Hill over the top hes wet Music big game for both these teams toward the bottom of the ACC this is the bottom nine of 18 in the ACC standings and again that cut line if youre not familiar with the League this year bottom three missed the ACC tournament NC State down by 15 532 to go in a real Troublesome spot here theyre going to finish at Georgia Tech pit and at Miami so thats what lies ahead for NC State in a season that hangs in the balance meantime we told you JJ Starling has stepped up and solidified things the last few possessions hes got 11 had only two at the half was one of5 from the field I think his his injury at the beginning of the year I thought slowed his growth a little bit this year you know I could have hit the ground running a little bit more and hes not playing you know to play alongside of Judah Mintz or to to have a Malik Brown who was so good on that short roll so out of the pick and roll you could hit that guy just doesnt have quite the foul fire power he had last year around him so hes had to carry a real heavy load again Donnie Freeman has been out since right after the new year with that foot injury that surgery for a second straight game no Elijah Moore The Freshman guard whos out with a foot SL toe injury red atrey told us pregame theyre hopeful that theyll have him back on Saturday he averages 16 minutes per game for the orange lead is 13 five plus minutes to go starling HS and will shoot two where do you think JJ starlings gain goes from here well its hard to play in that League that NBA right now when you cant shoot and and so thats the you know the biggest thing for him is is figuring out you know how to become a little bit more consistent from that three cuz when teams can go under ball screens when teams can play off of you it becomes hard to to get minutes at that level and I think JJ staring needs to buy into being more of a defensive dog hes got the size the positional size to do it hes certainly athletic enough I think committing on that end because when he gets to the league hes most likely right now going to be a backup guard hes not you know the best players are the ones who have the ball in their hands so how do you make your impact for a guy like that its being a dog defensively Junior season here for Starling 5 minutes to go go time for NC State Styles swirls in a three his third triple hes got 14 all 14 in the second half for dant Styles J Taylor nearly got his hands in there now Peter movich has done a much better job after those two turnovers the timeout by Red archery executing against that pressure Starling initiates middle Brooks Blitz them lapkin muscles in two more and thats the reason that Kevin Keats didnt want to Blitz the ball screen from the beginning tonight with Starling in it be because hes so good finding options out of it especially that big rolling Styles no they said that to us this morning we want to avoid sending two to the ball if we can when two and Whites got the ball in his Applause hands inside of four minutes to play at the Dome Syracuse trying to snap a threegame losing streak Carlos Starling Jaden Taylor committed the foul late shot clock and JJs darling trying to power Syracuse to the Finish Line 6754 the Syracuse lead inside of four minutes to go and another double double for Eddie lampin meantime dant Styles is trying to will NC State back into it it here inside of 4 minutes remaining but that balance from Syracuse eight different guys youre getting scoring from and pain points like you had pointed out right off the top where this game is going to be one on the play on both ends inside the paint and at The Rim JJ Starling to the line hey NBA Friday on ESPN big double header top teams in the East square off at 730 Eastern with Donovan Mitchell and the Cavs theyre in Boston to square off with Jason Tatum in the Celtics then out west the next Battle of Los Angeles James Harden in the Clippers LeBron and the Lakers NBA Countdown tips offer coverage at s Eastern my man Nico Harrison took his Heat last night now what a picture what a picture thats sweeping the interwebs I mean it was a tough move by him I I do wonder if he regrets it though cuz he is getting daggers man all over the place all over Starling one of three at the line after Jaden Taylor had fou him on that corner triple Bon Applause pass sh just hasnt been there for him today despite some looks and three and a half to go for Syracuse trying to put the finishing touches on this one got back home after they had the weekend off red atrey just kept repeating to us fighting fighting fighting first words out of his mouth when we chatted with him before tip off Starling skipped it Carlos clock winding down and thats a double dribble on jquan caros NC state has attempted 24 threes tonight Syracuse only eight I mean the the emphasis clearly for cuse was to get downhill and do its work inside and NC State just couldnt beg off you know and we talked about it early in the first half NC State wanted to do some of this to start both halves then Middlebrooks has been in second half foul trouble so that wasnt an option for Kevin Keats the best offense for him since halftime has been dant Styles heating up with his jump shot but too little too late for the wolf pack Applause JJ Starling in Syracuse try to close it out right hand left side of the you called it you called it brother right on it never seen it but it works for him he just doesnt want that left hand on the left sideon pass for Styles and now mcneel Styles hands another drra Styles with his fourth three hes got 17 since halftime he has he has shot it well Mike thats now 11 threes in their last three games for dant TR styles again he started his career in North Carolina was there for two years after he was a top 70 recruit in the country Kevin Keat set out of high school Dantes Styles was more athlete than he was skill but then hes added skill over the last few years those 13 a game last year at Georgetown and has been one of the primary pieces for NC State this season remember Don Tres Styles when he was a freshman at Carolina they they had that big comeback the year they ended up going to the national championship game that big comeback against Baylor he hit the first three in overtime and the first Basket in overtime is always a big bucket like its a its a very important you know points to put on on the board and he hit that three Carolina was of and running to secure that comeback and then obviously ended up making the nationville title game this NC State team including Styles was in Chapel Hill last week real tough first half for NC State Styles said afterward he said they got embarrassed against Carolina he was going up against some of his old friends including Seth trible who had a stared down of styles at one point starling through the wickets working on pass and he scored it and theres that right hand its a heck of a move right there JJ Starling is feeling himself down the stretch so is Styles working on Carlos too strong inside of 90 seconds to go here at the Dome next up for Syracuse theyre at Virginia Tech on Saturday Tuesday theyre at SM very good SMU team under Andy Enfield here on ESP ESPNU and then theyll finish back at home here at the Dome against Virginia who a reminder is coming up at Wake Forest about 7 minutes from now Starling no pass in transition got caught in the air now lets it Fly pass short rebound secured by lpin whos got a rip in his jersey hes done it all tonight crowd here likeed this effort from Syracuse going to snap a threegame losing streak they had dropped four of five and seven of nine but came out ready to go tonight after the week layoff thats not just a rip in lampin thats like an entire Mortal Kombat tried to pull the heart out from the chest someone took a bite out of that thing was like us were ravenous pregame so JJ Starling leads the way with 17 Gyer Davis had 15 and seven and Eddie lampin a double double machine with 14 and 15 for Syracuse back in the wind column 7460 the final Syracuse is 6 and 11 in the league and thatll help
