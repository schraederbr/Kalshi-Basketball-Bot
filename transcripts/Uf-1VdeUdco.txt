here but Dave Dickersons crew knows the opportunity in front of it and the special moment is to play in this iconic venue Leslie Jones Lee Cassell and in the middle Helen Miller our officials for the night Kyle filiposki philipowski one of the top 10 rated freshman was in the center there knocks out of bounds off of a Spartan itll be Blue Devils ball to start things off kolpowski double double in his first game on Monday on the fourth Duke player to ever debut with a double double loaded with skill shot making ability and for a big he can really pass the ball high low Applause USC Upstate had a really spirited practice yesterday a lot of energy in their practice theyre coming to win this game theyre coming off a win against Brevard at D3 School in North Carolina beat them by over 40 and theres Jalen Gainey getting a steal and loses footing but lays it in anyway thats your Jordan game excuse me that is your reigning Big South freshman of the year Team all big South last year preseason first team player showing activity again on the ball Dave Dickerson preached pressure the ball be in the gaps block out roach tries to split its second straight turnover Trey broadnax the transfer from Navy lays it up great start for Spartans you see the ball pressure by USC Upstate theyre not going to be afraid in this game they understand the game is one on the court its not one upstairs with the banners the banners the crowd or the recruiting rankings number one class in the nation here in Philadelphia part of that on the ball float over very Smith but it doesnt go in and theres the block out they have to finish plays Dave Dickerson said eliminate the live ball turnovers clean up the defensive glass and we got a chance Gainey guarded by Tyrese Proctor another one of those freshmen he reclassified from 2023 class of 2022 in the summer theres some time of the injury hes got his arm hooking gaining thats an easy foul called the league of cell take a look at the Depot theyve been pressuring the ball and then theyre anticipating on the passing lanes that was a telegraph pass what a finish by Gainey falling down the push this time its an easy tune how important is the start in this venue when youre Upstate its huge because you try to take the crowd out of it youre never going to take this crowd out of the game but you can keep them quiet you can scroll with Pace play here two times once at Boston College once at Ohio State took two Ls its a tough place to play Music my first ever broadcasting foray as that three goes in cant lose up here oh well my team did the Columbia Lions lost by about 100 that night but it was fun to watch Applause foreign Applause Music young the grad transferred Northwestern offensive board no good on the floor though and Floyd redone John Shaya spoke to us today at shoot around about the unselfishness of this team they had 19 assists on 27 field goals against Jacksonville we saw the kick out to the wing but one more to the corner King looks for each other Applause Young lid on that basket for the Blue Devils but theyll maintain possession and Dave Dickerson controlling the sidelines for USC Upstate his fifth year he knows this building well played at Maryland was the captain of the team in 89 and went to two different tournaments and then coached at Maryland and their Heyday was part of that National Championship team under Gary Williams recruited the likes of Steve Francis Steve Blake Juan Dixon all those guys so he knows this place very very well is that Ohio State made a final four very accomplished coach and he took this job over they won one game in the Big South last year they won 10 he has done an amazing job at USC Upstate a teacher a coach and a motivator Im telling you that practice was super competitive last night I was afraid somebodys going to get hurt they already have enough injuries true but guys were really defending each other and calling each other out Kellen Miller and Lee Cassell trying to set out sort out day timing issue here the USC Upstate injuries we just touched on really critical youve got three guys that would be playing probably starting out of the Lion which is integral to this team and youre trying to come on the road he talked about how big their depth is and to not have Alves goodlow and Brazil which is 24 are scoring and as I mentioned three starters its a big big hit but there are seven nil the starch Brazil is the backup point guard last year goodlow will be back in December seven points a game last year Applause kicks Smith go thats not his game but hes capable canarius Smith he made the first one sometimes could be the most dangerous thing thats a pushoff on Jacob brandison just checking in the game the grand Transit from Illinois travel excuse me what does he bring to this team the blue guy a guy who can bang inside guy can score but Im looking at the intensity right now and John Shire said Im looking for intensity in our team to play hard all the time and be unselfish its really that simple right now USC Upstate they may have a lead right now in the intensity category on it defended by Jeremy roach good cut by Smith on the corner lets head out under the ball screen that could be a problem thank you its a big part of his game that he improved from a year ago Jeremy roach he has to score and facilitate for this team and defend the ball 11 new faces for this Duke team seven freshmen four transfers goes to one key with Turner and his game really has continued to progress and now theyre going to call Smith I believe for a pushoff underneath on the rebound they do where to go to break can we come back well talk about the rest of that freshman class rated number one in the nation position with Mitchell and Whitehead and I love the shot blocking ability by Lively philipowski and Mark Mitchell and Jayden Chute can shoot the ball really well from the outside he hasnt done it yet in the preseason or in the first game but expect him to make shots from the outside and Blakes just checks in the game for Tyrese Proctor as does Derek Lively number one his first appearance in a Duke Blue Devil uniform on the Baseline there wearing number one Mitchell good finish from The Freshman he just brings the fight some people call it motor I see a high competitive Spirit Mark Mitchell you know his nickname is easy but theres nothing easy without playing against Mark Mitchell Lakes defending broadness Alex you have to get rid of the ball 13 seconds of the shot clock finally does Smith on it spinning under Anderson Southpaw no good listen with the rebound hes looking to go there isnt theres a versatility he can grab and go off the glass hell set screens Baseline driver an opportunistic high energy player 25 in the white I thought that was interesting we talked to John shy earlier today so how do you want to be different than your team of Coach Casey not really but an offense we want to play faster honestly shoot it faster but play faster and have these guys always feel free with something he wanted to emphasize right now theyve got to escape the pressure first points for Derek Lively and a great dime by Roach Lively 71 excellent screener a hard dive guy to the basket weak sides got to pick him up and thats a catch and an easy finish for Derek Lively how about the enormous size that Duke has been Lively at seven runs for Lebowski 610 screen to roll no help from Kadarius Smith great way to get Derek Lively off mention the size the starting lineup now this is a different group Lively eventually will be in that lineup they would be the eighth tallest team in the NBA with their starting line and thats where theyre really different this year than years past I mean they have a lead shot blocking presence they should win most games on the glass if both of those guys live with kurapowski and young can score inside we talk so much about the freshmen and theyre outstanding when it comes to Talent physical measurables but its Ryan young hes the anchor of this team in the paint on the transfer from Northwestern taking a blow right now number 15 on the bench great footwork good use of both hands and fish are on the rim knock down a shot six for six in that opener and I talked to Derek Lively last night he said Ryan young teaches me a lot in practice its good for the for the Freshman to learn it is a learning process I think people understand it is a baptism by fire at any level when you come in from a high school to college it is a huge jump rankings do not matter once you step on the court the physicality and the speed of the game as well as the basketball IQ is all Next Level and these guys are learning day by day Applause all game the start that way he looks at now Mitchell in the passing there you know Dukes defense its been okay in this game but its their offense theyre theyre not moving the ball as quick as they did in the first game screens arent hard enough against upstate you may have to just put the ball in the deck and try to go buy these guys Applause you got to screen and cut with precision spend it right now to that point on a dribble by Blake gets it to Mitchell its faced out enjoy enjoy and Blake is out running so is Lively and coming Dave Dickerson wants a timeout he knows what this buildings all about and it is starting to rock were going to break it he settle them down settle his team down Duke up for the first time this game back here at Cameron Indoor Stadium great sequence here Paul Cindy enjoy with the big time block USC Upstate pushes it hard and Jalen Blakes Applause two big time blocks 62 sophomore Blakes has been great defensively early in this game and that block punctuated it you gotta love the response by Duke because ninja makes a momentum changing play and Duke fights right back down seven picks 70 spurt by the Spartans rebounded with a 90 run Smith back in the game cant handle it the end falls down turns it over Mitchell on the Run Ison thats what he does well 40 percent and that one simple catch and shoot from the penetration of Mark Mitchell Applause and in Full Court man a little bit of Zone Applause hands on the ball gets a steal you know John Shire had something to say at that first TV timeout when his team was down no doubt about it they looked a little lethargic to start not anymore well they looked a little tentative on offense their defense was okay but their turnovers in their shot selection wasnt quite right at least gets caught on the screen broadnecks glitches hands nicely finished finger rolling that time their defense had a big breakdown nobody with the Hedge nobody with the help thank you Applause cant get it to go they like Mitchell right at the nail at the foul line for some isolation Music Applause Dukes starting to rev it up right now penetration and kick by Mitchell that gets the three ball going raking for steals Jalen Blakes Coast to Coast its a new staff hes putting together Chris Carwell Mill Jefferson there in the past they move up a seat Jayla J Lucas comes over from Kentucky these dudes at all who not just then not just then right now dude theres not a single staff that could beat those guys and you could I could go play and theyd still win we win five on five whos your first pick for lunchtime ball oh man we were watching Jefferson today hes still he still looks really good and hes the youngest of the crew and Im gonna take John Shari you know why as long as you always let the head coach score in lunchtime pickup thats probably true thats how you dont get fired probably undercut him thats probably can within weeks turned over by Duke but his team his staff is due the team is new but he wants to put his his Stampys been here for nine years hes part of a championship team in 2010 as a player and the captain 15 was on the bench were now trying to take it from the Hall of Famer and put his his stamp on yeah hes got Mike schrocky as well on the staff and a support role former head coach at Elon Chris Carroll the veteran of the staff yeah we give John Shiner a lot of you know what he needs John has no no yes man on his staff all guys that are trying to help the team and help him which is huge ball reversed shot clock counting down though he think crowd got him unfortunately for redo redo excuse me you got about three seconds left and just chucked it Brian Young back of the game trying to set the screen to Blakes first Tyrese Proctor still looking for his first points and an extra pass perform a Big Ten guys hooking up see veterans know where to go and they know what to do when they touch the basketball they play fast they play intense but they slow down in their mind and thats the difference between a freshman and a senior people I said if the game slows down its hard to explain but the pieces are moving at a different pace as you get older big time shot Applause gaming thats a guy that can really shoot a shot at 49 last year and take a look at this Paul like this the numbers look at the qualities hes a freshman against D1 opponents he shot just over 49 the class of guys only two other guys in the last 20 years have shot at a higher percentage Steve Novak and Marcus Howard as true freshman as true freshman those dudes are Drillers man check out the drop line though yo I wasnt supposed to be a shooter in my congressman year how did that get on there can somebody put my sophomore junior Years numbers up there sophomore year I researched 40 thank you you were from three my friends you tried to make me a point guard dont convert shooting guards at least if theyre not any good you said youd like to have fun before the broadcast well done sir well done go Black producer there will be no beverages Ill take your ear up good stuff and file for uh Duke and now redial will take it out Music Proctor picks up his second so he checks out for Blakes he had a rough first game Proctor against Jacksonville he didnt score missed some shots which is okay missed Olaf that was uncontested looked like nerves to me but that young man has great instincts and he is a shot maker and a passer the 65 Guard from Australia really talented player really smooth but you could see him thinking and just that when you think as a player thats a thats not good and see theres great communication right there Mel Jefferson and Proctor Emil not far removed from the game and can give his players the insight and the encouragement that you need especially in those first couple of games in your first year Applause approach defended by Gainey Upstate down five started with a 70 run start the game and then Duke counter nine seven phillipowski up through some contact Hank at the end one Baseline double came a little late young and Phil loposky were terrific against Jacksonville whether it was against zone or man who cross screen action to get through opowsky inside you got Mark Mitchell you see him 25 in the white threeman fourman whatever you want man because thats the way he plays this team has great size summer Tuesday night weve got a mens Hoops doubleheader for you right here on acc Network in the ESPN app Louisville not a good start for Kenny Payne and grew off to Bellamy in their opener and theyre playing tomorrow but App State six Eastern on Tuesday then Armando baycott the number one North Carolina host Gardner Webb at the Dean Smith Center in Chapel Hill North Carolina about to tip off shortly against Charleston just down the road here North Carolina with a terrific threeman class I really like Seth trimbled throws it up to Mitchell Showtime thank you its not just the steel of the deflection its the conversion they move so quickly from defense to offense guarded by Mitchell a lot of length on him down no good oh spins past the pressure knows in the Run Applause big key for Upstate as well defensive transition make this a fiveonfive game I went down slow to get up still grimacing shot clock down to 10 high ball screen coming for Roche refuses Lane line up late Dave Dickerson will take another one were going to step away as the Blue Devils are taking control of this one from Cameron Duke up 2211 over USC Upstate after starting the game down seven to nothing and defensively Paul being Cartier thats where they started to turn this Cruise here in this one they started to get serious about defense after the first four minutes theyre living low in their stance theyre playing low and theyre staying low when you do that and your hands are active and your feet are moving get deflections you get steals youve got ball pressure and you can speed up your opponent the defense its a big part of this lead for Duke 12 points off turnovers now for the half the points for the Blue Devils Justin Bailey on the ball earned by Johnny Roach see the great spacing by USC Upstate too high too wide and one inside constant movement Applause the Lefty maybe they got him again dont listen to him easier said than done somebody stop the ball the block by Young the three by Roach that was a walkup three just up itll drop Dave Dickerson crazy you got to communicate and stop the ball hes maybe the best player in the ACC Applause getting blocked is almost like a live ball turnover great run by Ryan young but fined by roach and the basket will count foreign Big Time block that gets Derek Lively his first two career points as a Duke Blue Devil held a strip by Blakes just being in the Gap being alert being active High hands they follow the ball and this Duke team can really convert from defense to offense 12 points off turnovers right now Jalen Blakes when he inserted in this game to help turn things around started picking up full court and this is the story the story of the game is told right here in the turnover and he knows his role you know make open shots he did against Jacksonville guard the ball help he does the Dirty Work I love that and look at his body so strong physical six two 200 it reminds me of Jordan goldwire oh in many ways that Ducan you know just a guy who just kept getting better and better through practice one of the best onball defenders yesterday Lively coming over to the block doesnt get it Music straight down the problem again you got to play him for the drive turn him into a shooter he can make them every now and then but thats not his game when you get up on Mark Mitchell hes going to blow by you nger Smith Lively singled up with Lang Lang a job by Lively just holding his position hands straight up no foul gets the block you dont always have to leave your feet to get the block especially was a 92 standing reach that helps 7Day wingspan put those two together fine youre from Columbia I cant hardly add I was told thered be no matter Lively one of the best shot blockers among all freshmen this year Applause in the court just in time because the big freshman is coming to get Man one great defense by philipowski when I say great because he gets out a little flat help sticks his hand in there and then he takes it Coast to Coast how about the mobility coordination at 6 10 to go the length of the floor get the steal and finish the play you mentioned his his skill set his ability guy comes from a pipeline a family of phenomenal athletes phenomenal players see Strokes down this shot I mean take a look at what his familys accomplished back to his aunt and his father and his brothers now playing at Harvard twin brothers hes got his uncle who you know from BC and to Dartmouth I mean look at this his Uncle Randy haggerton was a seven footer I keep calling philipowsky 610 hes seven feet that one right how about his dad Slippery Rock baby I watched my first basketball camp its over skill thats right John Millers dad shot that John Miller the dad of Sean election now he used to be the best coach in history really in high school basketball Western Pennsylvania and his brother Matt is a really good inside player as well had a chance to watch him for the New York friends when they played together on the AAU circuit theyll be playing for a former dookie Tommy Amaker up at Harvard the best programs in the ivy league Applause just look at Lively as a 71 player and philipowski a seven footer they both can make outside shots they both can pass from the high price Philadelphia Lively they were the one and two ranked centers by you in the ESPN 100 is there any hesitation by guys to follow the one and two theyre going to the same place to play the same position in the same way theyre all concerned by that because they can play together most guys can play together I just think the teams that are recruiting the other guy tells them hey you know what you cant go there they already got somebody like you but guess what you can play two point guards together you can play two centers together as long as they can both face up or one of them can face up in this case both can face up a little late in the reach and Smith trying to drop it off no good another turnover yeah but most people dont know about Derek Lively and Kyle philipowski outstanding passers so they could do it from the high post or down inside you can throw it in send Cutters they can skip it weak side Applause of the year last year in the Big South as the reflection Applause quick break in the action today about week 11 ACC Network college football lineup fresh off there what an upset not by the boys in Vegas Syracuse until that was taken down by Pitt they square off against quarterback Brennan Armstrong and Virginia uba needs to win out to become Bowl eligible thats new in eastern start the day then true freshman quarterback MJ Morris leads number 16 NC State against Boston College and the day capped off by our accn Prime Time matchup Syracuse trying to turn those things around against Florida State number 23 down the cfp weve won two straight including a dismantling of Miami last weekend NC state has a really good football coach and a great football team they saw them destroy UConn early this year Im torn in that game because my daughter goes to NC State okay my wife and I met at Boston College so its a pickle its a pickle all right well UConn has been torn apart by everybody in the SEC this year but thats a different discussion Applause kept in though by broadnax kind of the shot clock nice hedge by philipowski check Corner three from Bailey they needed it they aint get it see philipowski he Hedges and gets back big difference didnt run by philipowski in good hands the Corral it eventually nice pass Applause watch the court Vision by Jeremy Roach penetration on the Baseline I see my brother on the wing Jalen Blakes triple Bulls are up by 20 camera crazys doing their thing almost 500 straight sellouts in this building back till 19 since 1990 theyve sold out Cameron longest streak in the country is here for two of those sellouts one in 1991 and one in 2001 unfortunately the results were the same for us Double L Double L but the first one was real bad Malcolm Huckabee was a freshman our colleague we had Billy Curley Howard Isley but they had Grant Hill and Christian Laettner and the game was over before it started roach kicks it out hes got five assists on the night make it six John Shire said he wants Jeremy Rose to assist and play make more you see it there when the ball moves the scoreboard changes Applause so were going to take out the other teams best player that is Gainey on the ball drops it off theyre hard hedging Gainey on ball screens and eliminates a shot contact no call Anderson cant get to go backtoback possessions Applause still behind the play Baileys three no good Applause prom next trying to take the charge there watch this defense by Duke on the ball screen Jordan Gainey with the ball okay you cant allow him in the shooties 49 from three so what did they do quick hedge how about young with the quick hedge and then the recovery back to ninja the ability to do two things in one possession thats what bigs have to do at this level and the next level multiple efforts understanding where youre supposed to be grad transfer from Northwestern of course played for Chris Collins and theyre dookie up there never been to the NCAA tournament though hes hungry to make that happen he comes to the right place for that group number seven in the country I dont know if theyre quite seven right now but I see them somewhere between 10 and 15 when the bus settles weve got Kansas coming up on Tuesday Champions classic huge game of course the appetizer Kentucky the Michigan State Michigan State playing on an aircraft carrier right now kick out for three for roach no good it is Veterans Day another great event Michigan State Gonzaga playing on the aircraft carrier out in San Diego thank you to all the veterans out there enjoy this day should be recognized more often no doubt about it last time Duke actually played on Veterans Day they beat Army in 2018 ironically enough coach Ks alma mater Applause stayed another time now well hold it here as duke leads by 23 they are harassing Jordan Gainey whose father is Justin Gainey the assistant coach of Tennessee Justin was a very good player at NC State but Jordan Gainey is getting all types of attention in ball screens and all fall screens hes seeing help on the wings his man is getting up into his grill as we like to say theres nowhere for him to go with the basketball hes got to give it up and trust that it will come back USC Upstate try to run some actions to get him the ball and if they dont allow you to run offense Duke then you have to go to your back door counters along with a terrific guard PJ Burns started at Tennessee with the player of the year at Winthrop for the Big South and now hes back in the now hes back at the high majors at NC State and you can see Hill coming up after us hes at Georgia now theyre playing at Wake Forest here 8 30 on acc Network as Blakes comes the other way this guys got a taste of success and they want to challenge themselves and try to add another level Your Role changes when you transfer you got to keep that in mind very rarely do you remain the god Applause foreign Music Applause Spartans are started this game seven nothing so it is a 399 run to do that match folks that was difficult for me Applause apparents a good step through cant get it to go though Applause its hard to see the rim against Duke thanks to the 10 the rebound by phillipowski hes fouled sometimes when you get really deep against Duke and they have to spray it out as opposed to trying to finish at the river now four for four from the freethrow line tomorrow morning 11 AM Eastern Time ACC tunnel crew coming to you live from Syracuse New York get yourself another full day of football and also have halftime shows pre and post game shows throughout the day 6 30 get a complete wrap up the afternoons games and theyll get you set for the prime time matchup between FSU and Syracuse on accm at 8 oclock Eastern all right here on the network and the ESPN app Upstate has not scored since the 714 Mark has a good stretch for the Duke defense see if they can get a backdoor play because Duke has overplayed enjoy working on Young 20th points off turn points off the turnovers Upstate come out super aggressive to start this game and they were terrific for the first four or five minutes theyve looked tentative since Duke has decided to throw the knockout punch early on next working on young getting down the lane line finishes and John Char will call timeout if you use it or lose it a little Ward with his team high ball screen for Upstate that allows broadnecks to kind of snake the screen twist it come off get downhill his dad was an excellent player at Georgetown Harold broadnecks the sun transferred from Navy to USC Upstate theres something you remember doing would you want to work on like the full full court type plays absolutely even if other people see them and Scout them you want to get your guys in a rhythm and a habit of executing your place now youre not going to use something that youre going to do at the end of a game but something that maybe your B package take a look at and see if guys can execute if you draw up enjoy on the ball with that wingspan young to inbound off of granisons foot it looked like from here buzzer goes off but hold on a second I did something there was going to be time left on the clock and they will go to the board and we can sell well view this seemed like a quick question theres going to be some time left I imagine Music and that that could be a potential turnover but look at John Shire in the Huddle just more instructional than critical sometimes coaches especially firsttime coaches and I had that experience you could lose your mind in the Huddle and in the locker room and right there John just kind of instructing his team on maybe what they could do better when they run that play next time I had a first time coach experience love him to death but yeah he lost his mind quite a bit those first couple years you want to give us names people can research and figure it out I love that guy well let it go hes still in the game doing very well in his current spot Duke gets it back and we go 19 roach pull up Applause thats how itll end 25point deficit for USC Upstate he started up seven nothing the Spartans did but its been all Duke since then Network Studio Kelsey Riggs Luke Hancock take a look around the conference hell be back in a bit 22 it felt like 80 and thats what Duke wants to do defensively they want to pressure the ball get into the passing Lanes but John Shire said today to shoot around were not going to extend as much as we have in the past but in the quarter Court were going to make you cut hard and backdoor us because were going to take your actions away I thought that was interesting too because thats what Duke a lot of times was known for that pressure beat the 91 points away but we saw it last year at times Miami Virginia spread them out and just drive him and hes trying to maybe change that philosophy just a little bit he doesnt want to extend as much but in that quarter Court he will deny and hell play Gap too but sometimes youll see him play on top of Putters and Nicholas Cutters at the back door Tyrese Proctor back in the game the only player in the first half that did not score hes yet to score this freshman at 2 000 first five minutes and 40 seconds to hit the time another question cant get it to go down foreign Applause just a quick wall Brian Young he just he takes up so much real estate on both ends of the floor its like hitting a brick wall you cant move them when that jumper goes down for Mark Mitchell thats good news for Duke it gives him another weapon from the outside until the roof Whitehead gets back a two for five in the opener from three knocks this one down first of this game see Duke switching now some of these screens switch to deny thats why theyre getting steals theyre lost on the hands of Gainey reigning Big South freshman of the year having a tough day against this Duke team well Duke has taken his threepoint looks away hes taken one threes made it but for a guy who shoots 49 and Dave Dickerson is trying to get him shots both with the ball and coming off screens Duke has just suffocated gaining in this game thats a number that I think people always look at like what is their threepoint field goal percentage defense its misleading if thats the best number I think to your point earlier is when you limit their attempts its threepoint field goal attempts at two point attempts if that numbers small then you run them up the line thats what you really want to do and thats the best way to guard the threepoint shot is dont allow it Young on the duck in hands to his right hes got big hips hes got great footwork secure hands and he knows where he wants to go with his back to the basket and that takes time as a young post player but young now as a graduate transfer knows where he is on the court hes going to be killing people 20 years from now the YMCA a lot of cops to Chris Collins whove worked with him and his staff at Northwestern mainly in trouble gets it to Gainey four of the shot clocks got to go up I dont know if it ever Drew iron it did not Music great defense by Duke young calling for it locate spins carves out some real estate his real estate is below the rim but its just as valuable a little Crosby trying to duck in on the guard Applause deflected out Duke was picked preseason second in the conference behind North Carolina whos playing right now against Charleston the number one team in the nation Applause I like Virginia for that second spot Tony Bennett has a terrific class coming in hes got veterans bat Kihei Clark Gardner its just Tony Bennett veterans and talent they do a lot of good things Jayden Gardner all League last year returns immersive side of the media days dude did you put on more ratings we had a sweatshirt I was like he just smiled up hes like he didnt want to say he looked great man they that is a veteran group all five starters back and frankly they need him from the outside yeah Indiana Roach Applause he misses when hes open Im surprised I was watching the practice a couple weeks ago it was just the game was so easy for him it was impressive and you saw it in that first game youve seen it at times today too with so much size with by Duke oh this is upstairs Applause young as a decoy and Mitchell upstairs are you talking about roach hes got size on his team that hes never had this kind of sauce so he gets some open looks watch Mitchell just kind of wrap around young which is easy to do you put it anywhere Above the Rim and Mark Mitchell will get it a fantastic athlete with an infectious personality on the court make sure the Freshman from Kansas City Kansas now played at Sunrise Christian play design there Dr Amy good look one of his few open looks not only guards the ball the lapowski ripping and running too he can rip and I wouldnt want him running with it too much but Ill tell you what who can do that when he gets healthy Tariq Whitehead hell rip it run and finish it its got a little Jalen Brown in it Whitehead and Celtics okay what came out of Cal and many people yours included yours truly thought he wasnt going to be a great NBA player he wasnt that skilled yet when you saw the athleticism the intelligence he has on and off the court but his game has developed he was a defender in high school great driver and finisher an elite athlete and Tariq Whitehead is a big time athlete see the pipes yeah hes pitched hes got hes got hes thick hes explosive and hes smart Applause six seven two twenty thats Whitehead thats young inside again good ball fake gets the foul again crafty and takes up space he knows how to make and maintain contact with his Defender watch him make and maintain contact XMen shot fake footwork pursues the ball another shot fake foreign ER he knows hes not going to explode dunk over people but he knows he can finish around guys he went 11 for 12 from the free throw line Im sorry 11 for 12 from the field in his first game against Jacksonville Applause and the only thing stopping philipowsky from scoring that was balance when you get to this level your physicality and your size doesnt always allow you to score the ball like it does in high school so when you have balance and you play low you can finish stronger higher and people its seven feet tall your bodys still going to fill out now you still got to get strong especially in the lower lower half your legs glutes to be able to maintain position move guys gets the roll down Tuesday night mens basketball double header for here at ACC Network on ESPN app mobile hosts App State six Eastern cards coming off thats opening night loss against Bellarmine then Armando baycab the number one North Carolina Tar Heels host Gardner Webb at the Dean Smith Center in Chapel Hill speaking of that Chapel Hill right now Carolina down two in the first half with three minutes to go theyre down 4139 to Charleston right now one on the ACC Network extra interesting start there for the number one ranked team yeah the expectations from last year to this year a little different Music he was number seven in the ESPN 100 if you keep in score you know he didnt make the McDonalds AllAmerican Game because the game didnt take 50 or players but he was a McDonalds AllAmerican Music Kyle philipowski is just so locked in on both ends denying at seven feet pushing finishing threepoint shooter McDonalds AllAmerican and also he was the MVP at the McDonalds game and won a Geico championship for Longford Applause yeah an outstanding High School career this is a issue here Jalen Gainey got a call for a flag of one it looks like it shouldnt say one but Lee Cassell called her right away as Katie turned it over he reached out his hand and just kind of grabbed at the foot of Jeremy roach potentially tripping him yeah thats an easy one the roach because hes feisty he made a move towards gain hes got to keep his composure hes a leader of this team simply has to walk away whoever had to Prevail he got out of there and in the end now the referees well take a look at this just to push the properly adjudicating it you dont think Annie should pick out a game and get a flag or two for that not at all not at all I mean theres no way to go and roach with a few bumps and Gainey with the intentional foul but not to hurry mortar just stopped the fast break thats an F1 there you go theres your definition of an excessive and or unnecessary that hits both those really not a legitimate playing the ball there you go older push from behind if two is when you get in the world of uh intent to hurt especially above the yeah of the neck yeah Music and this turns into a lesson you know for Jordan Gainey when he gets frustrated down the road and other games are big South action you know hes going to let that go Applause Music see it one more time hes frustrated his teams down he lost possession and he wanted to stop the fast break and didnt make a wise choice Rose to the line and short folks last year Applause we wrote his first free throws of the day oh for two I used to always I mean I shot those for us a lot college and high school it was always weird with nobody on the lane I hated that not sure I ever went over too but I didnt like it its a different level of pressure it just feels weird anytime you take an athlete out of the routine or Comfort especially the free throw it is routine take that away it gets a little weird its like when you went to the playground and there were no Nets and shoot the ball its weird the rim is the same size but theres no neck Applause turn the corner really strong finish a good aggressive cake by Proctor he needed that Im glad they ran the play because they want they wanted him to get it we want him to get that basket and get the monkey off his back hes over eight in his first career game on Monday Applause Proctor just turns the corner nice step through beautiful Music Jaden shoot just checked in the game for Jerry roach Im a freshman here in Yorkville Illinois fellatine white what are we going to look at what do we see from Shoot he can shoot it and thats what he can do but hes got to get adjusted to the speed of the game and getting open and knowing when to shoot the ball and when to move it Blakes so active on the ball theres another foul to stop a Fast Break by Rita Duke has not allowed Upstate to score in the second half so far that time Blakes just you know he just goes for the ball hes a bit stripped guy yeah switch steel guy on the ball some guys are really good off the ball anticipating others on the ball Blakes does it really well and enjoy checks out Smith Checks In Applause these are valuable minutes for Tyrese Proctor Jayden Blakes beginning reps Derek Lively back in and shoot buckets hes a three ball late to happen hes over three on Monday from three and yet to score his college career knocks it down but you got a transition to know your guy on the other side of the floor too yeah that will be on the film study tomorrow but when you look at the shot preparation and shot mechanics of Jamies shoe you can understand why he can throw it up listen easily to the hole and believe me Duke needs Jadens troop this year because they need someone who can make an outside shot Off The Catch and shoot that they can depend on maybe a 37 38 percent trying to see one of those guys as well with him short Applause and Proctor can be that guy as well in shooting as you know is all confidence yeah if you have the mechanics and the preparation and good shot quality it all comes down to confidence Applause foreign shoot youre expected to make shots that was deep off the catch and shoot and thats where hes best the ability to spot up knock it down 40point lead for the Blue Devils here Big Shot for Bailey no good the way this game started USC up stayed seven to nothing in the first two or three minutes Duke could not score two turned Row in the first two possessions easy layups for as far as great start for them but since then its been 6114 and after John Shire I just love the way they responded to the slow start cant get the rebound Applause Dukes defense after the first five minutes in the first half to right now has been outstanding another turnover team now for Spartans Applause and its not been one guy defensively its been a collection of guys its been roach its been Blakes its been Mitchell young Im sorry Ryan young inside Applause you know in Derek Lively he just challenges shots the ones that he doesnt block he still challenges Justin he makes it hard for guys to score and as a guy as a driver you know hes there too Music no question about it Music Applause Music three fouls now five turnovers Creek season all big South First Team reigning freshman of the year in that conference we have some numbers that are impressive right now Duke with 12 steals 11 steals excuse me and those steals came you know after first five or six minutes of the first half but 12 assists 23 field goals yeah a little better than 50 thats outstanding its a very good assist rate and that was something John Shire talked about too sharing the ball great shots for two nights possession Applause hes going to play hard no matter where he plays no matter who he plays against the question is how long will he play this game after college and he could be a guy who plays into his 40s in Europe and have a good career I mean like I said hell be crushing people with the Y until hes 45 hes a main screen Applause Here Comes Bailey a two on one you know he hasnt done much in this game Justin did a very good player for upstate one point lead for the Blue Devils we come back well take those 202223 campaign banners up there the 2022 final four last years crew but theres 11 new faces on the team this year Jamie roach the only guy from last years Squad and the new head coach but they were picking the preseason full second behind North Carolina whos currently number one in the nation but Carolinas down seven at the break to College of Charleston came up 50 in the first half that said do you agree with this poll in the top five what are your thoughts overall about who you really like and some of these teams maybe not getting as much love on them well I like Virginia too I like Duke of three possibly in four Miami has a strong backcourt the Nigel pack Isaiah they have a good team this year Jim laronega does so well with the experience Duke has a lot of talent and they have some terrific role players and blue guys right here Mitchell but when you go through the season the battles of your conference on the road the big question for Duke in my mind will be how do they respond to adversity during the season and how quickly can they develop consistency both offensively and defensively John talked about it today a tune around its all about developing habits and playing with discipline never always going to be prepared but are they going to be disciplined they uh I havent really gone through much adversity they were down seven nothing in this game and it dominated ever since defense turned it up but theyre going to play Kansas on Tuesday as we take a look at this from Young look at those guys six nine six ten seven footer you got a 71 on the bench a lot of length man and every game they play they need to utilize their size whether its offensive rebounding postup game shop walking presents they should own the glass in a lot of games that they play again back to they will play Kansas the rain national champs who was also obviously in the final four last year have a couple guys back from that team Jaylen Wilson kind of have a new role as a wing player there and got some great young players granny dick hes a huge connection so that team theyre playing Tuesday night 9 30 ESPN network but we wont really see something about what this teams about then yeah Grady dick is the best freshman sugar in the country seven outstanding longrange shooter also from the midrange now he played a Sunrise Christian with Mark Mitchell so teammates are going to be opponents watch Duke depressuring the ball theyre denying the ball nice back cut when you overplay you have a chance for Steals and offensively you have to counter what the defense is going to do and take them a little bit higher back cut to the basket that could have happened a lot earlier in this game rocho for two missed those two on the flag of one earlier 76 percent its this one well now hes got guys in the lane feels different back to back to your routine buckets Applause and dont forget we talked about this in the open that Upstate lost three transfers the gradual transfers guys that were all physical parts of their team last year they have three injuries right now and theyre picked in the middle of the Big South and I think theyll be just at that middle spot maybe a little higher maybe four or five a very athletic team in the Big South at the one two and three and Cindy ninja to transfer from West Virginia hes got to give them some presents its not just the Lost guys from last year they are missing three rookie starters now yes on this team and it was an injury so theyre playing depleted and Dave Dickerson was real clear about that when were hurt were banged up and thats a thats a problem to say the least and thats why it was so impressive to see them come out aggressive get a seven nothing lead I mean they believed that they could win this game at the beginning not anymore a lot of that in my picture soapowskis got backtoback double doubles and well have a little official Blows the Whistle Kellen Miller Brad broadnax has an issue with equipment so he goes off and theres a lot of rotation here is Lively granison and shoot come back in the game and Dukes not going to take their foot off the pedal not at all part of developing habits yeah youre up big right you dont play the score you play the game and a lot of times freshmen will look at the score start changing their habits and John Shire and staff theyre making sure that his guys are playing the way they want him to play create the identity now look at so many times when the lights are on the cameras are here its a real game we got to maximize that time Applause its Jacksonville you know they played Applause just the right way didnt always play pretty but they played the right way Applause seeing a shot Im just talking about overplaying well Proctor was overplayed that time hes got a bad cut theres going to be games and it could be Kansas next where theyre going to feel the heat and the pressure and when you do just back cut your man the ball will find you when youre open Champions classic Tuesday night 9 30 on ESPN appetizer for that one is Michigan State and Kentucky Michigan State right now is up on Gonzaga number two in the nation on an aircraft carrier out in San Diego right now thats late second half and theyre up right now Applause but Applause number one number two in the country youre down right now a little different being down to Michigan State and being down the College of Charleston which UNC is right now with the break down seven a lot of people even in our industry overreact to scrimmages early season games theres a lot of time to shape your team to work things out in practice Duke and Carolina are great example of that last year so exactly Duke was was building into their season but hadnt had I think you see the ways they would have liked and that may get going in the tournament from being down all year North Carolina similarly they were 17 against quad one teams as philipowski gets it to go down and then they win here at Cameron and Coach K senior night and that changes their season and they move forward and get to both of the final four well I had a chance to call a North Carolina game last year they just figured it out how to play RJ Davis and Caleb love with Bangkok so this was called for a flop and theres no warning now you get an automatic Class B technical which means its one shot and then back to the point of interruption and its not you know shots in the ball it also is not a personal foul the new rule this year which do you like that rule I do but its so hard to call its very subjective when a seven footer a 230 pounds makes some contact with you you may go down not me I dont know what youre talking about Paul Im good I would go down before I got hit thats how we took charges Applause really hard call to make it a mission to see how that is called late game in big the refs actually do call it because I wanted to be out of the game as well but you also dont want to call it that to determine it when it can be such a subjective thing also comes like balance and wheres your body position its like I mean its hard to read sometimes and how did how does the official know how much contact it takes to knock somebody over and they got a hard job that we definitely know Applause thats a moving screen but this young man ninja is going to really help the Big South this year transfer from WVU he will be an impact player of the Big South not quite the same here for the blue ducks Duke cruising right now behind their leader Jeremy roach 107 dimes Paul not an ultimate uh he plays on both ends of the floor you see the defense which leads to easy two rejects the ball screen great take to avoid the charge as well plays with his head up his eyes are wide open that was a walkup three for Jeremy roach and how about this kick out the Blakes for the three balls driving to his left passing it across his body you know he came to Duke battle testing came from Paul VI High School he played with Trevor kills summer basketball A Team Takeover hes a playful talented I mean the only guy from that final four team last year or later Applause back to the freethrow line the Blue Devils go where theyre 13 for 18 USC Upstate has yet to visit the charity strike we saw that graphic of players in the ACC we know about baycott love and Davis Isaiah Wong he has continued to improve under Jim larranega love his game sir quavion Smith outstanding shooter thought about the draft came back hell be the goto guy for Kevin Keats Smith came to light it up tell you about the ACC Network football schedule fresh off their win over Syracuse Pittsburghs off against quarterback Brennan Armstrong and Virginia UVA needs to win out just to be a full eligible Tony on its first year noon Eastern then true freshman quarterback MJ Morris leads number 16 NC State against BC the day is capped off by ACC and Prime Time matchup huge tries to get the ship righted against number 23 Florida State who won two in a row including just throttle for instate rival at Miami Applause buckets deep from redo Music nice the more confidence this team can get early and John Shire understands its going to pay off during adversity weve got Kansas next you need to feel good about yourself going into that game this team plays extremely hard dude s first action is a deer food is in the books and hell walk off with a uh Four Points two rebounds and 15 minutes of play and in the game comes Cal catches the grand trance are from Barbara gets a block right away and Max Johns a grad transfer Princeton kicks it over the Grand and shoot no good down by catching gets it out the Jones Applause Christian Reeves 21 also checked in a freshman out of Charlotte North Carolina played NOCO Academy I know youre excited about history with you I love him 21 in the white a true sevenfooter who can really block shots run nice soft hands and hes developed really well over time agrito a little bit of a park shot just picked it up off the bounce turn and shot it buckets 134 when philiposky is gone Lively is gone and young youre going to see Christian Reese like give us the ball 21 in white hell start to step up for this team you know in his sophomore junior year another seven footer in this roster they are big great evaluation by Duke Chris Carroll was all over that way we need to get himself to the freethrow line first game in three points one or two from the field you mentioned Chris Carwell former great player here at Duke and he had a great story for us I said what do you remember your first game because Livelys game was first game its gonna be tonight we knew that and see him on the bench there to the right talking to Neil Jefferson uh he said yeah 1996 I was playing St Joes and Bill mortelli great coach you know I get in one of the last guys in I come in turn the ball over jog back next thing I know horn Im out and said that called his mom afterwards and wanted to talk to her wanted her to wanted her to console him and she said you must have done something wrong and right then I realized I gotta work it out this is on me he said shes old school and I think we all understand that its a little different world now but he said I got to figure this thing out I got to get right and eventually he did hes well ACC level player excellent recruiter I think hes one of the better evaluators he knows exactly what Coach K wanted and now he knows what John Shire wants and when you look at these Duke players you look at the talent and even looking ahead to next years group theyre talented but theyre High character kids theyre easy to coach guys you can trust off the court and thats huge especially when youre starting your coaching career I think people underestimate that now johnshires been here for nine years they have five number one recruiting classes but all recruiting classes are not created the same the type of player youre bringing in your program is huge you got to have a guy thats going to come in be willing to be coached or been taught and do things all the right way on the court and off the court especially an establishment like this and you have to look at the traits body language are they competitive are they coachable five number one recruiting classes and somebody told me that next years class is pretty good too but are they are they currently ranking where do you have them now number one number one is that potentially enough guys out there to change that equation theres a couple of guys on the board that could change that equation and theres a school called Kentucky that is always fighting it out with Duke for that number one and number two spot Spencer Hubbard was eager to get in the game the Junior from Los Angeles coming in for the shooter you gotta went nuts yeah a lot of guys Music favorite loves him five eight bucks produces a tough players in high academic institutions on the pass the officials do not have a flight to get here neither do I but Im starving caught up here in the pantry too I feel like I worked out the second time today I lost weight up here the Sun lamps lights we got a real tough gig folks we know were digging ditches out here Bailey its not good for him 3a Player of the Year in South Carolina last year won a state championship for Blue Ridge High School hes going to be a really good one for Dave Dickerson a real good one so its a nice ball just over match tonight on the Rock the red shirt Junior from Australia 22 gets it back to Bailey kick across and take it out Applause actually Applause Applause you know we watch shoot around today for Duke Mill Jefferson you did a really good job scouting USC Upstate covered all their Baseline out of bounds plays you see them talking to Chris Carroll how hard is that when you we only saw the 18 inches you slide over from an associate or assistant head coach your head coach now you are doing scouting reports and youre having more responsibility what does that mean a lot of pressure yeah pressure to deliver a good report to the team make sure that not that you understand it but they understand it in short sound bites you know you want to you want to coach this game and phrases and sound bites you can teach in practice Applause so I was really impressed with him and he knows he has to continue to polish up as a recruiter and thats part of the gig weve got to continue this pipeline of talent High character players the Scout is so important too and this is a side note not everybody is is a good evaluator scholar and sometimes its about doing the homework and just knowing everybody on the roster and tell us youll tell this to you because we had a coach that Paul was not cut for the business left the guy off the report the kid starts has 15 in the first half lets just say in the halftime I dont think we were spoken to I think the coach just got greened out who the heck is number five that guy might be selling real estate right now he is hes not in basketball you leave someone off the report that hurts you it did not go well thats not good for your career but a lot of coaches get wordy on The Scouting Report and sometimes you can put the players to sleep and Mill Jefferson kept it short and sweet enjoy through some contact no call no you want your players to play play hard play with intensity you dont want them overthinking actions in the corner sounds Applause and Hubbard need a score the only two who have not scored very good I was like but they need to score theyre up by 40 no they need to get their name yep look that was a walkon give me the ball Applause all right drive and finish by Catchings and Lefty of Tamika Catchings one of the greatest womens players of all time are you straight up bodies up hold on see when youre a rock on your game is in practice so you never get minutes like this usually you get 30 40 seconds youve got a couple of minutes coach still does want you to play the right way no question about it and theyre trying to run the offense running their horn sets looking for each other they try to play the right way and thats what makes them special out of bounds and thatll take us to a TV timeout Applause Duke and firm control as they Coast to 20 in the John Shire era the minute 51 to play hes been playing basketball since hes been six years old as we know it runs deep in his family he was an honorable student for all four years in high school Ill give you a nugget on him I played the French horn fifth grade through ninth grade I wonder if hes given to him now can he still can he still dab him probably hes probably bigger than the French horn too Music smart Stanley Borden checking in the crowd liking that as well from Turkey Applause from Chestnut Hill Massachusetts coverage begins at noon Eastern Brian here on acc Network and the ESPN app Music next up for USC Upstate they keeping the ACC they go on the road at Clemson theyre going to fall to 2 and 12 all time against the ACC they beat Virginia Tech and Georgia Tech in their history Applause take a look at ninja 45 hes a big dude yes six nine plus hes chiseled he went eight for ten in his first game from the freethrow line Applause its gonna be a big help for Upstate this year before here we go shoot taken to the rim and fouled Ive been in these games before when you get that big blowout lead and get the starters out you start thinking about your next game youre on the KU right now in Johns mind I think hes thinking about Kansas now he may never say it but sitting on the bench with this type of lead in the last five minutes starting to think about your matchups starting to think who played well tonight Kansas played last night they won a dominating fashion for the second game to start their season I mean they just barge you so hard Kansas and I think if anything that Duke has to work on is their offense getting open cutting screen Applause inside but can they score points and execute thats 9 30 Eastern on ESPN the doubleheader the Champions classic first game is Kentucky Michigan state that Kansas team to play national champs Jalen Williams different role now is kind of his mother the key guys was on the team last year too Juan Harris Kevin McCullough transfers over to Texas Tech I mean they got some dudes man thatll be a great night of basketball season yeah keep an eye on Grady dick an outstanding shooter best freshman shooter in the country Kentucky has two studs Jason Wallace Chris Livingston two tremendous freshmen and cover to just hold it and thatll do it a dominating win for the Blue Devils in their second outing things will change Tuesday night maybe not the outcome but the competition for sure theres point two on the clock so we are going to wait a second and then itll be inbounded and end final score 8438 here for Paul being party our great producer will black director Caleb Waters Im Dallin cuff were done here were sending you to Doug Sherman and Corey Alexander on the call Georgia at Wake Forest we out
