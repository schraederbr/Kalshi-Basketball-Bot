over an ACC opponent They beat NC State in overtime at Reynolds Coliseum 32 years ago Nick Forest tries to take care of business tonight but its not going to be easy This is a talented Campbell basketball team under firstear head coach John Anders who was on Todd Golden staff at Florida to win the national championship last April Three ball Jeremiah Johnson wont go Offensive rebound for the leading scorer of the Camels DJ Smith BKAs at 15 a game but Smith 22 a game and hes a light up the score sheet kind of guy Much more of an uptempo team than they were last year Theyre going to look for threes Theyve got a lot of balance Four guys averaging double figures We talked about inside ability but youre exactly right Smith can score from a lot of range Five games hes had 20 points or more So youve got things youve got to defend on this Gamble team Wake Forest has got to come out cheering on with defensive intensity Im glad you mentioned the contrast from last year to this year I think Kevin Begans a good basketball coach but his style very different than John Anders offensively This is Fields cant crawl it over the rim BKA battling for the rebound but its Spillers who takes care of it Couple of shots at the rim Campbell had opportunities Calm me Harris Mason Blue and Spillers for Steve Forbes Back here at the Joel Coliseum after a trip to the Bahamas Mai Mason trying to find the range and that will help You know weve talked so much about J Harris lately and Ivon Spears McKe Mason has had a really solid game after about 11 points a game Had a really nice jumper there to get going Theres your trap Deep three for Smith Way too strong And Spillers out fights Fields for the rebound Juke Harris launches and hits from the corner 6 nothing Deakons Nice start for Wake Forest I scoot it on the defensive end Transition Juke Harris continuing to have an outstanding sophomore season Quick trigger DJ Smith comes up short cheering The Camels are 0 for four The Deakons are two for two and looking for more Calm me finds Spillers inside Power dribble Eight zip Great job Secondary break Get to the high spot that time Spillers one dribble goes to the glass and score up Outstanding start on the defensive end for Wake Forest You play good defense youre going to get easy looks on offense Maybe the best opening two minutes of a game that Wake Forest has had all season long I tend to agree with that Campbell turns it over there And now its Wake looking to stretch the lead to double figures cheering Of course I dont know if you were watching NC State earlier today or even Carolina an hour ago Double digit leads early for the Wolfpack and Tarheelss did not last First miss for Harris And here comes the Camels from Buois Creek North Carolina They were in the Big South for a long time Theyre now in their third season in the Colonial Athletic Association Corner jumper too strong Camels still cant buy a bucket And another offensive rebound creates a second chance for Jeremiah Johnson A match up inside The bump on blue Shot clock doubles from 10 to 20 Yeah this is a team in Campbell Evan that averages about 81 points a ball game And they are playing a bigger faster tempo And you can see that theyve had four good opportunities to score the ball and have not been able to do that Different like you said of what you had in the past at Campbell The game was in the 60s low 70s Now the thing of it is is that youre getting more shot attempts but you got to make those or in this case get second chance opportunity steal You got to go first Campbells averaging as a team over 30 free throw attempts a game That was one of the keys that Steve Forbes mentioned on his coaches show last night Yeah we cant send him to the foul line Steve Forbes was in a good mood on his coaches show last night If Miles Coven hadnt made that shot I wonder if his mood would have been quite as jovial in the holiday spirit I can tell you that I can answer that one real easy Cam Gregory with a teardrop gets the fighting camels on the board cheering Mason knocks down another And we talked about Mai Mason being that unsung shooter Led the team in threes made with 13 Add two more to that list only six for 23 from the field in his last few ball games but two for two to start today from Mai Rebound deflected finally controlled cheering by Mason This is a Campbell basketball team that averages about 36 points in the first half of ball games Theyve had some good looks and not knocked them down Wake has converted almost Well done Mason knew he missed followed a shot Followed a shot You know where its going What a great start for Wake Forest Masons already got eight and the Deakons have the early double digit lead Seven and a half threes per game but those numbers have improved this year and scorching start tonight St And very impressive start for Wake Forest at three out of five from three line The thing also you like about it five field goals Deacons at four and two Feels like theyre a couple plays away from being six and0 and also one play away from being three and three Damn BKA Is that a pass or a shot Its a pass Well hit the rim It was too low Trying to get it to field Didnt get it high enough Cooper Schwagger is the first off Steve Forbess bench tonight Omaha Belaloo takes Rebound Bootka I love the ball movement so far for Wake Forest Blue wide open on the wing How do you feel about the defensive intensity I I really like it and it was continue to talk about you saw the double up a moment ago to get the ball out Smiths hand Everybodys down low Hands are active Thats a nice pass from Smith and inside Easy two for Fields Very good job He came out to contest Smith He made a good pass a quick pass Youre able to catch it and finish I like that Stan when you were coaching you Oh god there you go with that You knew hes worried about games around the holidays didnt he I I worried about them But yeah youre right He did screaming Uh youve got exams uh early injuries late injuries concentration got another one Theres a concentration of being able to come out and execute but you worry about a little bit of everything always but especially this time of year because theres so many things that are going on and a young team especially having because you know to get caught up in being homesick and all those little things Very confident start for Mai Mason after shooting two for 10 against Memphis Theres a tough banker DJ Smith going glass Yeah youre going to like DJ Smith Played several schools most recently at Robert Morris but he can knock down threes Had six threes against Western Michigan Hes going to get some looks What hes going to do with that not strong enough Couldnt get it over the rim Here comes Campbell the other way Okay leave him open Smith for three Offensive rebound fields No good Third chance for Campbell Yields free throws And you see one of the reasons why evident they go to the free throw line that of Campbell so much Theyre relentless on the glass Good hands trying to make contact try to score a play through it A great job by Fields The transfer for Northfor State Miles Coven getting set to check in Thatll get a good hand from the crowd here at the Joel in between free throws screaming and cheering Fields knocks down the first John Andersek is the third youngest coach in all of Division 1 college basketball He turned 33 earlier this month And ironically Wake Forest is going to face another 33yearold coach mid December when they face Longwood and their new coach Ronnie Thomas took over for Griff Aldrich whos now under Ryan ODM at Virginia Two for two for Fields along with Miles Coven Sebastian Akens and Marcus Marian also in the game for the Deaks Harrison Schwagger stay out there with the trio that just checked in And heres Coven coming off the backto back 19point games off the bench Akens hit some big free throws down the stretch as well against the Tigers to help set up that gamewinning shot Something that Steve Forbes did not overlook when talking about heroes from the game How about Isaac Carr with the pass Thats a bumping foul on the rebound action It goes against Gregory Stan Isaac Carr played two seconds and he didnt finish with any stats but he finished plus three in the two seconds he played Thats all that matters Its kind of like football in a late game pit or a late game field goat is execution Its got to happen three ways the snap the hold and the kick Well in that case you had the pass the catch and then the catch again for the jump shot And that all worked in sync And weve seen that before if youre following Wake Forest couple years ago Actually a game we did against Utah Valley Similar play to the other side Well executed Couldnt have done any better And and thats thats the difference between winning and losing sometimes Execution winding down here Juke Harris going to force a fire Catches iron but nothing more What I was going to say a minute ago is that You notice great balance in the Wake Forest offense Good spacing driving angles and theyre getting some good shots The ball kind of stuck that time Juke had to force one up But again I like the movement of Wake Forest on both sides 10 to shoot for Campbell Trying to pick and roll there And free throws coming for David Deska started all 35 games last year for the Pepperdine Waves Averaged just under 10 points per game Scored double figures 16 times And he started off this season hot Double figures in every game Had 20 against Weaver State Campbells won three of four since they lost two bygames early but they were very competitive both against both the Wisconsin Badgers and the West Virginia Mountaineers who Wake Forest will see in a couple of weeks cheering By the way the Wake foul was on Marion his first cheering Daviduss twin brother Dominikus Bka is also on the camel though he hasnt played that much coming off an injury Harris pulls it back out The BKA brothers are one of six sets of twins right now playing college basketball Nice take by Coleman And Wake Forest will have a set of twins next year when they add the Gallagher Brothers the Ped brothers Nice We Well get to that next week Okay laughter The Twins youre right I I thought youd be up for some twin trivia No Uhuh I want to see that nice little basket we saw by Culvin Thats what Im worried about right now Thats really nice Again we talked about I tell you we talked about Kulvins ability to score outside as well as inside And you saw that off the bounce takes it And hes so physical that hes hes going to have tell you what its going to happen Hes going to have a double double before this season is over I predict And its going to come all from 10 feet and free throws maybe one three because he could be so powerful See how quick he was there cheering Nice job protecting the rim right there by the Deakons I mean watch something The next time on down defensively watch how many hands are involved with Wake Forest defensively Nice job First two points for Sebastian Akens and the Deacon lead is back to 11 Watch this defensive possession right now See everybodys down in stance Theyre tossing the ball He missed it Contested Johnson for three screaming Offensive rebound fields Make it Smith rather He pulls it out Im lazy Fouls on Akens and well take a timeout Coming up next we will reflect on one of the great Wake Forest demon deacons of all time former Thank you September Very sad news a few days ago when word broke that Wake Forest and the basketball community lost Rodney Rogers An astonishing athlete a fierce competitor a beloved teammate and friend Rodney Rogers gone way too soon at age 54 Gone but never forgotten Randolph Childris said that Rodney Rogers was a transformative figure for this university and he absolutely impacted the lives of so many Stan can you describe what he meant to you Wow We dont have enough time Uh its been a crazy week just learning to death with Rodney Rogers Uh I met Rodney I think maybe in the seventh or eighth grade in Durham North Carolina and watched him grow Tried to recruit him a little bit when I was coaching and just got a chance to know he and his family He was a very special man that that meant a lot to a lot of people and I got tons of phone calls and texts believe it or not from people in the Durham and the Durham community just sending condolences to me about Rodney Rodney was a guy that lit up a room So you talk about basketball now that I think of Rodney as a man as a person That great smile screaming that big wonderful body and he always gave more than you ever got Wake Forest has lost someone special but so is the world the community I know Durham is mourning Im mourning Wake Forest family is doing so So I you know Rodriguez and Redia and Rod Jr Mrs Stella you know were all thinking about Rodney and our hearts and prayers go out to him So Rodney Rogers thank you for all you did for so many people May you rest in peace Amen cheering screaming cheering Right Hed like that move right there too Hes going to the left too You forget about him being a lefthander Will spin right there and score Chris Fields Jr with the bucket brings the camels back within 11 That was screaming time You know what really makes and the last thing I will say about the moving game what makes it so eerie right now Like I said I remember I mean boy we had some conversations back when he was in the side and everything Rodney but its so funny where were broadcast position is right in front of what the banner Rodney Rogers I mean you know its its right in front of us and so you just think about him but wow was he a special man and young man and so Im glad I had a chance to know him from a long way And from the corner here comes Campbell trying to get it back to single digits Now that was well said Stan We could reflect on the basketball accomplishments but how you described it the guy right the basketball isnt important to me right now Kovvin and one didnt finish but hell get two free throws The foul going against Campbells Cam Gregory Last last little bit since Im This is on my mind Im going to get it off my heart so I can go ahead and concentrate on basketball Rodney wouldnt mind but he would He was a sportsman Hes an outdoor guy I mean obviously the the freakish accident but he liked to hunt and fish loved NASCAR you know he sponsored a team a little youth football team in his later years you know was always willing to to share his experience and everything And Ill never forget this real quick I hope I dont mess this up but I remember when he maybe his second or third year in the league He was at a Hornets game Hes playing I guess with the Nets with Denver And I you know came down you know you know we speak to friends so Im just let me just say hello if I can get his attention And uh I you know I didnt mess with him So when the game was over I said man I wanted to say hello but he said Stan you can always come speak to me I SAID WE THROW him and I said man you know like that I said you dont know how much I said man youre an NBA multimillionaire There you go Thats Rodney Rogers play you know but he was like he was humble guy He was from Durham and he was proud of Durham and Durham loved him and he loved it So I Im done from there But yeah that was great play Great play with the dunk More free throws coming One last question All right let me tell you let me tell you about the Rodney the blue play Two hands How many times see Rodney would have pulled that rim down a little further Thats okay Maybe he would have broke it He could have He said he was seventh eighth grade when you first met him I think I met him like in the eighth grade What What do you remember from like what were your first impressions Well I just cheering kid people in the you know over at Central and everything and people talking about you know basketball players and everything you just see this big kid and he was just a nice kid He played and then I lo you know didnt really see him much and then all of a sudden next thing I know hes on the top 100 recruiting last year you know but because I knew him I started talking to him a little bit and we you know trying to chase him down but he was just a kid that played hard He was I if Im not mistaken he was recruited until maybe his junior year definitely sophomore year junior high school as a football player He was a big time football player over Hillside too you know So uh I mean just very talented and uh but all this doesnt matter He was a good man He was a good person Hes going to be missed Kai Mason for three No Nice outlet pass from Bka This is Cook met at the rim by Mason The impression once again by Wake Forest Knock this down makes it really end up good It does This is the best 10 minutes plus two Ive seen Wake Forest play on both ends of the floor and weve seen every game one way or the other Maybe we should all go to the Islands Rejuvenating experience Ive heard Buka straight away knocks cheering it down Nice job Just out the outstretch hands of Beloo But Ba again has the ability to step outside and knock down shots Hasnt made many threes more of an inside guy but that was a big basket for Campbell Just his third three of the year in just six attempts Akens in a bit of pain under the bucket Take a look here drives at least kind of got t one thing that Steve Forbes said remembering Rodney in the later portion of his life and his resilience and how he inspired people Steves wife when she had her stroke a few years ago went to this rehab facility in Atlanta the same facility that Rodney went to And that gave Steve an appreciation for what he went through and just the vast improvement he made fighting after the accident I cant for the life of me remember the name of the facility They do awesome work but I went down there I was in Atlanta for for an event maybe a couple months after Rodneys accident Tried to see him in that particular time I I wasnt able to get in to see him but uh they told him I was there and everything But they do great work So if somebody remembers that name well give them some love because they they its its so beautiful Tasos Cook Nifty move but he couldnt finish We outlets for Cal And a good job of Belu contestantly not fouling Mai Mason Strong attack Follow from Schwigger wont count but well get some free throws from Mai Mason whos already got 11 points The Deakons have a 13point lead 750 to go first half One more shot One more shot One more shot screaming Ladies and gentlemen Wake Forest with a 13point lead here against the Campbell Camels And Mai Mason has a couple of free throws This guy has been a prolific scorer at times so far in his career double figures 15 times as a freshman 23 times as a sophomore 14 times last year at the University of Washington after he spent his first couple of years playing for the Owls at Rice University And hes had a little bit of trouble with his offense lately but not tonight Hes a quiet scoreer Sometimes you dont realize hes got 14 15 points until the game is over You look at the bus wow I didnt realize he had that many but hes just kind of very methodical in what he does Hes gotten off to a really nice start some good looks with the threes plays good defense one of those kind of players at the end of a basketball game end of the season say Wow how valuable he was If youre Campbell you youve got to find a way to get some baskets 19 shot attempts five made baskets and a couple of extra turnovers Offense is not moving Wake has done a good job taking away cuts Theyve done a nice job of planting passing lanes pressuring the ball Smith not gotten good looks Passes up the three now trying to make a move Play without fouling them Toss Cook step back and fouling Campbell on the rebound shoving Mason out of the way Its on Gregory and thats his third This is not a Campbell team that goes very deep And this is the other BKA brother Dominus Hes only scored in one game this year That was their game against nondivision one MidAtlantic Christian Played singledigit minutes in every other game so he has not played a ton Beloo has the size advantage if he wants to try to back down fields makes it look easy Had gotten away with a little push there on that second bump but nevertheless Im glad he was able to finish that strong Friendly rim Theres the pressure Calm to Harris and Valoo there with a cheering foul Great job Omaha And a technical foul maybe No a timeout applause John Anders has seen enough Deaks by 18 Thank you Wake Forest on a 7 nothing run shooting over 50 in the half Omaha Belaloo his offense bounce bounce bang bang drop step goes inside friendly rim score and watch this in transition Nice move by Juke Missy but theres Omalo Omaha laughter Omaha 222 zero score Follow up the play I like that Whats 222 222 Uh just another number to uh change the play The line of scrimmage Dummy of a twohole two back half back into two hole Youve always been an expert with a dummy audible Well if you know one you sit with one You talk to one you be one Hey life is what it is Zone and wait for us How you go out of the timeout Flashing a little zone Cook gets it into the short corner cheering Theres a spin Nice pass from Bka but a better defensive play Smacked away Ball somehow finds Dominique and he cant convert And its a shot clock violation Ball didnt catch Rim If it had caught Rim it likely would have been a foul against Wake but its a Campbell turnover Watch this Watch Watch the double up in the ball Little help there Gets inside Gets inside Keep fighting for the basketball Shot goes up now And the thing about it was Juke was thinking for a foul Nevertheless another very solid defensive effort by Wake Forest Theyre pounding inside Kyle on David Sputka Grappling for position inside with Schwigger He just flashed on the bug Zero turnovers so far for Wake and Im not trying to jinx it but uh eight assists zero turnovers shooting 54 That is a crisp 14 minutes of basketball And if youre Campbell thats one thing you got to be very disappointed with They theyve averaged forcing over 15 turnovers by their opponent You know they had three games where they forced over 15 but yet theyre not able to turn Wake Forest over That means youre not active Your hands arent there Youre not getting in passing lanes And Wake Forest is going to the free throw line But even more important youre shooting a high percentage today Im tell Im telling you they this is this is a different basketball team the first half than any team weve seen so far in Wake Forest Sometime I dont worry about their opponents Even in the Michigan game they werent this efficient Oh they were playing from behind most of that game point zone area You got the blue at the top Makes it very hard for those smaller perimeter shooters Johnson for three Rebounded by Harris Camels now 1 for 10 beyond the arc Calmese kicks it Harris sticks it Wow Wow Smooth rainbow jumper from Juke Everything is looking good Heres that big point zone Got a big guy on the basketball Youre chasing it making him shoot perimeter shots If you miss it Wake gets the rebound No good for Dominique Booka And its Chrisfield Jr over the pack More free throws coming for the Deaks Wake has scored the last 12 points to break this game open You know we always talk or I talk a lot about the execution but something that steps in my head right now is the vis the ability to make plays and different players doing that The variety in this offense right now youve got different guys playing different positions Its the first time weve seen blue at the point or the top of the zone That depth that coach Forbes talked about that he hoped he could get this season weve seen a little bit of tonight I got a one in one for Mai Mason 12 12 11 12 13 That was close Its a very but I mean just you know make your free throws knock down a three 14 for Mai His season high is 20 His careerhigh is 30 cheering 131 pressure Got Mason about 68 69 at the at the point of this Again its a nuisance Try to speed him up Maybe get a turnover Maybe get a trap Pick up the dribble Theres your trap Nice job rotating Also the deep three Smith missed it Camels one for 12 from deep There you go Mason to Harris Cash money Straight cash homie DJ Smith trying to stop this Wake run He cant do it Deaks have scored 17 straight You got to make a basket if you can stop it but you cant stop this roll Here we go Calm comes up short That would have made it a 31point game Didnt expect to see this as a hold inside Now they got Schwagger Yeah Im with you Stan I didnt I didnt expect this I expected maybe 44 points by one team maybe in the first half but Campbell got spit up and and you saw what happened right there with the 131 three quarter court pressure Get it down beat the trap take the quick shot miss it boom away you go Knock down threes on the wing Do you think let me ask you a question Youre always asking me these hypotheticals or something Let me ask you a real question because you watch Wake a lot too Can you remember a time when Wake was able to get the wing jump shot as often as they have in transition as theyre seeing right now You know off a miss boom run cheering and somebodys there on the spot Do the names Terron Downey and Justin Gray mean They really do Justin Gray down in coast of Carolina there Yeah But this is just so smooth Its not rushed Its not a rush break Tough fade away Wont go cheering Look at it Two little lanes Two little lanes Two little wings Campbell still without a field goal for about 4 and 12 minutes in which Wake has now scored him 17 to one Calm me from the elbow Long rebound to the corner for Tasos Cook Didnt go in but it looked nice cheering Buka doubled gives it back outside Campbell just cannot buy a bucket from beyond the arc Buka made their only three Theyre now one for 14 They were shooting about 30 from the three line Marcus Marian thats the type of play he makes for this team Steve Forbes has praised Marion Hell have free throws when we come back import in the air tonight Its time for the winter Happy birthday Boy the threepointers are coming and theyre coming in abundance Great ball movement Gets your wing jumpers music wide open Playing good defense Knocking down jumpers on the left side on the right side One more on the left side Nothing but the bottom of the net there in transition Evan youd love it Knocking down threes And theres Juke making one more This has been a very fluid offense by Wake Forest moving the ball getting great looks How good is it Evan Well Juke hit the rim on his last three but the previous threes I think were on net Nothing But uh Wake with more threes than Campbell has total made field goals in the first half Thats not good is it Thats not good is it Its not good for the team from Buoys Creek Imagine Steve Forbes and his staff are enjoying it And and if you also notice not only were they wide open jump shots in almost every case but they were assisting 10 assists 15 made field goals seven threepoint baskets Very efficient offense Hey one housekeeping item Marian was fouled by Cam Gregory who just picked up his fourth personal foul here in the first half obviously And you saw and you may have noticed the number 54 patches Wake Forest is going to wear that on their jersey the rest of the season in remembrance of the great Rodney Rogers And thank you Coach Muse for getting us a patch as well Yeah Yeah screaming And I forgot to mention his lovely wife Fay I forgot to as I was talking about Mrs Stella and the rest of the family So we all you know were all thinking about you Snaps an over five minute long field goal drought That three there from Cook And Wake quickly answers Miles Coleman with his second field goal Just a strength part His third field goal Excuse me St No thats okay But its its its his strength of getting to the basket getting there quick Hes a matchup problem Speaking of getting to the basket quickly Campbell needs more of that for DJ Smith Well yeah Instead of looking for jump shots now they they feel cheering like they can beat you off the bounce So again thats Wake Forest having to have a rim protector but Smith needs to get going for Campbell Harris blocker charge Its on Harris Ron Guber and Jeff Pawn two experienced officials looked at each other for a second and then called it against the Deeps Lets take a look here See hand see that left hand kind of get rid of him a little bit If he stays engaged with the body they wont call that Nine Wake Forest Demon Deakons have played All nine of them have one foul each Exactly No one who has played for the Knicks has multiple fouls Thought Cook stepped on the back Didnt 10 seconds ago Think drive if youre if youre camping Think drive Cut screaming Johnson does drive and draws the contact And now Marcus Marion becomes the first Deak with two personals See its its a mind game sometimes as well as executing as the clock winds down Defensively you feel like okay I got him 10 9 8 seven I want to play good defense And theyll sometimes pick up a foul Offensively you panic as opposed to just say okay let me just drive to cheering the basket because they may panic and foul me I know youre going to think this is ridiculous No but it was fun looking at the stat sheet where every player for Wake Forest had exactly one foul Yeah it was fun to see that Now its no longer there screaming The moment is over Well this is a very close basketball team They want to do things together So I like that cheering Wakes going to have a practice I think Steve Forb said 915 am on Thanksgiving Yep Because they got the early noon tip off on Friday That is correct Hopefully no tryptophan induced sluggishness on Friday at noon OH HARRIS BEHIND SHOWTIME THE SPILLERS Thatll wake you up Thats something to be thankful for Nice pass Better finish Theres that trap again Making him so very uncomfortable I dont know if thats his best pass ever but thats Duke Harriss niftiest pass ever as a demon defac ball 113 to go in the first half Well the ability to make the play Watch this Kept his balance So watch this Boom Spillers able to catch it with two hands and finish with two hands This is a nice very unselfish screaming play You talked about the triple fans Danny Hurley told you about it I heard Danny Hurley tell you about Hey its a good idea Lets get the food done tomorrow Have a good practice and then play Let me tell you what aint nothing wrong with eating too much on Thanksgiving day Speaking for America Akins out of bounds Wake Paul 12 to shoot 59 and a half No speaking for Stan laughter was with as many ball games that are on TV and you know family and friends good food your your your thumb gets a big word from the Thanksgiving game nowadays Its got to be able to find a place you can watch a game in peace Shot clock winding down Akins raises the front rim and the fouls against Wake Not sure Smith did kind of get a little bit of a gamesmanship there Kind of touched the jersey as he was in motion to shoot That ball was a little bit off So now Belaloo with two and two shots for Campbell down at the other end trying to cut this deficit to 25 Campbell entered tonight 194 in the Ken Palm Wake was I believe 50th in cheering the nation 194 is seventh best in the 13 team CAA So theyre you know right in the middle of the pack from a projected standpoint in their conference And thats about where they were picked preseason CA Also cheering rebounded by Coven 14second differential Blakes going to go two for one They got to hurry And that time has passed cheering No clear signal but everybodys walking like its Campbell ball Yeah So a good break for Campbell You can score here and you get the ball in possession to begin the second half now So theyre just trying to look for a way to put backto back baskets together find some something to be positive about going into halftime They have shot poorly and a lot of that most of thats because of great Wake Forest defense Brock Bidwell into the game just the second game hes played in this season The first was against MidAtlantic Christian So this is a step up in competition Yeah small school up in the city Mustangs tonight school They shouldnt be playing division one basketball teams Well there are 365 cheering division one teams Find a division one team to play screaming Uh I Im not going to go there Im going to let that go But hey they play a lot of people They play some D1s They play some D2s I know Thats a criticism of Campbell No no no no Its not No no Its Its good scheduling Short rebound spillers One second Thats the end of the half Theyre not coming for free now I understand All right most points in a first half this season See if they can do it for another 20 I want to see that too because you keep that intensity going Dont let up And Im sure coach Forbes said something very similar Remember the Morehead State game had some game lamps I mean they had a big win but just kind of laps You want to finish out strong Ha on the glass lays it in Havent seen much of that out of boot cut But that was a big basket for him to get him going Only five points in the first half Hes been a big time scorer 15 points nine rebounds a game Beloo comes up short Spillers get to Ann of the rebound Keeps it alive Second chance opportunity Evan Mai Mason off the back iron and Harris got fouled This is going to stay right here Fouls on Tasos Cook Thats his first half 11 43 seconds into the half Fields is out and Monourir Newton is in Newton only played three minutes in the first half Mason to the basket Too strong Rebound Bka Cook with a skip to his step Fouled by Belaloo Thats number three on Omaha I like what Calbys just did He got him all in the huddle right there Say Guys come in and turn the fire back on Come on Light it up Lets play smart Blue was lazy that time you know as you know the bump Get get down in defensive stance Marian replaces Blue Takes a seat Each team with a sub in the first minute of the second half Wide open look DJ Smith cant bury Probably the best look hes had other than that layup on it go for the half Calmise hadnt scored yet but he had five assists in the first half Tough shot for Juke And two camels were right there for the rebound And it trickles out of bounds out of their reach Wake Forest ball You know you were talking about it earlier about the holidays this time of year with players and this is this example right now Your mind is you got to you got to stay focused on what youre doing So many things going on Youre in festive mode When you leaving for the holidays when you going to eat talking about that you know exams are right on the horizon And theres so many things to distract you that you have to just really kind of be nasty about it so to speak You know you got to be kind No no no Focus on what you got to do Not the way I think coach Fords would like to see his team start screaming the beginning of this I know were only almost 2 minutes into it but still you want to get that rhythm back and this snap back Dont want to pick up bad habits Jeremiah Johnson just picked up his third foul Calmise crosscourt Marian jump pass Harris for three Yes sir Wonderful shot I was watching Juke on the jump shot Feet were set Defender comes up in contest with those elevation and excellent follow through In high school Juke Paris was just a 28 threepoint shooter but he has really worked on that shot Hes four for seven from three tonight Well he dunked a lot in high school He He didnt have to worry about threes What Watch this Good ball movement Boom Another pass And watch the finish when we see that Watch the follow through Look at that Look at that Look at that Look at that Look at that Following through Hand in the basket Great arc and elevation on the jump shot You almost knew that was going in the moment he left his hands You like that I Oh no question about it Yes Finish Finish All right Back cut Johnson unable to finish it off the nice back door feed Cal me using the spiller screen Nate Cal me looking for his offense and hell get to the free throw line A late whistle but two free throws for Nate round One of the thoughts I had getting ready for this game Dan was thinking about Cal Me and Mason cuz I I look at their track records and think both of these guys can be big time scorers but for the most part we havent seen that consistently yet And part of that is its been other guys and part of that is theyve been struggling from the floor And I think if Cal me and Mason can you know theyre both shooting around 32 33 If they can get up to 40 45 which is where you would expect them to be at least cheering like it bodess well for Wake Forest that they havent even played that well yet you would expect them to make more shots Well Cal Mis averaged about 15 points a game last year at Washington State and Mason about 12 And thats why I was talking about being silent scorers with Mason is that he still had he said four of the six games he scored in double figures I I I it percentage No I I follow that I follow exactly what youre saying and I think that gives you some hope that if the shooting becomes better and if Cal Me But see ILL TELL YOU WHAT too Wake doesnt need Cal Me to be the big time scoreer he was in Washington State if hell get the ball see he can score just like that got the ball being the facilitator running the offense thats why I was so impressed we didnt call this team together but you expect the shot percentage is going to get better as a year goes on for for one reason These are a lot of wing players Theyre not always going to depend on taking threepoint shots Youre going to use your speed and athleticism to get big range shots A nice pass from Spillers to Cal Me Second assist for Trey Here we go This is BKA Rebound trapped by the Camels Newton Back to Buka Thought about it Dared to shoot He passes up the three Gets it to Newton whos rejected by Spillers But the foul goes against Trayvon Russ got him on the arm because it looked like from this angle he got a lot of the basketball Yeah See lets see here Down there Theres a reach Yeah Okay Yeah Got him before hes able to square up Okay cheering No problem No problem screaming But you know what too Last year I hate to use last year but thats what I mean We got to go by We wait for our shots for percentage and sometimes you saw shots and you said you knew that shot wasnt going in laughter Okay no disrespect Im just keeping Im Im always try to tell the truth You know what the groan sounds like from THE CROWD BEFORE THE SHOT LEFT HER HANDS THATS WHY I like that Juke Harris shot so well is because you could just see everything was lined up It had a chance to go in Shooting will get better I I always believe the more you work at it the harder you work the luckier you get and if you take good shots And one thing you like about this Wake Forest basketball team and you mentioned it about the different players with fouls theyre theyre very connected offensively Everybody moves out the ball well shared and rock different people in lead score Look at that Duke inside Look at that His first twopoint field goal of the night Just a great job moving it out the basketball Smith continues to struggle Hes 0 for seven from deep Wake Forest was up 27 at the half Theyre up 32 now Convention Lets go to black and gold tickets for the game Well see you in the QR code Whats an New Campbell coach John Andersek has challenged finished his team Its the toughest nonconference schedule in program history Those are uptodate Ken Palm rankings Wake Forest is one of nine ACC teams currently in the top 50 17 of the 18 ACC programs currently in the top 100 John Anders very young just 33 as I mentioned graduated with a degree in philosophy from Colombia 12 years ago where he was the team manager and then the director of operations I was told he graduated from Colombia in two and a half years those are kind of guys I dont I dont say I dont say a lot to them just just to move how you doing and you know whatever youre two and a half years really just trying to find your way to class in two and a half years Took over for Kevin McGee who was the head coach at Campbell for the last 12 years and before Kevin Robbie Lang was there for a decade So theyve had guys whove had long tenures in Buoie Creek Johnson misfires Harriss pass looking for spillers deflected and stolen Were talking about Kevin McN one of those class acts also screaming at Camp University long time coach there One of the first coaches I remember there other than you know Billy Lee back in the day particularly at the NCAA They were talking about it before the ball game with some people about Campbell and their history And you and I have some Campbell history together in broadcast with Clemens Yeah You and I called Clemens last college basketball game when I he rose up past a couple Thats when he went to what number three in the NIT You and I had that game a number of years ago in Greensboro back when Wes Miller was still coaching the Spartans Yeah I always remembered Campbell as as a kid because that was we were talking about basketball camp John Wooden would come down and for years I used to think UCLA was Campbell because you hear John Woods name talked about in the summertime Hes come back going to basketball camp at the legendary Campbell basketball school Cam Gregorys never really got going tonight Foul trouble Campbell back within 30 for just a brief second before Spiller scores again Trayvon with 86 rebounds Spiller catches a lot of passes contested You know people are around him Hes able to catch the ball softly and took his time and finish I I liked it about screaming it Gregory fakes it dishes Oh nice Field throws it down Yeah Fields had a nice career up in Norol State playing for Rob Jones Average about 10 points a ball game on some of those NCAA teams Going to be a welcome addition Just broken his start lineup recently Look at that Exploding to the basket Just so easy Just so smooth screaming and easy Gets to the rack doesnt waste a lot of time and gets back on the defensive end Bootcut the offensive glass gets two Havent called that name enough on the offensive side of things for Campbell Spillers will take it Make it so under control Leave it there We just talked about his hands Soft touch with the left hand just a little floated from about 10 ft He only scored four points against Texas Tech It was disappointing when he came back the next day with 24 Huge in the second half against Memphis And Spillers who averaged almost five blocks a game at junior college handful of years ago before he went to App State Gets his first block of the night Tear drop from Cal Nice is sweet See I think thats where you can get a lot of baskets out of Cal Nice keeping the ball alive in transition Continuing to attack Defenders dont stop him Hes got the little midrange jumper little floater Gregs fouled by Marion Number three on Marcus Watch this Goes inside Havent seen enough of this Nice little catch Able to finish it Hanging on the rim He come out the other end Just goes right downhill Whos going to stop him Who can stop the big guy Dad was a heck of a player huh You know you did you see him where you growing up I mean you know his dad New England Patriots grew up 5 minutes from Gillette Stadium in Foxboro You know I was watching Rosie Coven Super Bowls for the Patriots Little did you know that years later would be called the Suns games Look at that Amazing Isnt that amazing how sports do Oh look at that Oh Miles Coven looks on as Mai Mason swaps that shot the next Tuesday Well be careful Not a lot of sevenfooters and 610s and 611s in that paint to wake us They got a lot of 68s and 69 that can block Make you think theres seven foot Its a tough shot for Fields with the shot clock winding down Schwagger wins the battle for the board Getting better with every ball game cheering Coven Akens Mason Schweer and Marion Coven cant connect this time Here comes Gregory playing with the four fouls Nice Coming down the alley and Fields missed cheering the dunk screaming Good bad and ugly Fouls going against Campbell It just has not been the Campbells night And Wake Forest for the most part has been crisp Nate Calmese six points seven assists but he called his own number right here to put Wake up by 34 Lets go cheering screaming Sorry were not sorry Three of Wake Forest big additions this season Kulvin Mason and Cal Me continue to make an impact You know Stan Steve Forbes told an interesting story Said since co 24 transfers have taken an official visit to Wake Forest and 18 of those 24 players have signed with the Demon Deacons Thats everybody from Alanis Williams Jake Lavia Tyrie Applebee the three guys we just mentioned Cooper Schweager and others That Deaks have used the portal as well as anybody over the past half decade Chiefs ability to recruit understanding how to get the max out of players the opportunity Theres theres one to transfer it in too Thats balloon whos whos playing with more confidence Shot selection is better But whats not to like to get a chance open to score the basketball here plays an exciting brand of ball in a in a great conference in a great building with with outstanding fans Its easy to recruit here Everything I said earlier about Cal Me and Mason I would say the same thing about Belaloo I think he is any day now going to have a breakout few weeks cuz he could be an all ACC guy I truly believe that I think hes got the raw talent The raw talent Yeah I dont know that youll need him to score if everybody is Thats a nice pass by Fields finally for them But youve got another enough guys in the perimeter guys oriented that are scoring He can have big nights But Id like I I would like to see more consistency Yeah Before cheering I go on that limb right now You know youre not walking on that limb with me No No No Not right Not today But thats why you play the season Thats why you keep practicing I mean thats thats a smart play And the thing that all of those post guys have got to continue to do is be ball value In other words when the ball goes in the paint its 15 ft away Make something positive happen Pass score foul pack Nicely done by Campbell Ill clarify one thing I said Im not predicting thats going to happen but I think hes got that in his potential outcomes Well I you know I just you know wasnt expecting the pass from Min A little too fancy though It would have been nice if it worked Fields partially blocked by Coleman And here comes Beloo the other way Thats what Im talking about about Wake Forest on both ends Even contested that shot Aens to Belaloo Pivots in the lane Sets up Schwagger His first threepointer as a Nean Deacon Thats a great decision by Bel Its in the paint Didnt have anything Wasnt comfortable Youve got a trailer The trailer being a big who can knock down threes And he did exactly that Hes made 62 threes in his first 70 games of his career so he can shoot it Fields persevering and earns a couple of free throws Itll be just the 15th and 16th free throw attempts of the night for this Campbell team that was sixth in the nation in free throw rate coming into this week And that was and Im glad you mentioned that because we havent talked about the free throw line as much I think five out of the six games this Campbell team has played theyve shot cheering over 25 free throws And and I was just doing some stuff Smith has taken 52 free throws screaming Fields at 47 Duke 38 Johnson 35 Thats a lot of free throw attempts in six basketball games by four players I could see maybe one player having 50 cheering or 60 a post or a wing that cries but they have four guys But tonight that Wake has done a nice job of playing without fouling him and and what is that maybe 16 17 free throws attempt Whats a new number you have 18 16 16 free throw Yeah theyre 10 for 16 Wakes 11 for 14 Wakes made 10 threes Campbells made just three out of their 22 threepoint tries 12 against Western Michigan eight against MidAtlantic Christian Nice decision Dont force anything Youll get a shot from Swigger backing down Booka gives it up Mason try to get it back to Swagger Loose ball near midcourt Aens crafty bounce Coven at the shot clock Buzzer comes up shot Greg puts a shoulder into Aken Sets up Cook Mason the other way Taps the break Slows things down screaming Ill tell you the metrics if weight can hold this type of lead are going to like this performance tonight Oh my goodness Last time out we have 16 assists 24 field goals made Thats probably increased one one or two since I last looked Its been an efficient offensive and defensive performance overall for the Digs 30 33 rebounds for that I mean but this is what youve got to have this time of year This is what you got to have in this game I got a Nor Eastern and Nor Easterns three and three going into Friday mornings ball game And you got to come out come out Black Friday go shop go to the basketball game But you got to create your own enthusiasm So if youre a Wake fan you want to see them come out with the same passion defense Shots from far Nor Easterns not a bad

surpassed their average made threepointer count with 10 triples in the first 32 minutes on this Tuesday night Stan mentioned the Deaks will be home on Black Friday at noon to take on the Northeastern Huskies And then Tuesday night 7 oclock ACC SEC challenge Deakons Sooners right here at the Joel Four days after that a trip up to West Virginia to face the Mountaineers Thats in Charleston Its not in Its Its not in Charleston right It is in Charleston I believe it is technically a neutral sight game in West Virginia Its not in Morgan Town The fake neutral sight game just like the Greensboro Yeah the Greensboro last year for Michigan game Yeah Okay Duke Arkansas Thursday night is a neutral sight game in Chicago Although thats where John Sh grew up so figure therell be some Duke fans there Probably will be But tell me more about this Black Friday is 10 ticket Thats what I need to know I saw it on the on the Jumbotron before the game 10 tickets in the lower bowl In the lower bowl Black Friday special Juke Harris keeps it going Wow His fifth three of the night Tell all them people in Salsbury to go to the smoke pit get some barbecue get some brisket then come to the ball game for 10 You never been there have you How early does this brisket place open Oh its not brisket barbecue Its everything Okay Got ribs and brisket Guess chicken Ive never had chicken I had some brisket all cheering But its good You never invited me Juke for number six Not yet Youre talking to people about that Miles comes up short as well And its going the other way Theyll be packed tomorrow probably for Thanksgiving Wednesdays they give you three sides Its been a long time I may go to I may have to go to the smoke pit They got one in Concord Got one in Gaston What are the three sides that you typically go for It depends Sometimes try to get my veggies in you know some little you know maybe some greens and maybe a salad some green beans or something like that And then when you want to have the the things that taste better what do you get Same thing Uh fries of course macaroni and cheese all the stuff that you know good for you Yeah Good for the soul Good for the soul But uh thats thats someway chan down there food line Just stuff right there But anyway like I was saying 10 tickets Thats right Thats a wonderful thing The people should come out cheering go shop kind of work off the trip the fans that we were talking about early you know go out go to the basketball game see some Nor Eastern is not a bad team No theyre not Nor Eastern is not a bad basketball team Got some good history Another CA team cheering Kelsey Campbell As the year goes on they coming in three and three So a lot of stuff to do on Friday eat watch some basketball a little football maybe Deacon doubling up the camels 80 40 And remember that 80 to 40 And I want to see how flawless you can play this last 6 minutes and 30 seconds Palm adds to the lead There you go I think thats a shot and a spot on the court You can get a lot this season especially if the bigs for Wake Forest continue to play efficient Theres a foul Don Bouka Spillers and Bua have been battling there They called it on Spillers a possession ago This time Buka got a little over aggressive Isaac Carr gets a nice round of applause as he checks into the game for the first time I bet hes going to play more than two seconds here tonight I tell you what that pass will go down and wait for us basketball history You know absolutely will He put that on the money A great catch by Spillers Its another nice pass and free throws coming here for Miles And you mentioned the Applebee shot few years ago Then it was Hildri throwing the pass Matt Marsh a fellow Britt made the catch Yes Set up Applebee for the three that won at the buzzer right before the Deaks went to Jamaica And obviously Friday night shot Ill tell you a story I I had the Wake game on my iPad and was Friday night was working another game Wake was down six with a minute 40 to go and my car was leaving so I had to run So I hit pause on the iPad I checked the score about 10 minutes later saw that they won Couldnt believe it Went back watched it all from the point that I had paused it And uh what what a comeback So many little things had to go right Exactly I mean and thats thats why when you see a late game a late football game you watch football all weekend and somebodys coming down to the last seconds and you got to kick the field goal and youre mad at the kicker sometime because its wide right or whatever but you got to get the snap you got to get the hole then you got to get the kick And so I mean same thing with that play Its the same type of execution Its got to be flawless And what was it One one second one and a half seconds Theres that trap Again the irony was they hit it the exact same shot the day before to cut a fourpoint loss into a onepoint loss Of course if the foul had been called different its the its the old Valpo play They use the NCAA to beat Homer Drew called it Yeah Pacer Pacer Yeah I mean its not I mean everybodys got it in their arsenal one way or the other but its its been able to do it because you got to get it over a defender How do you You play it front you play it back screaming Spillers has got to make a good decision in this case because he could have easily taken the jump shot Its going to be a block Theyre going to wave off the basket No batsman here Miles wants the bucket too probably fortunate to not get the offensive foul All right here we go Take a look Squared him up and spin I mean the f the foul was when he discarded the defender not the foul was the secondary The first contact was a foul if there was one Yeah But you know Coleman says its okay Dont matter Im going go to the free throw line Ill make it dead Hes in double figures again tonight Yeah five straight games in double figures in six of the seven so far this season Well Steve Forbes mentioned the fact that Miles isnt starting but hes playing 27 minutes a game Hes one of the teams leaders in minutes Most overrated thing that fans concern themselves with And if youre a good basketball team and good players it doesnt worry you either because youre getting the minutes You know that that who cares if youre a star He goes out there and performs at a level that starters a lot of times dont So theres Jaylen Cross getting some action here in the second half Scored four points against UMass LOL after he grabbed six rebounds in just five minutes in the Morehead State game Hes been a very efficient rebounder Nine total rebounds in 13 minutes played See if he can keep that pace going comes in with just over five minutes to play Akens cross lane pass to Schwagger buys his time and then throws it away Itll be wake ball Deflected out of bounds screaming by Smith And this is the time for those guys that 10 11 12 person on the on the bench or whatever Youre getting your minutes like you just said be efficient Crowd wants you to shoot and everything You can get your shots Just run Yeah Is that efficiency Thats what Im talking about He gets He gets Yeah he gets miss rookie of the year in this conference He gets minutes but again hes got to run the team Make sure that Make sure you look like you know what youre doing Smith hasnt been his night from deep so he tries to get closer and draw some contact DJ Smith came into tonight shooting 36 from three which is pretty good Hes 0 for seven and his team is 4 for 25 Yeah but they have bumped him They have denied him cheering Theyve come out and tried to double him up made him very uncomfortable DJs only about six feet tall and youve had bigger defenders all night long coming out just chasing him around So whatever hes got hes earned but hes been a hard earned punch screaming cheering screaming One for two that time for Smith and Isaac Carr pulls down the rebound Its the second of his Wake Forest career Schwagger to cross A lot of contact They play through it Watch out for the 3second call and he scores fast enough to avoid it Keep looking for THE SHOT TILL THEY STOP YOU Till the whistle blows He was in the lane for a bit Hes trying to make a play Just keep keep playing till they blow a whistle knees anch Yeah I saw that too Isaac Carr the steel ahead Jaylen Cross denied That was a heck of a block screaming Aens rebounds the miss at the other end Good defense on that in by Campbell Schwigger missed his short We tick towards three minutes to go Wakes going to improve to five and two ahead of the Friday noon tip off against the Northeastern Huskies Enoch Colomb the Brad Duke from Quebec Campbell teams had an international flavor historically This year they got players from Australia Canada Gano Lithuania Nigeria but their international flavor has not helped them much tonight Four demon Deakons in double figures with Duke Caris leading the way A very balanced scoring sheet beyond this quartet Omaha Belaloos got nine Nate Calmise has eight Cooper Schweager has seven Sebastian Akens has six Cohen has five to keep that pattern going But alas we press on Deacon shooting north of 50 And leading by 44 Happy Thanksgiving Really You see that little that happy Thanksgiving feast week flash through the other day Had sound effects as we were going to break last segment It was directed on our screen beautifully by our crew There you go Look at that Happy feast week What you know It is an awesome week for college basketball It is an awesome week for basketball backcourt violation for sports in general I mean just you get tired I mean you cant watch them all You cant watch them all So happy to be a part of it too You know what Im saying Yes indeed Here come the walkons Will Underwood Vincent Recruit and Anson Beer Jr in the game All three of them looking for their first points of the season Isaac Carr and Jaylen Cross join these three walkons who work so hard You know the bench will go absolutely berserk One of them score Could be right here Rudy short goes in He cheering got it Hes living right He knows these rims in the Joel Lots of practice There you go In the dark Built in the dark Swear Ive heard that somewhere before I think so I think I got a tshirt Says it Watch this Good ball movement You You thought this short all the way right No I thought then I did You said short I said Wait a minute Heres a great great backspin on the jump shot Friendly rims soft touch gets the basket Now the question is can you get five more points in two minutes and 10 seconds cheering I did not expect I I I I really didnt think that the margin would be like this cheering especially the way Campbell has played you know even though they lost the Wisconsin game by a significant margin It was close Yeah it was close from a big big part of the game I I thought that uh and I didnt know what the carryover was going to be from both of these teams So Campbell was in Utah Wake was at the in Bahamas You know how are you going to be bounced back Wakes approached it well They really have Underwood Carr keeps it alive Eight to shoot Carr in the lane Beautiful move He can do more than throw it 34 court and he could score Up and under move That was empty Good for him See if we can get get another basket out of out of the baby book club He passed it up screaming Bidwell absorbs the bump plays through it These officials have places to be too but fouls going against Underwood so he avoids club trillion tonight Brother pass right there Are you are you aware of the origin of the term club trillion It was something that Mark Titus created when he was a walkon at Ohio State Now you go in the game you play one minute you have all zeros next to you in the box score If you get a foul youre no longer in club trillion cheering You miss two free throws youre in some club too A free chicken for the fans There you go if misses this one And thats a club that everybody wants Booka to be a part of FREE CHICKEN FOR EVERYBODY Thats great Thats Thats all what we need Extra chicken on Thanksgiving weekend You know what Im saying Car to the basket cheering But Ill take it Wheres it from ChickfilA Yes indeed Oh Ill take ChickfilA Even if it is Thanksgiving I could hold that Deacons by 51 You can never get too much free ChickfilA especially if you bring some lemonade with you How about that No 25 years ago Campbell came to Winston Salem and lost 8647 I think you and I both saw that score from 25 years ago tonight Thought this games going to be much closer than that Turns out we were wrong man cheering What if you get miss another free throw Do you get lemonade with the chicken I I havent read the fine print I think if you pay for it you get it Well yeah I would think that lemonades pretty tasty too Talk a lot of food these days Waffle fries Waffle fries Now give me some Give me that lemonade Here we go All right never mind on that Happy holidays to everyone Be safe Enjoy your families This is what its time Probably their final possession to get a shot up with a shot clock on Safe travels my friend Happy holidays to you Thank you very much And Ill see you soon And a nice solid win for Wake Forest And again we remember the late great Rodney Rogers This final moments of this basketball game Underwood kicks it out Shot clock is still on Wake it chance to get to 100 right there screaming Johnson missed the layup Carr battling for the board Its pulled in by Underwood Steve Forb says no more shots And that will do it Wake Forest 70 all time against Campbell 52 through seven games this season Final score 9951 Deaks by
