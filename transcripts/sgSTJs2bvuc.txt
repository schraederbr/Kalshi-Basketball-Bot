JJ Starling absent from Mike Brays starting lineup came up with an upset stomach this morning theyll bring him off the bench Van Allen Lubin moves into the starting lineup and for the men of Josh pastner Georgia Tech will go with Lance Cherry Kyle Sturdivant Debo Coleman Javon Franklin and Miles Kelly ready for basketball at mccamish and thrilled to have you with us in a veteran officiating crew Lee Cassell Doug sermons and Brian OConnell to officiate and the home team trying to snap that nine game losing streak has the games first possession Music thank you quick move inside its a good defense by Lubin and good defense by Luke we spoke earlier Luke is one of those guys whos going to allow them to stay big through Notre Dame they want to be able to have some inside presence on both ends of the floor the body garage trying to break a streak of their own tonight they have lost every road game they played nice high low and Lubin gets the layin how about Lou going one into four solid defense and they give him a touch thats one of the things again for Notre Dame that they cant establish that inside play that opened up that three ball form Georgia Tech with it Sturtevant from 16 next Applause a startiman averaging seven a game and 13 at NC State in and out for good one overall Notre Dame 10 wins 13 losses two and ten in the conference loose ball after retrieve it Miles Kelly part of this very talented softball class but they and this one banked off in good nice Runner by Miles Kelly and again Georgia Techs best threepoint shooter trying to force him off that threepoint line nice runner for him get to the basket 42 Yellowjackets heres Hammond moves it back Marcus connects one of those guys again that can go get his own shot Mike Murray talked about his team that traditionally wants to knock down the three but Georgia Tech has switched and played them mantoman Music top of the key for Kelly Applause talked about having Brian hes been in double figures four of his last six games stepping out of bounds on the catch was lacheski Mike Bray rounding up his 23rd season as the head coach of the hours but hes been coming to Atlanta a lot longer than that long time Duke assistant coach he was scheming that Duke defense to stop Brian Oliver well you know there were many times he did a really good job back in the days oh nice block good hands by Notre Dame and thats caught Carmack Ryan up the corner and a whistle this foul is going to go against the Irish push on the inside against Lubin Music Mike Bray has been known on his visit to Atlanta to frequent The Varsity oh man hes a better guy than I am because again I cant take that I mean once I was in college I was able to do it I dont know if my digestive system would handle that right now Dane Goodwin with the personal foul Franklin at the high post the rebound belongs to Hammond and thats one of the things we talked with Josh pastner is that theyve had great opportunities you see him get downhill could come up with that Georgia Tech wants to try to play with Pace because if they can get up and get these wide open shots but they got to get him to go Bob that has been a seasonlong nemesis for these yellow jackets the ability to consistently put the ball in a holezewski fouled going up we highlighted nashewski early Notre Dame will pick their points with how theyre going to play him with a smaller Guy Theyll post them up they got a big theyll take him out of the perimeter lets take a look at our keys to the game brought to you by your local Ford dealer football team for Notre Dame talk about the points in the paint theyre number three in the conference a threepoint shooting Georgia Tech is going to switch out of play man its big for them to establish that inside game but for Georgia Tech its in it early theyve got to play with Paige this is the team that traditionally has a problem with scoring when they can get some uh opportunities in transition get some early baskets thatll help a lot Applause puts in the first free throw of two changes Matt Zona coming in now for the Irish the 69 junior Hammond goes out Lubin goes out and there is another sub coming in Trey works the key role in that win Over Georgia Tech and South Bend second shot good I think was uh also at the line in overtime knocked down a couple of free throws that helps cement that win for the Irish against these jackets this is a prominent rival for Georgia Tech they play Home and Away each season Clemson is the other Franklin a little show and go gets rid of it Coleman for three Applause set up by Franklin thats one of the things that he gives jobs passer as a big ability to be able to penetrate that last time was able to force Notre Dame to have to converge and got Debo Coleman a wide open three zoner sets the screen now goes to the basket is trying to lob it over the top but the jackets break it up and it ends up in Lions Hands In and Out Kyle stervative the other way for Georgia test to the corner and Coleman jump stop in the paint hes fouled first Obama Matt Zona half Bob rathman Brian Oliver with you weve talked a lot about these close games and just seems like Brian every time Notre Dame comes to this Arena you are due for a barn burner and weve seen that especially the last two or three with both of them going into overtime I thought it interested in that last match up in South Bend Georgia Tech had the game in hand with less than two minutes to go up Seven but Notre Dame was able to come back and force it to overtime eventually win it in OG is the ninth ACC game between Notre Dame and Georgia Tech here in Atlanta all six oh excuse me all nine have been decided by six points or fewer 76 is our score in this one Applause good one JJ styling has checked in for Notre Dame Mike Ray is going to play it by ear to see how he was feeling got a drive to the basket here at the end of the clock and Id say he looks pretty good but you see Starling is one of those guys that can get to the cup and finish with either hand and again for Mike Ray thats got to be a positive sign when we talked with him early he didnt know how much hes going to get out of tonight JJ Starling has shot a very efficient 51 from the floor in the last three games little ball big cut off in the drive is Coleman and an offensive foul called on Georgia Tech last time Franklin down there trying to get the ball and the Georgia Tech is probably going to see their spacing you see Josh passion come in with Davon Smithson and more galon Moore also coming in Rodney Howard yeah which one with the iron five in the second half at NC State and I thought it was interesting when I asked him how why did he make him something he said that he thought that because his team was really under a nice little Groove offensively didnt want to take them out because you know the guys he had in that first half wasnt really giving them the point production that they needed coaches arent superstitious Brian they just dont want to take chances it seemed like he was riding that wave nice poke away and a great steal Georgia Techs got big numbers and Smith lays at home Devon Smith did not waste any time bringing energy here coming up with that steal in the finish and again thats one of the things that this Georgia Tech team needs Bob is creating opportunities to score because sometimes they dont have those laws with again scoring half four lashesky had it blocked a great rejection by Rodney Howard now to Smith and that is such a great point you make Brian particularly against Notre Dame a very low turnover team Music Terrace turns and hits well thats the guy for me that needs to get going for Georgia Tech last here is showing you that he can give you a solid 15 to 20 points a night but they need to get him going that last game against North Carolina State he struggled they need to get him going that was his first game back after a fourgame absence due to a hamstring injury Lance Terry rejoining the lineup in Raleigh over the weekend will be his first of the game you see luccheski down there Terry doing a pretty good job pulls the chair from underneath him and again when Georgia Tech is going to do with this man to man theyre going to basically switch one through five with that lineup and then Notre Dame has to do a good job of taking advantage of the mismatches Avon Smith over product who came home to play a Georgia Tech after starting at Mississippi State seven minutes gone by the first half offensive foul Andre Lon Moore good defense by lasheski being able to move his feet again five times you see big man being able to get there and then you see a little bit of a chicken wing by Moore especially doing a good job of sliding you see more comes out start to fin back in 118 jackets Applause Notre Dame looking for some offense just one basket in the last five minutes of playing time Music good one feeds it on the wing gets it back takes the through and thats gonna drop in first bucket tonight for Dane Goodwin averages just under 12 again recognized that he had Rodney Howard on him and knock it out in DC Lance here with another bucket again and look for a guy thats struggling Bob a lot of times to be able to get bucket its amazing how the three ball comes a lot easier that ten point effort in Raleigh for Lance Terry his seventh game scoring in double figures lacheski hikes up the three a little long run out rebound for Smith Music Smith energizing this Georgia Tech get it on the floor right now Terry driving to the basket you see last here he has a place going the last five going on his own personal run Josh pass you have to be excited about the production and you see how Georgia takes getting those points getting stopped and getting to early offense 1611 jackets moving in Lubin nice move by Logan again Notre Dame doing a good job of recognize when they get a switch big on little they make that big man go right down and they punish them for switching it for the guard on the big jackets have hit their last four shots Terry does he make it five no a mutual friend of ours would call that a heat check who would that be this one out of bounds and weve got a timeout 1119 to play in the opening half Lance Terry get the done seven of Tex 16 hes come out and he has started out very aggressive for the Zillow jacket team 16 points for the yellow jackets hes already got seven of them and the Irish must be thinking wait a minute is this the same Lance Cherry we saw in South Bend he had only four in that game and went one for nine well and again I like the fact that he has come out and been aggressive Georgia Tech when theyre able to get out in some type of transition early offense that gives them not to not have to match up against that set off defense for Notre Dame last foul charged to Davon Smith on Lubin who got the start did not play against the deacons over the weekend and South Bend had a left ankle injury in fact hes missed the last three until tonight jackets have been five out of the last six but we must say for Georgia Tech this is not atypical they will have good stretches in games but what makes it so crazy for Josh pastner is that when the streak of good shooting ends they go ice cold and theyve had multiple games like that where they have played very well they play like one of the better teams in the league and they just cant finish again against North Carolina state that was a game that they were winning you know I did a game here against Syracuse you see nice penetration and get the ball over to Terry but Georgia Tech will have those moments where they will go ice cold Ill run the bounce and a miss from The Wing by Sturdivant clearing is Marcus Hammond if Im Mike Brady with two bigs on the floor Georgia Techs got four guards I try to take advantage of the postups and pound that ball inside youve got Lubin being played by one of the guards Id pound that ball inside and give him a touch Applause turn around for Lubin hes been effective and heres the thing is that when youve got a guard playing against him hes a big strong body thats going to force Georgia to take the major decision if theyre going to double or not and that will open up the three ball we talked about Notre Dame being top three in the league as far as uh threepoint percentage pass inside tough luck there for the jackets Notre Dame on the run out thats a shot that Rodney Howards got to meet Ryan rebound to Kelly Stone Mountain Georgia product to the basket for Howard Smith backs it out Terry moves in nice pass reverse is good oh what a tough shot for Miles Kelly great penetration by Terry better finish by Miles Kelly First Take doing a good job of being able to break down Notre Dame again not to be redundant I would go back into the big because again Georgia Techs got to make that decision how they gonna play those bigs in the golf and theyve got Sturtevant on Lubin in the post now he comes back up top but I thought initially down the floor they had him and youve got a you see the penetration by Ryan youve got to hunt that mismatch because you know that you got four guards playing against basically two bigs catch a Juke back up top to Calvin to Smith hell drive and get fouled Avon Smiths energy but a big boss for Georgia Tech off the bat yeah the fact that his energy and how hes come out and hes been aggressive Josh Vassar is looking for some high energy hes definitely come off that bench and provided him towards that hes second foul on Ben Allen lumen free throws for David Smith hey third point now a message from Coyote Tractor my experience if you work the land you got to be a jack of all trades you got to have a little bit of optimism and a whole lot of getgo this has struggled at that line this year just 44 splits the pair but the ball out of bounds to Georgia Tech no seven first half Dean in favor of the jackets Georgia Tech fired in this ninegame losing streak the longest streak since they dropped 13 in a row in the 8081 season Smith oh oh look at those hands Im shooting that man Music not a passer Im a shooter this one rolls out rebound to Hammond Music Applause nashewski nice little give a go and that was great great pass on Ryan because lucesky fake to set that pick and he immediately dulled to the basket having a guard on him then youre talking about a guy thats six nine six ten theres no way to get Rodney Howard wide open and he goes in and misses and then a block underneath normally dont see big guys wide open they were like he was like my God Im wide open and theyre going to guard me and he makes that run then on the other hand watch that was actually a pick that galilezewsky wide open you see Damon Smith couldnt really put up much resistance and again Notre Dame has something right there Bob with being able to take advantage of those big guys that are out there Rodney Howard to the strike first foul line Dave Goodwin they switched the foul earlier from Goodwin to Lupine so thats why Lupine has two and Howard now is at the line hes been battling Achilles tendon and Ankle injuries of late free throw no good finding all these Financial gigs that are always setting picks and passing the ball right Howard found himself wide open and it was a shock for him that he was that wide open its like a scooping score for an offensive lineman what is this thing Mr both but Colemans got it Smith Sturtevant around here is Terry putting it up and off look at the energy by Smith right back up and down talk about the air Avon Smith goes in and again with the lineup that Notre Dame has youve got lashesky as your long big out there Smith is one of those guys that you know goes way up high goes and gets that rebound for the putback and he was terrific in South Bend had 1610 and added seven assists 2117 and throwing win the big three is Hammond and Hammond realizes that he had Howard on them most of the time Biggs dont want to guard a guard out there he realized that all he had to do was create a little space to knock down that three 2120 Rodney Howard Avon Smith operates shot clock down to 11 first did a good job of guarding contested that shot got a little bit of a distance and again Georgia Tech opened up this lead to four good one gives it back to Ryan moves through bounds to the corner kick for the bounds Smith the junior Guard from Loganville making an impact on the floor to take on Wake Forest big winner over Carolina earlier in the week that Saturday then a couple of home games with Virginia Tech Im not conference affair with Florida Tech before finishing out with three out of four on the road how about the play of Dave on Smith Brian Oliver and we talked about the fact that since he came in he provided that that sense of energy come off the bench got a steal for a bucket assistant Bob he has been that guy for Georgia Tech that has come in and delivered watch how high he goes up amongst the the trees down there and get that foot back with Georgia Tech he has come in and given him instant offense and again he said if youre going to back up off me you know what Im feeling my knock down that three allow Georgia Tech to extend that lead to four Davon Smith has scored six in fact theyre the last six Georgia Tech points 15 on the Notre Dame shot clock long entry and theres Smith up high to knock it away but lejevski has it Ryan will drive and lay it in nice move by Ryan and I think we have a Le schewski may be pleading and thats why they stopped the game you see Ryan realized he had Franklin was able to sell that with a pump fake gets right to the basket Lubin comes in lachevski to the bench hell attend to that cut with 6 52 to go Bob like what theyve been able with Notre Dames gotten out of movement hes giving them an opportunity a guy that could guard the perimeter and he does a good job of sealing those guys and they give him a touch theyve gotten good production out of him offensively ready Kyle Sturtevant recaptures the dribble Zips it across to Coleman theres nothing happening in the paint hes got to get out of there but throws it into the backcourt and thats a violation Coleman over penetrating right there for me Georgia Techs got to do a better job with their spacing they seemed too compacted right there and then that lane there Notre Dame has done a good job of being able to stay with the dribbler you got to spread them out especially with this lineup you got guys that can go get your own shot in Smith and also Terry that is the fourth Georgia Tech turnover Applause 2422 Applause good one to be honest with you thats probably Notre Dames best post guy Dan Goodwin they will put him in the pulse and he does a good job of being able to take smaller guards down there and he does an amazing job of being able to get his shot off Smith Cross Court to Terry ran out of Runway but a blocking foul on Notre Dame foreign Music comes in replacing Marcus Hammond you look at the lineup for Georgia Tech and who they have out there theyve got guys that can put the ball on the deck and go get a shot oh underneath Terry nice fake good block from behind by Lubin great recovery by Logan will look to be an easy basket for Terry Ryan out front the works inside its an offensive foul you see Mike gray wasnt happy with that one I thought Terry did a good job of selling it boy thats three fouls on Lumen and you see right there get the ball to the big guy Terry said and then basically when Lubin went to and a lot of times those big guys they try to punish us guards down there Bob and he said you know youre too small get him out of here Terry did a good job of selling it on the extension tied at 24 but a key man for the Irish has to sit with three personal fouls JJ Starling heads to the scorers tables theyll check in in a moment Franklin Music Smith Rises up air ball great save but into the hands a good one on the break heres words nice push ahead to Ryan open three bottoms great transition bucket you see Notre Dame when they get that ball out transition the ball does not waste any time against open shooter we saw words realizing he had Cormac run wide open uncontested three 194th career three before Matt Ryan Irish by three 701 for Notre Dame bounce inside outside Sturdivant loses the handle shot clock down to four Smith for three rebound good one good defensive possession by Notre Dame again for Georgia Tech seems like after a couple of passes their offense grew closer inside that threepoint line and theyre easier to guard that way Applause Music works Music Im high to get the rebound Jaylon Moore Applause Sturdivant top side three is good and that threepoint was set up by getting that early offense you see Notre Dame trying to get back Jayvon Smith realized he had caught a Sturtevant wide open he was able to step into that three and knock you down Kyle had his season High 18 at Notre Dame attacked one before to play first half Applause Ryan shot clock draining Ryan going to work puts it up and off rebound Smith Sturtevant gives it up in the wing they walk into the corner and the three ball for Lance Terry great ball moved by Georgia Tech anytime that you can shift the defense like they did you see Goodwin going right at Terry anytime you see great ball movement Lance Harris says Im wide open baby three ball corner pocket with Georgia Tech leading 3027 time for tonights CPI Security protecting the paint I didnt realize that Georgia Tech and Notre Dame you see those bigs down there are basically punishing those smaller guards but Georgia Tech doing a good job of Manning up down there not giving any room to The Bigs from from Notre Dame you see Josh pass has got to be happy so far in this first half of house yellow jackets have come out and performed well making baskets will make him a happy man absolutely and Lance Terrys been terrific Smith Off the Bench very good performances for a jacket team but sometimes goes just completely dry on the offensive end Music he throws coming for Dean Goodwin he was huge in that game against the the jackets and Notre Dame had 19 points 12 rebounds Toyota halftime report coming your way with first half highlights will focus in on Coach Bray and our Toyota driven features and the updates on the ACC scoreboard two free throws for good one Music weve talked about how the series between Notre Dame and Georgia Tech has been close and UC its been back and forth right now Yellow Jackets are up by one I dont think any team has gotten this lead up more than five thinking of Coach Bray so great to see him tonight spend some time before the ball game what a magnificent job he did for the Irish of course the alltime winningest coach at Notre Dame over 23 years 13 NCAA tournaments dismissed four on the clock more lets it block gotta get that midranger to go but theres Smith the game cant believe he missed it and Franklin found going on Smith know he wishes he had that little bunny right there did a good job with offensive rebound be shot by Moore no one puts a body on Smith he comes in and then by that I think everyone was expecting to go in Franklin comes up gets that offensive foul draws that fouled lets go to basketball two Marcus Hammond committed the foul for Notre Dame Franklin 73 foul shooter averaging 77 points and just under six rebounds a game Grand transfer from South Alabama he is fourth in the ACC with 16 blocks and he as you mentioned earlier Brian really stuffed the stat sheet in Raleigh over the weekend had five blocks in that game against the pack and hes an explosive big that can put the ball on the floor and attack the room you see Georgia Tech extending this this man to man typically against threepoint shooting teams theyll go into a Zone but I thought an interesting drive faster thought that they could do a better job of switching how about Dave husband goes up high takes it right down the middle sets up the sugar out the leg in the three ball by Sturdivant his second of the night Bob you had Nate laches who literally had him he had him on the front side of him all he had to do was throw it up high and Avon Smith goes and theres no pass thats safe around him six threes for the jackets Applause corner for Starla tapped out to Ryan Applause Music Applause how about the two minute block of the first half Ryan lets it Go short this time for the rebound for Georgia Tech goodbye Franklin reposts looks hits nice move by frankly I thought the first two times he tried to go he had the middle he was dead set on trying to go to the Baseline but realized that he can get that ball and jump up over the chesky with that left shoulder seven point lead now for Georgia Tech Music its on a 60 run big three for another day shot by him and Notre Dame really is playing Five out with the shesky playing like that youve got a big out there taking advantage of knocking down that three Music Franklin secured by Goodwin Applause Starling loose ball picked up by Goodwin lacheski out of the corner and thats good for three and thats where theyre at their dangerous Smith at their best when they can move that ball you see Josh pasler calling a timeout just like that backtoback threes bring the Irish within one 3635 get the ball over there wide open we talked about him the Highlight his ability makes shots he is more comfortable knocking down that three hes probably been posting up time for tonights Fresh Market discover the best sky has been better than all the rest of Notre Dame 482 wins in 23 Seasons with the Irish 581 overall as a Collegiate head coach he was talking about his days at Delaware when he got his first head coaching job after leaving the Duke bench as an assistant coach he said that his locker mate for the team at Delaware was the team mascot he would come in and address with the mens basketball hed take the head off and say boy its hot out there coach he doesnt have to worry about petting something I dont think hes going to worry about them but as as one as amazing as his resume is he hes equally a great guy I mean like you say I mean I go back to my days at Georgia Tech when he was at Duke just one of the alltime greats foreign Music Music Music with his leaping ability he can shoot over most bigs in the lead shot clock is off were down to five seconds Marcus Hammond for three Bob follow is good by lejevski and thats the half Nate ends up with nine points in the first 20 minutes and what do you know we got a onepoint game between Notre Dame and Georgia Tech where you see again shot goes up no one puts a body on lasheski wide open is able to get it up right before the buzzer weve got a good one that gets some offensive fouls they have not been able to stop them and for Georgia Tech it seems like when they can spread Notre Dame out and get downhill theyve been most successful and that opens up the three ball for them Ive always liked the first five minutes of that second half to see who comes out with what type of energy and you know Georgia Tech fans everywhere are looking at this second half holding their breath saying please can we still make shots they force a turnover here in the first possession of the second half tournament right down Peach three but kicks it out on the wing Coleman this one rebounded high in the air by Lubin back after picking up his third foul with the 5 43 Mark of the first half off the play by sturdivin but you get that far into paint you got to finish that and and take your luck and go towards the basket it was a good basketball play to get Coleman as you see moving right down there pulsing up again he is that guy that that they give him the ball because Georgia Tech has not been able to stop him down low first foul on Miles Kelly Mike Bryan the Irish went right over the top and thats whats going to happen is that you get the ball inside you force Georgia Tech to make a decision if they send another guy when they do that then thats were going to get those wide open uncontested threes shot clock at 10 Ryan puts it up with four on the clock Franklin rebounds from the wing Coleman trying to adjust the sight short with one long with the next 3837 it remains and again Georgia Tech has done a good job of knocking down six threes but I think that when you get in transition you got to try to get downhill get to the basket you do not want to settle for a three and to your point take advantages take advantage of what you have in the matchups and thats two times that you saw them get inside the paint Ryan gives it up a ball fake and a fire in and out right at the buzzer for Dan Goodwin and this is one of the things that Notre Dame misses Bob is the guy that can go down and break down the defense and get to the bucket you saw that last possession Georgia Tech really was able to keep them outside the threepoint line Franklin gives it a cross Miles Kelly at the top working on Ryan Music and this ones fumbled Away by Franklin and again Georgia Tech has to do a better job you saw too many guys down there in the paint and then by that time the Kelly got it he couldnt really do anything with it and then basically it ended up before Eternal good one had it stripped this was the change agent for Georgia Tech in the first half Davon Smith he comes back early Josh pastner realizing is that their offense has kind of started out the second half sputtering and Smith is that guy Applause Lubin is fouled I think Lance Terry got him on the arm and heres the thing that youre going to know if youre last here Lubin is not a great shooter you dont want to foul him right there you want to take your chance especially outside of the paint third foul on Lance and Ben Allen Lubin heads to the foul line six in the first half just six eight freshman coach Perry said his focus is more like a junior or a senior and youve seen that with his post play today stay tuned for the fast break presented by your local Ford dealer movement delivers his seventh point a 64 foul shooter this would take it down by Franklin tied at 38 Music see Notre Dame in this Zone turn around and I like couldnt start have been right there at the freethrow line a lot of times youll have a vehicle that may not be willing to shoot that shot anytime you can get us out there free throw line thats breaking down that defense and gives you an opportunity either shoot it or even make a run to rim first Georgia Tech points in the second half Applause front of the Notre Dame bench telling a shot clock I dont recall Notre Dame getting into short clock situations this often in the first half but they go right in to Lubin and I thought that that was a great recognition we keep talking about when Georgia Tech switches one through five lubins gonna find himself with a guard and Ryan realized that he had him you get him on the top side and no ones on that weak side to help him making that mask Coleman for three hes going to give himself a chance you saw earlier in the in the second half missed two uh threes hes going to keep shooting Because he believes that the third ones going in right well wrestling match inside and Sturdivant called for the foul as he was wrestling with lacesky making that last play watch the ball movement for Notre Dame realize that he got Davon Smith on Louisville throw that weak side was a little late and I feel like thats one of the things that youve seen a wide open day gun open for three Georgia Tech fell asleep on their coverage good one with his second three tonight he had time to check the wind and everything absolutely he doesnt missed assignment he saw last year he laid on that when Josh Pastor cant be too happy with that Franklin nice move by Franklin the better challenge at The Rim by losing been really impressed by Lubin you know on both sides of the floor defensively hes giving them a rim some Rim protection and weve already talked about his ability to get the ball down low look at him post a big strong mid post turnaround and heres the thing that I would like to see more teams do when you got that mismatch you keep feeding them until you and you make the team make an adjustment Georgia Tech has already shown that theyre not going to send a second Defender I would keep giving the ball down they make them adjust 4543 Irish with the block Pavilion dang good one left along of the corner and he makes Georgia Tech pay Applause zMAX micro lubricant extend engine life increased fuel mileage available at AutoZone Applause on the campus of Georgia Tech the Irish have taken a twopoint lead then Alan Lumen got the start tonight for JJ Starling has to dance around some foul trouble in that first half but boy has he been impressive and weve talked about how hes impacted the game on both ends of the floor great defense but I love the fact already five for five down oh and Notre Dame has done a good job of putting him in a position to get him rolling and he has literally punished all the guards that have been guarding him 11 points four rebounds and one block and a game night with a name like Vin Allen Lubin sounds like an action hero yes it does and he has been a man of action here tonight its a breather on the Irish bench 1527 to play Notre Dame by two Georgia takes it two out of six here in the second half Irish three of five Applause see theyve got Davon Smith going uh Nate was yesterday and there have been times where they tried to get the ball inside and I still I still would try to get the ball inside because Georgia Tech has shown that theyre not going to send another guy for a double Applause Scarlett checked out Lance Terry brings it ahead for the jackets and on the spin and theres run over and this is where Georgia Tech has had problems in the past with those unforced turnovers Terry realizing that he had a big on him and not and trying to do too much with the ball if you dont have the initial he thought that he could take Zona but set up your offense that last time was a turnover you get nothing out of that that possession sixth Georgia Tech turn Trey Wertz from long range of late two for 16 over his last five on threes first up for luccheski Music Applause cant get a flop warning out of that one and they do Doug sermons and the Flop is going to be called on Lance Terry this seems like a little wouldnt they have called that a little earlier though it just seemed like it was a little late and I agree I I dont think I disagree with the Flop there but the play continues and then you see the block by Avon Smith and Georgia Tech has the possession I guess Im a little confused on that one maybe thats why Im sitting over here with you and stuff out there with a whistle in my mouth Dean Goodwin to the free throw line here its going to be poor foul on Lance Terry good one now with 11 points Applause Music explaining it to Josh pastner yeah shes trying to get his two cents in its a six nothing Notre Dame run here at the shot clock will be set to 28 it does not Rob Georgia Tech of The Possession its just a stoppage to shoot the team here is Sturtevant Franklin Terry Applause Goodman to step off and watch that cutter and allow Terry to get wide open again he had a great first half interesting to see if that gets him going again second Georgia Tech three of the second half their eighth of the night good one needs some help good defense by the last tear in the end of the front good excuse me moving and now allowed to get that post up darling no back of the iron the ball recovered by Davon Smith Applause nice pass by David Smith again about 14 by Georgia Tech thats trying to find offense you want to get downhill in transition because you got a big in Franklin that can run and put the pressure on the beats another day 1330 to play Georgia Tech has cut back the lead by two Applause and Smith getting tangled up and I think Davon has called for the foul but he got theyve gotten the worst death though it looks like he may have taken the elbow to the chops again you got to give a lot of credit to the guards from Georgia Tech and how theyre fighting you said last play easy right there trying to get around here he took out probably inadverted elbow looks like the refs may take a look at it yes they are they can see if this is worthy of a foul call here as Lee Cassell comes over to take a look at it its a 4846 Georgia Tech lead with 13 20 Music left in our second half kind of looking over the shoulder of Lee and the officials here thats Doug sermons to the left Music in the second half Georgia Techs four of eight but again we talked about it the first half Ryan Smith has made a dramatic impact on the tech offense and they struggled in the second beginning of the second half when he came in that picked up the energy because again on both ends of the Floyd you see him down there fighting with those bigs and the time that Georgia Tech has been able to get in transition has been able to get them easy baskets that last run to the rim by Franklin to allow the yellow jackets to go up too see what we can see here you watch right there on this play there right there yeah and it looks like the swing through with the left hand it may have caused Smith across the chops Music another name ball out of bounds Joy foul has been assessed to lasheski his second good one rebound Lubin right back at it has been right there to Johnny on the spot I wont get offensive rebounds with Georgia Tech thats one of the guys would definitely have to turn around for the body on 48 all right you gotta hit a trade and get those gaps Applause get the big off the ground and an offensive foul on Notre Dames Nate lasheskin second foul and watch this penetration by Lance here realizing that he has lacheski up its that big gets him up on his tippy toes and finishing fighter in the room looked like a young Brian Oliver on that shot yeah hes got a little bit more well Young Brian Hallelujah I had to bounce then I thought you was saying Brian I was gonna say no bounce right now again either penetrate to the top and Kevin Terry again Music the board belongs to Troy works Applause Music Georgia Tech by two 1205 left foreign Music kicks it out warrants missed the corner three rebound Georgia Tech on the handoffs tournament oh sturda been missed Dave on Smiths wide open cutting to the basket aside Franklin and thats going to be number four on Lubin brings us to a timeout in Atlanta Franklin with a big slam and Georgia Tech leads it by a deuce visit your local Toyota dealers today Toyota Lets Go Places and by CPI Security CPI home security that protects what matters most inside the Irish huddle a 5048 score in favor of Georgia Tech right now the jackets continue to make shots tonight 46 percent for the game and in the second half the jackets are five of eleven Notre Dame is four of 11 in the second half and they have one threepointer after intermission a twopoint game right now Josh pastner and the jackets tried to snap a ninegame losing streak here tonight and it was such a seesaw Affair at South Bend Georgia Tech was down nine then they came roaring back they LED it 6558 with two and a half to go only to see Notre Dame rally with a 70 run to force overtime weve had that kind of a seesaw Affair here again tonight it seems like neither team has been able to extend their lead past five points again 5048 it seems like its been a seesaw interesting to see the wish team can actually go on a minor run here extend their lead its one of those matchups of course the college game is 40 minutes but it wouldnt matter if we played 20 minutes 60 minutes its going to come down the last possession I was going to say the same thing because weve seen the entire game Bob where its fluctuated by three four points as you see right now interesting to see this 524848 league is that the biggest lead of the game it is Applause Music foreign Applause Music maybe not so much on the challenge but going on and kermak Ryan is one of those guys I love him as a player because hes an American shoot the midrange and can put the ball on the floor probably one of their guys that could go get you a bucket when you really need it threetime team captain tells you all about his character free throw is good point number six double figures in four straight coming into this one for Coach boy nearing 200 career threes hes up to 194 after that first half two free throws good standing foul shooter at 80 percent 5250 Terry Applause Music best opportunity there I would not leave nation flushesky wide open Runner is good by sturdivance right there inside the freethrow line that midrange game he saw that last time the pick and roll between he and Franklin Music Irish had been on the cold side theyve cashed in at the foul line but just one of seven from the field here off late were down to 10 25 catch and shoot Ryan in and out Applause Id like to see them get the ball to Franklin it seems like he can put the ball on the floor and swing pass and get past Nate lasheski foreign gets it back halfway through this second hand step back as good as that looked I really thought that Smith had him and he just could have kept going to the basket he didnt have to hit him with the heavy he just could have gone right to the basketball finished and the left hand to the hole good move by Heaven realizing that he had Smith on his right side for a lefty to be able to get downhill no resistance by Smith Southpaw Hammond now in double figures with 10 first Notre Dame Bill gold since Lubin left the game with that fourth foul absolutely you saw that last play by Franklin he should realize you cannot dislodge The Defenders hang being called for that offensive foul and you see watch the pit the post up you cannot slap that off I mean you know that you cant do that Josh pass has got to be I rate with him because he comes out with that foul and thats one of the things that you cannot afford to have that kind of foul on that that type of play foreign Music Applause Terry was backpedaling anticipating a whistle and it never came and if youre lastary you got to hold strong there Cormac Ryan did a good job he dislodged him understood there was no whistle and then he just took advantage of being able to get that open opportunity to finish the layup died at 54 Music thats true went down no whistle shot clock at seven goes one on one got the man in the air and missed the shot well when you got the defender in a helpless position like that go right into it definitely have to and thats one of the things I think they do a better job in the NBA but if again if you get him off like you said you can draw that contact and if you dont make it you get the free throws lucchesky Nails the three and again luceski is one of those guys that will post you up but if you give him an opportunity to set his feet its deadly outside the threepoint line thats what he would prefer to do 70 Notre Dame run Music 810 remaining Kelly Airborne I feel like the guards from Georgia Tech are settling because if you have with just yet theres a big you can see a wide open tripping right there again this is where Notre Dame is at their best knocking down two consecutive threes Josh pastner has to be upset with his team 10 consecutive Notre Dame points to go up by six and good ones up to 14 his third three tonight time out jacket Point our Coyote Tractor Turning Point atteno Notre Dame run and Bob you and I talked about as this game is seesaw back and forth which team would go on that biggest run and as of late Notre Dames doing a good job of being able to stream some really good baskets theyve done a good job of being able to probe that defense with Georgia Tech get some wide open shots and this is one of the things that you know about this Notre Dame team is that theyre one of the tops in the league in threepoint shooting Georgia Tech up until now had done a good job but as of late poor shot selection by the Yellow Jacket has led to early offense by another day whats the antidote for Georgia Tech well I think that again they need to spread them out and get downhill theyve been a lot of opportunities for their guards to turn the corner I feel like they are settling theyre going east to west rather than attacking the rim foreign Applause Applause Music Georgia Tech 7 of 17 in the second half for 41 percent Notre Dame up to 47 as well theyre eight of 17 Music Notre Dame has made tonight eight threes same number as the jackets and free throws right now for Nate lecheski speaking to Boston College Nate had his careerhigh 29 on seven threes against BC back on the 21st of January pumps this one home well we talked about him and the fact that how hes a mismatch most bikes dont want to go out and guard him and who can shoot the three hes only he could put the ball on the floor and then they will give him the ball especially when he has a smaller guard on him in low post second shot good Avon scored eight for a tab points not yet in the second round it comes to Terry weve talked about the fact behind the Georgia Tech has lost nonconsecutive games do you have a sensation as Franklin and he gets trapped underneath seven on the shot clock four nowhere to go heres Coleman can he get it off in time yes and it wouldnt look like they were headed for an empty possession and I was going to lead to that time and time against Michigan in the second half they have those empty possession Coleman was able to come up and knock down that shot if thats where it is is that they dont have a guy that can go kill him when they really need it thats why Im always talking the more they can play in transition without have to set there against the setup defense they can take advantage of the athletes in there quickly Music 5258 Music Applause Jerry comes around keeps driving to the hole reverse wow 17 for Lance Terry and weve seen two backtoback possessions with Georgia Tech when theyve been to come up and make spectacular shots and it seemed that Notre Dame was going to open up this lead he got it back to a close game again 6260 spins it out heres good one Music Applause right into the basket lots of contact and the foul cold Applause that last possession I want to say that evil comb is probably in the restricted area you see come back Ryan over there yeah hes definitely in that restricted area late there not settled if youre Josh past you almost willing to let him go because I think Devon Smith may have come up with that block happen right the point I was trying to make he wanted to get your opinion about it and it could be any team not just Georgia Tech but youre in a in a nine game skid you get to the second half youre in a close game as theyre a feeling that of individual play like Im going to do it Im going to bring us home not with the team in mind of course but you just try to rather than run that offensive do the things that got you there well I mean you look at this team and its probably where the absence of Veteran leadership because again you got guys that want to take the gain on themselves and I dont think its a matter of selfishness right its trying to be accountable we talked with Josh pass and he talked about how the energy was so high in light of them losing nine and you think you have guys that want to step up but sometimes you have to stay within the system and take the opportunities rather than trying to go outside of what the team youre trying to do yeah no reflection on anything but a team spirit but its just like you know maybe tonights my night and to get us over the hump for my team and normally this is where a good point guard play comes in because the point guard is basically trying to put people in the right position and when the team drifts outside of it thats the guy that puts guys together in the Huddle and say hey lets go to this play Lets go to that play interesting again as you see 6460 how is Georgia Tech going to be able to take advantage Notre Dame again we have not seen Lubin out there when he comes back in the game can they go back and exploit those mismatches and Im sure Mike Bray feels like hes playing with some house money leaving Lupine on the bench with the four fouls and a fourpoint lead Applause Music a little hesitation move Franklin scores it and low pick and roll they got a lot for Franklin At Last Time got the mismatch and you got Franklin with a guard right there on the low post and he had him right there under the basket Georgia Tech its his last four shots Applause Ryan gives it up 15 to shoot camping on the drive nothing doing good coverage Inside by Coleman take it out Hammond fire rebound Georgia Tech and more solid defensive possession by Georgia Tech Id go back to that same paper you see the spin Music Applause Franklin that would have tied the game and if Im Franklin I take one more dribble to try to dislodge and get closer to the basket youre in no rush because youve shown that you can shoot over listen Music Applause Goodman out of the corner Applause Music a lot of contact no whistle Smith Jets to the other round Music he turns it over that was a rough plays to put put more in if youre if youre Devon Smith he wasnt ready for that ball Ryan glass no Tech the other way running with Coleman Smith shout out to that whole life Smith can take inside that lane hes not looking and he can Elevate over them and shoot right over and Josh pastor wants to take a time out here three minutes and 48 seconds remaining Notre Dame but Georgia Tech one more time to the wire Applause young man Dane Goodwin probably no one ever will he clips that Mark that he will eventually set time for tonights zmax Max performance look at his numbers 14 points four for eight field goes in three for five of them and Notre Dames had balance scoring I felt in the second half when they hit that ball they were staying good but then basically came out and gave them some big buckets this one where you had a chance to actually you know arrange his hairstyle knocked that down and he has shown in the second half Bob and giving Notre Dame a huge lift offensively Dan Goodwin was an allconference performer last year when the average close to 14 a game and back in the big man then Allen Lubin whos been so effective tonight but has been saddled with foul difficulty in each half he has not played since the 1139 mark in the second half and the Irish were down by two he comes back in theyre up by two three on the shot clock Pullman lets it Fly and a foul on Notre Dame if you might great you have to be besides herself you play very good defense and then on the bailout but Debo Coleman you fouled him on that three again watch the handoff right there between Terry and you see words a little late and gets him right there on the edge of the elbow foreign three big free throws for number three Debo Coleman hes a 66 percenter at the line this year this is his first visit 3 333 left first one good point number nine Applause Notre Dames lead is one two down one to go into works I hope you didnt have dinner plans we may be here for a while I have dinner plans wherever you have an open tab you know I got you Bob the Jeweler man I got you he hits all three Georgia Tech lead 6564 interesting to see what Georgia takes defense if they continue to switch if I might bring I tried to get the ball to my man Lubin hes proven every time that hes able to get a guard down low hes been able to punish him Applause Lubin most up position but Tech covers it well back up top to Ryan 10 to shoot Brian gets it off follow no Tech rebound Georgia Tech and a 92 run Applause its making a poster Franklin spins gets fouled and sticks it in and thats what you wanted to see for Franklin going immediately I thought that many times before and he gets that ball hes sitting around hes taking too long that last time you saw the feet and look how deep he has with Jeske get him down there no man and turns quickly on absorbs the contact for the and one again great recognition has him sealed and Powers the ball up heres Georgia take an opportunity to extend this lead to four Franklin has 15 points nine boards three assists and completes the oldfashioned threepoint play now Georgia Tech leads it by four Music szewski the fake the reverse for two nice rebound by lazeski supposed to take dogs to pull it they passed under this the screen and allowed him to get a wide open shot but even in that no one puts a body on eight with session 6866 Georgia Tech 2 28 left Tech trying to bust this ninegame losing streak here at home Terry looking around Sturdivant Applause now its going to be Smith with two on the shot clock Smith Rebound with the Irish good defense by Notre Dame now they got a chance right now dont need a three take your time on your offense Applause good win Byers short loose ball Ryans got it underneath hes smothered Applause about in the locker room you get a good stop right there and you see good challenge right there by Terry Georgia Tech has to come up and then you lose that rebound and then youve got or Meg Ryan the right place at the right time with opportunity to tie this ball game a little another two minutes to go Ryan with 11 a perfect four for four at the line Notre Dame has missed only one foul shot all night 12 out of 13 Applause that would barely touched the net Music 6867 Music thank you for Point number 13 perfect 68 all with a minute 56 Georgia Tech has run an action where theyll come off with the pick to be able to get the ball inside I think if you give Franklin an opportunity to go or you can get maybe your Davon Smith to get downhill Ive been trying Terry rebound belongs to Lubin and you that last shot by Tim you can get that anytime because again when you saw how he went there were too many guys it was too bad Georgia Tech has shown that you better when theyre spreading them out Al Notre Dame has an opportunity Im still looking for that mismatch down low if I can get it in front of Lubin with Smith he comes around gets it drives it Mike Brighton was a goaltan no call Georgia Tech the other way Smith gives and the dunk is missed by Terry and if Im Lance Terry you just make the shot you dont go for the Highlight spot right there this opportunity you see come back Ryan going to the basket a shot of two strong off the glasses gets back trying to cut Smith off and the shot is short Applause down the stretch 68 all that Mike gray says lets talk it over again that last played Mike Mike gray was by right there you see moving down and then you see Franklin come I dont know partner it seemed like he got that up there and you watch again I think if they could hit the glass they did not he got it in the cylinder for sure and then heres another play you see Lance Terry going what was I love the uh the athleticism but at this gut you really needed a basket Georgia Tech had two missed opportunities to go up the dunk contempt by Terry and then the fast break when you saw Davon Smith going oneonone against uh Nate lasheski you know we could have just met at about four to nine eastern time and just put a tie score on it doesnt matter 22 6868 doesnt matter and just let him play a minute play a minute its uncanny how these games come down to this last minute anybodys ball game well if I can go into the Huddle for Notre Dame I might break what I do is I run some type of action knowing that Georgia take us on a switch I still go inside if I can the guy has shown me that I could they could go get a basket its Cormac Ryan if they shift out on him let him get downhill and try to penetrate Georgia Tech youve got to stay solid if you got a small on a big you front him with the weak side help everybody goes to rebound Josh pastor with a final Ward for his troops of the officials get the guys out on the floor 24 seconds on the Notre Dame shot clock and 418 left in the game Georgia take a swish on this mantoman everything they have switched you cannot afford to let anyone go on guard Applause Music top three as far as threepoint shooting teams in the in the conference Barrels in lots of contact shoots and missiles rebound Tech shot clocks off dear Georgia Tech you want to make sure that you go under 10 seconds again you dont want to be stagnant with the ball Id run some kind of pinned down action and try to get downhill you see right now Davon Smith one on one you push him left and they get the foul to stop it at 68 thats the fourth on lasheski and that is the fifth team foul on Notre Dame can Georgia Tech you do not get this last play has to be going to the basket youre going to get downhill or you want to try to grab get some type of contact you do not want to help Mary with almost seven seconds left to go in this game Notre Dame has saved another foul to give and they take it here and that slices Another Second and a half off the clock were down to 53 if Im Josh Pastor I have Davon Smith come and get this basketball to try to get downhill Music Georgia Tech with the ball 53 remaining Notre Dame has one timeout left Georgia Tech without any more timeouts remaining and what set this up is watch the defense by Debo Coleman you see luccheski try to get some clearance Coleman stays solid and then he comes out and secures that rebound and this is a spot as you look at the Notre Dame huddle first game goes overtime this one is five seconds away from overtime but if youre Jack pastor at Georgia Tech these are the moments that youve been waiting for weve got our opportunity to win lets take advantage and the ball is on the opposite side of the bench and if Im Josh pastner I I run something to allow a Davon Smith to get it and get down here with his right hand and use that athleticism to get right to the basket we do not want a three we do not want a contest a jump shot if Im Notre Dame I force them to put come to the left side of the field to get to their weekend because if youre going down here with your left youre not as aggressive coaching staffs have had their say now its up to the 10 men on the floor 53 left Lance Terry is the trigger man Dave Goodwin on the ball for Notre Dame Music the bounce entry to Sturtevant Kyle driving Kyle for the Baseline at Georgia Tech wins I think it beat the boxer theyre gonna check it but I think thats gonna count the nine game lose
