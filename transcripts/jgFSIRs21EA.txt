Tuesday for Wake Forest how good was Tyree Appleby 35 points 11 assists and he set an ACC record with his 23 made free throws he did Roca Dickie Hammers record Another wakeful is great record stood since 1955 he was living at the striped down the stretch in a big win for Wake which wins the tap and away we go from the Joel Aaron WinstonSalem to start out this double header that will continue in Coral Gables with Louisville at number 19 Miami but first its the jackets and the Deeks awaken the white has it with damari Monsanto the Sharpshooter from long range he throws a lob too tall for canned Hildreth and a turnover to start we check out the Georgia Tech starters and Randolph theyve gone to this small ball lineup over the last few games and you mentioned Lance Terry you think he and Jayvon Franklin have been the keys I think theyve been playing really good basketball since last Thursdays return he had missed four games with a hammy since his return hes averaging 15 points a game hes helped freed up his other teammates now his team is really doing a really good job of sharing the basketball now they got four guys on the floor at all times capable of scoring double figures after the hamstring injury Terrys been back hes been big and it was a great win right at the horn like we showed you against Notre Dame Wednesday to snap that skid Tech comes in 212 in the ACC second to last in the conference but theyve been playing better basketball recently but its always interesting to see how teams come out and they play against this this uh Princeton style offense there and you know weve covered them in the past teams that went to denying and now wakes choosing not to do so Kyle Sturdivant gets the three to go Wake Forest with a small ball lineup of its own Andrew Carr starts at the five so that means Davion Williamson returns to the starting lineup for Steve Forbes and Hildreth off the turnover pushes in transition for weight and a chance at a threepoint play Camille just think getting it done on the defensive end hes one of the ACC leading steals he just adds to us told it right here getting his hands up getting his deflection and coming away with it taking things in his own hand with the ant one there on Sturdivant guy who has really taken a jump forward third leading scorer sophomore from England and one of the guys who will be in the mix for most improved player in the ACC you would think he should be I mean hes taking a sophomore jump I like to take thats the biggest jump you see most times and freshman year only four points and jumped up to 12 this year and been a really good player for the Deeks this year you mentioned the prince and style offense for Georgia Tech how do you expect wake to counter defensively thank you well wake is just trying to theyre adjusting their sagging off Javon Franklin theyre giving him the shot Damien Williamson Center Court through one kind of guards to Princeton action a little differently wake is choosing to let Javon Franklin catch it and then theyre just backing off trying to clog up the lane a little bit keeping everything in front wait Deeks wants to keep everything in front stay between the man in the basket just contest jump shot this is not a great shooting Georgia Tech Yellow Jacket team Miles Kelly no dice for deep yeah Steve Forbes to us this morning he said stay underneath you dont want to be out denying everything in the Princeton style offense dont want to give up back doors want to keep everything in front and contest Music this game will be about Pace today too Deeks one of the number one offensive team in the ACC they want to push this in the 80s Georgia Tech wants to control it a little bit Carr rounded down off the lob and he gets the roll very fine here on the Baseline out of bounds just not seeing the man involved just throw it up steal your two easy points in the Baseline out of bounds four point margin early on the first two and a half minutes for Wake here at home at eight and six overall in League action Cal Sturdivant has scored in double figures in three straight but he missed that one loose ball to Hildreth and here come the Deeks on a 70 run Corner three Williamson notice this time both teams doing a lot of switching so lets see if theyre just trying to attack matchups Joe to Tech will go more into their Princeton style offense when things break down the Deeks will go more in the ball screens shot clock at 10 for Debo Coleman he backs it out and now Miles Kelly with clap to shoot he pulls up from long range kept the line by Franklin but right to Monsanto Applause speaking of ball screens we saw a lot of them from Wake Forest against Carolina highlighted by Tyree Appleby picked off by Lance Terry the jackets run Debo Coleman saved it and no he did and he was out of bounds along the sideline well Steve Forbes got a big win in that victory over North Carolina his group now tied for seventh entering the day with Syracuse in the ACC but only two and a half back from the top of the group and now backtoback wins at Notre Dame against Carolina and according to Joe linardi hes got them as his next four out so effectively his seventh team out of the field at the start of the day yeah theres a lot of work to be done for the Dukes I think obviously they got to take care of home court tonight they got a big week next week being on the road at Miami and then at NC State I think they have to get one of those wins and theyre going to have to avoid any difficult losses from any of the lower Place teams in the ACC if they want to get into the dance helgrith scores check out the full look at Bracketology according to Joe linardi a lot of movement today North Carolina Clemson was a big game earlier today and the heels got a huge bounce back win in Chapel Hill yeah its amazing Clemson started today was in first place and right now considered maybe a team on the bubble but not in the tournament its just unbelievable when you watch the rankings yeah its amazing Rodney Howard in Off the Bench he missed it Monsanto secures it and Georgia Tech is one of seven from the floor with a couple of turnovers Applebees pass is picked off I think Georgia Tech will get to their Zone soon here Kelly rounding out offensive rebound Howard in the putback Alvin and Jerome Franklin are both just too big they complement each other well really good offensive rebounders here on cue enjoy the text back in his own yeah like a guy who has studied a lot of Georgia Tech tape through the years in your time at the coach for Wake Forest you just know what Jack passner is going to dial it up yeah Applause the wig tries to solve a shot clock winding down on Davion Williamson who gets fouled by Kyles third of it five minutes in Wake by four at home on this Saturday in the ACC as your AC basketball is presented by Subway Subways upping their game for the AllStar Subway series menu just ordered by name or number 30 points Tennessee before Tyree Appleby did that against Carolina on Tuesday you were the last guy to do it for Wake Forest in 94 also against Carolina we cant get my pitcher in like high definition or something man like do those exist are you kidding me no he had a great performance and outstanding I dont want to talk about my game he actually won his game we lost that game so well I wasnt going to mention that well its true yeah uh yeah Wake Forest did win that game in large part due to Tyree Appleby 35 points seven rebounds 11 assists only one turnover and we told you 23 made free throws Steve Forbes actually joked with him hey you missed five at the line if you had made those five you would have had 40 thats a lot of free throws most guys dont do that in a five game stretch he got 28 free throw tips in one game it was crazy last two minutes alone he was 15 for 16 at the free throw line and we joked with Steve Forbes earlier today and really in all seriousness as impressive as any part of that was that Wake Forest kept getting him the ball in bounds despite North Carolinas best efforts I I dont know if there was any uh in the basketball at that moment but they responded today credit to those guys but hey if you wanna you got to get the balls entire recap of your hand just to close games and he was you know he took wake home and thats what he does for this team when they get it close they know they can put it in his hands and theyre going to win or lose with him making the decision late in the game you asked him earlier today whats he got bumping in the preak oh yeah I said future its always future he said hes going to be light nice and relaxed and under control today so he said hes going to hit a little future going so thats thats the theme of the day his his music theme always dictates his play its been working out pretty well for Tyree Appleby and his one and only season here in WinstonSalem sixpoint game Devon Smith is into the game Off the Bench five in gold for Georgia Tech as Debo Coleman misfires Blakes doing a great job keeping everything in front Georgia Techs settling for jump shots Pastor was pleased to get that win he said after the game goodness gracious we needed that badly yeah you need any win but when youve lost nine in a row you know you just know the dam has to break eventually and credit to those guys since Lance turret returned his team has been playing a lot better theyve been scoring a lot better its not showing so far in the first six minutes of this game but theyve been a much better offensive team Monsanto cant get it to go from the corner and it belongs lets see stays at this end of the floor with Wake Forest I think its the right call and again against this Georgia Tech one three one zone the corners of that zone is where theyre most vulnerable so youre going to see wake put their best shooters in the corners try to hit gaps and kick it to those guys and Monsanto of course one of the very best in the country 41 and he has made 793 and Appleby out of the right one two with Corner three what do you know its a great job though week four its just moving to basketball finding the open guy thats where Georgia Tech is running where theyre going to move it quickly put their best players in those corners and knock down shots like it just did there and Wake Forest is one of the best threepoint shooting teams in the ACC Sturdivant to miss fire Monsanto clears it see the note 37 percent this season from three for Wake helgers off the ball fake Josh Pastor needs a timeout foreign Applause with a fake to that corner and it opens up him streaking to the cup hi Im Jeff next Saturday and heres our ACC and mens basketball double dip hit Virginia Tech and Blacksburg five to Eastern and then at the Yum center Clemson visits Clemson trying to get back on track after a few losses here over the last few weeks and here in WinstonSalem Wake Forest off to a great start just like they had Tuesday against North Carolina the lead is 11 here these first seven minutes on Georgia Tech Smith misses on a long two quiggs doing a really good job of running our offense getting the shots they want theyre getting the open threes another offensive rebound there theyre getting the right shots that they want I think Jordan Texas is settling on the other end Avion Bradford is tagged for foul pushing off battling for a rebound do you think Georgia Techs settling offensively for too many long jump shots theyre playing outside in one thing about wake wake leads to ACC in threepoint shooting but they attack you in the paint thats how they get those threepoint shots right now show the text playing from a threepoint line in Lakes doing a really good job the defensive game plan you can tell is to stay between them and the ball keep everything on the perimeter and force this team to make jump shots like this stavon Smith probing and then kicking and it sets up that kind of look for Jalen Moore again thats what you want get the paint Force help Force rotation kicker to a shooting even guys who arent considered great threepoint Shooters when you get looks like that they tend to go in a lot of the Georgia Tech players since that win Wednesday over Notre Dame they talked about better ball movement better flow for them offensively Assad there Bradford puts the ball in a bear hug and we get a whistle with 1209 to go here in this first half Music turnover on Wake its already there fourth here in this first half I dont think that was Bradfords fault he caught the ball on a run its up to the pass of the Guard to be his eyes couldnt see what was in front of him as you rolling to the rim there Smith off a ball screen Tavon Smith has played great the last month or so for Georgia Tech he finds Jayvon Franklin attacking Carr on an offensive rebound and Franklin will go to the line for a couple when we come back to WinstonSalem would wake in front by eight Music with one of the best savings rates in America banking with Capital One is eight minutes of play so far its Camp Hildreth eight and Georgia Tech game in the early going in this first half in WinstonSalem yeah cams put so much pressure on the Ramones to talk about again its not a great threepoint shooter hell take open looks but right now hes in efficient three for three from the floor and hard to top that when youre getting right into the rim so want a mini offensive weapons have hes drawn a lot of attention this year the sophomore season for how as a guard he plays so much in the post and we were chatting with him before his game on Tuesday and he said really before I got here to playing in the United States playing in Wake Forest that was never his Mo as a player offensively you should have seen his tape you know I was their own staff when recruiting him and he was shooting jobs he was just a score and thats the score but when he got here he just has the ability to play bigger than his size he plays like hes 68 and Ive watched him post up guys that are six eight six nine in his league and score on him so hes just a hes unusual weapon full guard and just really really efficient hes taking a major leap as a sophomore in his League Worthing England he is tough Javon Franklin by the way and made both his free throws the margin is six Midway through the first half theres Hildreth oh what a pretty fake and it rolled off Music Avon Smith thought about it hes got Hildreth on him and carry is called uh Davon Smith what a move there by Hills he just gets to his spots and he plays off two feet and hes so physically strong tough Miss there and just calm down by Davon Smith thats the Fearless turn over there Georgia Tech as you can tell intentional about pushing the basketball trying to score in transition they want to try to beat the Wake defense down before it gets set even though as you said earlier Josh pastner said to us today they dont want to get into a track meet against Wake Forest they dont but they have to score in transition like this when the opportunity presents itself more its a blocking foul and Jalen Moore will shoot a couple on quick shots and long rebounds like that they can get out and get numbers theyll take advantage of it just like that I think hell just lean in a little bit back a call kind of jumps into him a little bit hey I have my hands up lets tag for his first so Board of the line sophomore from Alabama yeah you talked about scoring and transitioning you said to Josh pastner today man you think Georgia Techs transition offense has gotten better the last couple of weeks well with Lance Terry coming back he understands who he is and hes a really good shooter so he runs to the corner and hes spreading out your defense so now with the small ball lineup down theyre much more efficient than they have four maintenance overall but in half court it allows them multiple handlers multiple guys making shots attacking you in different ways and then multiple handlers in in transition so theyre just doing a lot of different things for a team that struggles shooting the basketball down 11 theyre on a 70 run you saw Music in the bottom perimeter is not not offensive rebound though Carn Williamson back down Monsanto not gonna miss again its only different shots one never touched the paint took three that time Davey and wheels can get to the paint forces rotation he knocks it down basketball game is pretty simple man when you do it right yeah anything as a shooter thats a nice way to get the three wide open kicked out well misato he didnt care how he gets as long as he gets it so the first one or the second one you know thats his first four connected on his first and then Davon Smith counters with two and the weight lead is five monsantos feeling it wanted another member he hit eight last ER Day in South Bend Indiana against Notre Dame and he wants you soon to take shots but the difference is the one that he just took before that he made came within the flow to the offense someone else created it that one was just a I made my last win Im gonna Im gonna pull up and take the next one Smith in the midrange theyll give them no shots all game long just a matter whether Georgia Tech wants to take him theyre going to play in their drop coverage on ball screens and sit in the paint try to keep everything in front of them Smith not known for his jump shot but he has come on recently against Notre Dame Wednesday eight points nine rebounds seven assists and he was the first individual the Josh pastner singled out post game after that big win he said that his energy and positivity throughout the week was huge more with a block of car Smith bounces for more the Franklin follows and a timeout wake Force great defensive effort there just running the floor transition again this Georgia Tech team is going to look to push the ball then transition theyre not going away ladies and gentlemen we have a game in WinstonSalem dicks up one Music welcome to the neighborhood after the win on Wednesday against Notre Dame Lance Terry said I think these last three games have been our best in terms of effort and Jayvon Franklin said that win is a confidence booster for Georgia Tech coming down the stretch and youve seen it carry over today but I mentioned to you and shoot around today you can tell by the energy in the chatter or the group there was a lot of Pop to him I think this team knows that theyre better than theyve been they feel comfortable and I think they theyre going to enjoy playing the role of spoiler and and I think theres a belief that they feel as though they can get to Greensboro and make something happen thats how Josh pastner has broken it down when he sized up the schedule the final eight games of the regular season up top from Applause app just plays physical basketball and dunks how many times have we seen that and said that this season big guy showing some bounce Davon Smith around the ball screen shadowed by Williamson and again in the midrange this time cant connect yeah theyre going to give him that shot I think he can take it a little early if he wants theyre going to give him that 15 footer all game Williamson gives it up for Appleby only one bucket so far for Tyree Appleby off the 35 points on Tuesday Monsanto pulls up and the rebounds secured by Franklin Kelly hoyce and hence is a different Georgia Tech Team you know throw the record away this team is playing much faster theyre more capable of scoring in transition and as you see now when certain guys get open looking three like that theyre gonna take car no run down by Kelly and the confidence swells for Georgia Tech Music Jalen Morris attacks through the contact great shot fake getting to the plank finish there Music Jayla Moores got seven Off the Bench last two games that only played 14 minutes total and hadnt scored and its coming back with Georgia Tech Music Applause shot pick here in the corner just puts it down gets up hang time baby got himself a ball game Jordan check up too welcome to the neighborhood we told you coming in Joey bracket says Wake Forest is next four out at the start of the day so effectively seventh team out and this is a quad 4 game and as you said this is a very different Georgia Tech Team and not what you would expect for something that qualifies numerically as quad 4 no theyre theyre a much better team that when you get an accomplished play now I mean this team is Jordan 16 is healthy now but when you get an accomplished playing its just so difficult you dont expect when youre playing the ACC to be in February playing card four games and just the way things are the landscape of everything right now and youre a Wake Forest and you have postseason plans as you do you just got to find a way to to win this game if youre flipping around and just landed on this game at one point Wake Forest led by 11 he did Georgia Techs on an 185 run theyve got 13 points from bench players 10 from starters Kristen Maxwell pushes off and meanwhile Wake Forest two of its last 11 shooting and theyve had some turnover issues yeah I think Wade got a little jump shot happy as well in which coach Forbes gets a little upset with his group when they do that so expect them to cause some plays now and get a little bit of execution from the group and I think youll see the ball in Applebees hand maybe some ball screens Laughter Marsh knowing what he does jumping and dunking Music at 10 points four rebounds in 13 minutes against Carolina five of five shooting it was his first time in double figures since before Christmas and boy did he and Davion Bradford give Wake Forest a lift and they knew that those two guys would be important against Armando baycotton company horse got a piece of it but Kelly sticks with it and hes got a chance at three thats just one of those 50 50 balls Jordan Tech won that battle 50 50 ball gravity Music Applebee just sees it as the ACC leader does has been doing it all year long finding guys making teammates better in here just coming up with a loose ball there Miles Kelly known as a threepoint shooter but hes starting to mix things up Music yeah hes got six now as he stamps a threepoint play coming out the season low four points against Notre Dame only played 22 minutes on Wednesday where theyre switching Springs with apple with Applebees again great job just identifying the switch Mars just pushed the guard up the lane and he throw it over the top no weak side defense there by Georgia Tech and he just slams at home great job great find Music George attacked by one Franklin from the elbow hes done a better job initiating offense from there Moore nearly ran it down but it belongs to Wake Forest hes a little hesitant to take that elbow jump shot I mean hes he has that as repertoire hes capable of making that shot but he just keeps trying to get closer and Marshalls giving him distance going right into them when you do that fish was not going to give you the call coming up on five to go in this first half Bobby Clinton The Talented freshman from Sweden way too strong and now Davon Smith leads Georgia Tech back Kristen Maxwell can score It Off the Bench good drop off for Franklin and now more resets to Smith hey Tom Sergeant Maxwell is home for him no he lives right there in Charlotte Music Applause navigate Franklin on the offensive glass kept it in on the Baseline and then got caught in the air Appleby cant haul it in just trying to get it trying to get an easy one there and had numbers a little rushed it a little bit just over through Applebee youd like to have that one back I think he could have had a dribble up three maybe one of the easier shots hell get trying to play unselfish basketball and just an unforced turnover there sixth turnover for Wake which only turned it over five times in the win over North Carolina Davon Smith hes got seven 26 from three but you can see it he is feeling good both teams are doing it you know a really good job their game plan is to keep everything in front and when you do that its susceptible to make you know threepoint shooting and shots and right now both teams are comfortable because theres no pressure on the basketball theyre taking open looks like that pretty ball movement Zone theyre gonna put Five Guys on the perimeter spread it out put the best Shooters as I said the pointers they know where to attack this Zone another good look there this crowd comes to life trying to will wake to a stop Smith leads to an offensive rebound Kelly connects both teams looks like a horse game right now anything you could do I can do nine for Miles Kelly wakes going under those screens so that you know its a confident group and its playing with nothing to lose so those shots theyre going to take them now its Josh passner ready to get into a defensive stance himself Appleby gave it back for Clinton got back tapped by Davon Smith and stays with Wake Forest despite the gesticulations of Josh pastner here in this first half got a ThreePoint Contest going on here in WinstonSalem Georgia Tech is coming to play Miles Kelly with a knock down jumper here tucked up four Music ESPN app its a triple header of womens Hoops BC and number 14 North Carolina at noon followed by 11th ranked Virginia Tech hosting number 19 Florida State and then Zurich Houston number 10 Notre Dame on the mens side here in the ACC some games that have already gone final we told you about Carolinas big win over Clemson bounce back Carolina won that game by 20 and then in Tallahassee how about Pittsburgh they are 113 now in the ACC theyre 187 overall and Jeff Capel might be the front runner for ACC coach of the year he may be I mean it was threeheaded rate three horse race there at one point in time and if it is hot take I think Pittsburgh will get one of the double Bots I think they have a favorite favorable schedule I think theyre a really good team in the world coached team I dont know how hot that is either I mean theyre playing some great basketball they started the day in that threeway tie atop the conference at 103 out of careless turnover s and individually playing here by Way Avon Smith went diving on top of the pile he gets saddled with a foul as cam Hildreth was at midcourt after nearly another wave turnover I dont know what he was thinking I mean look at this he just comes over there from the top rope boom well you know what thats a fumble drill thats a football hes playing a wrong sport hes a football player his argument might be that that I didnt touch him he went for a driveby swipe on the ball he did he stopped dropped and rolled on that one though Applebee no but Marsh follows and Matt Marsh has eight on you guessed it four dunks theres just no answer for him size wise Franklin just doesnt have the girth to hold him out Ronnie Howe was the only one coming in with enough physicality to keep him off the rim lets see how many more touches he can get Howards only played two minutes in this first half Smith kicks it out for Jalen Morris had a very nice Half Off the Bench seven points three assists for The Talented sophomore forward March the rebound Appleby pushes and Maxwell swiped him Tristan Maxwell head blocked by hildred Maxwell follows oh Tristan Maxwell tried to detonate during the Joel this is a homecoming for me he has a lot of family in his dances to say his young mans from Charlotte and he tried to come home and make a poster if you know anything about Tristan Maxwell oh folks he is not going up for a lay in a finger roll no no and he was going to let you know about it if had he made it oh he got that from his dad yeah hes got that honestly he cant help him so hes got that from his dad its a great block though it just goes up and whoo great hot good Baseline out of bounds drawn up to Bobby Clinton and Georgia Techs sixpoint lead is down to four th off a baseline out of bounds there lets see if Dakota Tech continues to being mantoman has something to monitor in the kind of stealing points and based on how to bound plays Miles Kelly is slow to get up so the officials stop play AJ decide blew it dead and Kelly comes up hobbling and well check out of this game just shy of halftime hes all right leading scorer for the CIA George attack and nine for the jackets in this first half he got tangled right near the free throw line subscribing his left ankle Music Smith navigating up top Franklin hello Music to a spot to find him and Damon Smith continues to play good basketball card from Appleby you have to force Applebee to use the screen he rejects the ball screen forces rotation when the bid comes over thats why hes leading the accent assist hes going to reward his big man every time and its defending that you got to force them into the screen Smiths floatergov yeah Applebees six assists thats right at his average you said it earlier leads the conference and assists and now weight can hold for the final shot down by four headed to halftime Georgia Tech changes the defense now theyre theyre in their Zone look for the ball to whip around the perimeter and try to find one of these Corner threes monsantos off the floor right now Williamson back out for Appleby Williamson off the shopping thats how the first half comes to an end game of runs right now weve got a selfie Echo game Wake Forest jumped out at 11 and Georgia Tech closed the show Georgia Tech leads by four in the start of our double Heather on a busy day across the ACC lets go to the studio Kelsey Riggs run to the point continue to play yeah okay they just changed the lineup sorry but it is still worth monitoring and he came out out of halftime out of the locker room and did test it out here on the floor pregame well show you what happened to him he appeared to just roll his left ankle but good to see you for Georgia Tech fans that Miles Kelly is out on the floor wait goes to work with Cam Hildreth getting blocked by Jalen Moore who also starts out a halftime Tristan Maxwell wanted to transition three weeks on offensive rebound Jayvon Franklin and a good start to this half for the jackets the jackers are going to look to scoring transition quickly they dont get it now look for the get into their Princeton offense here shot clock winding down on Davon Smith who gives it up to Miles Kelly who lost the handle stays with Georgia Tech all right watch Miles Kelly 13 and goal watch his left foot here wow awkward standing step on anyones foot just pimp it off Franklin did not get it off he had one second to shoot on the Baseline out of bounds and Josh passner hes frustrated yeah hes telling these guys I had no idea how much time was left on the shot clock there Wake Forest meanwhile they had eight turnovers in the first half only got three points from Tyree Appleby did have six assists gets into the midrange back iron Appleby is one of five from the floor the threepoint line is such a big part of Wake Forest attack right now and then there are only 4 16 from behind the line and youre thinking as much Zone as Georgia Tech plays they shoot a better percentage right now thats going to be critical if they want to get back to command of this game Maxwell lost it Williamson off the hesitation kicks it back out Appleby theres the three nothing like a pink touch and an open three again Avion Williamson creating for his teammates Rose of reverse sometimes when youre at school you need other guys to help create easier basket for you Davion Williamson has just been to Mr do it off awake it doesnt get as much credit as I think he deserves its as tough as they come excellent threepoint shooter and the Creator when he needs to be he has accepted a new role this year for Steve Forbes Moore slashing Franklin another offensive rebound and then he went up and down against whistle for a traveling violation its a great drive and find it its wide open you wont get it open more open look than that he steps up and knocks it down its only barking in the first half came with 13 49 to go so he went about 15 minutes of game action between buckets car pops out cant hit rebound Smith s got to give back a match up here still unmatched up you can see it coming they got away with one Kelly had a good look Franklin another rebound hes got 11 of them already and then Smith got bumped and Tyree Appleby gets tagged with a foul that these fans disagree with wake defensive but just never got mashed up didnt communicate didnt find it Im sure theyre talking about right now in that huddle like hey get back and communicate on your matchups again this is Georgia Tech Team 2 and 12 in League action Wake Forest eight and six backtoback wins the huge showing against North Carolina Tuesday but still on the outside looking in at least according to Joe linardi at the start of the day and this is a quad 4 game that wake does not want to lose morgos spinning gets bumps and he will go to the line gets fouled by damari Monsanto yeah throw the records out of the window here I mean this team is playing hard and confident and they have their complete roster something he hadnt had all year and its just a confident group right and theyre playing well Josh pastner has been rolling with the same group of guys when gets into tight games recently and so hes got more out there we said Maxwell starting this half as well tonight nine Eastern after our doubleheader that wraps up in Coral Gables the nothing but net crew will break down the day in the ACC with highlights and Analysis and a look ahead to next week as well right here on acc Network and the ESPN app Duke and Virginia have been locked in a tight one they have Appleby tried to jam it regurgitated by the rim Moore has one pop out himself got the rim playing defense on both teams Here and Now helgrath misses this is a track meet Smith pulls up cant hit battle on the boards last Touch by Franklin can you still dunk I couldnt dunk 25 years ago I know I cant dunk now oh you gotta ask Corey one day when youre working with Corey about my Duncan hell tell you about that its one of the most embarrassing moments Ive ever had thats coming late night with Corey Alexandria Monsanto off a nice feed play on execution there back door screen no eliminate the weak side help got an easy basket wont get one more easier than that so its a onepoint game Georgia Techs last bucket came with 57 seconds to go in the first half so about a five minute drought Kelly turned the corner tough shot over Carr and jaybon Franklin soars to follow its the plate if theyre running there theyre doing a dribble handoff and when youre playing in that drop coverage the guards are getting caught trailing behind us a defensive mistake doesnt walk through today we heard the coaching staff say go under the dribble handoff they want to avoid that thats something Im sure theyre going to talk about in this time Jayvon Franklin has had some follows just getting into paint nobody boxing them out putting it on cars head great game here in Winston youd go back the last three games coming into tonight for Jayvon Franklin the sixth year senior big man for Georgia Tech he has done everything for Josh pastner and the yellow jacket he does it all he rebounds you know hes creating an assist hes hes the key to that of the point forward position in that Princeton offense his ability to pass and dribble handoff hes going to the Double Digit I think the most underrated thing he does is offensive rebounding and his shot blocking nice Vamp in the league in blocks per game and here in this one hes got eight points and 13 rebounds already as Tim Hildreth gets fouled and Jayvon Franklins play is a big reason why Georgia Techs been able to go to this small ball right thats been effective for him the last few weeks well he has hes so athletic I mean hes a guy thats only brought six seven or so but he plays like hes six nine six ten he has a quick jump long arm reach really quick for a big and as you see there he has 169 against Notre Dame and hes been averaging that for the last three games and I think thats a combination of all the guys getting getting everyone back getting everyone healthy theyre having multiple guys on the floors created this level of competition and they dont have to rely on certain guys every night and its been a different guy any different combination of guys that they get going and its made them effective offensively theyve always been a pretty good defensive team Music and Jayvon Franklin had a huge block on Van Allen Lubin of Notre Dame down the stretch in that twopoint win against the Fighting Irish on Wednesday on the flats and Hildreth makes more its a onepoint game just over four minutes into the second half Karen WinstonSalem Georgia Tech one of its last eight going back to the end of the first half from the floor a lot of time going off the clock here they just want to go right the ball screens Music and went 15 seconds into the shot clock to initiate that with Smith and now Franklin got bumped got it tries to score over the top of marsh and he does he knows he has to attack march with his quickness he cant back him down so hes trying to set the ball screen get the guard to come down and attack and hes getting lobs and more importantly if the guard goes to score hes getting to the offensive glass see the note hes got his fourth double double and then Lance Terry denies the lob to Marsh Smith right down the lane the fools cant be happy with that no one stopped the basketball Music first thing you have to do in transition you run back got identify the ball and stop the balling Smiths count 11 speaking to stop the ball Lance Terry best perimeter Defender according to Josh passner he is hawking Thai Appleby did a really good job there standing on his right hand helgra at two and about who just put so much pressure on the rim constantly throwing fouls there does a great job cuts off the angle there going to the line here for an M1 thats the type of stuff you saw in film just a pure score well he did it all over I mean he scores it in so many different ways I think hes fundamentally hes a better shooter than he is and hes shown from the threepoint line I mean hes only a 30 threepoint shooter in a year on the season and I think hes a little bit better than that thatll improve I think hes lost some confidence even in his free throws I think he missed something late in one game and I think hes lost some confidence there and but he just does a really good job quick crush on teams Franklin denied that lob to Marsh wakes got numbers Hildreth did not trigger Appleby is barking out signals shot clocks winding down and Hildreth left it short and its secured by Kelly those are the threes youd want him to take off the catch of that last one there and he just waited on the defense to come and end up driving himself into traffic theyre not going to get a better shot in The Possession than when he originally caught it to step up confidently youre making shots youre making plays take shots Clinton didnt bite more pivoting and the rebound Monsanto Hildreth leads all wake scores with a dozen Appleby too strong Music Kelly is left alone and missed it Smith the rebound and the reverse wouldnt go its stays with Georgia Tech one of the issues you have playing against this Georgia Tech Team Jamon Franklin so so runs the floor like a guard and Martian struggling the awake is changing and I think theyve realized that taking Marsh out of the game they need to get quicker on their front line because what he does is he makes the guard have to take him in your rotation and your defensive matchups get all screwed up and you end up giving up open threes in transition like you did there so its back to a small lineup for Steve Forbes you really got to watch out Forest Franklins offensive rebound and his 15foot jump shot the one you were asking for his half for him to take that shot because the game plan to keep everything in front they were backing off that and hes a matchup Nike I mean he really does heres another steal getting a passion Lane is a big Franklin lays it in and Jameson Franklins doing everything for Georgia Tech on the road hes doing what hes done the last four games Music expect centers to get in the passing Lane coming down and doing a little bit of everything from Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets here when just doing it all tip dunks catching oops big man is just catching offensive rebounds putting them on peoples heads getting out in the passing Lane you dont expect Senators to be doing that you guys completely taking over this game here early in the second half see hes got eight of the 12 for Georgia Tech in the seven minutes since halftime hes got 14 points total 13 rebounds couple of steals you said hes six foot seven Josh passing earlier this season takes really about six foot five and hes playing this well you heard the guys in the studio with Kelsey talking about all right well whats the counter to that for Wake Forest why cant they capitalize on him being the tallest player on the floor for Georgia Tech one because he plays with a level of quickness but whats really happening is the guard hes setting ball screens with dribble handoffs and the guards are getting in the paint forcing the big to come over and rotate and they just cant box them out its no different than what were seeing with Marsh Marsh gets the dunks because Applebee gets in the paint like that and more guys are just put more pressure Jordan Tech just seems to be getting more into the paint awesome rotation and theres just nothing they can do to get in front of jaymon Frank you cant expect the guard to box him out Elders meanwhile has 14 and Franklin and the jackets lead by five Lance Terry Lakers is having a difficult time guarding the dribble right on the hill dribbler who wasnt guarding the basketball putting pressure on the rim just getting in the paint theyre getting too deep like that from Kelly but he missed it and car clears it Applebee silky cross over and hes blocked by Smith Carr is fouled by Jayvon Franklin his second boy Davon Smith can get up hes got that Mike Monaco vertical yes spread the gospel the big time block there Music the lead athlete car for two misses the first ACC Unity week tips off next Saturday with this mens basketball doubleheader Pitt Virginia Tech Clemson Louisville five and seven right here on acc Network and the app Devon Smith told us earlier this year his vertical 45 and a half thats sick thats impressive pretty impressive Music Applause foreign runs off a couple of screens and Terry he and Franklin cant score and wake pushes trying to cut this to a one possession game Monsanto nearly walked with it I thought he did I thought he got away with one there he has been quiet two of eight shooting from the floor one of six from three and what is that from Debo Coleman he comes out and fouls Tyree Appleby and Josh pastner says that wasnt the plan Applause hes the reason that Im hanging up in those banners obviously the focusing staff and my teammates but just what he meant to me off the court is just balancing everything just a tremendous man I know he is his family are dealing with some health issues with his lovely wife but praying for you Charlie you know I love you and the childrens family is forever grateful and indebted to you for what you did to me thats beautiful man special man special special man and for the career then that you went on to have here your son had here you got to share those years with him The Best Time Ever you know Ill get that I get off ask that question quite a bit someone will say to me how is it coaching your son its different its an adjustment but its absolutely amazing and uh my four years of being with him far exceed the four years that I played in that uniform its just amazing thing to watch and be able to coach your children and knowing the importance of how Planet your Alma mod and with so much history and uh thats why this is a special place for me thats why Ill never leave I was like a corner man in a boxing match when you came back up at halftime having you off with sweat because youre too busy kissing babies as you should Im home Im home Im home with my family baby Tyree Appleby man bull bonus already 11 minutes to go we heard that on Tuesday Debo Coleman knocks down a three its a great job of executing their offense there miscommunication on the back door cut didnt talk both guys went with the cutter and left Debo Coleman open for a wide open three this teams confident now theyre making shots Colemans first points its Georgia Tech by five if youre just joining us maybe you watch that great finish in Charlottesville its been a good one and strapped in steps out hes got it off the bench and its a twopoint game just going to say someone else besides cam hell just have to step up and wait for us offensively and freshman great way to step up knock down the shotgun Applause Hal Sturdivant had two thousand the first half hes been quiet Franklin caught the lob and then missed it too strong started ahead and altered by hildred and this place is vocal this building was supercharged on Tuesday for the Wake win over Carolina a game wake led by as many as 26 Applebee took the ball car tries to follow but he lost it to Franklin Devon Smith pushes off the bounce he lost the hand hildred is bumped by Coleman will shoot free throws with the foul coming on the floor and the one in one on the way I think youre starting to see a little bit of fatigue as well Music team is really going deep into their bench probably on a sixman rotation right about now and free throws to play a big part here going down the stretch of this game remember for Wake Forest Tuesday in that game against Carolina it went 33 for 42 from the line now of course a lot of that 28 of the attempts 23 of the makes came from Thai Appleby but much like this second half is shaping up to be they got into the bonus very early pay our womens basketball triple header for you tomorrow on ECC Network and the ESPN app first its BC and number 14 Carolina at noon then a top 20 showdown at two with Florida State and Virginia Tech capped off at four oclock with Notre Dame against Syracuse Hildreth makes both save on Franklin is out right now for Georgia Tech foul away from the ball goes on Damian Williamson theyre really small right now you look at the lineup out there for Georgia Tech Applause I think theyre just trying to buy time Applause how its been nursing some nagging injuries and playing a few minutes early right now his team is playing with Jalen Morris the starting Day sturdivin always good in the midrange Clinton the rebound and wake wants to take the lead Applause Music Appleby dumps it off and Clinton will go to the line with a chance to give Wake Forest just that Applause great things happen for weight whenever one of their guards get deep penetration Force rotation theyre drawing a lot of fouls and when theyre not they kick out their best I think the the best threepoint shoot shots that theyve had tonight has come from the penetration of the guards even passing it to one another or Bobby Clement coming in hes been giving his team the Boost in something in the second half just like hes done the last three games big minutes for the Freshman from Sweden those last three averaging 26 minutes a game and Steve Forbes has said and he has learned how to play off a two feet he has slowed down its under control and the Freshman has given wake a lead on a 123 run new respect to see that with a freshman when you get to February youll often tell them youre no longer a freshman youve been been through enough battles there where thanks for slow down Moores only made three threes all season and Josh pastners not going to wait around now because Jayvon Franklin getting ready to come back into this game after they tried to steal him a breather on the sideline yeah you got as much time as you can get him Appleby tough shot yeah difficult shot there wasnt balanced Applause Kelly hunting got it from Sturdivant this is where the Princeton offense gives them issues because theyre not opening up the plank but coach costs time out there hes going to give Franklin the game his stunt is coming back Georgia Tech is locked in a good one with Wake Forest in WinstonSalem Music where it feels like nio was meant for this guy and for this partnership Tyree Appleby with Applebees and the deals that got announced this week after oh so conveniently Tyree went for 35 and 11 and said an ACC record for free throws against Carolina on Tuesday and now hes got this deal I its perfect how fitting Im wondering what took him so long today I told him I wanted some lemon pepper wings so theres no problem just let them know Well what took so long I mean they reached out to him he told us earlier today in November two and a half hours of filming for the commercial he told us Im an actor now Sturtevant had to hang in the air against eating by two inside of eight to go with the ball in the hands of their star Tyree Appleby Music off the bounce tried to coax some contact from Sturdivant and now backs it out to Hildreth whos the leading scorer for the Deeks today with 16 and then Bobby Clinton follows with 10 driving again Terry the rebound this is where Bobby got to learn too you reach for the ball you got to get back Terry attacks and hes got a chance at a threepoint play that ones on the Freshman shot goes up you got to get back he stays behind hes trying to Gam for the ball doesnt get back he doesnt stop the basketball they run right down the lane and his teammate gets the foul and then one for it so something theyll get correct with the frame room on the young fellow and Lance Terry with his first points of this game averages nine per GardnerWebb transfer in his third game back after missing four with the hamstring like you mentioned a guy whos been as key as anyone the last week I think he and Javon Franklin have been the reason this team is playing as good a basketball as theyre playing right now and again now hes on the floor hes probably the best threepoint shooter and you got to watch him with all the cutting and movement thats going on hes their best perimeter Defender as well and what is it block or charge on cam hildren with Terry defending the anticipation builds with Jamie lucky and AJ Desai Music and its a block thats the longest call ever Music I thought we had an NFL huddle right here does a great job of holding his ground and they could have called that either way I mean hes youre entitled to your space and I thought if you kind of failed the first time they may have given it to him but by the second time I think he was already in a no charge area and its an automatic block if youre not elevated boy Terry was just banging in so many of those battles in the game against Notre Dame earlier this week and some of them went both ways charge blocked we had flops involved in that game as well in a game that got pretty testy this type of year youre going to get that I mean as everybodys playing for so much so much at stake something thats got to come out and you got to show you dont need to have your best stuff but you need to have your best effort Applause wake by one seven to go start of it probing Terry cutting and finishing Applause what a game just back and forth Winks got to get one of their big guys got to get big guns got to get going here right now Applebees struggling from the floor Applause huntmen and hilders have been the guys and Clinton gets fouled by Debo Coleman Music four on Debo Coleman Como comb is critical because he gives them the versatility to defend the four spot dont leave him picking up his fifth hey weve seen some amazing fans from across the ACC and now we need your help throughout this winter accn wants to experience each sport from your perspective so snap a pic or take a video tag it use the hashtag all the devotion and you might see it here on accn Applause Music Applause Music back in his pinch post action here start of it driving on Appleby started and knocks it down hes got a guard a ball its too much size there to getting too deep both teams get great shots when their guards get in pain when the ball touches the pain Applause apple b around the corner on board great job getting the paint again and its so quick especially he gets to that right hand this is dominant right hand player and spies leading the ACC and scoring you said the stars have to be stars for Wake tied at 60 Sturdivant shook Hildreth and it rolls up Music Applause crucial game for Wake Forest Quad 4 game against these jackets eldrin back out for Damian Williamson shot clock below 10 eldrin finds a cutting core at the room great move by Carl good cutting away from the basketball everyone standing around watching the ball thinking that hell just want to attack the switch great Cut Great Bond great finish Music Applause Music Steve Forbes took the time out after these buckets Applebees just getting down in the middle of the lane scooping it at the rim and just a great cut here Grapevine put the Deeks up too what a game what a game if you havent been with us throughout Wake Forest built an 11 point lead the first seven minutes of this game but then George attacks stormed back and actually led by four at halftime on the road after Georgia Tech on Wednesday snapped a nine game losing streak here in the ACC then Josh pastner told us earlier today he had never experienced before in his time as the head coach and you could tell it wore on him and his team but they talked about the confidence that they had coming out of that win and quite frankly how theyve played the last few weeks and they have been in a battle with wake all night well losing beats you up mentally it just does it too for yourself your coaching staff and your players and this team we had them a couple of weeks ago at NC State and that game went down to the wire they just didnt score the last two minutes of the game Music playing better than it their strong play have just continued Music Daemon Smith a big first half for Georgia Tech so did Miles Kelly theyve both been quiet in the second half and Kelly misfires Applause so many tight games this season for Wake Forest Appleby stopped out a dock holds his pivot foot nearly turned it over Carr bails him out and now cam Hildreth with the shot clock at seven Carr robot wow Dave off Smith with the contest that was gorgeous Davon Smith needed all 45 benches knocks it down wow great play Great Bond great pass wow is literally jumping for joy on the sidelines and he should be his his guys are competing hard and theyre fighting Applause eldrick on the Baseline and he gets fouled by Miles Kelly so free throws coming when we come back after a massive three and Josh Pastor is show him how to do it coach Music all right ACC Network basketball is presented by subway subway is upping their game with the AllStar Subway series men just ordered by name or number ah yes the power of the face Shields and what a run it was for Josh pastner and the yellow jackets a couple of years ago were getting close to the ACC tournament about what 20 minutes from here in Greensboro this year and this day has the feel of a postseason game with the energy throughout this building all night both teams going back and forth here and just matching plays and getting stops when hes time one person to one they come right back and and double up on him so its just been a back and forth game all night and all afternoon and lets just see who closes out who steps up here tie game three minutes 20 seconds to go who wants 63 all cam hildreds got 19 hes drawn 10 fouls hes nine of 12 at the line meanwhile at this end this guy Lance Terry has eight of the last 10 for the jackets Davon Smith initiates with Hildreth on him shot clock winding down Devoe Coleman yes Applause Music hes not expecting Debo Coleman to make that shot if hes the Geeks 31 from three and needing to tag on that role because theyre so concerned with Jayvon Franklin catching lobs and he tagged and just couldnt get out to the shooter Monsanto cannot answer and Georgia Techs got it two and a half to go up by three and Wake Forest needs to stop plenty of time left no need for the beaks to panic just need to settle down here and get it stopped Josh passner has been coaching right out of his suit here in these last few minutes yeah anything with Jayvon Franklin here with a dribble handoff allowing him to either in the ball screen or roll the question is what do they do now after he turns the corner because hes there for the law Smith threw it up there and got the shot to go expect the Dukes to make a switch possible they got to do something different got to keep these guards out of the paint Tavon Smiths got 135 and five and some good defense hes on Appleby who gets two thats four stars need to step up and bring your team home and Applebees doing his part right now this place comes to light in Winston Salem inside in 90 seconds to go in the second half I want to simplify it its going to go right into a 15 ball screen right here with Franklin Smith circling probing kicking Coleman down battle on the boards and an offensive rebound Kelly plenty of time plenty of time here this is a must stop you got to get a stop here with the fresh shot clock here and damari Monsanto is on Coleman so Josh passner takes a timeout with a minute to go so I was faster trying to decide where the basketball is to control the play whether its sideline or Baseline he finds out at the sideline out of bounds play its a big stop here for the Deeks down three you dont want to go to a two possession game here under a minute you need to get a stop you dont have you dont need a three theres plenty of time if you get a stop to come down run your offense and get it too so but this is a big possession here I like to say this so were in the guts of the game this is a big component of the game right here after this one from Georgia Tech One timeout left on both sides it is another one possession game for Steve Forbes in Wake Forest and for Josh passner and Georgia Tech too they feel like theyve been in a lot of these games and that they are better than the record would indicate well weve talked about that a bunch I think Wake Forest has been in so many oneposition games they were four and two to start theyve been on the back end of the few of those lately theyre four and five and thats in that Span in these one possession games and theyre in a dog fight right now when this one is its going to head down in one possession side out of bounds 10 to shoot on the shot clock for Georgia Tech another ball screen Smith rejects tough ball away no great stop to everybody Deeks now you got to get him Applebee wants to get to that right hand Applause shut off by Smith now a handoff for Carr Denial on Hildreth tried the back cut on Hildreth car underneath off the glass no but hes fouled Applause its a late whistle Jamie lucky blew that one a little late I thought it was a foul they call letting the players decide to game it had he made it I dont think he would have called it but when he missed it a long time Jamie lucky one of the best in the business third foul on Jayvon Franklin so Andrew Carr to the line hes one of two there tonight 75 percent this season for the junior Delaware transfer twopoint game huge game for Wake Forest this is quad four a team that Joe linardi says is next four out as of right now car makes both its a onepoint game now its a onepoint game and its got a 30 second clock here now so you cant let him run it down to one second so wake has fouls to give here so Music one one second difference I expect weight to go all off the steals if they dont start using some of their fouls theyve got two to give Coleman runs the Baseline and start thats team foul number five God weight Force the second on Pilgrim you look ahead to the free throws Georgia Tech has a team the worst in the ACC from the freethrow line at 69 percent yeah but Lance Terry and Miles Kelly are the guys shooting mid 80s so those are the guys if you got to get to the free throw line youll see when its time to do that right now Sturdivant needs to have the balls in his hands you need to get ball handles and hands right now weights looking to foul Terry throws a rescue pass into Franklin Music Monsanto was there along the sideline Music Applause fake fans dont like the call yeah its a foul they slapped him on his left arm there foreign Shooters in its a lot of pressure on this free throw but its going to be a one and one when they get to it and Applause Georgia Tech in this game eight of eight from the line Miles Kelly you mentioned 88 on free throws this season lets see if they can get it to him 13 and gold last Terrys taking the ball out at least 85 percent and has to burn the final Josh pastner timeout with 28 seconds left its got to get the ball inbound in one of his better free throw shooters there wakes gonna foul immediately theyre playing the clock as much as theyre playing the score right now theres only one point one second difference before you started filing to get yourself in a bonus so Josh pastner talks things over up by one here in WinstonSalem and meanwhile for Wake Forest they got off to the hot start theres six and two in the ACC they left this game by 11 as well in the first half they dropped four straight in the ACC including three straight twopoint losses now backtoback wins including that Carolina win and you look at what their resume is Joe minardi again says outside looking in you do not want to quad 4 lost on the resume you dont you dont need a quad 4 loss if they were to get it it just puts more pressure on their coming she stayed on the road Applause theyve been here see the effort the insisted in the defensive end right now theyre playing for steals theyre going to go out the steel here again you know theyre going to foul once again it is Lance Terry the key it in hes a great freethrow shooter Miles Kelly is their best option on free throws thank you try to throw it along theyll have someone wide open there in the Sturdivant and he lost it cargos diving for it and he got a timeout wow Applause tough scramble physical play there a foul it didnt file right away Applause I think he threw it because he was going to travel he was off balance maybe thinking he got fouled but he was going to travel and he had to get rid of it Applause car get on the floor car comes up with it calls time out after you Wake Forest you got to score early you cant wait cant kill the clock to the last five seconds to go so lets see what coach Forbes and his group throw up here like I said theyve been in so many of these games they really have and its crazy to think of how many theyve played in over the course of the season and they already do have a couple of late winners at the horns this year against Utah Valley it was Tyree Appleby a gamewinning three at the buzzer in overtime to win that game and then Andrew Carn against App State in December he had a game winner that landed number one on sportscenters top 10 plays theyre down by one theyve got 23 seconds left theyre out of timeouts I expect something quick here to hear with bald and alphabes hand a play they dont need a three theyre only down one Im sure Georgia Tech has a plane in mind themselves I think Waco get right after it me time in case they dont score here in the hands of Tyree Appleby the senior star Applebys off the glass and end with 118 remaining tie Appleby puts wake in front Applause just gets the angle Scoops it up spins it up just enough to get it in push the deak up peeks up one now theyre gonna probably add a few seconds or two back on the game Music Applause and how about Tyree Appleby you said your stars you have to gotta be stars at this point in the game and he steps up in the big moment he stepped up and made baskets late for the Deeks but thats what you respect for a guy were talking about Player of the Year caliber gets here plays off two feet doesnt panic gets the angle its a heck of a shot maybe 126 or so might throw uh a second like you said back on the clock you see the 14 points for Ty Appleby 11 of them have come in the second half and he has put Wake Forest up by one and a gotta have a game here at home yeah its a must win game for the Geeks One Stop away for moving on and good thing about this review it gives Pastor enough time to draw up something here and this is where the Deeks got to get a stop you got to sit down you got to guard you hadnt done a great job tonight if keeping the basketball out of the paint Applause question is who has put into the Smith Smith played well hes got 13 points here and hes his ability to penetrate and get in the paint Lance Terrys done a really good job so this theres plenty of options here for Georgia Tech remember they just won on the buzzer beater on Wednesday on the plants against Notre Dame 13 seconds left its Davon Smith with ahead of Team attacking Smith gets it to go no timeout from Georgia Tech and did Josh passner try to call one without one no no no no hey look at the clock looking at the clock all right they will go look at the clock after Davon Smith streaks home through the contact and finish Music its difficult when you try to put the ball in the fish make the officials blow the whistle didnt blow it let the players play is what you want to see Let The Players decide this game Music I mean how about Davon Smith this guy has been awesome over the last few weeks and Josh pastner singled him out after the win wins they over Notre Dame they got Georgia Tech off schneid and said that his positivity and his energy yes in the lead up and during that game has been a huge difference maker and hes done a little bit of everything for the jackets in this one because he doesnt care about if I start or anything he didnt start the game but he finished in this game hes taking his team home hes answered I would be here down the stretch and now and hes got to make a stop on the defensive end if they want to pull up a major upset here seven seconds left cam Hildreth will put it in for Wake towned by one apple b is going to want to get to that right hand here he is Appleby off the hesitation in the air rolls up but a foul calls with 23 left Applause still a lot to play for right now you still gotta see the situation yeah I think he got his hand low before he elevated the shoot foul there on watch four here watch Devon Franklin their hands low you missed it from the other angles shows you a little better and Tyree Appleby to the line 83 percent for the season two of two tonight and hes good on the first to tie the game Ashleys looking to sub its allow his team to set up their play Applause Music Tyree Appleby just set an ACC record Tuesday for made free throws he was clutch against Carolina for the lead Applause someone has to get up to guard the basketball you cant let them roll it up wakes got a match up here Debo Coleman will throw it in for Georgia Tech with 23 seconds remaining its enough were catching two dribbles baseball pass the length of the floor Franklin cant handle it and Wake Forest wins at home great comeback win by the Deeks the Eric and Clarity here Canada brought him home flush free throws to put him up one great effort by Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets they continue to play better Applause 7170 the final and Winston
