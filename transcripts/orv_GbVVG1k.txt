he is their leading assist guy by a wide margin in ACC play averaging almost six assists a game is the grad student mutts who plays in his 145th career game tonight against the Panthers Federico and basily get us started Lee Cassell Ramey Steins AJ Desai on the whistle and we go from Blacksburg and Nelly Cummings will set the table offensively for Jeff capels team that has won six straight and eight of their last nine and this is Federico Okies open in the mantoman and remember Pitt relies heavily on the threepoint shot you got to run them off the line Elliott against Collins Henson squared away on the screen now heres Burton at the top on Couture from 16 feet and the rebound for months Virginia Tech no change in the order Padula Couture Collins basilian mutz and here is basily missing with a three and Henson the rebound for Pitt and no change there for Jeff Capel Elliott Cummings Burton Henson and Federico and there is Greg Elliott to push hit in front Wes Elliott attempts more than threefourths of his shot from Beyond The Arc but if youre going to run him off the line hes certainly capable of getting inside the defense Elliott averaging 11 a game here is mutts and a dunk thats how youre the fifth best field goal shooter in the ACC and thats thats going to be an interesting matchup Munson Henson Cummings on Padula all the way to the rim Dan to put Pitt back in front Cummins is only six feet tall West but he is very quick and he is strong in that time Padula didnt have any help and cummings got him right underneath the basket the silly has been red hot as of late and a bump on Elliott itll be the first on Pitt and Jeff Capel III 70 wins at Pitt 123 this is the best ACC record that Pittsburgh has had in their membership in the ACC they have won six Road games in the ACC and looking for a seventh here this afternoon against the Hokies Wes they got off to a little bit of a slow start but they have really come on Couture second best threepoint shooter in the ACC and thats what Elliott was trying to prevent the first time and maybe because he picked up that foul hes a little more conservative the second time early lead for the home team Henson driving much to the basket all the way to the Baseline got trapped here as Elliott was six to shoot another twopointer cleanly through for Detroits Greg Elliott and raymie Steins is calling one of the uh students out from underneath the basket to swab the deck around the foul line and Mike young a native of Radford in his fourth year here hes got 368 career wins five NCAA trips with Wofford or forward with Wofford five in the last 10 years as a head coach for Mike Young just a terrific terrific basketball coach 65 heres Collins trying to weave off the basily screen Baseline blocked by Henson and scooped out of there by Cummings both of these teams play really good mantoman defense Federico at one no theyre not going to count it theyre going to wave off the basket by Federico itll be a Baseline inbounds after Couture commits the foul while Couture ran into him while he was catching the ball in Federico at the presence of mine to throw it up to the basket hes just a little late catch and shoot three Henson long rebound for Couture three minutes gone in Blacksburg Vasily traveled with it trying to beat Federico and each team West neither one of thems a racehorse kind of basketball team but they would really like to get the ball up the court to beat the other guys down and get easy opportunities miss basili going just a little too quickly early sub for Jeff Capel Nike sabandis coming the ball game to replace Nellie Cummings or break your pardon Greg Elliott is Cummings handles the offense for Pitt Cummings a spot up on basily is good boy Nelly Cummings a couple of field goals early for the pit calls Wes he showed us he can get to the basket but maybe the best part of his game is that pullup Jumper in the midrange Panthers by three and Lee Cassell with a whistle well now the hook the Panthers have a couple of fouls West and both of them are have been committed against Couture obviously the defense is really concerned about cutting off his threepoint shot damn we talk about the three levels of this game its the perimeter its the midrange and its the rim and specifically for both teams theyve got focal points at each level and priorities at both ends of the floor heres basily and he will go Baseline in the offensive foul called on Grant basili by AJ Desai his first second on Virginia Tech now basilia is 69 235 and Nelly Cummins just goes and stands there and basily out Lynn Kidd Checks In and there is Kid the Junior from Gainesville Florida averaging just under six points and four rebounds in ACC play and a very different kind of player than bacillin and theres Padula off the ball against Cummings committing his first third foul against Virginia Tech West both of these teams can be very physical and if youre going to be physical out on the perimeter then the officials are going to find you and call it here is Burton now for some Bandy against MJ Collins step to the left jump shot bounds away and Virginia Tech has it as weve played four minutes first half and a threepoint lead for the Panthers heres Padula spot up two and the rebound for Henson West neither one of these teams are great offensive rebounding teams really like to get the ball and push it if they could heres the Charlotte grad student jamarius Burton taking mutts on the drive and He will draw the foul first on mutts four on Virginia Tech veteran play by Paradise Panthers the lead early in Blacksburg shipstation saves us so much time it makes Music Burger a couple weeks ago that the hoagie bird pecked you on the head in front of the student section so theres your head being pecked on in the student section again oh by the way there are a lot of people that want to take that home and youd be surprised of the list jamarius Burton first of two is good third best free throw shooter in the ACC Pittsburgh is number two in conference play behind Clemson West the Panthers are number one in terms of threepoint baskets made but so far theyve only attempted one and Burton buys one of two fourpoint lead for Pitt IES have gone two and a half without a point kid on the floor with mutts remember bazilly got the foul here is Justin mutts gets it to kid explosive is Lynn Kidd now mutza three front rim Miss Cummings turns and tries to put Pitt in transition Federico Vallejo he really runs and he catches the ball much better now than he did at the start of the season Panthers have to be aware of him of his presence in transition yep sixpoint lead for pick Couture caught in a double team off the dribble heres Collins boy theyre doing everything they can to prevent him from getting a look from three backing out Padula now kid turns against Henson in traffic wrap around pass and mutts a tough shot Justin mutts his second field goal Wes that was some pass and mutz was directly under the basket I dont know how he could make that shot but he did bounce pass knocked away intended for Cummings the pit turnover to Padula all the way down the layup rolls in first points for Sean penula the Panthers have been pretty good so far on defense West when they have set the defense but you turn it over like that that gives the Hokies a chance to get out and go four in a row for Virginia Tech to cut it to a twopoint pit lead Panthers have hit five of their last seven Henson comes to a stop against mutts sabandi sizing up Collins crossover in traffic had it knocked away Federico controls with five and he will be ticketed for travel quick reminder to you this is game one of our doubleheader next well send you the Derby City theyre celebrating the 10year anniversary of the 2013 National Championship team tonight with Clemson visiting the Yum Center Joel Cadet Malcolm Huckabee are there for our coverage on acc Network and always available on the ESPN app Music and Clemsons postseason has essentially begun Dan well Clemson they got no room for error anymore Wes Poteet has come into ball game he wears 34 for Virginia Tech as does John Camden who handles the ball on the dribble against Elliott and then a block is called I think Greg Elliott trying to stay with Camden will pick up his second and this is a huge foul against the University of Pittsburgh Elliott is trying to stay with him trying to get in front never could if youre going to draw a charge you got to have both feet on the floor you got to be facing the dribbler in One Direction or another and he simply was not and all this discussion isnt going to help so Burton will come to the table Elliott has two fouls first free throw for Camden is good redshirt freshman from downington Pennsylvania who transferred from Memphis after appearing in just two minutes of the first game a season ago for Penny Hardaway Applause and it looks like AJ Desai and Lee Cassell have gone to the table here to confirm Elliott and if not Elliott then maybe Federico Dan well I thought I thought they made the call against Elliott and I thought Elliot was the guy who actually committed the foul West another look Elliot is guarding the ball and theres the contact thats what gets Camden off balance and so I think theyre going to confirm that contact is right there as Elliot steps in to the drive in Camden and knocks him off balance and you see then the second line was Federica but by the time Federico got there Camden was already fallen down Camden missed the second now Elliott is a very important Cog in this pit offense with his threepoint shooting ability and thats now Nike sabandi becomes very important yep Pitt does not have a three yet theyve only attempted one right Burton working on Couture quick spin move gets him to the basket and the missed shot is rebounded by Virginia Tech Couture is one of the better defenders in this conference yep whipped inside Poteet hell turn with a right hand and score milajo Poteet has pushed Virginia Tech in front well potique big and strong in there 265 pounds and used every ounce of it Cummings tried to fire pass in got deflected out of there scrambled and picked up Couture seven nothing run by the Hokies but silly back on the floor to spell and heres a three oh my God make it a 10nothing run now all keyed by the Virginia Tech defense West they forced some turnovers forced Pitt into some tough shots here is Burton back out front for Henson so Bandy wants some help heres Federico for the screen and he was moving offensive foul on Federico Wesson you create that with aggressiveness on defense and so another turnover by Pitt thatll be their fourth in the last three minutes Dan meanwhile Virginia Tech has been able to use the defensive end of the floor really to spark their offense I think West theyve been able to get down the court before Pitt can really get set on defense but silly Poteet Collins Couture and Padula boy basily has been red hot 20 plus in his last three and five of the last seven for Mike young heres Padula oh standing in the tee with Sean penula wow 50th three of the year for the sophomore from Edmond Oklahoma Wes I wasnt sure that one was ever coming down theyre lucky it didnt burn up on reentry heres Burton Pittsburgh in need of a basket goes to their leader rebound Diaz Graham underneath knocked out of bounds last Touch by the Panthers Applause well almost not Joe lunardi after the noon games and Dan you get a look at this Virginia three despite the close winning and snow today Miami beat Wake Forest NC State tomorrow and Jeff capels team and Duke are nine seeds and heres a look at the details for Pitt and I guess the thing to note today theyre 48 Virginia Tech is 66 so this makes this a quad one today for Pitt right right if Pitt can win this game thatll be their sixth quad one win of the Season which is a very impressive number now the Hokies West theyve made five of their last six shots and two of those shots have been threepoint baskets and Pitt has really been trying to force it on offense the Hokies doing a great job pushing them out of the lane 13nothing run by Virginia Tech and here is basily one dribble knocked away Burton and recovered on the turnover heres Cummings back for jamarius Burton hard dribbles against basily into traffic Burton trying to find a wall and Scoops it around and in oh what hard work for his first field goal and it stops the drought for Pittsburgh well she dont want to be working that hard every time Diaz Graham recovers Poteet had it knocked out of there by Cummings and Nelly Cummings is going to be called for the foul thatll be his first in the fifth on the Panthers and Mike Youngs team is out right now but heck they were out when they got to Brooklyn last year and found a way to make it as the champions of the ACC but you see the two and five mark in Quad one this is not a quad one for them it is for Pitt free throw Poteet rolls around and drops in Blossom thats because if youre at home quad one is only one through 30 in the net right if youre on the road its one through 75 so Virginia Tech is home Pitt is 48 this makes this a quad two game for Virginia Tech hell take out one of the two but Virginia Tech is 66 and so Pitt is on the road which makes this a quad one opportunity for Pitt but its an opportunity that theyve squandered so far simandi Cummings Pitt is without a three so far in the game Panthers came in when the defense has them pushed way out Burton will tee one up and it bounces out now he is not I mean he can make a three West but thats not the strongest part of his game and I think if youre Virginia Tech youre satisfied if your Defense Forces a contested three by Burton mutts on the lob Poteet the catch taken away by Burton tremendous play by the pit leader hell go all the way to the rim scoop it up and it rolled off the backside where the Hokies Turn and Burn medulla back for Poteet on the scoop and a foul will be on Henson itll be his first it is six on Pitt quick reminder to you a doubleheader womens basketball on Thursday night Miami and Louisville at six oclock from uh the KFC Yum Center and then Carol Lawson and Duke most Diamond Johnson in NC State and Cameron Indoor Stadium at eight oclock Thursday night all presented by Ally on acc Network and streaming live on the ESPN app Poteet now it averaged seven and a half minutes in his last two games and he is now six of his last nine at the freethrow line thats where all of his points have come from well West hes part of a big lineup in the game and hes going to leave now but its a big lineup in the game with kid now instead of potique basily and mutts really creating some mismatch difficulties for the Panthers 162 run by Virginia Tech has got him with a eightpoint advantage pull up by Cummings and a rebound for kid and one of the interesting defensive matchups we see out there Wes is pacilli when hes on defenses matched up against Burton yeah we pondered all sorts of alignments today we did not come with that one they rolled the deck Diaz Graham ends up locked up with Justin mutts and possession will stay with Virginia Tech as Federico Federico checks back in to replace Guillermo Diaz Graham for Pitt and here is Padula coming back in for Lynn Kidd and Mike Youngs lineup yeah so that that big lineup was just to get Padula breather in fact I dont think Padula was done with his breather yet he was still drinking water over there and I got him up off the bench sent him in he had finished his water while hes walking to the scorers table here is Burton guarding mutts now backing down mutts the reverse and scores pretty played by Justin mutts hes got a half dozen now hes got a size Advantage West and hes such a great passer you hesitate to double team him its got to figure out a way to get inside this Virginia Tech defense the lead is 10 Burton sabandi off the screen and cummings had it deflected itll stay with Pitt but seven to shoot for the Panthers what Virginia Techs doing a great job handling the screens that pitted setting and theyre putting such pressure on the ball handler that he cant see Federico whos open for a moment inside quick inbounds for Burton five to shoot back into the corner Cummings a three bounds away much its got the rebound for the Hokies West they make more than nine threes a game that havent made one yet yep and theyve really been on a tear lately Collins wrap around for kid right back for MJ Collins who squares Cummings trying to find an alley was alone down in the corner but I dont think they saw him Burton a step back got it jamarius Burton with five well she may not be able to shoot the three as well as some of his teammates but boy if he gets inside the arc off that dribble hes pretty tough but silly wrapped up had had the ball stripped out of there by Federico and now heres Burton once again working against a bigger hokey oh no hes not going to do that and Henson Henson Travels With It Pitt turns it over Virginia Tech has hit six in the last seven they lead by eight as throughout the arena and Pitt is seven of 17 Dan but just three of their last 11 meanwhile the Hokies have hit six of seven and theyre shooting 61 and a half percent Couture on the Drive Burton tried to rake it out of there mutz has got it back out for penula oh a little crossover and the layup rolled off trailing is Henson in a deep three Blake Henson on the board thats his first basket West that was almost as deep as the one I thought he was going to take before he got called for the travel Bonner Yi of little faith on Blake Hensons range fivepoint game despite the Panthers struggles here Dan this is a great mismatch inside mutts working on Cummings out of a double team basily alone and thats why you cant double team him West you know thats really a tough thing for Pitt to handle you got to get out and defend Couture so they get to switch and then must had to mismatch inside and you double team to help Cummins and immediately he passes for an easy basket Grand basilis got five in the ball game on his second field goal tend to shoot for Cummings and Pitt trailing Again by seven La Federico the catch straight up and lays it in thats a nice job by Federico to get behind basily and then jump up and down so Cummings could see him six minutes to go first half heres mutts inside squeezing around and scoring Justin mutz nows got eight in his first half thats easy money for Mike Youngs team Dan well if mutts can get it that close to the basket West hes going to be hard to stop thats just great player movement and ball Movement by the Hokies yep Virginia Tech has executed their game plan nearly Flawless in this first half theres a drive Henson had it spin out Federico controls it and now hes got to find an open man and its Burton and Burton will be ticketed offensive foul first on Burton its the seventh on Pitt player controls so no free throws but Dan the sophomore from Finland Federico Federico is pitting in my opinion to be the most improved player in season in the ACC while West you can see his numbers over the last 16 games wasnt double in the first 10 games he has really improved and that has helped the Panthers basilia trigger on another one Virginia Tech has hit four threes two of them belong to the right State transfer basily lead back to 10 and Federico sets down the dunk well that Federico has been able to get loose the entire game and thats really the first time weve seen a lack of ball pressure handling that screen Collins back door basily the layup 10 for basily eight for mutts 18 of the Hokies 32 between the two Biggins way way too easy Wes just one layup after the other for the Hokies yep heres Cummings bounce pass Federico the layup and a foul well what a pass by Cummings and the foul will be on Couture Wes this is a pass that Cummings doesnt even try to make to Federico earlier in the season but Federico just streaks to the basket Couture you know he just was in the wrong place at the wrong time and he wouldnt try to make that pass to Federico earlier in the year because Federico would have had a hard time catching the ball six points for the young man born in Egypt raised in Finland hes got seven now Danny at 107 rebounds three blocks for his first double figure game in conference play the other night against Boston College and heres the other stat we showed you the points and rebounds He has blocked three or more shots in 12 games this year seven of them in ACC play hes an alldefensive guy too Wes he really helps it back into that pit defense now he covers up a lot of mistakes and the Panthers have made some in this first half a lot of easy baskets for Virginia Tech Poteet back on the floor with Couture mutts Collins heres Hunter Couture Miss badly on a three Cummings and the Panthers try and attack theres a lob Federico was pushed in foul thats on Poteet I believe Elijah Poteet is first that is six on Virginia Tech Wesson and Federico Federico has suddenly become the focal point of the Panthers offense well as we were visiting with Mike young today and he was talking about pressuring the perimeter right yes you said that may give Federico more of an alley to contribute its taken a while but seemingly Pitt is trying to get there here in the final 407 of the half well Jeff cape on his staff making some adjustments seeing whats available and that demonstrates a lot of confidence in Federico that theyre trying to put the ball in his hands no shots for Federico Baseline inbounds for Cummings double team on the perimeter Elliott back on the floor he plays with two heres Burton trying to square up on mutts drives him into Lane and scores he can make tough shots Wes seven for Burton Pokey lead is a half dozen and Diaz Graham got tied up in the post and commits the foul thatll bring us to a timeout in Blacksburg Virginia Tech by six side and Justin mutz has been a dominant Factor on the interior for the Hokies slipping loose a couple of times and is able to score close to the basket and the Hokies you built the sixpoint lead here in part because theyve been able to convert Pitt turnovers too the Panthers have turned it over six times and that has resulted in 12 Virginia Tech points the Hokies hold a 124 advantage and points off turnovers so I mean not really much of a secret theyve made a couple of Threes theyve forced some turnovers and their defense has been really good Couture at the line first of the one and one hits the rim Hunters been fighting it a little bit seven of his last 20 coming in here today 719 from behind the threepoint line averaging just nine points he has three in this opening half Elliott on the drive playing with the two fouls missed it Federico had a shot at it last Touch by Collins it will stay with the Panthers and even when Pitt gets close to the basket West the Virginia Tech defense is contesting those are tough shots and once again its Federico being really active on the inside that helps the Panthers keep that ball Cummings on the inbounds heres Burton a little pull up on the Baseline thats his game nine for jamarius Burton Panthers to within four with about three to go Kelsey Riggs Joel Berry Jordan cornette take care of you at halftime Camden Cut Loose a three and potique goes High to get the rebound and the foul will be on Henson his second thats the ninth of the Panthers dont forget womens lacrosse coming up next Friday from here in Blacksburg Jenny Levy has number one North Carolina visiting Southwest Virginia seven oclock start right here on acc Network and streaming live on the ESPN app Poteet is three of four at the line today has five points in this first half and the first one rolls in unless we talked about mutts and mutzs activity on the inside but Poteet has been very active in there as well big contributions Elijah started his college career at Rice year ago 14 minutes a game eight points four rebounds from Reidsville North Carolina and the second one rolls in seven for Poteet pretty good half for the big fella absolutely lead is six again Cummings off the Henson screen over the top of Poteet and it pounces for Padula on the rebound good positioning by Poteet West to just get a hand up heres Padula all the way to the basket back for Poteet in the dunk nine for Poteet Applause Elliott tries to answer cannot Padula again and bumped and fouled by Cummings second on Nelly Cummings its the 10th now on Pitt and miligel Poteet has tied his season high for a third time in this first half with nine points Wesson and he just followed the ball down the lane and everybody went after Padula and nobody stepped in to pick him up fourth best freethrow shooter in the ACC is Edmond Oklahoma Sean Padula the first one is good got a nice note Dan today from Andy dimetro does Georgia Tech he of course seen Virginia Tech earlier this week he said Sean Padula is a sophomore is averaging 155 a game the last Oklahoma guard to average 155 was Mark Price so sophomore guards from Oklahoma theyre the two best there you go dont forget Steve Hale he was from Jinx who played at North Carolina in the late 80s right yeah but he didnt averaged 15 points as a sophomore that is true Nellie Cummings a spot up too hes got six The Hokey lead is eight inside of two minutes to go first half at the castle in Blacksburg foreign reminder to fans to download the ACC threepoint challenge app presented by

their Affiliated ACC teams final ranking a day Warner on the app is my man Bonner youve been tackling that since day one huh I gotta get my grandson to play it hes pretty good thats it Carson takes over good point 141 to go first half Hokies used a big run to create this margin and its eight right now for Mike Youngs team heres basily teeing up a deep one miss badly and the long rebound Collins right back at him now for Camden 15 to shoot that ball ever hit the rim on the first sure it did Dan I you know they made that shot clock maybe shouldnt have reset heres a corner three Collins and the rebounds some Andy and no worse for The Works doesnt make any difference doesnt matter now right it may have hit the it may have hit the rim here is sabandi and a foul on Camden theres Nike sebandi draws the first on the Freshman seventh on Virginia Tech now with 103 to play so one and one for the Indianapolis senior from Crispus Attucks High School who transferred from Miami of Ohio and the Panthers are at that best were at their best West when sabandi is scoring Off the Bench and he hasnt scored so far today nope had not only had six the other night against Boston College and missed the front end of the one and one my goodness boy that ball spun up there oddly didnt it West yep Hokies can take a double figure advantage to the locker room possibly Padula oh Diaz Graham fell down and then he picked basily what a recover by uh Jorge Diaz Graham after the crowd dude and odd heres some Bandy trying to find momentum couldnt with a triple Padula to the races thats a good job by Pitt to get back thats almost like a turnover when you miss a threepoint shot that way and two and a half second differential shot clock to game clock as we wind down this first half and Mike Youngs going to use his 30 here and we will step aside eightpoint lead for the Hokies final stretches of half one you attack an eightpoint lead in the ball here as we wind down this first half Hokies come in they won for their last seven upset the other night Atlanta Dan to Georgia Tech about 113 at home four home wins in the ACC heres Mike Youngs Club what did Jeff Capel tell us this morning that he was afraid theyd be playing against a desperate team yeah weve not only seen a desperate team but an efficient one for sure have heres penula five to shoot kick out basily 13 in the first half for Grant basili and thatll take us to the locker room what a half for the Hokies huh well its as well as theyve played in a wild west theyre making shots theyre playing really well on the defensive end the point lead as we go to our subway game refresh an 182 run in the first half and the Hokies have not looked back meanwhile Jeff capels team who came in here averaging 126 threes in their last three half but one in the first half well and the amazing thing about that West they only have six attempts you talk about running somebody off the threepoint line well thats what Virginia Tech has done Federico inside the offensive rebound and the foul I believe is Grant basili and it is itll be his second its number one to start the half on Virginia Tech now Wes Henson took that shot and it was a three so they didnt run him off the threepoint line but they ran him so far back behind the threepoint line that was a long shot yep he was standing where Padula hit from in the first half and Raymond Steins a little game management here off the inbounds Cummings for Burton hell drive it foul line on basili might have got a piece of that Wes its been a tough half for Hunter Couture as well offensively for Virginia Tech yeah but hes been really good defensively hes made Burton work very hard for everything Burton has got here is Couture came into the contest 15 points away from becoming the 50th player in hokey history to score a thousand heres mutts that got deflected basily collects three to shoot reversed and fouled and it is on Cummings so the grad transfer from Colgate and Midland PA Nellie Cummings draws his third and thatll put grant facility to the line the facilities got himself a mismatch on the inside and Cummins doing everything he can to fight him but I mean theres just nothing a six foot guy can do against pacilli but that third foul that is a big foul because Nelly Cummings is a key to a lot of what Pitt does his ability to get the ball into the lane is a big factor in the pit offense Brazilian gets one of two shes got 14 hes got 11 straight double figure games told you in the first half hed been on a tear 20 or more and three straight and five of the last seven including a 33point game against Boston College Elliott heres Henson the lead a dozen for the home team and the Panthers standing around a little bit West and thats what good defense does to a team that emphasizes ball movement and Player move Federico and one Applause 10 now two straight double figure games for Federico Federico his fifth double figure game of the year and he just runs through the basket basilia very poor job blocking out but Federico West he looks really skinny but he is stronger than you think that was a power move right there young man from finlands got three years left in the program in Pittsburgh and he missed the free throw but Burton got the rebound how many more can the Panthers add on here at this end of the floor well they need to start adding West because Virginia Tech is in total control of this game Cummings all the way to the basket and hes going to draw the foul ended up in the photographers laps along the Baseline who has not he drew a foul right there but thats a a perfect indication of the problem that Pitt has faced he drives the lane hes got three guys after him but they call that follow Sean Padula okay which is his second and the third on Virginia Tech well potique came into your picture there very quickly to close it down two shots for Nellie Cummings hes got seven in the ball game and hes only missed two free throws in conference play with three because he missed one in the first half and that spins out thats on you by the way no its not a minute and a half gone half two nine point lead for Virginia Tech trying to pick up their 16th win it would be their sixth in conference play Federicos now trying to guard much thats to keep Federico closer to the basket Collins heres mutts and federuco Federico moves his feet but draws the foul itll be his second second on Pitt but youre reluctant to leave the threepoint Shooters to help out with mutts but mutz is quick enough with the basketball that a guy the size of Federico is going to have a hard time moving his feet and staying in front now they switch and hinsons matched up against mutts Padula now heres mutts quick bounce pass inside Federico is going to get called again and thats his third two in a row and the third on pit already in the half both schools have three and we havent played two minutes six fouls in the first two minutes of the half another look now just great positioning by Poteet on the inside and Federico comes over the back and not only just come over the back but he comes over the back right in front of the official wow Elliott took a screen from Poteet and an offensive foul call igel Poteet second Boutique is the big guy and Elliott is not you know that I think thats a pretty tough call against Poteet he just was a big person pit gets the ball and theres an offensive foul and thats four thats three and a half on Federico Federico and with 1745 to go four fouls on Federico and Guillermo Diaz Graham from the Canary Islands will have to replace the sophomore from Finland Poteet against Diaz Graham now Couture firing away and hitting six for Couture Wes I dont care whether hes been struggling or not he can get rolling sure can the case Award winner last year at Barclay Center in Brooklyn and cummings is fouled by Poteet third on Poteet and the fifth on Virginia Tech and look at the threepoint field goal made leaders AD Visio 260s theres some pretty good names on that list by the way Wally World Lancaster OH the bimbo and Wally Show in the late 80s in the castle here is Henson sneaking through lob Diaz Graham mistimed it well I think Henson missed through it Wes you dont throw a lob like that Im not sure that was a Lobby he may have been shooting that ball yeah it might have been nonetheless its still a 12 point lead for Virginia Tech and the and the Panthers looked discombobulated again on offense sure do moti turns it over stripped out of there heres Cummings Elliott now trying to drive through against Collins and Raymond Steins will call MJ Collins for the foul itll be his first its the sixth on Virginia Tech well they did not rule this a shooting foul Wes and again you see them running off the threepoint line that is a great job by Collins to force Elliott who wants to shoot the three to put the ball on the deck Henson had the three spin out Diaz Graham the rebound Elliott tries to answer and does wow so whats happening is the Panthers to make a three they got to keep backing up they gotta miss the shot too yeah that was an offensive rebound Second Chance triple from Greg Elliott Padula wants to answer and launches Pittsburgh trailing 11 or nine rather heres Diaz Graham the catch and score but Guillermos first bucket he got lucky there West he turned and he put the but brought the ball down and Padula almost had it but thats a big basket for the Panthers they got to do something to change the tempo of this game seven point lead for the Hokies much inside offensive foul Justin mutz thatll get us to a timeout second on months that is seven on Virginia Tech and we get a timeout for racial and social justice in conjunction with its member institutions have identified February 18th through the 26th as ACC Unity week and were happy to be a part of it as well as we rejoin you from Castle Coliseum and even with a seven point lead Dan foul trouble looming for Mike Youngs Club here West foul trouble is a big factor in the game weve already had 11 fouls called in the half and you know we havent played five minutes yet and Jeff capels got some too fabrico with four Latin Cummins with three Applause and now Bert Cummings Henson Diaz Graham and Elliott return for Pitt medulla Couture mutts Malaysia Poteet and MJ Collins are out there for Mike Youngs club and the Hokey head coach was fired up going to the timeout a moment ago heres Elliot against Collins nice pass Diaz Graham catching layoff second bucket for Guillermo the older of the twins by a couple minutes well Wesson I think that the Panthers really have to attack because theyre already in the bonus Collins heres Couture for three unless thats two in a row for him yep nine for Couture all three of his field goals from behind the bonus line and Henson Couture is going to get called for the foul sure is third on Hunter Couture is the eighth on Virginia Tech now dont forget following our coverage here for Blacksburg off to Louisville youll go Tigers and cards for a second time this year at seven oclock Eastern Joel Cadet Malcolm Huckabee standing by the Yum Center on acc Network and always available on the ESPN app first of the one and ones for Blake Henson is good Weston this again this could be a key factor for the Pitt Panthers because theyre every time they get fouled theyre going to shoot for the remainder of this game and theres a lot of time left missed the second one so its a seven point game heres mutts out front now Padula with Burton defending poteets had a terrific game for the Hokies equal to season high in the first frame with nine eight to shoot mutts oh what a pass and a foul will be called Lee Cassell and it is on Blake Henson its his third its the fifth on Pittsburgh Wes this is just some pass he drives into the lane theres hardly any room there at all hes double teamed and then Cummins is standing in the background ready to pick it off I dont think Cummins ever anticipated that that pass could be made two shots for Poteet and the first one gives him a season High 10 points first double figure game in a Virginia Tech jersey for the rice transfer milajo Poteet mutts is out and basily has come back for the Hokies Wes poteets performance has really been significant Its a Great Lift Off the Bench for Virginia Tech and Pitt that relies on guys coming off the bench most notably sabandi they still dont have anything from the bench Applause why take that back Diaz Graham just scored a couple 12 bench points for Virginia Tech today coming step back 30 Padula is strong Diaz Graham touched it last and Randy Steins originally awarded it to Virginia Tech AJ Desai wants to help him out and now theyll change it you can look at home a battling on the inside and clearly basily was the last guy to touch that ball good piece of teamwork by the officiating crew and boy Couture and Burton are really going at it right and Raymond Steins rather than be very demonstrative just walks up there with his arms folded to say hey guys turn the volume down a little bit here Applause Cummings hard drive to the basket oh skip for an open Henson couldnt knock it down Burton recovers and scores 11 for jamarius Burton Wes that was a great job by Cummins to set up that threepoint basket but Im telling you if the Panthers cannot make threes theyre going to really have a problem coming back in this game seven point lead for Pitt remember Henson has three personal fouls basilia three slapped out Poteet hes just made one good play after another sure has brazily spinning oh what a tough shot 15 now for Grandpa silly or 17 Im sorry 16 for basily his first field goal the second half to go with a free throw heres Elliott on the drive and an offensive foul thatll be his third sixth second half fouls on Pitt this is a really good move by basilis guarded by Henson whos in foul trouble and has to be careful and weve seen basily make the three thats just a really nice move on the inside but again hes taken advantage of a guy whos in foul trouble Elliott comes out of the game and you can see nothing new for basily hes been fabulous for Virginia Tech Dan you talk about having a Strong finish to the regular season Grand basilis putting one on here now in the Virginia Tech defense continues to do a great job running the Panthers off the threepoint line Ellie had picked up that foul because they drove him off the line and forced him to drive and thats four fouls on Henson so Blake Henson walks away on the 17 foul against Pitt and four on Henson with 12 53 to go west and thats just a bad play on Hensons part hes got three personal fouls you dont want to pick up your fourth on a play like that thats almost a giveaway four for Henson four for Federico three for Elliott three for Cummings and the free throw Couture is good Western what an important spot for the Diaz Graham Brothers to be in the game yep 25 is Guillermo 31 is Jorge and both are on the floor at the same time Couture missed the back end hes one of three at the line and Wes I think what youre going to see the Virginia Tech defense do is push out even further on the threepoint shooters out front Diaz Graham thats Guillermo missing a three Jorge battling inside lost the rebound to basili 10 point lead for the Hokies Padula all the way for the scoop well she get unfamiliar lineups in the game playing together its not only hard to play offense but its hard to play defense and the Panthers are in trouble Wes yep down 12 with 12 to go Pitt needs a takeover goddamn Burton Diaz Graham a three and the rebound for Guillermo off the Jorge Miss heres Cummings skips to Jorge for three good the eighth three of the year is the first points of the day for Jorge Diaz Graham boy Ill tell you what the legendary voice of the Panthers Bill Hillgrove hes had a fight on his hands with these two this year back after this running a food pantry

the clothes you enjoy the great fit Stitch fix well its a nine point lead for Virginia Tech 5546 and our big bow moment is brought to you by Bojangles and this is sevenyearold Shea Chase OBrien from Roanoke he designed Mike Youngs shoes for the shoes for Hope initiative last month so Chase is an honorary starter today for Virginia Tech theres the work he did on the shoes and heres when hes announced to the crowd and good for you chase he is a patient at carillion Childrens which is a in a great partnership here with Virginia Tech athletically a delightful young guy you see he had a press conference he was asked more questions than Bonner was in his last press conference well if he had a press conference hes had one more than I at least one yep but what a what a great treat for that young man and our best to Chase and his folks who also got pretty good seats out of the whole deal I might add heres Padula now Couture with sabandi 10 to shoot for Virginia Tech and Padula all the way through sneaks a pass inside Collins had it blocked and that was Guillermo who knocked it away from MJ Collins and we will step aside as they tend to MJ Collins back after this its bow tie the good news is MJ Collins seems to be okay although Dan Bonner told him before the game be careful now with the mass because when you got that mask on it doesnt mean that youre absolving of another hit right well he got smacked right in that mask by Diaz Graham on the block shot at him he got a tooth knocked out against Miami and then the next game against Virginia he broke his nose and mutts inside and a reach from Cummings and he now becomes the third Panther with four Wes thats just really good Movement by mutts yep sure is and thats a couple of times now hes gotten loose in there on that same type of play first trip to the line for Justin butts 61 percent on the year dont forget Thursday night is ladies night on acc Network double header of womens basketball for you Miami and Louisville at the Yum Center get it started at six and then at eight oclock number nine Duke hosts NC State all available presented by Ally on acc Network and streaming live on the ESPN app 10 for mutts seven straight double figures 21st double figure game of the year for the uh grad student from Millville New Jersey but West there is still plenty of time left in this game but the Panthers have to get something started I think the next three or four minutes are going to be critical for Pitt heres Burton trying to take Collins inside strong move and a hoop jamarius Burtons got 13 on his sixth field goal well if youre Jeff Capel you gotta hope to find the Takeover guy right well absolutely and Burton is normally their takeover guy West but hes been under such heavy defensive pressure all day he needs some help Collins Poteet whos had a terrific afternoon for Virginia Tech and before that Collision yeah somebody grabbed onto it AJ Desai Mikey Savannah this is what the official sees right there Wes and Nike zamandi had his arm wrapped around him sabandi got screened and hes trying to get around in front of Poteet so Poteet cant roll to the basket but potiche is too big and strong and sabandi gets called for the foul motene is seven of eight at the freethrow line tonight Wes remember we talked about the fact that the Panthers had a big Advantage because they got to those seven to get to the one and one early but no Advantage now missed the front end of the one and one nine point game Burton against Padula all the way in couldnt buy the basket but again a very tough shot Padula with good defensive pressure stepped out of the way at the last minute so he didnt get the foul John Camden in the ball game the redshirt freshman and that got knocked away last touched by a pit although Diaz Graham was litigating I remember at one point West the fouls were seven to four Virginia Tech on seven for Virginia Tech only four for Pitt and now its pit nine in Virginia Tech eight 34 fouls have been called in the ball game Dan and 17 in each half and some key guys are on the bench heres Boutique 13 from Elijah they list Diaz Graham at 205 pounds so I think thats optimistic there goes uh Jorge rather and a pass to brother Guillermo for the basket six for Guillermo the Panthers are hanging around Wes Elli has been also very good today for the Hokies Cross Court now back to Poteet right up on Diaz Graham and Jorge the rebound Elliott Ts up a three nope and its a wedgie and were going to get a foul on Camden and John Camden will be called for his second nine on Virginia Tech now that was a foul West he was battling inside for rebounding position so itll be a one and one Camden is number 11 hes at the free throw line as the shot goes up he turns around and he just pushes Graham yeah thats a foul Guillermo Diaz Graham from Tenerife and the Canary Islands as a one and one he is a 62 free throw shooter Applause first one in seven all here in the second half for Guillermo Wesson thats nine fouls now on each team so for the rest of the game well be shooting two and of course everybody was excited because he misses two in the second half and they get bacon yeah you know they give away potato chips at North Carolina and they give away uh fast food chicken at North Carolina State and I admit those are two of the higher food groups but bacon I think is the better heres layup by Collins no good and a whistle on the miss and it is on Guillermo Diaz Graham itll be his first 10 as Dan told you a moment ago now on pit well the reason the foul is called here hes up in the air and he gets fouled after he releases the ball but before he comes back down West and you have to give a guy a chance to come down thats the Airborne shooter rule Collins will shoot a pair hes 77 percent at the line this year and the first point of the day for the Freshman MJ Collins Michael Anthony Jerome Collins Jr heres MJ thats very impressive that he can be back at the line that he can see straight after getting hit on that mask and both free throws good too lead is nine with nine to go the Panthers really havent been able to chip much further away than nine nope heres Elliott working on Camden all the way to the basket and the lefthand layup for Greg Elliott and thats a nice play by Elliot but again Wes they didnt let him attempt the threepoint shot they get out there and forced him off the line they have in the ball game today pit has but three threes total one in the first half two in the second half five as their season low hanging two by Collins rolls in well done four in a row for MJ Collins at Virginia Techs into the floor remember now they got two guys sitting over there with four fouls and thats Jorge Diaz Graham for three Burton had a shot at it and lost it tried to get it back they rolled to the deck and last Touch by Pitt sabandi I think made of graced it and under eight to go a nine point lead for Virginia Tech Music interesting peace let me bring well three weeks from tonight in Greensboro we will Crown the champion of the New York Life ACC tournament at the Greensboro Coliseum and if the season ended right now right now because I say that if Pitt loses today that quarter final order changes a little bit Dan well in the Virginia Tech wins today the first round changes a little bit due because Virginia Tech and Florida State will swap places so thats a quick check of where we would be in less than three weeks meanwhile Jeff Capel who is the clubhouse leader if you will at 123 has to win because Virginia withstood a Dane Goodwin open three at the horn today in Charlottesville boy they died 5755 they dodged one today by the way congrats to Kihei Clark became the Cavaliers alltime leader in assist and ironically broke John crottys record with old 22 in the building Brazilia three boy that is a big basket just when pit thinks like maybe theyre crawling back into it Vasily knocks down the three announced a double figure lead again hes within a point of his fourth straight game of 20 or more and six of his last eight Burton soft Fall Away rattled around and its recovered Jorge threw it up there he couldnt score it and Couture with it in the corner and they play on neither coach particularly a neighbor with the whistles well winner coaches ever enamored with the whistles West under seven we go 12 point lead for Virginia Tech trying to weave through Diaz Graham A leaner rolls off on Sean got it back and a hell ball will give it to Virginia Tech now Padula was coming out of there with with that ball anyway but Padula does a great job just taking it away from Diaz Graham and Wes to be honest with you look at the way those two guys are built Padula has a few more muscles than Diaz Graham he just took it right away from him Couture on a spot throw in and Jeff Capel cant wait anymore hes got Federico Federico and Hinson back in the game yeah both played with four with under seven to go and heres basili dumps it inside and another Hill ball this one will go to Pitt Justin much is on the floor hes returned to the lineup with Collins Padula Couture its the original starters in essence for both schools now for each school and I tell you what if the Panthers are going to come back West they got to start making some threes and the Hokies have really limited their threepoint opportunities terrific defensive Effort Virginia Tech heres Cummings bounce pass Federico through traffic nice little move there with the left hand a dozen for Federico well okay you scored if youre the Panthers now you need stops thank you Padula tried to dump it inside deflected away heres Burton the turnover skip it for Henson all the way in he just fouled out sure did well you could see that coming from half court West Blake Henson who came into this game on a tear is going to foul out with four points and basily was just standing there waiting for him if youre Hinson you have to recognize Wes and get stopped and Henson fouls out for the fourth time and the third time in ACC play Wesson he only made one field goal today you can see on average in almost 16 he had four tonight yep hes only got four so band he hasnt scored most really tough for the Panthers to win that way heres Padula mutts now Collins trying to get it to Brazilian wont forget now Federicos playing with four and bazilly lost it got it back threw it up and lets see this might be the second on Burton or is it the fifth on Federico its the second on jamarius Burton Dan heres the other part too Virginia Tech noted for lots of Threes very perimeter base bombs away type scoring theyve done this today getting dirty on defense well theyve done it with a great defensive effort they and you talk about shooting threes well yeah theyve made a couple but Poteet Has Come Off the Bench and played extremely well on the inside mutz has done some damage on the inside theyve been able to drive the ball to the basket but youre right Wesley was all keyed with their defensive effort Vasily hit one of the two and itll belong to Pittsburgh dont forget following coverage tonight from Louisville of the Tigers and cards Kelsey Riggs has got Joel bearing Jordan Cornett in studio to join her boozers at the AllStar Game and Luke Hancocks at the 10year reunion of the 2013 National Championship team tonight Louisville so full coverage of the day in ACC basketball with nothing but net follows the Tigers and cards and a foul on the Nelly Cummings Drive will be against basily itll be his fourth and 10 now on the Hokies with 5 20 to go west that 5 20 to go is a key because Nelly Cummins driving the ball to the basket and getting fouled taking a really tough shot if youre Mike young you dont mind that youd rather not have the foul but if theyre not shooting threes I dont know that they have enough time to come back in the game first one in and out here we go west this is the bacon shot and were talking about a 92 percent freethrow shooter well thats some pressure Wes when bacon is on the line the dejection in the building always fascinates me I mean the coupon for the bacon goes by the boards and the place is just crushed well who would want a coupon for Smithfield bait I mean we said thats thats a wonderful giveaway heres Boutique Padula a little floater too strong and sabandi the rebound 10point lead Nike around Couture in the layup good first field goal though as Dan alluded to its been a very quiet day for the Panthers star sixth man thats a nice job by Pitt to push the ball up the court eightpoint game much calling for it against Burton Burton is a strong guy but I think mutts has the advantage here Padula a three Applause and that was under pressure a dozen for penula Virginia Techs Got Five Guys in double figures now the lead is 11 Burton against mutts all the way through and scores 15 for jamarius Burton well they just traded two for three West though thats not a formula for a comeback yep inside four to go on the drive Collins cannot get through against Cummings tend to shoot for Couture challenges Burton and thatll be the fifth on Elliott or fourth on Elliott rather Greg Elliott commits the foul and a timeout Virginia Tech will have the ball nine point lead when we come back to Blacksburg its interesting he took some time off to be here but okay here is Justin mutts at the line after the fourth foul on Greg Elliott and the free throw by mutts is good well and the struggle is real for the Panthers at the three line today Dan 36 percent coming in 19 heres the number today meanwhile the Hokies have shown their form after quite frankly some struggles they really have had some struggles for you know Virginia Tech theyve played very well defensively tonight but if theyre going to beat people West they have to put the ball in the basket and they have done it at a great rate tonight if youre shooting 50 almost 54 overall 50 from three and theyve made nine threes and 70 from the freethrow line and heres Cummins driving the ball to the basket and hes gonna get fouled maybe get the oldfashioned threepoint play but the defense by Virginia Tech and running pit off the threepoint line has been very impressive Applause and a free throw good the Panthers get almost 40 percent of their offense in conference play from threepoint shots and when you eliminate basically that particular aspect of their game it makes it really hard for Pitt to produce enough points to win a game Applause fourth consecutive game of 20 or more now for basily its got 22 now he has been really good in the last half of the regular season here in the ACC Burton tried to get mutts in the air tend to shoot sabandi high off the window and in just four now for Nike sebandi well and that drops the lead back to eight and so its not like the Panthers are completely out of the game but theyve got to force some turnovers here West oakies got three timeouts you see on the board two for the Panthers and Virginia Tech can afford to take their time if they choose to do so yep Couture rapping all the way through who Collins took his eye off of it theres Cummings Nelly plays with four as does Federico right back to Collins who went for the dunk and the foul will be called and Collins is down again on the Burton foul which is his third Collins went for the dunk and boy I think MJ Collins wearing that mask took another shot around the face sure did oh and landed for boot oh my so Collins is being tended to Hisham zahood is there fourth year basketball trainer hes out with David Jackson the former hokey player whos in their strength and conditioning unless again he he lost a tooth in the game at Miami right and then he broke his nose in the game here against Virginia and and hes been hit a couple of times in that mast today yep second time in this half and theres going to be a timeout taken here so with 220 to go a timeout Pitt will go to their bench and Mike young has come out to make sure that his freshman from Clover South Carolina is good MJ Collins is playing with the mask hes playing with a mouthpiece well but again Wes that mask is just hard plastic yeah so if somebodys gonna hit you on that mask doesnt do very much to cushion the blow doesnt do anything to cushion the blow right so this young man who has come in started the last seven ball games at 12 at Notre Dame but only three points the other night in the loss in Atlanta when by the way he had nearly 40 tickets folks that have come from the Clover to see him play in Atlanta get a load of this guy hes staying in the game tell you what now this one tough guy hes gonna win the ACC tough guy award this week good evidence I know they dont issue the tough guy Ward out of Greensboro with rookie and player of the week but if they did Collins would get there my goodness good heavens and he and Burton understand its you know jamarius A Touch of Class of course just to say hey look you know no harm no foul didnt mean to do it like that and MJ understood were ready for free throws couple of them here for the rookie and it bounds away so it is an eightpoint game and 220 left to go Pitt needs the win to stay tied for first with Virginia and the second one is good for Collins a loss today would put them behind both Virginia and Miami they would go first to Third and Clemson who follows us at Louisville tonight so Collins comes out and malijah Poteet has come in so here is sabandi and Pitt down nine and Nike on the drive to make it a seven point game as long as the Virginia Tech doesnt turn it over Wes I dont think Pitt can beat can catch up two at a time so Bandy has two fouls Burton has three everybody else on the floor plays with four thank you Padula with 10 to shoot to mutts Couture shot fake no foul on Elliott and heres Poteet easily laying at home well Wes I think that was a good no call but what happened was one of the pit players went down and Virginia Tech had a five on four and they took advantage so Bandy fouled on the reach by mutts thatll be his fourth so free throws coming for Nike sabandi with 91 seconds left to go in a ball game Joel goodett Malcolm Huckabee standing by theyll join you live from Louisville when were done here seven for sebandi all in the second half tigers and Cardinals played earlier this year Louisville had it in a one possession game with about a minute and a half to go should be an interesting test they played Virginia the wire the other night they sure did play Virginia to the wire Tony Bennett said before the game that he thought Louisville was getting better and the cards didnt prove him wrong Clemson could do no wrong speaking of that off on Wednesday night against Florida State Couture with 12 to shoot Poteet looking at basily and now heres Couture Hunter a step back thats a two and its good nine in the half 12 in the game hes three away from a thousand Burtons triple no good and the rebound Couture with under a minute to go and a nine point Virginia Tech lead what a performance by Virginia Tech West heres bazilly short on the three Burton the rebound half minute to go Elliott spot up three over mutts missed it got it back and well draw the foul from basily and shoot free throws and thats five on Grant basili hes going to foul out with 22 points Dan its his fourth straight game of 20 or more and six in his last eight well West into the backtoback games he had 33 points right and it was really interesting seeing that that was the first time that anybodys had backtoback 33point games since 2003 and Eric Green Oh man talk about go get it numbers talking about somebody who can put numbers up on the board two shots for Elliott first free throws of the day and thats good 10 for Elliott six here in the second half its an eightpoint game with 23 seconds left and Jeff cables not sacking the bat yet folks hes got one timeout left to go and I got to believe hes going to tell Elliot make the free throw and Pits gonna press here see if they can force the turnover they dont they dont really have enough time Wes but this is what you do if youre a coach and see the problem is Wes the pit Panthers this particular Incarnation they are not gonna win a game if they only make three threepointers yep their DNA as a team is based on threes and dont forget now if this turns out to be their eighth loss of the year in their fourth in the league they have a quad for Tuesday night a quad three next Saturday a quad three and Dan a regular season finale that might be the biggest game of the final day nacc play when you think about it its not beyond that that game could determine the regular season absolutely second for Elliott Good hes got 11 in the game Federico is out and Jorge or Guillermo or Jorge Diaz Graham is checked in well now Wes you get an immediate steal and a three then suddenly it might be interesting theres an inbounds to Padula the Trap is on in the backcourt and heres Couture fighting through 15 seconds left and Virginia Tech well watch Pitt just back off and the Hokies are gonna go to 1611 and 610 in the ACC Pitt will fall 19812 and four and they go from first to third in the standings with the loss here this afternoon terrific performance by Mike Youngs team a great performance by Virginia Tech on both ends of the Court West Grant basili leads five Hokies in double figures and they will welcome Miami here on Tuesday night Pitt will host Georgia Tech
