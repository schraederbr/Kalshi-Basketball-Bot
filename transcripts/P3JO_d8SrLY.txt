and battling through really probably for about the last three weeks it feels like hes been battling through it West and you can see this is what he needs to the Duke Blue Devils he struggled in the two ACC Road games and they dont think its a longterm thing its a weektoweek thing they just want him to get better Boston College is here after a seven point win on Tuesday against Notre Dame Duke lost 8460 in Raleigh on Wednesday night to NC State so Tyrese Proctor is the new man on the floor for John shires Blue Devil Ryan young also draws the start today and theres a backdoor cut a layup for Derek Whitehead to get the Blue Devils going early boy one of the things that Ryan young could really do West is pass the basketball you want to be aggressive out on the perimeter but boy you cant stop that back door Jaden Zachary and you get a look at Demar Langford Jr off the right side and young the rebound for the Blue Devils Music Dukes lost two of their last three Boston College has won three of their last four here is Mitchell The Freshman on the drive the reverse and the land from Mark Mitchell well thats a really nice play by Mitchell but Makai Ashton Langford is 63 180 pounds and Mitchell is 68 220 so if they can create that kind of an isolation its going to be a long night for Makai Ashton Langston Zachary a league Bay at the top fires over the top of philipowski and young another Blue Devil rebound get a long rebound like that you get out and push nice job by BC getting back Lebowski had a doubledouble the first time these two teams Matt and he turns it over there one of his six on this season that Dan spoke of a moment ago heres Makai Ashton Langford on the drive and BC on the board and Boston College does not shoot the ball very well West so its important that they get easy shots and if Deuce going to turn the ball over thats going to help the Eagles get easy shots here is Young and fathered Inside by Bickerstaff turned over by the Blue Devils Ashton Langford was sidetracked with a hamstring injury only played nine minutes five weeks ago when they played in Durham heres Demar Langford zacharya catch and shoot three and the rebound to Picker staff and a league Bay right back but philipowski blocked it BC recovers and Eagles get a third chance here at the offensive end a Boston College had 14 offensive rebounds the last time these two teams play another block by philipowski and then Whitehead turned it over trying for the quick Outlet to Mitchell Baseline the drive Lankford had to fall off the front rim Music wow a lot of stuff going on the game is Scott here in the first two and a half here is Proctor inside catch score in the bucket for Ryan young whos now made 14 straight field goals and the foul is going to be on TJ Bickerstaff his first and the first on the Eagles Duke has done a nice job for the most part this year defensively and of course block shots really help thats a good one by philipowski and then driving the ball in there its thats a hard thing to do against the two Blue Devils free throw by Young when you drive the ball into Lane Weston you have to do it if youre Boston College youve got to make good decisions once you get in there you cant force the shots liquor staff Ashton Lankford a triple from the front and the rebound for Mitchell The Freshman from Kansas City and you see how prolific Ryan young has been for the Blue Devils hes got it again working down skip out top Proctor of three standing and Mitchell tried to keep it alive thicker staff terrific rebounder fires the BC transition chance yeah Langford thought about it he will drive the ball and the rebound for filipowski quite another tough shot Wes yep Proctor on the drive against Zachary Jaden Zachary affected that BC goes the other way and there goes Makai Ashton Langford all the way to the cup couldnt finish and the younger of the langfords Demar finishes on the followup Wes duke it turned the ball over a couple times and theyve made some bad decisions in terms of shot selection and that has helped Boston College Music heres philipowski a league Bay defending the double team almost had it knocked away saves it Whitehead will fire and hit five for Derek Whitehead The Freshman from Newark New Jersey whos had two straight double figure games and hits six of his last 13 dials one in there boy Wes you can just see him coming on yep very very highly touted Prospect you mentioned he struggled with some injuries but he looks like hes rounded into form now yep Blue Devils by a half dozen here early played four and a half minutes Ashton Lankford on the drive nice pass Zachary for the easy layup four for Makai Ashton Langford Boston College is the best twopoint percentage shooting team in the Atlantic Coast Conference theyve got to get more of those Whitehead quick delivery for filipowski PC doubling on every pass to the block foul on the Eagles thatll get us free throws when we continue but Dukes off to a good start philipowski Tariq Whitehead knocks down a triple Blue Devils by four early Music fourpoint lead in West one of the reasons is theyve been very effective on the inside and this is what Ryan young does number 15 just hands it off and just slides to the basket they lose him on the inside and young can be so effective like that Duke is coming back out here to shoot free throws because they threw the ball inside to philipowski Duke has an advantage in there they have to use it Dan Earl Grant what I thought was very candid with us he said we have to make good decisions in the paint and that that I think mostly is an offensive discussion but it certainly applies defensively too yeah it sure does and while youre while youre talking about the BC offense West they are the second worst threepoint shooting team in the country only Alcorn State is behind them right and yet of their nine field goal attempts three of them have been from outside the arc theyre actually three for six inside the Lebowski knocks down both free throws and here is uh Jacob grandison in the ball game for John shy and there is the 35 year old native of Northbrook Illinois and his first season of course in Durham so the character of Dukes team changes right at the moment Wes this is the kind of Versatility they have Granderson comes in the game and theres post first three of the Year well in time post has the reputation West that he can shoot it from out there its his first three of the year but this is only his second attempt thatll help CJ Penas come on the floor as well during that time out for Boston College threepoint game flakes Jalen Blakes out there for the Blue Devils with grandison heres young going to work nice pass catch by Mitchell lefthand move and a score for the Freshman Mark Mitchell hes got four theres some catch by Mitchell I dont think he expected to pass but Im telling you if youre around the basket and young has the ball you better expect to pass Lively and Kelly waiting at the table for their respective schools as we played almost six minutes of this first half heres Demar Langford backing down Jalen Blakes skips into the corner Makai Ashton Langford rings the bell on a three Wesson what happened before he got that three they got the ball into the lane they caused the defense to collapse Ashton Langford is not a great threepoint shooter only 25 percent on the year Music off the screen of young heres Tyrese Proctor his two rims out but grandison runs cleanly underneath for the second chance Proctor will drive it now tried to bounce it to Young saved on the floor by Pena and then young touched it now Mitchell had it and Zachary reaches in to commit a foul its been a little frenetic at times Boston College has gotten close on the strength of their threepoint shooting we said they were one of the worst in the country but he posts can shoot it he gets a wide open look you see all the Blue Devils are in the lane everybodys in the lane Makai Ashley Langford didnt even your picture the areas has all day to shoot that ball I think if youre Duke youre okay with that youd like to get out there and pressure a little bit more heres grandison of three Livelys coming the ball game to spell young for the Blue Devils first look at Derek Lively and CJ Pena cant handle the lead pass from Ashton Langford so there is the Freshman Lively 71 from Philadelphia the centerpiece of the Duke recruiting class but in all Candor here this preseason ACC Rookie of the Year selections been struggling he has been struggling Wes and one of the reasons is hes got 21 field goals made on the year 18 of them have been dumps the other three are within three feet of the basket so he has not shown uh yet that offensive ability other than to dunk the ball Blakes trying to size up Kelly a Houston freshman and Jalen Blakes its his first pass see and Duke is different now with Lively in the game and grandison in the game theyre not looking to get the ball inside by throwing it into the low post theyre looking to get the ball inside by going off screen and rolls and driving Kelly for post Music Applause now here is the Freshman we spoke of a moment ago post a nice pass Damar Lankford on the drive it got knocked around post couldnt control it Blue Devils out of there with it its not a bad idea to pass up the three West it might have been a bad idea to take it all the way to the basket pull up and shoot the midrange jump shot Lively heres Mitchell spotting up at the elbow long rebound for Pena and BC wants to run if they can Ashton Lankford too strong Demar fouled and free throws when we come back 1612 Duke a fourpoint lead BC will be at the free throw line when we continue on acc Network thank you since I was little I wanted to be a part of a team come here buddy played just about every sport there is growing up my moms been there for me through every season well get him mostly to keep me fueled and cheer me on Music it took me a minute but I finally found what I love all thanks to her you are always there for them and were always here for you Food Lion here for every moment that way hes up in the gate with the subway series an AllStar menu a delicious sub fourpoint lead for the Blue Devils at 1612 and were gonna have free throws after a foul on grandison now you come to the arena and you can see some of the similar things in this in different venues but Ive seen everything now building of the burger yeah you like that huh well and speaking of building things uh this guy post Quint post is trying to build some momentum with Boston College we showed you these numbers before the game but he has come in and he has been a big contributor early and hit that three sort of got him off the mark from threepoint range and I dont think its a coincidence Boston College they started one for ten theyre for their last five and that little streak is with Post in the game Earl Grant talking to Mark snow we got a terrific crew today Roger Ayers Pat Driscoll Mark schner Demar langfords a 56 freethrow shooter see how Dan your note about the threepoint field goal percentage look at where they are in twos and in free throws wow thats thats the percentage of their points not their shooting percentage and you can see they only get about 20 percent of their points from Beyond the threepoint line and thats among the last you know the very bottom in the country you know the free throw percentage that spot in the midrange but the percentage that points against for two thats very high so if you do you have to defend the lane aggressively Mason Matson has checked in for the Eagles during the break whereas 45 for Earl Grant Squad here is philipowski cutting to the basket and scoring first field goal for the Freshman from West Town New York thats just a really nice job make a pass you know they go give and go you cut into the lane you said theres two seven Footers playing out there now its hard to defend both of them five assists now for the Blue Devils on seven baskets fourpoint lead post with the right hand left his short a whistle and a foul and its going to be on phillipowski Bohemian Lively were contesting Quentin post whos going to get a couple of free throws out of him Wes early in the season everybodys talking about Ty filipowski and his ability to make twos here he just makes the pass a nice little screen Inside by Blakes but he just cuts the basket you pass it you go to the goal he is a very effective inside player Wesson Duke would like him to operate more down there not just drift out Beyond The Arc when post play 24 minutes against Notre Dame 16 against Syracuse Earl Grant said ah there might be a bit of a pitch count on post but see how it goes well Id say its going pretty good right now yeah it is he had a stress reaction in his foot not a fracture he had a stress reaction in his foot and they sat him down so it wouldnt be calmer a fracture he missed those 13 games and of course he wasnt really able to do very much of anything but he has gradually come back hes played those two games Earl Grant told us what He sore spinning on a leak Bay oh skip to the corner and Whitehead parries another three boy you better find him wow now he started out slowly this year West but his percentage is climbing steadily I had the foot injury of course going into Wednesday night you know he was ascending a little bit and now he is taking the roof off of ascending wait post is working really hard inside he was open a couple of times they didnt throw him the ball and Wes Im telling you when youre a big guy particularly when theres two seven Footers on the other team when youre open you need to have the ball right now because those other seven Footers are battling to get in position against you DC needs to do a better job looking for him inside and finding when hes open dont forget we got two more following this one at Chestnut Hill well send you to Louisville and then well close the night at John Paul Jones Arena Syracuse and Virginia waking Louisville all part of our ACC Network triple header today also available anytime on the ESPN Syracuse going into that game three and one in the conference yes here is Whitehead measuring post tried to go back door on a cut Blown Away by the Blue Devils and heres BC trailing five Batson Ashton Langford the hanging two and Whitehead grabs a rebound but thats a tough shot here is Blakes maybe pull up for the jumper Quick Pass philipowski shoveled the Lively Corner three grandison and post clears the rebound I think Lively was surprised by that pass he didnt catch it cleanly couldnt gather himself and passed it outside yep a league Bay Madsen launches and hits and Matson 163 of the year his first points today well Wes Madsen is the guy who came in here with the reputation as a threepoint shooter has not shot it particularly well so far but he is capable listen looking for some help the Lebowski trying to oblige switch by the Eagles and turned over by the Freshman but then the Eagles gave it right back shot clock did not reset philipowski for three and the rebound Zachary knocked Away by white man and it will belong to the Eagles but Mason Matson and heres the thing Boston College Dan we talked about their lack of Threes they only average four and a half a game theyve already got three and heres the latest and Whitehead just plays off of him Wes and again I think that thats okay but you have to understand he is their most dangerous threepoint shooter in terms of his history so you cant play quite that far off Whitehead is athletic enough defensively that he can kick up to him and prevent that easy look without being having Matson drive by BCs made their last three threes here Music see Mitchell playing way off Langford out at the top here is post against Lively big challenge for the Freshman post a big kid cant finish with the right hand Applause Lively handled that pretty well defensively place got a screen couldnt find Lively on the road and Lively screens you got to be looking for him on that roll yep Duke found him like three or four times in the first game against BC five weeks ago now heres Whitehead with eight to shoot working on Madison twoman game with philipowski hell turn force it up Lively couldnt catch and finish and heres Zachary and the Eagles three on three and Jaden will go all the way and scores West when when you take a tough shot it allows the offense or allows your opponent to get out in transition offense and thats exactly why that has happened tied at 21 Zachary pressuring Blakes and a hand check on Zachary thatll be the second on Zachary its the fourth on the Eagles we get a break in the action to Chestnut Hill but Jayden Zachary sophomore from Salem Wisconsin has tied us up when we continue from County forum Music stronger faster the future is strength you can feel and results you can see and you can only experience it on tonal for youth basketball today honest Id say just keep pushing yourself dont short yourself because especially kind of my whole story from where I came from not having a lot you got to just bet on yourself thats my main thing always just bet on yourself people are going to doubt you as long as you believe in yourself and your family does youll be fine well basketball Journeys are a little more uh arduous maybe than they used to be right uh Jaden Zachary earned a division one scholarship offer and then elected to go to Junior College and went to a terrific one Chipola in Florida one of the best in the country he got a lot of attention from D1 schools after one year but it was Earl Grant and a zoom call convinced him to buy into what Grant was going to build here at BC and its been a winwin so far for both its also been a winwin for Tariq Whitehead in the first oh I dont know 12 and a half minutes of play and it makes a difference when Ryan young is in the game he causes the defense to collapse and he can pass it out Whiteheads got 11 third straight double figure game on his third three post got back down too far on the Baseline but that was a force that time you got to recognize that the double team is coming and find the open man heres Mitchell and now young with post there young rolling on the big kid now back for filipowski on the drive squeezes it up Tapped Out by Young and finally control Langford threepoint lead for the Blue Devils era 22 ACC teams Applause Duke has been a demandtoman the whole time badson long rebound post tried to make the save but made it to Proctor a freshman from Australia nice job by BC to get back and good decision by Proctor to pull it out yep here is philipowski tried to bounce it to Young kick by post and well reset to 20 Wes we talked about Ryan young down on the inside watch the pass to the guy in the low post and Madsen drops down to try to help out and just a little bit too far its not a bad thing to try to drop in and help but youve got to be able to get back and Whitehead already 11 points four for four pretty good dont you think yep absolutely TJ pickerstaffs come back in to replace Quentin post and we see Devin McLaughlin for the first time and there goes Whitehead thats just really good movement yep without the ball Duke doing a nice job moving players and moving the ball when theyre playing well offensive terrific first half for Tariq Whitehead from a scoring perspective hes got 13 and that ball got deflected away Duke collapsed on the Baseline heres Whitehead all feeling it nope first Miss of the day off the back rim three but I think hes entitled to that absolutely heres McLaughlin and wooden looking on the bounce pass from Langford and BC turns it over in transition Applause and Earl Grant here in season number two and Dan I tell you what hes done a terrific job here he really has and I thought it was interesting Wes we were talking to him he said he really didnt look he really wasnt thinking about how they had missed so many guys with injuries until the Christmas break he said it was just a matter of you know a guy goes down another guy comes up and he said he didnt start thinking about the might have been until his team went home on for the holidays heres young trying to work inside nice pass out of a double team Mitchell the dunk and the foul Ryan Youngs passing ability frees Mark Mitchell for a chance at the end one but yangirongs passing ability is helpful but his ability to absorb contact and theres a lot of contact here guys bouncing all over him and again theyve tried to come and help out do the Eagles but youve got to get to Young that was paying you you got to get to Young while hes dribbling the ball if he picks it up hes going to find somebody ETO run by the Blue Devils its a 2921 count threepoint trip for Mitchell hes got seven here in the first half Applause Ashton Langford CJ Pena Applause and now here comes McLaughlin for the screen for driving into traffic all the way and young had a shot at it McLaughlin recovers and scores Kevin McLaughlin redshirted a year ago gets his first basket another offensive rebound for Boston College when you get the ball in tight like that West you force Health Defenders to come people are available for rebounding here is Young spinning with the right hand in his first Miss in about three games McLaughlin did a great job to hold his ground sure did here is Ashton Langford squeezing the trigger in traffic hes got nine on his fourth basket Dan but West he really does a nice job driving to his left and then shooting that ball with his right hand Applause a couple times weve seen him do that in traffic today four in a row by the Eagles have cut the lead in half for Duke and Young on the way lost the handle last Touch by Boston College so itll stay with the Blue Devils but a moment ago Makai Ashton Lankford weaves on through and then look at a little scoop with the right hand Duke by four when we continue Music glitchy flexing our confidence in a single game breaking records ankles Music and new ground come for it all Duke 29 Boston College 25 damn theres so much history in ACC basketball you could dive into the nuances maybe sometimes and feel like youre drowning but home court winning percentage in conference games is it 71 its sometimes Teeters in the 60s I dont ever recall seeing it its 71 even in the month of January but 71 is a big number its always tough to win on the road but Im telling you 71 is and North Carolina adds to that because they won at home today already 8164 Carolina win with baycott getting 21 and 13 dont forget we got a fullscale womens Hoops scheduled for you tomorrow two oclock Pitt in Louisville presented by Food Lion the great Haley van lith in the cards welcome Lance Whites Panthers to town and then Notre Dame and Carolina from Carmichael Arena helps us close the schedule nothing but that surrounds that and a three ball from Proctor gets Duke going out of the timeout Proctors another one of those guys Wes hes a capable threepoint shooter who hasnt shot it well so far this year just left him alone out there that was pretty easy yep seven point lead for the Blue Devils Applause Ashton Langford a nice pass catch and score for Devin McLaughlin boy there was some heat on that one he was lucky to hang on to that ball thats where Boston College is most effective when they can score inside Proctor heres Mitchell now Whitehead whos the Blue Devils leading scorer with 13 here in the first half skip pass boy what a catch by flakes I thought there was no way he was catching the call heres Lively four to shoot Blakes got to do something here against Matson he fired for three oh he got it to lambly who dunks it I thought he was going to try desperation three he got it to Lively somehow and the Freshman dunks home his first basket as 19th dunk of the year in 22 baskets somebody said thats something that Duke was able to do effectively in the first game heres mcglockton Applause lead back to seven for Duke BC found a was able to four in a row to cut into after an eightnothing Duke run but here a moment ago this desperation from Blakes but its desperation from Blakes but not desperation from Lively he catches the ball takes his time and dunks it home he dunked that West with point one left on the shot clock Mitchell the foul by the way is first third on the Blue Devils and now Whitehead and well take a break philipowski has come back Whitehead has gone out of the game hes got 13 points for the Blue Devils going down to the corner theres Zachary a little running hook shot huh back to the era of the Bonner the running hook shot take you back does it wow when Pagan would have been proud of that striding through the lane throwing it up the right hand huh theres a catch by Lively inside and fouled by McLaughlin at the iron itll be his second sixth on Boston College lets go back can we and rerack come on take me through this now wow Zachary gets the bond again Boston College is trying to get into the lane and he sees the sevenfooter in front of him and if hes going to shoot the ball thats really his only option I did that one time Wes we were playing Clemson and tree Rollins sent the ball back to our bench so its not the easiest thing to do with a seven foot guy he got it over yeah and thats a really good shot blocker Wayne tree Rollins was having none of your business Livelys got three in a row for Duke and misses the back end of the freethrow sixpoint lead for the blue down Boston College is hanging around Wes looks like a pretty important two minutes absolutely a tremendously important two minutes yep Zachary tried to feed through to post and Mark Schnur is going to award this to Duke Kelsey Riggs and our ACC Network Studio Luke Hancock Joel Berry of highlights of Carolina Notre Dame their thoughts on this plus youll hear from Earl Grant and from John shot here at Conti forum all before we start the second half Duke by six and the ball Proctor hit a three a moment ago heres philipowski a catching shoot triple and it fell off the back flange I just had a couple open ones hes missed Wes post to catch and shoot to try and answer can I Mitchell will run down the rebound now with 90 seconds to go John shires Im gonna try and manage as much of this last possession or two for his Club inside Mitchell squeezes up in traffic and scores that is a nine point first half for Mark Mitchell Derek Whiteheads got 13 thats 22 of Dukes 37 from the wings Music hes got Proctor with him and knocked out of bounds last Touch by Ashton Lankford that is some play by hasten Langford West I mean Blakes does a great job stepping in front of Zachary and Ashton Langford just stays up in the air West and doesnt drop his arm waits for the ball to be exposed and then blocks it use it or lose it time out well step aside for a half minute success is picking up extra

dont forget that during the winter season here around the ACC we want to see you the fan in action too post a picture of your ACC experience and hashtag all the devotion capture tag and post and look for it on acc Network great to be with Dan Bonner West Durham where Conti Forum setting the table for you on a triple header today on acc Network here is philipowski off the inbounds blocked by post under a minute to go in the Eagles trailing by eight elec Bay its really good job the double team and making you kick it back out again theyve shot the three pretty well today but this is not a good threepoint shooting team DC three of eight from behind the line in the first half Ashton Langford a whirling dervish kicks it to Demar Langford Fall Away good the second field goal six for Demar Langford hes really good with that midrange shot particularly getting into the lane there with that little turnaround and Wes I think that was a huge basket for Boston College now lets see if they get a defensive stop before halftime final possession of the half belongs to Duke Proctor and the Blue Devils going to go 14 here Music is Proctor step on the dribble now flakes Fall Away off the rim philipowski with point two left and its going to go to BC on possession on the ball thats caught in the rim Wes you forced if youre Duke you force the switch you wanted you forced posts to come out and guard Proctor but they werent able to take advantage of it yep so two tenths of a second here Dan you really cant do anything can you well all you can do is tap the ball yes but theyre going to take a look and make sure that point two is the correct with 03 or less all you can do is tap it you cannot catch it right you have to have at least 04 to be able to catch it lets look here there you go one oh God it looks like they got a lot more than 02 yeah that ball gets stuck right see gets stuck right now theres theres one one left on the clock but theyre gonna theyre gonna go with one they put one up there and thats Im good with that now one second Wes one second you have time to catch it dribble it and shoot it Mark snow has been the government Authority on the time Applause so Demar Lankford will have to throw it 94 feet at the basket hi arcing ball and post the catch score it theyre gonna check it theyre gonna check it but Quentin post might have sent BC to the locker room on a twopoint basket Wes I thought that ball might hit the ceiling this is so now of course the clock doesnt touch till its start until the talk doesnt start till the balls touch that ball looks like its out of his hand got these you know hes this is his first year at Duke but hes a graduate student he gets everybody together talking to him coming out of that huddle Mitchell Proctor young philipowski and Derek Whitehead the games leading scorer starts second afternoon I thought Proctor did a pretty nice job in the first half he didnt score a lot but he didnt have any turnovers but Lebowski had it blocked by Zachary out of bounds itll stay with Duke Im going to tell you something Jaden Zachary at six feet two is going to be talking about this forever yep you know you go block a seven foot guy shot little guys just never let you forget that heres young off the inbounds 15 on the shot clock DC is playing like Earl Grant Envision the movie tough very tough in the first 20 years Whitehead and he opens with a three you know its hard to get closer to him because he can go by you but youve got to put a little more pressure on him than that and another big shot sure is Derek Whitehead opens it up hes got 16 now and the Blue Devil lead is gone back to seventh a league and thrown away young with the turnover here is Mitchell leading the break the crossover tried to get to the rack draws the foul Whitehead has tied his season High by the way with 16 he had 16 last Saturday in the win against Florida State he goes off the screen and he gets a mismatch Bickerstaff a bigger guy has to go to him and Bickerstaff has the big guys a little afraid he doesnt want to get beat off the dribble and Whitehead makes him pay Soul shoot two first one good hes got double Figures its a really good start to the second half for Duke Boston College made six of their last seven shots going into the locker room at halftime including that 94 foot yeah Hail Mary in conversion if you will 11 for Mark Mitchell they dont want to let Duke get away of course BC has fallen behind in games Wesson rallied to win including Notre Dame on Wednesday yep or Tuesday rather just dont think you want to make out of it Ashton Lankford left open three ball bounces away I think you have to try inside before you shoot the three if youre Boston College phillipowski on the wing and heres young with the catch turn with bicker stats skip out Proctor eyes of three phillipowski The Rebound in dunk second field goal six points now for the Freshman Kyle filipowski his first points since about 11 and a half minutes to go in the first half Wes the defense gets all convoluted because Ryan young is inside with the ball and that quick kick out and the quick shot creates an offensive rebounding opportunity seven nothing run to start the half by the Blue Devils heres Ashton Lankford weaving through tomorrow length for three is good great answer by The Eagles boy they needed that yep first three of the day nine for Demar Langford Jr but thats Demar Langford Jr West now on the season hes two for 12 come out beyond the arms and Whitehead a turnover Applause trying to find Mitchell philipowski has been rather quiet today but this is just this situation he gets us a nice job getting positioned inside and going to the basketball turnover Dan about 12 minutes of gameplay stretch for John shires Club heres post a couple of dribbles hesitates with young defending good match up here postal turn skip out Baseline Bickerstaff had it rattled out Applause Whitehead Proctor will fire away and hit Tyrese Proctor both of his field goals are triples hes got six the lead is 11 biggest of the afternoon for the Blue Devil classic Proctor was two for 11 from three and ACC play coming into the game Demar Langford tries another three I know he just made his last one but now hes two for 13 on the year and so maybe you should stick that one in his back pocket for a while saying the heat checks need to be limited well Earl Grant he said to us going off the court at halftime that his guys need to give the Duke defense an opportunity to break down and when you shoot a three that quickly that doesnt happen thats an offensive foul Dan I think this call has been uh kind of investigated dictated through but this is the drop of the left shoulder right right you just cant pound into a guy with your shoulder like that weve seen you know we saw DJ burns from NC State he doesnt use his shoulder he uses his entire body to back you down and spin and you can get away with that but right in front of the official dropping that shoulder driving it into your opponents chest thats going to get called every time here is post now with young defending double team help now theyll find the open guy and thats Langford 11 now for Demar Langford when they can get it into the Lane West they can cause Dukes defense to have to react and youre going to get opportunities like that young setting the high screen for Proctor nice pass billopowski tough catch in a foul how about this ball handling Tyrese Proctor playing for the injured Jeremy Rhodes getting a lot of minutes whats an awfully good look here out front for the three in a moment ago Paul for the delivery and a OneShot chance when we come back new customers get our best deals on all smart today A lots been delivered West he has played really really well and this is the third game of the road that hes shot the ball really well hes got four threes today and you know the Duke Blue Devils they theyve told us that theyve got a lot of guys who can score but they dont have that one guy well they may be finding him Wes and it may be him well the Blue Devil suit took a tough loss in Raleigh on Wednesday night 50 following 20point regular season losses in the last 25 years Kyle filipowski at the line to try and complete the threepoint play and Dougs but hes got five and a half nine in the ball game and Dukes got their largest lead now 12 points you just sense that Duke is gaining control in this game Boston College needs some sort of response theres the double team against post trying to force him into a threepoint shot opportunity vicker staff muscling in and Mitchell blocked it a battle for it TJ pickerstaff with five to shoot they skip it for Zachary shot clock winding down and a front round Miss by Boston College that was some defensive sequence right there Applause but you see how Duke when post gets the ball inside theyre coming to double Proctor on a cut off the screen here is Whitehead nice pass young the catch right back out front Whitehead another three but Rim Miss Langford the rebound for the Eagles Applause young is amazing in his ability to find open cards picker staff heres post another pick three from front spins out halfway down and it rimmed out for Clinton post Applause you got a Boston College their strength is their defense they got to dig in here Paul got knocked loose bounced right to phillipowski for the layup but the big guy had to go down and get it Wes those are really good hands by philipowski right there yep 14point lead for Duke 5238 Blue Devils on a bit of a tear theyre five of eight from the floor here in the second half PC just two of nine make it three of ten as post catches and scores thats really the first defensive breakdown weve seen for Duke in a while theyve been outstanding yep and Zachary or Ashton Langford almost knocked it away from Proctor itll stay with the Blue Devils so post that last time he got the ball quick and was able to score but here as he sets things up he dribbles the ball a couple times Mitchell gets over and double teams him and then Mitchell he plays so well he goes straight up in the air he double teamed he went back found his guy and blocked the shot thats really good defense Ryan young goes out Derrick Lively reports back for Duke first time weve seen the Philadelphia freshman in the second half Proctor misses on the three there a rebound for Demar Langford Applause theres the drive and run for Makai Ashton Langford what a tough takethrough traffic Music field goal now double figures on Makai Ashton Langford West is a tough take through traffic but this guy has shown he can make these interestingly about this one he uses his body to fend off the defender weve seen him make this move and shoot the ball with his right hand but he bounces off the shot blocker Lively and somehow gets it up there with his left hand how about that 80 free throw shooter looking for his 12th point and has it Not only was that a heck of a play Wes that was a play that when they really needed Jalen Blakes has come on the floor for Duke the sophomore from Somerset New Jersey she spells Proctor during the timeout Applause Music Applause bikes trying to get everybody set AC showing a little bit of a Zone here what one three one man so it looks like West Side over here Zachary with a Duke giveaway and Jayden Zachary cant finish they slap it around Demar Lankford to follow Lively finally pulls it away and a hell ball will give it to BC on alternating possession Earl Grant wants to know about the foul Boston Colleges second year coach not happy well this is this is a pass by Lively but Blakes does a nice job getting back on defense and Lively recovers as well bothers that shot but cant claim the rebound that the Eagles get the ball on the alternating possession on the hell ball here is posts against Lively in a bump and a foul on Derrick Lively will be his first itll be the third of the half on Duke on Livelys defense you dont expect Quentin post to put it down and drive it and he just sticks his arms in there thats a point of emphasis most of the time you dont see it involving two seven Footers out at the top of the key but phillipowskis out and Jacob grandison has come back in dont forget tonight seven Eastern after our coverage is done with the triple header the nothing but net crew breaks down the day in the ACC highlights an analysis of all six ball games theyll also look ahead at the best games of the schedule in the coming week Kelsey Riggs hosts with a full Cadre of guys three ball posts is good a dozen for Quinton post Wes hes got a really good looking stroke season high for the seven footer from Amsterdam 80 run by BCs drawing them back to within six and again the Zone Wes just trying to make Duke slow down a little bit grandison heres Mitchell couldnt get by Zachary three on the shot clock grandison on the drive lost it over the inline out of bounds thank you Applause Granderson trying to drive into the zone and Wes one of the reasons people play zone is to prevent penetration so its sometimes its hard driving through but when you draw the defense against a mantoman you can find an open shooter Dukes got eight turnovers four in the first half and four already in almost the first eight minutes Ashton Langford couldnt finish I think he was expecting a lot more contact than he got whoops Im with you there parts heres Blakes now Jalen is a steady hand at the wheel of the offense and theres Mitchell and its an offensive foul so Mark Mitchell tagged with his second foul the fourth on Duke Boston College has bought some momentum back into the Conte Forum down six and just better than five years ago early December 2017 number one Duke lost to Kyle Bowman Jerome Robinson and the Eagles 8984 West you talk about a guard tandem that you put a lot of points on the board wow they were something Kyle Bowman Jerome Robinson High Volume High reward right No Lack of confidence there yeah Langford here is post hard dribble against philipowsky and Quentin post the runner to go hes got 14 in the ball game now hes got a season High remember its just his third game and BCs to within four of Duke West that was really some move because I thought philipowski was in pretty good defensive position 100 run by the Eagles young back on the floor for Coach Shire that got knocked away Madsen and McLaughlin reaching in post has hit a couple of Threes so when he gives the fake he gets filipowski to stand up and that second one filipowskis standing up is when post just gets a little bit of room on the dribble and theyre telling Pro Grant and the Boston College bench to sit down and theres a foul and thatll be on McLaughlin itll be his third its number three on the Eagles here in the second half Duke plays with four team fouls Applause Victor philipowski is a tough matchup for McLaughlin yeah particularly philipowski is going to go inside heres young reverses back up and under and a good basket just the second field goal for Ryan youngbo Dan but Duke needs a basket who do you go to right well thats only his third field goal attempt I think Wes six point lead again for the Blue Devil Zachary took the contact from Blakes bangs in the little jump shot hes got a half dozen but Boston College did a nice job spreading out the Duke defense creating an entire opening a big opening in the lane and Zacharys played that kind of tough game he showed us hits of a year ago Earl Grants Premier season and BC back to the mantoman yep heres Proctor young with a hard screen Proctor soft jumper rolled off the post its good defensive help by Madison here is Ashton Langford thought about pushing it all the way to the basket oh no about 25 feet wow that would have been a longrange jump shot again you have to move the ball Zachary in the McLaughlin scores theyll score the basket would have been awarded anyway basket interference on the Blue Devils third field goal for Devin McLaughlin the redshirt freshman nice job by Madsen to come over bothers that shot a onehanded rebound by post that gets everything started this is a really nice pass on the inside and when philipowski grabbed the rim then ball was already in the cylinder pull up at 15 feet missed jump shot phillipowski gets his own rebound fresh 20 for Duke the lead is only two for the Blue Devil and Duke I think needs to take out of the page out of the Boston College book moves the ball in and out from side to side the lapowski from in front cant finish rebound from Matson BC can tie or lead here West that shot by philipowski was close but it wasnt easy 142 Run for the Eagles and an offensive foul on mcglockner Florence at shoulder Wes four on Devin McLaughlin was not even 24 to go thats not a hard call gets the ball just lowers that shoulder and as I say if you back him in with your backside you can get away with a little bit more than when you turn and drop that shoulder Music Applause so here comes TJ Bickerstaff for Devin McLaughlin Applause and that core pressure I thought for a moment Becker staff was going to come help Ashton Lankford and Zachary did not well bring it front court right they get a trap over there hell be part of it heres Young lobbing for Whitehead he couldnt control it Blakes got the deflection look at that pressure though BC has been terrific on defense wow theyre very physical defensive team heres young driving post with a right hand and the rebound of the Miss and heres Matson with Whitehead back for Zachary and retired foreign Applause by the home team Applause terrific play and recognition by Metson and Zachary locks us up at 54 in Boston next on behind the series let me tell you with Earl Grant in the background and the best defensive stance of the night Boston College has tied the game it starts with defense but watch this Outlet pass that is a great Outlet pass a little fancy thing at the end by Madsen but Makai Ashton Langford saw his teammate sprinting down the court and that out but pass is what made the play now at 54 heres Whitehead challenging post and Quinn post gonna be called for the block itll be his first shot one awry on the 15 pounds Applause and Earl Grant wants to know what for well you got to get yourself in position you have to you have to be in position before your opponent leaves the floor and I think that was uh that was the call Post was close that he didnt establish his defensive position in Time season High 17 now for Derek Whitehead first free throw attempt to the hes got an older brother to here who was a terrific I mean not good terrific linebacker in the NFL and when I heard that not long after Derek committed to Duke have seen the younger brother play the younger brothers got a little bit of heres linebacking characteristics in him hes got some juice thats for sure Wes hes got a seasonhigh 18 today and the Blue Devils go to Zone here Blue Devils in the 23 Zone Boston College has been doing a great job getting the ball inside when you go to the zone to prevent that dribble penetration Langford back to the younger brother Demar and heres post on the roll couldnt finish knocked away last touched itll stay with the Eagles wait that was a fabulous move by posting and everything but put it in the basket when post health is he must be feeling a little more toward 100 because I dont since theres a pitch count here in the second half well hes as close as this game isnt as well as he played yep there may be a pitch count but I think on the BC bench they might have forgotten 21 minutes which is a season high for him or he did have 24 the other day I should say heres post skip to the corner Ashton Lankford was six to shoot pull up and the rebound for bicker staff Cal post blocked by philipowski recovered young Whitehead but no numbers good reaction by philipowski Boston College that had a couple of good chances yep theyve never LED in this game Wes here is Whitehead nice catch by Young tried to go up and under is going to draw a foul its going to get us to a timeout were going to get free throws when we come back Ashton Lankford picks up his second Music its bow time get more bow terrific crowd young and old here today at Conte Forum taking in the 31st meeting of the Blue Devils and Eagles dont forget this is just game one of a triple header on acc Network next Mike Monaco Chris patola stand by at the Yum Center cards have beaten Wake Forest five for the last six times and then after that off to jpj Virginia has won seven of the last eight against Syracuse and Jay alter Malcolm Huckabee blows our triple header today on acc Network and always available on the ESPN app Ryan young is two for two at the line today its got six rebounds West he had five assists in the first half and knocks down the free throw he is as gifted a big passing ball the ACC has man now Duke with some pressure Applause four point lead for the Blue Devils been as big as 14 and so BC they got to dig back in again unless they cut into that 14point lead sometimes you spend so much energy making that comeback you dont have enough to get over the top so they just got to start again plenty of time heres Becker staff skip for Zachary a league Bay of three rebound by Young Applause hell wait on Proctor to circle around and then heres Mitchell I think if you do if you take that a league Bay three for 13 from out there coming in today from the drive Whitehead working on Zachary offensive foul its tremendous defense Zachary moved his feet made Whitehead stop and then Whitehead gets called for the foul with that pushup second on Tariq Whitehead just gets in front and now Whitehead turns drops the shoulder the arm comes out west thats the call you see every single time Applause lots been written about that block charge call Dan you know theyve kind of refined the rules makes it pretty clearcut to me now heres Duke in the zone again particularly that displacement foul like that Wes it is very clear inside blocked was Bickerstaff and recovered by the Blue Devils two terrific possessions of Rim defense by the Blue Devils well theyve got big guys in there and that time I think that was Mitchell that got that one yeah oh heres Proctor trying to get it to Young Bickerstaff hedged and takes it away well young was open they didnt form the ball they waited too long and then he was covered up Malik Bay passed on the three that time coming up on six minutes to play in a fourpoint Duke lead even against the zone you got to get the ball inside Ashton Lankford a deep three and knocked out of bounds by Victor staff so Dukes kind of tightened it up on defense here Dan wow this time the ball does go inside but theres three guys around the ball that is a really tough shot you take that one because youre looking for a foul Boston College made their last four shots before it went to that break now theyve missed their last six Applause Dukes in a field goal drought thats better than five minutes but still have a fourpoint lead heres Whitehead of three long rebound phillipowski collects procto give Duke another chance philipowski has got a mismatch inside Langford guarding him they go to Young heres philipowski four to shoot back toward the Baseline tried to find Young and Duke turned it over West that all starts because your point guard cant get the ball into your sevenfooter against a mismatch and by the time young is able to get it down there philipowski doesnt have enough time to make a play and that is a great job by Machias in Langford forcing phillipowski further under the basket that he wanted to go three straight turnovers by John shires team thats where they got in trouble in the first halfway they turned the ball over three times in the first couple minutes of the game and then ended the half with only one more turnover 5 19 to go Applause Kristen Langford Demar Lankford Zachary post and Elite Bay on the floor for Earl Grant you got to get it inside here is DeMar Langford Applause skip for Zachary hell loop back four to shoot a league Bay forced it up hell draw the foul on Young Wes thats great offensive Patience by Boston College because what Duke is doing a lot of times when youre playing against the zone you get the ball inside to force the defense to collapse and then you can shoot a three well Dukes not worried about Boston College threepoint shooting so the defense comes the league Bay gets it he knows the shot clock is running down hes got to make a play big strong kid that was a nice job well this young man from Minneapolis who played at minnehan Minnehaha Academy with Chad Holmgren and Jalen Suggs goes to the line and the first one is good first points of the day for Prince alipay and you saw there Wes hes been playing pretty well coming into this game its only a 56 freethrow shooter on the year theres a two straight double figure games averaging 13 and a half points and six and a half rebounds but his impact on this game may be in the last 457 and the second of the two bounces away well he takes a long time 10 second Counts gonna be a real deal with the Lupe isnt it here is Proctor now Applause Zone by BC back into the Zone West at 131 has been good to Earl Grants Club Whitehead will fire over it and miss and the rebound for post and Wes this theory is the same you got to get the ball inside against that zone force it to react that was a long shot without ever testing that zone Music Applause Ashton Lankford Zachary rimmed out on a tie again West Boston College one of the worst threepoint shooting teams in the country so if youre Duke I think youre okay with them taking those long three Mitchell trying to drive it on Langford all the way in draws the foul Damar Lankford second itll be the seventh on Boston College with 358 to play threepoint lead for Duke and free throws when we come back Music Point ball game the under four immediate timeout free throws coming for the Blue Devils when we continue here and this game summary Dan Tariq Whiteheads got a seasoned High 18 Quinton post playing very well and Dukes doing this without Jeremy roach a couple hours before the ball game you see the boot on the right foot reaggravating that toe injury thats kind of been bothering in the last month it feels like by the way John Shire told us before the game hell be week to week and here you can see that neither team has any fouls to give The Possession arrows in favor of Duke we picked up two timeouts BC has three Mitchell missed the first one freshman from Kansas City and the back end good West Duke is now 13 for 15 from the line Boston College is perfect but theyve only been there five times Duke comes in at 76 percent and ACC play Austin College only took nine attempts five weeks ago when they played here is post double team quickly squeezes through rebound a leak Bay and finally philipowski cleaned it up heres Proctor and a little open floor for the Blue Devils but here BC youd like to see post make that shot but he was under heavy defensive pressure on the inside Mitchell the Lebowski working on Elite Bay wants the basketball they get it to the freshman Applause cannot finish they gather and finally knocked out of there heres Demar Langford on the drive Elite Bay thought about it oh Zachary flagged that down that was going to be in Jim molinarys lap on the PC bench a league Bay at the foul line cleanly through basket for clinics a league Bay hes got three points its a twopoint Duke lead under three to go West and ball movement created an opening in the middle sure did mantoman for Boston College Mitchell nine to shoot gonna take Langford on the drive through traffic young the rebound skip for Whitehead heres Proctor out front hell attack on the dribble cant finish second chance no they battle inside the foul on the deck against BC with the Mitchell rebound and its going to be on Demar Lankford itll be his third its the eighth on Boston College West the defense by BC pretty good but you got to get the ball nice job by Ryan Young when the post went to try to block the shark young went to find an open area and the ball just happened to come right to him and then Duke just stays with it free throw by Mitchells good the Blue Devils are having to do this and get through a drought that is almost nine minutes long without a field goal but theyve been getting the ball down into the Lane West theyve been getting close and drawn fouls if you make two free throws counts the same as a basket at least thats the way it used to be yeah three in a row now for Mitchell the lead is four just ahead of two minutes to go 35 of the games in ACC play so far this year been five or less weve had one overtime game in conference play foul line Zachary with the right hand scores tough shot how did he get that in the basket and a timeout taken 30 second timeout for Earl Grant Zacharys got ten six in the second half and then last basket the most difficult of them all Music has this ever happened to you how was school Duke leads it by 2s and after the last basket by Jaden Zachary what Zachary cut into the middle Lane that little fake freezes young and allows Zachary to get by but silk he gets to the basket hes got to go past young and through filipowski and somehow hes able to get it to go in the basket that is an incredible play Duke holding to a lead despite not having a field goal in the last 908 its been since 1108 that theyve been able to score from the floor theyve missed their last 10 shots he sees just two of their last 10 talk about grinding thats where were going philipowski got the roll snaps the drought and Duke pushes it back to a fourpoint lead very aggressive play by philakowski hes missed a couple of those West but undeterred 90 seconds to go at Chestnut Hill foul line Zachary a league Bay Applause So within what are the Eagles Applause right hand and dynamite cant finish tapped around control Elite Bay Music okay taken away philipowski hes got Whitehead Applause Whitehead goes down ball went out of bounds and Tariq Whitehead is he okay Applause Music Applause and I think they want to look at things over at the monitor Roger Ayers will go there boy philipowski makes a great play to step in Applause and West were under two minutes so theyre going to look obviously to see who at last touched the ball the ball initially awarded you saw Rogers point the blue Devils way and that means they have to find definitive evidence that they should change the call if it belongs to Duke you see the reset here Dan twotime out Street School bonus time already for the Blue Devils next Duke foul puts BC in the line and heres another look at the Whitehead dunk that rimmed out well you dont expect that to happen nope and and well lets see if we can tell here who touches the ball philipowski goes for it and then Zachary is coming in from behind and that looks to me like Zacharys the last one to touch it I hope Whiteheads okay shot by Prince a league Bay for 13 from Beyond The Arc and hes already missed one today but again this is a shot that if your Duke you can live with that shot and of course Boston College we said theyre one of the worst threepoint shooting teams in the country but they make they make about one out of four so law of averages says eventually theyre going in at least at some point now they do decide that its Duke ball its going to stay with the Blue Devils you need to stop here obviously Wes heres philipowski lost the handle on it got it back tried to roll it and a timeout taken by Shire the minute the Lebowski lost it the first year head coach of the Blue Devils punched that time out as philipowski went down just right of the lane on the dribble thats a tremendous break for the Blue Devils because Makai Langford has his back Ashton Makai Langford has his back to the play if he sees it he can pick up that ball that he never saw so 15 to shoot 476 to play and of course if youre Makai Ashton Langford youre not looking for that ball youre defending your guy so thats not a mistake on his part just a bad break for Boston College well North Carolina already a winner today we told you at the top of the broadcast just a complete Log Jam at two and two of course Carolina went to three and two you see where Duke and BC theyre part of it Florida State leading Georgia Tech uh NC State later tonight in Blacksburg theyve got two wins after the win against the Blue Devils you know Wake Forest coming up in the game two of our doubleheader Dan in Louisville I mean and of course you got that big pit Clemson game yeah thats North Carolina State West you know we were there the other night for Duke and that this is a huge stretch for them thats a quad one win they get against Duke they have the chance to get another one today at Virginia Tech to all these games even though its in January theyre all important and you ask any coach in America they all count March too yep spot throw in on the Baseline itll be Proctor The Freshman to put it in play does some Mitchell did he touch it no Mark schner said he was touched by Boston College of course were going to review it yeah that was DeMar Langford I believe defending the inbounds oh wait I dont know right for never Touchstone either it went right through Mark Mitchells hands I dont know that Langford ever touches this ball he reaches for it but I dont know that he ever gets it oh now his right hand he may have gotten with his right hand he missed it with his left oh look at a chance to see it in a did Mitchell touch it doesnt matter it went out of bounds if Langford never touches it it goes to Boston College right but again Wes the key here is the ball was rewarded to Duke awarded to Duke and so do you have enough evidence here to give it to Boston College its Mark snorer Roger Ayers checking the monitor boy this is a tough one yeah sure is Boston College ball there we go so it is overturned to the blonde to the Eagles Applause Wes and theyre the way where theyre putting the ball in bounds theyve obviously ruled it Mitchell touched the ball because if Mitchell never touches the ball they take it out of bounds underneath here is Zachary now Applause on the drive block Mitchell what a play by Mitchell and last Touch by Duke and were going to go look again Applause and Mitchell blocked it off the glass on the Zachary Drive Wes I thought Zachary had a really good Lane to the basket and Mitchell doesnt try to get close to him and he gets that ball before it gets to the back to the backboard so who touched it was it Proctor so was it post post watch Quentin post number 12 come in here I think post hit it I do too I guess is going to go to Duke after they check it out here this is some recovery by Mitchell now he just stays with it the balls going up it hasnt touched the backboard and he gets it and I think post is the guy who hits yeah you see the right hand of Quentin post there now Proctor is also there but I dont think Proctor ever got to the ball but again it was this one was awarded to Boston College so is there an is there enough there to change the call to Duke now people say well they review too much in each of these last two instances its helped them make the right call man thats why the rule exists the way it does youre under two minutes you can go and review those out of bounds plays but obviously theyre critical plays now Duke burned the timeout along the way here by the way Dan theyre down to one so they have one to go BC has two now west there is there are 368 seconds left to play in the game and if youre Boston College you do have the option of playing tough defense and getting the ball back yep you do not have to foul in this situation right and Roger Ayers is over there with a little bit of game management I believe just to make sure theyve got things tuned up on the clock I think hes checking the clock thats it yep double checking the time meanwhile Boston College and Duke are locked up into one corner here and of course Wes you have to check the time in this situation because every 10th of a second chance well we saw that at the end of the first half right thats true every second counts every tenth of a second counts and so theyve taken off well no theyve added 373 its a 368 so half a second solapowski to put it in play Proctor in the corner lost it last Touch by Proctor now belongs to BC 356 left what a play by Zachary Applause now here we go Zachary Cuts in Applause uhowski yeah it bounces off Proctor and hits on philipowskis leg so time out and thatll be it for Duke I believe did the Blue Devils call this no I think Boston College called the time BC called the timeout so each school now with one left to go full time out here for Earl Grant dont forget still to come wake in Louisville Mike Monaco Chris patola stand by to KFC Yum Center following our coverage here from Chestnut Hill West now Roger Ayers is over at the table again and he is going to look to check on the clock and hes going to look to check on that out of bounds play yeah but Wes its not about seems pretty clearcut well it does seem pretty clearcut but as long as you have the opportunity go and make sure yeah now if youre Boston College West you are down one and so and you could I guess elect to hold it as long as you can but in the general philosophy here would be to get the first good shot that you get so you have time to recover if you miss all right now remember Boston College has kind of been in these tight bits intermittently through their season one of them came earlier this year against Cornell early November and Prince a league base scored right at the rim with less than a second to go to help the Eagles beat the big red so remember that and then we had the 94 foot play at the end of the first half so weve seen just about everything Earl Grant can throw at the sink heres the throw this is DeMar Langford with a terrific pass by the way hope Jeff hafley doesnt come from the tunnel to pull in for football and Quentin post a turnaround off the Baseline so that was the end of the first half just keep all that in your pocket here as we go down the final 356 one point lead for Duke Dans already giving you the differential heres post to work on Young finally turns and scores Clinton post 16 points BC in front shot clocks off John Shire has a timeout Mitchell to Young against the league Bay trying to reverse It Up Knocked away recovered inside and it hit the inline and we got a foul called we do and its on a league Bay yeah were 124 to go Wes I thought young had a chance to turn and shoot that ball he gets the ball inside and hes against the league Bay and he elects to try to try to take it into the middle theyre very fortunate they were able to keep that ball oh theres the foul by lakebank phillipowski 124 to go free throw good phillipowski an excellent freethrow shooter and Duke has been outstanding from the line today tied at 64 Applause John Shire got a timeout in his pocket if he wants it Earl Grant has one as well if he misses West you hold for the last shot if he makes you got to go down and score quickly and Duke is going to call the timeout I believe now Wes Earl Grant he you know hes at home he could play it this way he could go for the last shot but again the general rule of thumb is if youre down by a point you take the first good shot you can get a lot of finish huh unbelievable right weve had great defensive plays weve had the monitor reviews weve had about everything you can think of so Duke is out of time out Boston College only has one and Wes an important factor to consider here the possession arrow is in favor of Duke yep well I told you a moment ago 35 of the games in conference play have been five or lesser overtime Dan well in college they played in overtime against Virginia Tech yeah and what what a seven point game here the other day a seven point game where they trailed by 10 yep well send you to Louisville as soon as were done here at Conti Forum Mike Monaco Chris patola standing by at the Yum Center well put you in the trusted hands of Jay alter and Malcolm Huckabee later tonight from Charlottesville this is some kind of finish here now Duke went almost nine and a half minutes without a field goal led by as many as 14 in the second half Dan because they led by as many as 14 West and Makai Ashton Langford made an unbelievable threepoint play and sort of stopped the bleeding for Boston College and they went on a 162 run to tie the game yep so Demar langfords going to put it in play well you got to get it in play first of all Wes he can run the Baseline and then you get it got to get it across half court and its back to Demar Langford heres 10 hell break the timeline at eight heres Makai out front with six trying to drive foul on jumper offline post the rebound lost it over the end line with half a second to go itll belong to Duke with 05 left Ryan young and John Shire discussing just throw it to the other end throw it to the other end of the Court yep so Metro gonna wind up throw its caught post at Mid Court oh and the ball game ends with Duke capturing a 6564 win Applause they put it in the hands Dan of their leading scorer makayash and Langford did the Eagles yeah they did West and he just didnt get a very good opportunity here nice defense by Whitehead and posted everything he could but he couldnt recover the ball thats
