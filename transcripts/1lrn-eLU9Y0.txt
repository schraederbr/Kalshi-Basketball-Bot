do is want four straight in this building officials today Roger Ayers Tommy Morrissey and Nathan Farrell Matthew Cleveland back at the starting lineup for Florida State he missed the last two games with back spasms no Nigel packed today for Miami their starting point guard is out with a lower extremity injury Florida State enters play on a fourgame losing streak theres Caleb Mills now Cleveland from the Baseline tough shot and comes to omir and heres this Miami offense averaging 85 a game during the sevengame win streak and Isaiah long hits the three for the opening chords of the guitar Anish Florida State better be locked in better than that in sequences because Miamis going to come and look to Spore fans Mills turns it over North Shadowmere leading the break bounce pass comes back to Omar Thunder from Miami to start for the canes allowing that defense to keep some high percentage punctuations coach himans in timeout to settlement Applause Music just the ability to get deflections get hands on balls and thats North Shadow Mirror youre quote unquote Center running to break Poplar gets it back and rewards the big fella activity effort and execution all coming to the Forefront early on for the Kings thats how you start we got the opposition calling your timeout in first minute youre achieving at a high level this is a rivalry game but given the trajectory of both schools you look at Florida States record eight and twenty six and 11 in conference theyve lost seven of eight with Jim larenega took the floor and shoot around today high energy the message was there this Miami team they all watched Virginia lose to Boston College earlier in the week that loss by Virginia that Miami is in the drivers seat in this conference playing like it off the getgo and it should be too hard in danger group although youre playing a lesser team than youve already beaten by 20 plus but youre playing for a championship thats why youre seeing a Keynes group thats engaged they want the hardware they want to be like that 2013 team Mills almost turned it over Worley fights for it and gets the tough basket inside and still see the ball Hawking of the canes I mean ball pressure trying to get Lanes theyre trying to be active defensively to activate what is an explosive offense Bensley Joseph getting the start in place of pack now omir coming off the DoubleDouble Joseph shakes Mills kicks to the corner three ball is good what a popular shooting it at a 40 clip for deep in conference and then a turnover in the backcourt as well just Florida State seems to be sleepwalking early on Bensley Joseph inserted in a lineup in place of Nigel pack quarterbacks that thing is your best perimeter Defender driving kick but an understanding of his connection with the guys Wong leaving the Florida State Defense no resistance very businesslike in the approach early on Keynes have hit their first four from the field Florida State already a couple of turnovers theres Cole on the Freshman backing down on the low post too strong loose ball and comes to Miami and Joseph Applause Cora nearly stole it away Poplar left his feet without knowing where to go cardinalson with the basketball but they live to see another day Wong in consideration for ACC Player of the Year finding omir offensive rebound ball never hit the rim shot clock didnt reset it doesnt matter nor Chad omear who had a doubledouble in the first meeting between these two Florida state is being punched in I mean every piece of the body right now a lack of toughness down low of here doing whatever he wanted there core and lost it out of bounds another turnover and Jordan this feels like the first game which was a Miami blowout yeah just shot out of a cannon and Isaiah wall capable with the three shoot career highs there 38 percent in conference then he attacks that closeout nobody is better with the the tough twos in the conference that Isaiah walks when these two played last month as you look at what Wong has done against Florida State four 20point games but only one win against the Knolls Applause Music in that first meeting between these two Miami in the first half scored 54 points they shot 61 percent from the field nine of 14 from three and it was the hustle in the first half of that game 190 in terms of Second Chance points in the first 20 minutes hey this is a group thats capable of scoring 90 points theyve done it what three times already this season I mean they are an explosive group but its how they get theirs they try to maximize possessions they get a lot of run outs they got a lot of efficient guys Ill run out like that for Logan Paul yeah foreign State ambushed from the getgo Karen green launches and hits they need that from him just one of ten from deep in the first meeting he is a lights down threepoint shooter when he can get going yeah I mean hes one of the best and hes hit second most in conference Florida States got to take care of the basketball give their offense a chance to find some sort of Rhythm here on the road in this Ruckus environment Joseph stepped back on Breen everything falling from Miami now seven of nine here in the first four minutes plus dribbling Worley the sophomore throws it up through the rim gets his own rebound and is fouled on the finger roll Applause Music Applause Music conferences most efficient scoring team well when you get ones like this an up forced air will come Poplar winning the ACC and winning the ACC tournament they are capable of playing deep into marks maybe even deeper than they did last year I mean theyre without Nigel pack one of the best scores in the ACC and you wouldnt know it with how theyve come out here well if they maximize possessions their defense Keys a lot of what they do on the open floor they have four guys who averaged better than 13 and a half points per game but what Ive been most impressed with Denise today is this a Florida State team Miami blew out of the water by 20 already once this season its a 4 PM tip its not your normal Prime Time tipoff but theyve been locked in high energy engaged and playing like theres something on the line and there is a conference Championship its the best team of watching in the ACC right now Im with you a team that went to the elite eight last year and youve said many times theyre better this year theyre better this year person out there better this year how theyre connected theyre better this year how they score theyre better this year Music Applause this group has an identity knows exactly who they are and theyve won seven straight in conference conference play is hard to win consistently theyre doing it better than anybody Joseph dribbled through the entire defense before turning it over Applause and Jim laronega when we spoke to him really praised his Scout team his young guys who you dont often see on the court challenging the veterans its made practice is better Leonard Hamilton on the other end has had to deal with the opposite theyve had so many injuries they normally have some of the most competitive practices of anybody in the ACC given how deep they are not the case this year with all the injuries yeah and Florida State without having that depth that has been the trademark of Coach hams success here that that has been a challenge for Florida State so many injuries early on theyre playing catchup all season and its just been a year that theyd like to put in the rear view and they get a little bit more elevated in the effort here standby well Miami as you see one of just five power Conference teams with an unblemished and undefeated home record border states got to get back defensively theres no communication wide open rattles out rebound to Worley but youre not hearing guys talk I got four ones coming theyre just quietly getting back in transition thats a losing effort Mills slips under Walker and gets the bounce Caleb Mills coming off the career high last time out 27 17 of those points at the freethrow line against BC thank you heres omear down the lane through the contact muscles it up and in no call that thats a good matchup for Amir if he could get McLeod to come all the way out there at seven foot four allows him to make McLeod a perimeter Defender thats a losing thats a losing battle Applause its for out of Arkansas state Cleveland the pullup and left it short rebound Walker all right omir again has McLeod on the perimeter picked up his bounce and time to shoot down low omir blocked at The Rim by McLeod the 74 sophomore from Philly Mills transition three no omir battling for the rebound and a foul against Florida State itll be by any ball and I think omir didnt know where he was found himself buried underneath the basket and when he tried to elevate it was too slow developing for McLeod to recover and its 74 thats an easy shot block opportunity for him you know how some teams have a type it has that smaller thickly built forward Florida state has a type I always got a big like something yeah but you know theyve needed a couple of those guys typically is what theyve had in years past that system of you know I remember Trent four saying I played 24 minutes a game and Id be gassed after those 24 minutes because Applause the highway calls oh its too easy you gotta afford to find the paint that Gap was robust that could have gone in slow motion and walk around the Finish green follows his shot and hits all right Music Applause Matthew Cleveland and Harlan Beverly at the scores table Applause look at the spacing five Beyond The Arc Isaiah Wong driving on bottled Miller through traffic through it up followed his miss new 20 its taken away by the knolls Mills over Joseph and the rebound was taken away by Bob Miller after Jordan Miller had it for a moment Robert Miller the high leads out of freshman from my orcas Spain Stripped Away Miami pushing down low Jordan Miller who has been a rock of consistency all season for this Miami team we were talking before the game he might not be first team allconference but he does everything well yeah this group is just the active hands of the deflections I mean 34 points off turnovers enable them to get that win over a very good Wake Forest team they do so much of their offensive work like this you called it Applause even Wong at his size this team has come out here with a purpose this afternoon Music Applause Music Applause let us donations interesting peace let me bring in my expert so many scratches those are from my car keys such a rich history this wont do well at auction but at A T its worth a brand new Samsung Galaxy s23 wait really what about this atts deal is bad everyone Applause Music Applause oh my God Applause Music Applause Music all right okay Applause foreign Applause here Miami has come out like a house on fire the sevens are rolling the aces are coming up its been jackpot for the canes they made 11 of their first 16 shots it was 80 on points off turnovers 2415 for the canes its this simple win today win next Saturday at home against Pitt Miamis your ACC champion and the one seed in Greensboro Miamis been feasting inside the painted area finally a first sign of resistance from Florida State and yet another live ball turnover that leads to a hook on the other side for Jordan Miller for those of you just tuning in here on ESPN2 that saw Alabama beat Arkansas thats three by my count Breakaway dunks for Miami yeah Florida state is just gifting what is the most efficient scoring team in the ACC run out after runout meanwhile Darren Green hits the three his second triple Florida state cuts it to eight 2618 second meeting of the Season between these two teams last month in Tallahassee Miami scored 54 points in the first half lights out they ended up winning by 23 Jordan Miller from the outside way off and the rebound to Florida State and Deontay green at this point about Miami Im not taking anything beyond the arc obviously capable there but theyre owning the inside meanwhile Baba Miller has six three on his 19th attempt and Florida State here in the last couple of minutes has closed this deficit all the way to five Miamis largest lead was a dozen thats 611 Baba Miller and thats why the NBA Scouts are out here to watch him and alluring Prospect very high ceiling Applause Harlan Beverly lines up a three doesnt go and the rebound to green and with this smallish Miami Lineup Im making Boba Miller work outside to defend fatigue will play a factor and just not comfortable necessarily moving through screens guarding his perimeter Defender Chandler Jackson driving through traffic and it comes to Wagga Poplar Miami at home this season a perfect 150 Music Walker Music Applause Music Applause nearly another live ball turnover Miamis trying to get in those passing lanes and for good reason with the success theyve had foul is called five steals already for Miami in the first half average seven a game in conference they thought that was a clean pick of the pocket from Beverly look if Im Florida State on the catch strong with the basketball if I dont have anything remove it move it move it and then try and explore a gap operator Applause Music Matthew Cleveland hes got two fouls for Florida State he was coming back on the court now heads to the bench his first game back after missing the last two with back spasms a notable absence for Miami Nigel pack their starting point guard in this Miami seven game win streak back had been playing his best ball as a hurricane 18 points per game 45 from three so Bensley Joseph got the start of point guard for Miami really those last four games since the Louisville win I mean he has taken off on a rocket ship being efficient going for 20 plus night after night pair that with Isaiah Wong and good luck with the other weapons on this team and stopping them meanwhile Florida state has clawed back as Jalen Worley brings the deficit back to within five Applause they get a Christian Watson sighting freshman wearing three for Miami just his 10th game of the season Applause Music Miller inside the basket counts George Miller is so good he is one of the most undervalued players not just in this conference in college basketball he can do so much you can also put it on a deck Spin to Win through traffic and one opportunity on the other side Music third sellout this month for Miami anticipation growing and building around this program at eastrop Jordan cornette the way this game started boy Miami looked like a team playing for an ACC Championship to Florida States credit they battled back after an awful start Florida state was just gifting the basketball to Miami and Miami was taking that thing with runouts going the other way getting easy ones Florida State minus one miscue was settled into taking care of the basketball theyve moved it a little bit Darren Green has got a couple of his looks from three and the Sharpshooters provided for them and theyve had a little bit more resistance defending in the paint which has brought them back can they maintain that stand by War lead to Mills off the shot fake working on Isaiah Wong didnt get much on the shot he wanted a foul now Bill dont worry about that hes got to get back defensively and Gordon omear drops it off to Beverly for the easy two theres no sense of urgency again in that sequence when Florida state had started doing a better job they resorted back to lagging on their way back might even is going to beat him down the floor if thats the case Green from the Baseline and Miller there for the rebound he does everything Da Vinci and high tops for Miami the lob to omear offline and omir able to track it down North Shadowmere the first Nicaraguan to earn a division one basketball scholarship Miller the turnaround using the height advantage on house Miami plays with great space so usually on those plays for Miller Thats isolation just couldnt win the oneonone green sets and misfires watch Miamis gonna go oh theyre actually going to sit sit on this one when its been a half court game Florida state has found a success its just the challenge of making it that half court game some bad misses have keyed some now as well for the canes and their opportunities to run is that what you want not when its coming as easily as it has for Miami thats that settlement of the highest form this launches rebound omir how long and thats a kickball it stays with Miami that in many ways a break for Florida State a bad shot the same as a turnover we see it all the time absolutely and the thing about Miami personnel Five Guys that could all change is theyre five highlevel athletes more Shadow Mirror six seven but he moves like hes 62 up and down the floor so Personnel on the other side with Florida State needs to understand when that thing goes its a Sprint to get back and pretend thank you Music Joseph making a second start of the Season today now its Wong nearly lost it defended by Mills Applause shot clock down to three Beverly launches and connects its a good defensive effort I mean Worley and six six had a hand of the face of Beverly youll live with those mates theres Baba Miller tipped up by McCloud into the Embrace of omir the other way Joseph running ahead of the pack plus one how about the outlet oh were on the rebound division before the catch he almost knew Ive got a leak out opportunity and he gets it out to Bentley Joseph look his eyes were up right away that is an elite Outlet pass to key the fish for Joseph in the open Lane underrated part of omirs game his passing I mean thats huge as Biggs youre taught rebounding basketball the really good ones are going to rebound and get greedy its like a DN coming off the edge so one thing to get the sack its another thing to get your hand on that football and that was a rebound that became a scoring opportunity because Amir said Im gonna do one more past the job get that thing out with some baskets Florida State cut it to five and then Miami has responded with an 110 run Music lets break points the story of the game Music Applause now Bob Miller its not really part of his game to play back to the basket despite his 611 size advantage thats where youd like to see his game grow to really create that matchup nightmare that he can be at 6 11 hes going to get his shot off but he needs to be able to take those guys especially as small as Kanes lineup down low and punish him and thats just quite not in the bag yet for the youngster with the high seal Florida State hoping he comes back next year NBA Scouts tantalized by his potential Miller beats the shot clock but its an air ball so it is a shot clock violation this has been a tough season for Florida State theyve had injuries missing pieces they lost guys in the off season who they thought were coming back but Leonard Hamilton will go into the transfer portal to supplement the guys that are here and if the players who we think should come back come back Florida State should get back to being what were accustomed to seeing next season I think coach ham surveyed the landscape of what this ecosystem of college basketball is right now and said okay this is the adjustment we need to make and hes going to go ahead and make it next season and theyll be relevant once more look they were dealt a tough deal with injuries of personnel and the way they like to play they want to press you shorten the shot clock challenge you to take a tough ones with the clock being short and play really hard in sports play 10 guys and overwhelm you that has not been the system theyve been able to play this year and theyve been exposed Applause this game having lost four in a row seven of eight and the only win in that span against Louisville who sits near the bottom of the ACC and omear now hes just rubbing it in knocking down a threepointer the sixth three of his career the fifth of the season this was a game a few minutes ago thats the ability to score in bunches that Miami presents and theres green putting an end to a 140 Miami run offense seems to be so effortless for Miami Times they just they have so many guys so many guys that can do so many different things I mean every guys that can score at multiple levels Music Joseph for three front rim tracks down the loose ball Music Applause Chandler Jackson ran into resistance now its Mills theres three not there Joseph amongst the trees I mean Mills is a sub 30 threepoint shooter thats what you want him to do popularly Up and Under no call see if Florida State pushes Poplar gets back Applause green near turnover Wong went for the Steal rushed the shot Joseph the outlet the other way Poplar the twohanded plush that sums up the entire first half look when that shot goes up you now have a couple of these Miami guys that are just leaking out Florida States not an elite rebounded team not the ones were used to and theyre being opportunistic Florida States not adjusting getting back Poplar knocks it away its Walker on the breakout Throwdown City Music and 182 run for and hes sitting here with me Ive been high on this Miami Team all season long um just been the Personnel they have the bench some contributions buying the rolls from guys whose minutes have dwindled from year to year this group is connected on all fronts best team in the ACC and can get to a final four that kind of good yeah its funny I thought the ACC was down and nobody was good as green misses a three and say what you want about the opponent Florida state has not had a great season this Miami team even the games they have lost with the exception of that Maryland game and nonconference they have been in every game theyre perfect at home and as time Korean said theyre beating in so many different ways yeah and he makes a good point when you bring in a guy like Poplar thats just another weapon for this group offensively how about Bentley Joseph whos offering one up there for three and gets it to go hes your best perimeter Defender hes a facilitator and hes also a very capable score theres an embarrassment of riches now the vulnerability with this group would be their ability to defensive rebound but again their style of play can still combat that inability at times because they do other things so exceptionally well like take the basketball away Miller with Miller trailing and the foul on Baba Miller Jordan Miller down near the camera folks Ill tell you I cant say this enough if Im drafting a team in the ACC theres a lot of stars youre going to grab first I get it you got you got Burton youve got Wong youve got turkuevion youve got charcoal Joyner this goes on and on early on in my picks give me Jordan Miller because this guy does a whole lot of a whole lot for your team and any gaps of vulnerabilities with the squad he covers up a lot of those I love this young mans game he doesnt just cook the meals he buys the groceries puts the Reps to be together he cleans up after hey sounds like me as a husband in the Coronet house yeah stop lying Virginia North Carolina 6 pm Eastern today UNC barely survived against Notre Dame this is a must win for a UNC Team without a quad one win yeah I mean this is the the definite quad one in front of him Duke could present them as another one but Carolina with the challenging circumstance in front of a much like me broadcasting here with you as you take shots at me they have to deliver they have to today you know you were going to catch a couple of strings Chandler Jackson knocks down the three thats the Freshman from Memphis careerhigh 10 points last time out that was a week ago against BC Applause 5028 Miami in the two games against Florida state has scored at least 50 points in the first half both times just think about this then youre at 50 right now and youre shooting 64 to the field 56 from three its because of the shots theyve been afforded in this game and theyve earned them no question these are run outs these are layups these are open threepoint looks those are uncanny numbers 10 points for Jordan Miller whos now scored in double figures and 23 straight this was much like look the Wake Forest game he scored 96 you shoot 60 from the field Jackson with another three and you go back to that first game in Tallahassee you didnt think Miami would be able to top that first half the first 20 minutes last month in tally 54 points 61 percent from the field today 52 points 65 from the field still 18 seconds to go Music a 21 point lead for Miami and to be frank this was not close for very long Miami got off to a great start Florida State at one point got to within five and then Miami exploded on a big run and thats the story of this first step it just never has felt like the Knolls have really been in this game yeah you just got to get to the half and at the half you got to pull the fire alarm or something is this your game where as a coach youre thinking do I get tossed in the second half coach Sams not that kind of guy look this is the tale of two seasons Florida States not that group right now and Miami is one of the best teams in the nation Applause and this is what you get a first half by number 13 Miami 54 points in the first half for the second time this season against Florida State the canes over the finals 74 54 points on 66 shooting Florida state has to adjust they got to take care of the basketball they gotta get back they got to try to develop somewhat of a Rhythm by allowing themselves multiple possessions consistently without giveaways and you brought up a great point in the first half they got to talk for him yeah I mean you can tell its a group thats done a lot of losing this year and its worn on him but you still gotta go out there and play a surprise here in this second half Al Miller 15 on the back door cut he leads all scores 15 assists on 24 field goals for Miami cream Miami is a team playing with Hunger theyve been making the extra pass Jalen Worley their best perimeter defender on his hip played through the contact got there before Wong and help side could get there to potentially alter the shot and attack them good to see for Morely in that sequence Florida State today getting Matthew Cleveland back after missing two games with a back injury hes the teams leading scorer Caleb Mills has a wrap around his right leg he was getting that iced up during shoot around to McGovern and what see what Corin does here on the pick and roll defense shows doesnt need to recover to Walker a good contest in Florida State rebounds good sequence defensively from the Knowles Cleveland backs up with Miller pressing Applause Worley thought about the three hesitated nearly traveled he did travel he got away with that one and Cleveland Cashes in that is eight straight baskets for Florida State it is a 131 run and then back into this game The Freshman corn has done a fantastic job of just playing his role running the floor hanging around loitering around that rim and good things have happened Florida States generated a couple turnovers which has got them playing fast and not having to operate in the half court because of that theyre back in this ball game Miami kind of a step back defensively hasnt been doing what has been necessary to protect this lead and here comes Florida State all inside New York eight of nine is Florida state in the second half zero threepoint shot attempts zero turnovers which was an issue in the first half long forced it over Baba Miller didnt hit anything and Florida State with a three can get to within single digits and this is good for Florida State they need to play at a faster Pace because in a half court they just dont have the Personnel to be dangerous UNC big game for both teams later today all those teams you see with the double by our second weekend teams in the NCAA tournament and beyond for all the talk about the conference being down look at those teams that are already slated finals represent the conference sure you dont see UNC and you dont see Duke but you still see dangerous teams in this conference and all the crap that they take right now lets wait and see what happens come March because it always seems to me walking back some of that narrative once we enter the madness Clemson another one a team that led the ACC for a lot of the year the tigers not in jolinardis projected field they got a big win in a big way against NC State earlier in the day Joseph down the lane Florida State imposing its height now its Poplar doesnt get the roll but a foul against Florida State as Jordan Miller went for the rebound its going to be against Green Jordan Miller arguably their best offensive rebounder does a good job of getting in there boxing out on offense to try and get that rebound and that speaks to his Acumen and his ability again Jordan Miller a guy who checks a lot of boxes for the canes Miami has led by as many as 25 in this game Florida state in the midst of a 131 run Jordan Miller threw three Defenders 16 for the red shirt senior just feel boy seems to take the right shot or make the right play understanding to take what the defense gives him and attacks the gap theres Cleveland now Darren Green one of the best threepoint Shooters in the league Jackson The Freshman Deonte green was calling for it Cleveland so good from the midrange yeah big time shot I mean they had green as the dive guy all alone because of the hard show on the pick and roll theyre still able to find good offense Florida States starting to come alive and discover that Rhythm at half court omir ran into an ambush kicks it to the corner turned over another place Florida States been better protecting that paint theyve converged on a basketball but the unforced error prevents them from cutting into the deficit Applause Music Matthew Cleveland is a versatile guy that can only get better and consistently him playing with that catch coming off Pearl screens midrange thats a sweet spot you can be deadly there 11 points for Cleveland nine in the second half Music Wong over Baba Miller those are the long arms of Baba Miller and that 611 frame impacting the shot Wong thought he created space but its 611 with that reach theres no such thing and the layin by Jackson at the other end Miamis now been the team that struggled to get back and defend in transition and Florida State taking a page from the Kanes first half book a 173 run Florida state has that scored in Miami 229 since halftime and the Knowles are 10 out of 12 from the field here in the second half Music Joseph Falling Away and thats what what Joseph elected to do is what Wong should have create that space But then with that second offensive effort drive it make Miller defending Cleveland draws the contact and well get two free throws to foul on Anthony Walker Florida State coming alive starting to play fast and its helped key their offense a little bit fill the lanes get downhill the Florida state not giving up North Carolina right now one of Joe linardis first four out you beat a Virginia team with its net ranking being what it is that puts you in Joe linardis projected field yeah its got to be for a group that struggles to shoot it like Carolina has Beyond The Arc and I wonder if the health of RJ Davis that that finger hes been less efficient but theyve got to find ways to speed it up try and play through Bangkok despite the fact when youre not making shots they back in that pain five ways to be effective inside the ark and its a challenge because they run good stuff but it settles in on shooters who just simply havent been knocking them down this year and thats been challenging for them to stack wins or win it all consistently or down the stretch meanwhile Virginia struggled with late as long releases and hits Virginia had a scare at Louisville they were pushed to the brink by Notre Dame and then ambushed earlier this week by BC yeah Virginias very reliant on a threepoint shot and theyve kind of uh become an inefficient shooting team there theyve needed more from Beekman as Florida State again gets one downhill 11 of 13 are the Knolls in the second half Virginia doesnt have the defense were accustomed to seeing there there are some holes in the Virginia group but yet still theyre a dangerous team because coach Bennett is coach Bennett key hey Clark is that point guard just seems to make so many things right Here Comes Beverly denied at The Rim Chase for the loose ball and they will tag Beverly with his second foul Florida State continues to do a good job protecting their goal converging on the basketball a lot of guys challenging multiple efforts there Florida States taking care of the basketball only one turnover here through the first half of the second half whereas they gave it away 11 times in the first 20 minutes Cleveland thought about the three instead puts it on the floor Maneuvers past Walker and Florida state is within single digits 6859 Applause hard screen set on Walker lack of communication bumps him off the play allows Cleveland that clean look this is the closest its been since the 7 30 Mark of the first half Music I mean defensively Miamis just not done whats necessary or whats up to standard for this group giving up 60 points nearly here with 10 minutes left to play in the second half Florida State 12 of 14 and incredible now deploying the full court press Ive not taken a three here in the second half just trying to attack be the tougher team for 10 minutes here they happen Applause 16 points for Jordan Miller to lead all scorers hes one of four canes in double figures Cleveland has 15 for Florida State one of three Knowles in double figures Applause shot clock down to five Joseph lets it Fly and rims out and a rebound by Cleveland Applause Music foreign puts it on the floor to the ram thats good thats just too easy Harlan Beverly not in a proper stance and the first step allows the blowby and get to the rim and we see that time and time again here in a second now 6861 the answer from Joseph not there Cleveland rips it away on the break against omir no whistle a lot of contact there Cleveland did what he was supposed to take it at the Chet of omear and Leonard Hamilton cant believe no foul was called Beverly has the open three hell set fire rebound to Worley keep pushing it for Florida State keep attacking Cleveland transition dont like it dont like it not with whats been working for Florida state that is giving Miami what they want they want them to settle for that Miamis not been able to stop the drive from Florida State you cant abandon that if youre in the Knowles currently long lost it theres Worley Two on Two Against Beverly its a layup good in Florida state has made this a two possession game keep attacking Florida State now believes and for good reason a two possession game coach larne is going to play through get to the under eight trust Jim larranega has in his team Miami turns it over again grain pushing Mills calling for it Worley wide open jumper front rim rebound to Jordan Miller this is a veteran Miami group Jim larenegger trusts his guys to figure it out on the Fly almost like an NBA coach they got to take care of the basketball a few giveaways here have really hurt them Joseph starting today with Nigel back out omir Strip by Worley heres green pull up three thats good Florida State downed by as many as 25 has cut it to two wow Applause defensively locked in refused to give up anything on that end and its allowed them to speed up and play with the base that has been advantageous to the Knowles and here they are on the doorstep omir Worley give me that getting out on the Run boom from three Korean dead eyes and we got a ball game in Gables Music with one of the best savings rates in America banking with capital Applause Music Ill tell you what guys Miami had a 23point halftime lead and then the Cuban coffee hit for Florida State the Knowles 15 out of 20 from the field in the second half they have cut this to a twopoint game 180 fast breaks Miami had 18 points in that first half Florida state zero Florida States flipped the script 12 fast break points in the second half to Miami zero sailor Falling Away offensive rebound put back and the foul Georgette omear taking MILF money on that sequence Jordan Miller does a quick one from about 15 feet the rip through to get that inside position and Advantage for North Chad omear and to put back second foul on corn ER today 13 points seven rebounds missed the free throw but Miller tracks down with arrow and this is plagued Florida state two and theyre losing the inability to defensive rebound unacceptable off of free throw block him Jim larenaga calls a timeout to salvage The Possession will take a break too 7066 all of a sudden we have a bowl game at Coral Gables switch nation of college basketball brought to you by Wendys two for six dollars the best deal in fast food that last time out by Miami came from the court not the sideline it was Jordan Miller who called it not Jim laronega so Miami right now is out of timeouts with 6 49 to go we know Jim laronega likes to trust his team and in big spots hell let them play through some rolls but if this game stays close and you get into the End Game Boy that could come back to haunt Miami he had a tight game like that you want to have the ability whether theres some turbulence or just you know some confusion you want to have one of those timeouts Miller jumped in early there he didnt need to call that timeout there wasnt a heavy pressure he could have passed out of that played on with 14 seconds on the shot clock so regrettable decision but Miami has a chance to get their puppies in a row and get a good one here and try and build what has become a very narrow narrow lead Miamis largest lead was 25 Florida state has never LED Poplar of the corner three not there Chandler Jackson with the board Florida State pushing make commitment to the basketball there from long but luckily a retreat dribble from Florida State who I thought I had an advantage of the rim once again Mills his pass knocked down Corin saves it green a three fouled on the threepoint shot by Joseph feels like Florida state is playing to win this game and Miamis currently playing to not mess up theres a tentativeness that has become obvious sitting Courtside here from Miami in their body language and how theyre moving whereas Florida state has just been the aggressor absolutely got up under the shooters face there was contact bad decision there from Joseph Greene 89 free throw shooter and Florida State with a chance to close the women one Joseph asking what he did you gotta let the shooter Leia Applause remember with Virginias loss to Boston College on Wednesday Miami is now the team in the drivers seat for the one seed in the ACC tournament all the kings have to do win today beat Pitt at home next Saturday Miamis the one seed pressure bus pipes I mean this is the madness starts in February and trying to tell everybody this is not March comes right about now when you start trying to secure regular season championships and seating Millers swiveling inside and Florida State with a chance to take the lead Mills driving inside and the Knowles lead for the first time today how about it perimeter defense has failed the Kings Florida State can get to the rim Whenever However whatever Here Comes Joseph on the back door Poplar is fouled on the way up its too easy for Florida State Caitlin Mills gets Jordan Miller whos one of their better Defenders but he got him on that hip and Jordan Miller gave up on the play had an angle I thought to maybe alter that shot but pulled up Mills finished it through Florida state is doing every single thing inside the arc only take it two threes one of two from three but the points in the paint they have 36 of them and all of them I feel I can come here in the second half its wild this Florida State team entered the game on a fourgame losing streak they had lost seven of eight the only win in that stretch against Louisville Miami meanwhile one of five power Conference teams that began the day undefeated at home Applause Mills driving on one the Up and Under at Florida State back up by one going right back at Mills turns it over great accelerates wild shot Joseph tracks it Miami has not had anything in transition in the second half green should have played off two was just moving entirely too fast had a great look driving it at the rim and its been layups all day Joseph triple Drive in the paint throws it up and hell shoot two but Mills its just been able to I mean I mean challenge here in these last few sequences these Miami guards and just get to the rim a little bit of a hesitation to stand up to Defender and Isaiah Wong to create the Gap in advantage in driving lane and then he finished Id like to see Caleb Kayla Mills with the ball in his hands a little bit more here down the stretch because his ability to get to the rim Miami shot 65 in the opening half just seven of 21 from the field here in the second half meanwhile Florida State 17 of 23 from the field since halftime Applause Warren over Poplar the basket counts plus the foul and a chance for a threepoint play for the Florida State freshman talk about being the more physical team thats been in control 30 second half points in the paint for the Seminole Horton began this thing if you remember in the second half with the rim runs as the dive guy scored around a basket and here he is again with Florida State adding one to their narrow wing the free throw no good now the joke here at halftime was what are we going to talk about in the second half a ball game yeah Joseph tied up jump ball possession arrow Florida State and again it goes back to the tentativeness Joseph was on his heels the defensive Jacksons looking here to guard I mean excuse me that was Joe something to handle hes just not ready for whats coming his way Florida States applying pressure theyre trying to go take this game right now Miami is allowing a whole heck of a lot Applause yeah Florida state has won four in a row on Miamis home floor thats corn is the dive guy Cleveland against omir Hit the side of the backboard Wong will retreat OMeara needs to get down on the Block and try and make some plays through the post as well Miller against corn got the freshman in the air and gets the two Miller so good in space Music knew that he had the open Lane and ability to operate and converts Miami by one Mills the other way wild layup and a blocking foul is called against the Kings Applause 3 42 to go in regulation and its a ball game Music Caleb Mills at the free throw line after Bensley Joseph just picked up his fourth foul Joseph remains on the floor and Bill is an excellent free throw shooter 84 percent ties the game at 76 no Nigel pack for Miami today so if Joseph were to fall out youre probably looking at Isaiah Wong maybe even Harlan Beverly playing some point and obviously no Nigel Peck didnt think it would matter to this degree but clearly in moments like this his ability to produce baskets he had just that other thread is sorely missed currently a onepoint lead for Florida State they have trailed by as many as 25 Applause Miller puts it on the floor kicks it out Poplar for deep battle for the rebound one by Mills pop Mills I want to see if Walmer Miller has ever got me can keep me in front Mills got Miller in the air draws the contact loves so good at getting to the freethrow line last time out he went to the 21 times in a win against BC or a loss against beast called for him coming across the timeline not because Im smart lets be very clear Im not but Kayla Mills has had a great success attacking his defense and theres been nobody thats been able to provide that resistance for him not to believe he cant get where he wants on the floor Applause first one no good Isaiah Longs family in attendance wondering what probably a lot of the building here our water at the Wasco Center is is this Isaiah long time as we get to the last three minutes weve seen it so many times over the last few seasons here confident performer wants them all in his hands Isaiah Wong in his career one and six against Florida State all time against Cleveland Cleveland gave up nothing there shot clock is six now its Miller a lot of dribbling Miller Lost in Cleveland ahead of the pack traffic throws it down got away with a lot of steps but a great it is this Florida State team the active hands and what theyve been able to do here defensively multiple efforts guarding in isolation turning the water off onto Kings fourpoint lead the largest for Florida State but Wong gets the crowd to its feet you gotta get stops perimeter defense has to elevate themselves here if they want to extend his home winning streak Mills trapped kicks the grain the three no Cleveland offensive rebound new 20 green again raises the rim they rushed the shot when they didnt have to and the Florida state bench in disbelief thats a regrettable decision from Green first one fine youre one of the best Shooters in a conference second one horse run some clock get a good one crowd still standing Wong over Cleveland off the side of the backboard and it comes to Corin less than 90 seconds to go Florida State on the verge of an improbable comeback I go four flat or a high ball screen but wet Mills determined if he can once again get past long corn set the screen Mills kicks to the corner green no good rebound to Miami hes a shot you want its good execution from the Knowles just couldnt convert and remember Miamis Adam to announce they burned their last time out with seven minutes and change to go in this half Miller posting up Worley Miller with the left hand oh near the follow Miami by one Applause timeout Leonard Hamilton Applause 336 left a game that was on the verge of a blowout comes down to the wire Florida State struggles to defensive rebound this one costly I havent been a ton of second chance but this eighth one from Miami their biggest of this ball game a lot of tense fans here hoping the canes can get to 160 and remain perfect at home Applause whats on the line Anish a whole lot of achievement to this point from the canes and their rival Florida State open to play the role of disruptor for Miami theyve won seven in a row they have not lost at home right now its Miami that is in the drivers seat in the ACC if they went out which means a win today and a winning pit next week theyre the one seed in the ACC tournament but a loss here it packs you not just in the ACC ENT but it also impacts your seed line Applause Miami right now a number four seed according to Joe linardi you lose to Florida State it impacts seating as well so a lot at stake for Miami and credit Florida State for not giving up when this game looked to be over now let me tell you something else a niece worth noting if youre a Miami Hurricanes fan you dont want this game to go to overtime why Florida State doesnt lose its 130 in overtime games which is an active NCAA record they do not lose in overtime and I remember Leonard Hamilton earlier this year telling us why that was they had won 13th straight in OT because generally theyre always the deeper team and they always have the pressure legs thats not necessarily the case this year now here I said I like the green three that was the miss it was the right shot its got to be Caleb Mills to make a play here Wong is not sure the ability to stop it Mills has to get to the painted area and try to make them play here 10 second differential between game clock and shot clock Mills got his man in the air throws it up off the window and in Florida State by one they havent stopped final 20 seconds Miami out of timeouts Juan puts it on the floor in the painted area kicks it out and we get a whistle itll be a foul against Florida State now they had a foul to give away the 16 foul I said Mills challenge long long end stop to get in that painted area in the second half thats exactly what they do on the other side Florida state had three defenders in place corn did need a foul there get him right where you wanted it inside no bear blocked comes back to Joseph 10 seconds time to drive out of bounds well stay with Miami 81 seconds to go entire building on its feet Poplar to inbound Miller for three for the lead got it chance Florida State Worley Cleveland for the win its good Matthew Cleveland stuns Miami uh officials at the
