the whistled before the tip there but uh rearranging some guys Bill Covington Jr will throw it up Tony Bia Clarence Armstrong also with us here tonight and Rain Smith tracks it down and the cards have it to begin play Louisville lost three in a row the four losses to all teams right heurn to Javon Hadley misses the first look there got got the tap and James Scott as we see the UTP lineup here Cory camper has played a at a high level the last couple of games for them youve got Devin Barnes and David Terrell these guys really get after it on defense and uh well talk about shooting in a minute as well CU they can shoot it too Larry they do UT shoots as a team 40 from the threepoint line thats top 20 in the nation so its definitely something that the universal mves got to take away today if they want to come out with Victory two two missed shots in there pretty good point blank missed by Kevin kaloo the one thing they dont do is rebound they get out rebounded 342 to 29 on the season so just averaging a little over 29 rebounds a game for the Cardinals its Hadley Smith heurn Scott and Waterman for the second straight game as you see Chucky heurn to James Scott misses that one ball tapped up Hadley with it to rain Smith and he throws it away as he tried to uh got caught in midair there as Barnes goes up for the layup yeah got got caught in midair there just indecisive turned it over Barnes with the two and UTEP up two to nothing here early on the cards looking for something offensively Hadley is double team over to Waterman no Waterman good close out there from the UTEP defense and another takeaway for UT David Terell going in and uh Chucky heers going to be called for for the first foul Now call Lous got to be sharp with those interior passes UTEP getting hand on the ball there as R Smith got caught in air and Bon Baker going in for easy Applause two crowd moaning over the replay missed shot there for Terrell Waterman with the rebound Sal louville two turnovers already the team that forces the most in the nation and Waterman with a three Off the Mark Hadley with it back out to heurn and Chucky tries to work down he does underneath the James Scott for the dun good job its one thing you got to use against UTEP if uteps playing the passing Lanes being aggressive use their aggressiveness against them James Scott Now 26 of 30 on the season doesnt miss many of those and he gets a lot of dunks nice save there from Terell as they get a kooo on Scott Smith helps out f with the jump hook up and in he averages 5 and a half points per game thats a uh twopointer that puts UTF ahead four to2 here early on so good sign for UTF to get points from Kevin k early get him involved into the game thats a good sign for Louisville a corner three ball from Noah Waterman 10 of 43 from three hes got to shoot the ball back for this team its a great sign if youre pack he you want to get nor Waterman going early need guys to step up especially since youre down youre short and rotation you lost some of your key glasses hes one of the people that has to step up to help these M cards get to where they want to be good defense by Scott heurn comes away with it heurn off to Smith and oh that ball was to Hadley and he was open and Scott tipped it away and the camper run out layup its 6 to5 UT Waterman into the basket Noah Watermans got five early on neither one of these teams are slowing it down they are not and Larry you talk about the forc turnovers 2025 in eight through eight games is ridiculous but when you break it down 113 in the first half and nine in the second half so theyre consistent with their defense throughout the entire game they are thats a sign of conditioning and thats a team that really just likes to get out transition and puts that hard on defensively to try to get out to get easy buckets speaking of hard hat defensively theres the stalwart for Louisville heurn getting the steel hes got it looking for Scott underneath he hits Hadley in the corner theyve got couple guys coming at the ball very aggressive you see the double team there Scott Chucky for three misses it gets his own rebound to Scott Waterman another three he missed Hatley there for the rebound and Javon Hatley puts it back W looking like theyre starting to take their time against this pressure able to be patient the key to it his ball fing anytime you get a lot of press you ball fake and use the defenses aggressive aggressiveness against them Terell with a bucket there so all four different starters have scored for utap its 9 to8 James Scott with a three misses that one we had talked about his 26 of 30 hes now 0 for two from Applause three Barnes misses the three Frasier right there he lines it up he misses the three and Scott gets the rebound Chucky with it for Louisville Waterman drives and he is dishing off to Hadley uh when he is fouled as the cards up 98 here early on over UT Music all right back here at the KFC Young Center early on Louisville already three turnovers 9 to8 the cards do lead here and Jody dimling Larry oon here Larry uh as we look Joe golden does a great job four years here 58 and 50 uh and and again they let Nation last year in uh in both categories Force turnovers and Steals and they do it again here this year do a great job of just flying around to the ball just creating chaos as I like to call it when youre out here playing youre playing you just in a constant scramble trying to get DEF flexions just giving yourself a chance to get out on the fast break and get some easy points as we see here looking at changes for both uh teams here for the cards Terrence Edwards is in KY is in Kai is uh had his best game on Sunday against Duke Ahmad bam is in the J AllAmerican from last year hes number 12 Larry averages 121 points per game hes only averaging 20 minutes a game but he leads the nation in threepoint shooting at 633 that is amazing he shoots a better threepoint percentage than he does from his foul line he shoots 61 from the foul line so somebody that L has got to be be aware of can let him get the tempt up Chucky almost taking it there but instead gets it inside the Scott back to Chucky hebburn triy to force that one and bham comes away with it so four turnovers here early on for the Cardinals as they cling to a onepoint lead Terell thats also Derek Hamilton in and a steal James Scott and he is fouled he is fouled by Elijah Jones who just came in Derrik Hamilton and uh Jones coming in there you see it under Joe Golding and uh lar its super impressive I mean the nine and the nine game is is good the 74 is just fine but youre talking 114 and 121 I mean thats 11 extra possessions that you give yourself each game and when you shoot the ball like they shoot it from three and 40 being one of the top shooting teams in the country you know youre going to put yourself in a lot of positions to be successful when you can combine turning teams over and shooting the ball well Scott misses it but Ruth with the uh the and he what we going to call offensive foul on Kai Ru so they call him with a little bit of a hook there I think Pat Kelce first season at Louisville five and one to start theyve lost three in a row need to have some tough breaks right you lose three of your top seven players lost Music Kadir weve got uh Terell with it on with heon on him Frank Anam eBay so I was looking I was like hold on theres something different out there for Louisville Frank hasnt played for a couple games and kind of comes out and helps and kooo with an easy bucket yeah Frank got caught on the ball a little too long hes supposed to help and get back coach Kel getting on him hurn to Roose really got to take care of it here and for Louisville Chucky uh with a couple of turnovers already Louisville with five already in the game purn jump shot misses it Waterman and eBay fighting for it Waterman misses it rebound by camper so two Louisville guys going after it pretty hard but Waterman just missed the foot back yeah hes just got to go up strong and finish that R Smith and Javon Hadley going to get back in here at the next break theres bham oh my goodness a three for bam 63 Pat Kelce wanted his leg uh wanted to call the leg kick out there but man that was a tough shot it was knocking down to three showing you why hes leading the nation at 63 from shooting shooting three Waterman over to Edwards and he gets to Roose and theyre going to call foul there on David Terrell the uh for the miners his first team second team third of the game so Hadley and Smith come back in heurn and Waterman come out yous the defensive pressure is really making Louisville uncomfortable kind of taking the out of their Rhythm a little bit just need to slow down ball fake be strong with the ball make you make your pass crisp you pretty much know every time youre going to have two guys there is a nice pass andam eBay to Edwards underneath for the bucket good patience there by ter ball faking putting it in for a Applause layup you know youre going to have two guys there you just have to be patient right Larry with as far as when youre on offense for L it is when you have aggressive teams you have to use their aggressiveness against him ball fake ball fake on passes ball fake on shots let him go by like Terence did down there and Ne that was a weird one there as you see that ball goes up and oh yeah that was tip B him is the one that tipped Applause it yeah B him tipped it there and it should be yeah it looked like he got that wrong Manis and I dont think it hit did it hit the back thought it hit the backboard and not the the rim billingtons going to go look at it I couldnt tell from our angle there it hits it it it was close to it but it definitely hit off of bham and uh the two Louisville guys looking at it yep they it did hit the it hit the rim so 20 seconds he looked to see that but he didnt look to see he went off of last yeah definitely did hit the rim B him misses the twopointer the put back for Hamilton so 13 12 now 15 to 12 here Edwards fake down the lane up and in for Terence Edwards a little awkward but it got and they got the bucket as long as it goes in as long as it goes in L got to do a good job of boxing out Derrik Hamilton hes one he has more offensive rebounds than defensive rebounds on the year so big ke for little to make sure they put a body on him when the shot goes up another bucket easy at The Rim it looks like for Barnes so Louisville defensively and Edwards is fouled as Louisville Trails here 1714 early they already got five turnovers on the night outside of that you know its not many guys that could really create shots for themselves so losing Corin and losing Cas was huge blow but just more opportunity for the guys that are playing now to step up and you know do a little bit more to help F that role with uh the void thats coring and case left so they just got a band together you saw R Smith very patient on that one and he faked and then got the threepointer Louisville double keep in there you got bam up for three he missed one hey stop the presses there bam 64 from three he did miss that one but lville fouled on Scott his first 13 foul and you see the fake rank Smith I mean ranks top 20 naturally and Three Points makes per game just doing what he does taking his time using the ball fake and knocking it down UTEP shooting 40 top 20 in the the nation louville top 20 in the nation as well threepoint attempts the shoot 26 got to find that balance though some nights you knocking it down and some nights youre not you got to find creative ways of putting it in the basket when youre not able to put it in from the threepoint line every night Hilton makes one of two Waterman a three for Louisville Off the Mark but theyre going to call foul now and Waterman also looked like he twisted like his ankle or knee and he is going to get three free throws good to see him walk it off you that is the last thing you want to see is more injuries already kind of been devastated with a couple of injuries this year you just want to see him walk it off and Music keep playing Waterman just three of 11 from the free throw line and Larry what I I dont I dont I cant figure it out I I it looks his free throw looks fine as we see the uh as we see the replay there and oh he just came down he stepped on his came down on his foot his free throw looks good but it just doesnt go in hes now 3 for 13 on the season oh you know sometimes you just got to you got to block it out man you got to go up there and like I said just shoot the ball sometimes its its more in between the ears than whats going on with the with the shot so he makes one of three and its now tied at 18 loville with five turnovers team that forces 20 a game Terell with hat on him Hamilton working inside steal by Waterman and hes fouled there so Waterman fouled by Frasier thats the second un Frasier the fifth team foul L does a great job when they play through the high post with the big catching the ball allows them to have a lot of movement and with against a team like UTEP thats very aggressive it allows you to cut you can get a few back doors and they have really good pass especially with James Scott how about hler just going right to the basket Chucky with the bucket that always helps too yeah times you can get in there and shoot a high percentage shot Chucky up guarded Terell CH really getting after the ball Edwards the screen from kooo Edwards and Scott kind of ran into each other left a wide open Terell in the corner but he doesnt make it Louisville on the Run Edwards with it Edwards the step back three misses Waterman and its going to be a foul on Noah Waterman thats his first foul the fourth team foul for Louisville Chucky when Chucky takes it to the basket its usually pretty successful it does hes getting in and now hes got his eyes on the rim early in the year he would do that hed be kind of look to look kick out now hes kind of driving the score and once you know they take away the the shot hes able to distribute now but does a great job of just getting in there and just being aggressive and getting to the basket Chucky with some pressure Devin bar back Applause Music in Scott almost with the steel and uh Pat Kelce that pass was to Pat Kelce over there on the sideline and thats a good thing for Lille because coach Kels out of Eligibility I think his eligibility is out so Barnes with the turnover thats the fourth turnover from UTEP Louisville with five been stuck on that five for a little bit Larry thats a good sign I think I just jinxed it but no Chucky trying to go behind his back it goes out of bounds got to keep it simple uteps pretty good with their hands good at creating deflections got to keep it simple Edwards Scott back to Edwards Edwards a little more patient tonight than what weve seen rain Smith for three misses that BL with the Music rebound Kai Roose going to come back in at the next dead Applause ball ARS out to camper camper averaging 129 points a game their leading score this is that hes been playing at a at a high level the last couple of games for them rain Smith with it for Louisville Smith to Chucky Music Applause Scott with it to Chucky hurn again Scott looking they were looking for Scott to get it to Edwards Edwards to hurn oh three for Chucky hes got five that was a great possession for L had a few dhos going in there you were able to get the defense moving drivve and kick penetrations extra pass knocked down for a wide open shot great possession there Barnes to camper Campers only hes got two he is their leading scorer its only taking two shots Horton in Horton a threepointer Off the Mark Padley with it Padley comes down the court to heurn Chucky likes his matchup goes to the basket but uh kind of comes back around now as got a man wide open Hadley under the bucket its good pass its good move good cut without the ball by Javon the miners take chances we weve talked about it all the steals all the turnovers and Chucky heurn drew them to him and that created that easy bucket he was patient he was dribbling the ball around kind of circling waiting for somebody to get open caught UT napping with Theon wide open lamp under the basket kooo missed that one Chucky with it to Hadley Hadley taking it to the rack Hadley strung up Miss is it kooo with the rebound and thats going to be the second foul on urn its not what you want if youre louville but hey hes doing it well 80 run for Louisville right now 11 to1 over the last 5 minutes the Cs lead 25 Music Applause 18 25 to 18 Chucky heer a big part of that tonight hes already got five points hes got three assists hes got a steal hes got a couple of rebounds and Larry when you look at his career comparison hes a hes being asked to do something totally different this year than he had been at Wisconsin but you look at the numbers and its just a consistency I think its just allowed Chucky to really blossom into more the player than he you know already was right you know when hes at Wisconsin he was in more of a defensive role to setting up and kind of deferring to other guys here hes allowed to Blossom a little bit more offensively he still has that you know all conference defensive mentality so its been a pleasure to really watch him Blossom and really become into the player that hes that he is for the Cardinals right before he went to that last break he did get called for his second foul so the cards hes the one guy you can ill afford to have sitting on the bench my goodness and that is a guy you cannot afford to let get going Ahad bham pulls the string from the corner and then lets the Louisville bench know about it man he can shoot it naus Applause Hadley B him now two for three tonight Roost the Waterman he lines it up and misses it Hadley Terrence Edwards misses it Tapped Out Loval Taps it again but UT comes away with it Sal getting good looks the cards just three of 12 from the threepoint line tamper takes it to the bucket on Roose and a five quick points there for UT no racing back down great job they need to do more of that its l has an interesting lineup not not many creators on the ball floor right now so really going to rely on a lot of cutting and moving last possession you saw Kai kind of get in the paint drawing drawing kick for for players so really interesting to see what kind of sets and offensive movement they come up with with this lineup BM is now 21 of 32 from threepoint range on the season and Waterman misses another free throw hes one for four tonight and four for 15 on the season you just got to watch it go through the net and build his confidence thats it you just got to build his confidence watch it go in and just repeat that over and Music over yeah when you miss a few it can get into your mind right yes it is definitely between the ears you up with it down three B him I want find him inside the threepoint line and find Pat Kelce camper missed it Frasier with the rebound and the put back nice finish B to the basket athletic Up and Under hes had Otis Fraser thats his first bucket hes had double figures in six of their eight games Hadley caught the corner over there rain Smith Scott over to Kai ruse three misses cards three of 13 now from three lble without hurn right now whos got two fouls sitting on the bench since the under eight Timeout on rain Smith his first thats his first a six foul foring David Terrell picking up the foul there last years freshman of the year in Conference USA looking to take his game to another level this year 6 and A2 points two rebounds so far find him again another three and thats going to be a technical foul because Tony Padilla saw him as he got in Pat Kelce he said something to Pat Kelce as he went down on the floor hes got pet fired up over there yeah he did Im not sure what he said foul number 12 V thats his thir personal Applause 18 Golding doesnt like it as we see here he hits the three turn around and says something right to Pat Kelce Bill Covington Let It Go but Tony Padilla from the opposite side did not Edwards hits the first yeah and thats just one where you got to play you know hes excited hes gotten off to a good start hes hes made some threes and hes feeling good but you still still got to stay within the game you dont you dont want to do anything to cost your team like getting a tech and giving Louisville opportuni to score at the foul line Terence Edwards hits both of them Louisville missed their last four field goals put heurn back in yeah the offense just doesnt run the same without Chucky out there it doesnt I mean hes really the only two point guard left on the team so its only natural that it it flows better when hes on the Applause court thats going to be a turnover there for the cards and Kay ruse did a good job of uh he did a great job of can I did of of keeping it alive there but then he just turned it over yeah he just got to have better spacing just be patient and just execute the pass I think he just anticipated Terence being in one spot and Terren was someplace else and just turned the ball Applause over Carol the Applause camper missed by uh UTEP saved by Edwards good Hustle by Terrence Edwards fat with Applause it Hadley guards have missed five straight field goals Hatley with bam on him to Edwards Hes going to be fouled by Terrell bam has got three threes hes got you back in it were tied at 28 Music Larry hes not getting much room but he can make it man for the season those are some Larry O numbers arent they I dont even know if Larry O was shooting a de clip man that is that is impressive man that is and I mean in difficult shots too not like hes just catching and shooting like hes shooting off the dribble and off the bounce those are some tough makes Edwards misses the free throw the front end of the bonus uteps only got two assists today you know they have one of the highest assist percentages on made field goals in the country they assist on 56 of their field goals and they only have two field goals for this game so thats something to keep an eye on as we go into closing the half and into the second half it has been a lot of oneonone stuff that theyve gotten because a lot of a lot of it coming on offensive rebounds yes Bruce turns turns right into it and thats what youre going to learn there Chucky cannot foul bar and Barnes with the bucket Chucky has two fouls that would have been devastating for Louisville right there yeah hes got to stay away from Applause that Waterman Scott theres Kai to the basket The Freshman misses its his own rebound out to Edwards an open three he misses it Lille three of 15 now from three two of their last 10 from the field out of bounds basketball bars just misses that one out of bounds off of his uh chest as we see the replay here Otis Frasier all defensive team from conference last season catching Kay Ru on the spin move and surprising with the still creating easy opport for UT to get into the fast break situation thats the under eight Music Louisville had the lead on this UTEP Team 25 to 18 a couple of Threes by bam and the cards have just gone cold two of their last 11 they havent scored for 2 minutes and 30 seconds thats going to be off of r rain Applause Smith EMP just being more aggressive to the ball more aggressive and usually the aggressor gets the calls gets the whistles the more that was a pretty I just saw a replay on the big screen looked pretty clean off of UTEP but again the referee with a bad angle cuz there was there was no referee behind it here we were the ones behind it and Louisville just not strong with theyve got eight turnovers so far Chucky to the basket Applause misses so heres uh you see there theyre just stronger theyre just stronger Deon Barnes playing to pass a lane you know got gave rain a little bump there but you know you got to be a to create separation to get yourself open and get the pass so hes know Rs got to step in and be a little stronger make himself available for the pass Chucky 35 of 42 on the season from the line makes the first one Moville six of 11 from the line and three of 15 from threepoint Applause range theyre going to get Chucky out for the last 145 with those two fouls KJ Thomas in for UT for the first time number one The Freshman from Amarillo Applause Texas game tied Anam eBay Thomas the Miss D kud went up for it and Hadley just got a little piece of it Waterman misses the three and Lille struggling from outside struggling from the field they are they are and you know at some point you got to continue to put pressure on the paint youve got to get inside get some easy buckets and hopefully that the Rhythm comes back to where you can start making threes but you got to find other ways to put the ball in the basket besides just relying on the three sometimes when youre not making them you mentioned early on the passing lanes and being patient as Barnes at the shot clock as it was winding down and Barnes with the Hail Mary almost there big time shot there Ws going to call timeout with 34 seconds left here in the half Utah up 3330 Music Music Music well Devin bars has nine including a three just before we went to that break as you see it here but shot clock running winding down and e Bay extended and uh right at the buzzer goes through the bucket gives them a 3330 lead for the miners Louisville two of their last 12 they havent had a field goal in almost seven minutes and theyve missed eight straight its just been nothing but a struggle for Louisville offensively it is uh Id like to see Louisville go back to the high post action it just kind of creates more movement allows them to maybe get some back cuts to get some layups opportunities to get points in the paint CU right now struggling from three so just got to get creative and find new ways and trying to put these guys in the best position to score the basketball L waits as Chucky goes with 10 seconds to go L going to run something here out of the timeout heurn with it on the Baseline tries to get it to water man and the foul is going to be on collo thats his first foul and uh loville actually kind of bailed out here really it was because Chucky ran out of real estate there ref called a foul bail him out cuz it was was heading into a turnover Ard makes the Applause first hes got a eight and he makes the second Scot Scott back in he replaces Chucky 11 seconds left here in the first half Thomas with it quickly down the court Jones three BR Smith almost made that one so Elijah Jones they got to find different ways and get easier baskets well three of 16 from three you saw that they have it scored in 718 and its a quick early offensive foul Frasers third foul picked up 7 seconds into the second half he only has two two points the average is 136 and has scored in double figures in six of their eight Applause games that buron to Hadley underneath and a great idea kind of stabbed away there by uh that camper in the game there so good idea from Chucky it was it looked open and camper closed that quickly and bounds to Waterman theres a foul on Terell his third speaking of camper hes him and Chucky hurn are both top 10 in the country in steals camper at 29 steals a game Chucky at 32 steals a game so gets his hand on a lot of lot of passes R Smith Scott with the footb James Scott flying Above the Rim woo he was way up there by the way the foul was on Barnes they actually pointed at Terell but they called it on Barnes so two on Barnes and two on Terell two early fouls here for Music UT camper backs Hadley down Scott with the rebound James Scott with a put back dunk and a quick rebound here to start the second half maybe hes that guy that gives the cards a part Waterman misses a three and Louisville continues to struggle from threepoint range now three of 18 Terell to the bucket getting Music downhill ring Smith Hatley Waterman he instead of the three he drives Hadley has it almost taken away and he does walk turnover number nine for Louisville UT up 3834 here Noah made a great ball fake in the corner but when he goes into the paint hes got a think aggressive mindset and scor the Applause basketballs purn harassing harassing Terell Applause Frasier drives on Scott and a tough bucket and hes going to get the foul noce Fraser their leading score looking to get himself going in this second half catches a match up he likes and gets the one opportunity against James Scott actually called the foul on Waterman but Scott there but they give it to Waterman thats his his second foul think they might have caught Noah Waterman on the reach him this is the free throw a sixpoint lead its the largest lead of the game for the miners of Applause UT Chucky into the lane hes going up for the shot he gets two free throws as they call the Applause foul wasnt a lot of movement on that possession was kind of Chunk he just kind of determined that he was going to play oneonone and that foul was called on Frasier theyre 136 points per game he now has four fouls with 1751 left its a big loss going to the bench for utap looks like Elijah Jon is waving him off it looks like theyre going to look so after theyve already shot a free throw here and were going to look at the foul Clarence Armstrong you see there theou last number five Terell thats his third all right so Terell has three Frasier with three Frasier with three so were all confused here the officials to begin this half its the second time if youre Joe golden youre happy about that because your best player just went from four fouls to three fouls so hes able to St here on the floor for you yeah he had a sub at the at the table already and he helped him up and said go sit back down Young fella I think Im going to keep my best player out there Applause 40 36 Bs got a dig in and get some stops and try to find a way to get some deflections get some Steals and get out in the fast break and get some easy layups not a ton of deflections tonight youre right and that for this loal team camper the three he makes it Cory camper just six of 22 on threes this year he hits one to put them up 40 3 36 the miners with their largest lead of the night EP is feeling good they feeling like they can come here compete and walk away with the victory thats how theyre playing Waterman misses it Scott with the rebound R Smith with the three he misses it its going to be a foul on the rebound its going to be a foul on camper is second the fourth team foul here and Larry Waterman comes out hes one of seven from three and two of five from the free throw line hes just struggling tonight he is hes just you know got to find his confidence got to get himself some easy ones to get himself going just cant hang out on the threepoint line got to find other ways to put the ball in the basket that ball blocked at The Rim it will be Louisvilles Ball but Chucky looked like he had easy layup and and kooo blocked it at the r think Chucky was going in to try to get a little twohand stuff and Kevin kooo able to get his hands on and block it h it in the rim so thats a jump ball it is lilles possession to Hadley he works Hadley with the turnaround Hadley hes going to have to continue to score for this glal team when theyre in a night like this when theyre struggling so much hes a guy that can do it from a number of different levels he is made a great move there took his time Edwards comes away with it it was the deflection Edwards in for the bucket the easy layup for Terrence Edwards so four quick points for Louisville and Pat Kelce urging the crowd on just in time what we talked about jod getting the flexions getting out on The Fast Break getting some easy points getting the crowd into it in the corner that ball is missed by Barnes Hada comes down with it looking for help he gets it off the Smith Edwards more patient tonight than weve seen from him I think on offense thats been an emphasis I was at practice yesterday and you listen to coach Kelsey talked to him and just telling him hes got to slow down a little bit just be patient and keep the game simple F Edward number three and Louisville has tied it big time shot thats what Louisville needs they Lou they need Terence Edward to step up and be that offensive spark for especially on a night like tonight when theyre struggling crowds getting into it its a 70 Run for the cards and its started on Applause defense inside kooo has it taken away rain Smith comes away with it for Louisville the cards on a 70 run Smith to Scott and he has it taken away got caught where he Music couldnt its going to be a block on rain Smith as the Cardinals on a 70 run set it looks like his feet were set there like you said you dont have to take it on the chest anymore long as the defender set make contact and you fall thought he might have got that call but like you said its a bang bang play 5050 chance referee call it the block you got to deal with the car and move on to the next play they replayed it here in the arena and Coach Kel coach Kelsey was looking at it when when they did it and of course that is what sparked him being like okay thats not a great call yeah of course if its not in your favor youre definitely not going to like it camper with the free throw hes got eight tonight he averages 129 a game make it nine two point that was a 70 run a quick 70 run from Louisville started with defense defense in patience on Applause offense that b they just seem lar they its like theres seven blue jerseys out there at times cuz its like okay somebody has to be open but theyre flying around and theirs hands everywhere just do a really good job defensively they are theyre just getting their hands on a l of ball Louisville has to do a good job of sealing and getting themselves open and they got to snap the passes the passes are a little too Applause soft Hadley nobody else doing a whole lot for Louisville in the corner canai misses battle for the rebound Terrence Edwards saves it for Louisville Edwards gets it back in the corner a three for Terence Edwards Hes got 14 and Louisville has the lead at 4645 Big Time shot to give the cars the lead here a crowd into it here in the y center for really the first time tonight B him to the basket o tough shot oh tough shot Edwards right back down misses the foul on bying him will be his second as we had a lot going on this year a big one a huge defensive play and he gets rewarded in the corner it is great hustle play by Terence Edward saving the ball its only right that he gets rewarded and then you see Ahad byting just a natural score shoot threes getting to the basket just finds ways to putting the ball in the hoop B hims first twopointer of the night you know hes hitting 64 from three or right at 64 from three and from two or for overall its just 569 hey youd like to say Jody the more you shoot the more the percentages start to average out but his is going up is going up all right Edwards now leads Louisville with 16 put the card Back on Top by one again adley and heurn camper with a long three there it is onc camper with another answer to stop the momentum every time louville gets a little momentum the miners have an answer Chucky misses a three Frasier with it Louisville five of 24 from three gave bam some space and Waterman blocks it out of bounds good block by Waterman good Applause recovery Scott in for Hadley for Louisville we see the block Applause so Scott heurn Edwards and Bams going to come out and Waterman for Louisville Bams coming out and hes limping they get Barnes in and hes going to go hang out with the trainer and going look look like maybe a his side or the leg or his leg we watch that camper has a charge and thats foul number four Nowell Terrell thats his fourth foul a good job of Chucky sliding his feet there getting in position Terrell lowers that shoulder easy call for the ref Terrell only has four points tonight but the ca freshman of the year last year hes kind of been running the show even though they like you said earlier they dont have a ton of assists only six hes kind of getting them in the flow offensively thats a big big loss for them right now as he goes out it is but when you match up against Chucky hurn you know hes going to get a lot of people problem in the ACC so Kudos the Chucky for really kind of taking him out of what he wants to do and drawing him in into some fouls marman to Smith he throws it up for Scott and hes fouled hell get two his it was the Ali an Ali oop see rain going Baseline there throwing it up James Scott at The Rim thats Campers third foul so some foul trouble for the miners already seven Applause here Scott made one for two in the first half makes that one hes got six is uh the miners some foul trouble here thats camper third has four as these fouls start to P up to come down to who makes free throws at the end of the game as this is going back and forth in the tight neck game camper now out front for the Applause miners Thomas the step back misses it rain Smith Taps it over to heurn heads up play by rain Smith its great box out by James scottt even though he didnt get the rebound he didnt let Dereck Hamilton get it Scott with the bucket and James Scott has four quick points hes got nine on the night and the cards are back in front theres an illegal screen on Hamilton thatll be a foul on Hamilton and James Scott four quick points watch this one from Chucky to James rule up Music 5250 is or false is going by all the way Home Services its the congratulations thank you again to everyone to tonight toy video one of the winners you have win number 101 all right were back here at the KFC Yum Center Jody dling and Larry oand Louisville with the lead and Larry the miners with some foul trouble three key players with foul troubles now it is you see David Terrell there with four Otis Frasier with three Cory camper with three and Louisville already has UT with eight fouls so theyre in a one and one and so for the rest of the game you know you want to put press press on them attack the basket get to the foul line try to get yourself easy baskets on a night where youre struggling to shoot the ball from the threepoint line try to get to that foul line try to get yourself to the double bonus so you can shoot two for the rest of the game and that last foul was an offensive foul so Louisville just gets possession here that bur with it fat Edwards in that corner again and that ball gets stuck the second time tonight that Balls got stuck right there the last one on a layup this on a three and that goes over to Utah how you see that in the corner not very often a good look there from Edwards Hes got Applause 16 Smith the aloop and he T he blocks that gets his hand on it deflection Edwards and thats going to be a block so the blocking foul on Barnes I think Barnes started the fall before Chucky I mean before Terence actually ran into him otherwise he was right in position to take the charge but he just started the fall so Barns third now 19 fouls yeah he definitely was in good position and just you you do though I mean you remember those day you want to you want to sell it but you want to you want to make sure you get it so youre kind of like in the middle yeah you dont want to take the full blunt of it but sometimes you just got to take it on the chest Scott kept that alive and then its going to be a foul on Hadley his Applause first 13 foul of the Applause half Louisville two empty possessions in a row Barn for purn on him P doing a great job stepped out of bounds so thats four turnovers now for the miners in the last 230 so the team that turns you over now turning it over they have 13 Louisville with just 10 we talked about that number it was five after the Under 12 in the first half so just five the rest of the way so things trending well for Louisville in that uh in that category Larry theyve settled in and theyve kind of gotten a comfort level with the the intensity and the defensive pressure that ERS are playing and so they know how to be patient and how to attack it on the offensive end Hadley with the Miss Scott gets the tip Louisville the ball everywhere cant get it Al boy they get out on the break fast they boy they do camper with the uh the bucket there were four of them around the rim its tied up at 52 bur Edwards and Hadley fat Edwards over to Hadley back to Applause Chucky Edwards a three Hadley with the rebound good put back you know Larry you you looked at the threes five of 27 now for Louisville and you might say okay when are you going to stop theyre theyre open looks thats the thing theyre hitting open looks and you got to shoot it you got to keep him honest but you know you got to find other ways like we talked about offensive rebound is Devon putting it in getting deflectors getting out on the break getting easy layups getting to the foul line you got to find other ways to put the ball in the basket theres a way to put it in for the miners thats a three from Frasier Edwards to The Bu P Edwards now with 18 over doing a good job after the make a push catching UT Applause sleeping Scott almost with the steel B him and Edwards gets his hand on it Chucky gets the steel Chucky to the basket hes going to get fouled that will be four on Barnes I believe as you see Edwards with the Miss but Hadley right there and thats Javon in a nutshell right just kind of doing whatever the team needs him to do whether its scoring defending playing inside playing outside just kind of that guy that kills the boid of whatever Pat Kelce needs him to do that burn now with 10 Im sorry with 12 without a field goal though since early in the game just two of six tonight from the Applause field misses that one seven of eight from the free throw line all right so Terell with his four fouls back Applause in nice pass there to ham missed it that was a really nice pass from Frasier down the Baseline it was a great sa derck Hamilton wasnt ready to score the ball when he caught it and Edwards takes it to the bucket2 Hilton Hamilton second thats already double bonus for Louisville Pat kely iss going to

Bandon and Larry O its because of Kai ruse the young fella has been going to the rack the last two possessions for Louisville it is as you can see it all starts with defense Louisville getting a stop getting out on the break here Chucky pushing the ball canai running the lane just rewarding the big F Above the Rim Mo just doing a good job of starting this run they always build up great momentum from defense as you see canai sending it home special delivery Kai Ruth four points tonight just two rebounds hes only played 11 minutes weve talked about it he had his best game of the year 10 points and six rebounds against Duke the other night I I think the minutes have to continue to go up correct they are you know each game that he plays his confidence just builds and builds and builds and hes going to make mistakes but he doesnt hang his head he continues to play he plays with confidence plays hard and hes only going to learn with the more and more experience and time that he gets out here on the court Jones with it heres Thomas foul trouble for UTEP Chucky almost with another steal there he almost got that one with his foot camper to the basket on Edwards it goes in and Applause fouled so edwardss first foul camper with the bucket Campers been the answer every time L was momentum camper has been the one to step up and how of Silence the crowd for a second hes got 17 Applause now holds UT back to within Applause five BR Smith a three off the front of the rim bham whos been out for a while we thought maybe with an ankle Twisted it hes back in hes the threepoint threat leads the nation in threepoint field goal Applause percentage B him on hurn Chucky great defense Hadley with the board rebound number nine for Javon Hadley he didnt take the three passes it off to hurn Music Applause Edwards drives Hadley the onehanded put back and he draws the foul how did he get that in I dont know I do not know but he found a way he found a way typical Javon Hadley passion just finding a way to get it done for the team and whatever capacity that they need that gives him his double double cuz thats his 10th point and that was his 10th rebound of the Music night Hadley misses the free throw we talk about finding different ways to score offensive rebounding how you doing yes it Applause is B him with a three off balance with heurn trying to steal it and he still gets it off my goodness oh and a turnover for Louisville going a little too fast camper and a quick five points for UT its now a twopoint game every time Louisville has some momentum they have the answer its been Cory Applause camper Edwards and there as I say he was tugging on his J pretty good there Thomas Thomas is second you know coach Kelsey took Terrence to the put him on the bench a couple games ago and I think he did it to get his attention you know wanting you to be more aggressive wanting you to be more assertive and Wan you to be more consistent in these last couple games you kind of see a different demeanor in him even when things aren going his way and hes not making shots hes still aggressive he still wants the ball I thought at times when things werent going his way he would kind of shy away from the ball and kind of defer but I think coach Kel said I want you to be aggressive you know whether youre having a good night whether youre having a bad night we need you to step up especially with KAS and cor going down to help us tring of be a man and help create easier opportunities for these other guys and I think hes really stepped up and shown that in these last couple of games starting with the Duke game hes got 22 tonight hes eight of 10 from the free throw line Thomas to the basket burn G Tucky gambled on that Applause one Edwards to Music Hatley Hadley misses it Scott with the rebound tries to save it tip out of bounds theyre going to give it to Louisville good Hustle go from Scott number 23 hes in fores Edwards into H hebburn hebburn Hagley Smith Edwards and Scott R Smith a threepointer its been a while for rain he had missed his last four but he makes that one with a quick release one thing about rain is hes never going to lose confidence rain can be over for 10 he wants the ball he believe hes hot hes going to shoot it you got to love that about a shooter ball tipped up James Scott and it was uh pooo coming over and getting a hand on it over his back they give it to Louisville so the cards dodged one there Smith Im sorry Thomas open in the corner right there yeah it was a good look just didnt knock it down little fortunate to get out of that one now UTEP with their starting lineup back out on the floor again foul trouble two guys with four three guys with two Applause Hadley to Edwards Edwards been successful tonight taking it to the basket this time a step back hes going to miss it and C with the Applause rebound Barnes to the basket and draws the foul Hario Bandon with you Karen Ard he had 21 against Duke on Sunday hes got 22 tonight and Larry has come up big for him he has hes really stepped up to the challenge answered the call Louisville needed somebody to really kind of help kind of take the Reign on the offensive end and he stepped up and done just that made big shot after big shot and hes got it done defensively too so you can kind of see the demeanor that hes coming out to play with and hes on a mission and trying to get little across the finish line here with the win against UT every time Louisville gets a little momentum though UTEP has a an answer the missed there at the free throw line trying to convert the threepoint play Barnes misses L with the Applause possession we have jump ball be Lal Applause possession so fortunate that ball got stuck in the behind the basket earlier cuz it was a jump ball you get The Possession now right rather have it up three with 330 Left Applause Right inbound to Smith its that play that Louisville runs try to catch a quick one rain misses a three there not even close tough shot loville up three UTEP with the ball just over three left here at the Y Center 3 minutes left on the one possession game whats going to come down to which team can execute best at the end of the game and get to the sets and get to the easy Bas that they need to looked like he walked might have been fouled nothing called Hadley comes away with it and Hadley drives in its good take to the basket Javon like he was going to try to turn that one over Jody Javon Hadley Applause second foul lley missed his only free throw tonight hes got 10 points and 11 rebounds is 19 of 26 on the season from the line Hadleys got 11 boards Scotts got 11 11 boards for Louisville just the ultimate ultimate teammate a winner and a God that does whatever it takes to win competes thats why Pat Kelsey loves him crowd Comes Alive here in the Young Center good defense from Louisville so far Barnes to the basket foul on Scott Barnes will get two Z James Scott thats his second 16 foul for Mars getting low getting in those little crevices in the pick and roll game able to get in and draw the foul hes 29 of 37 on the season one for two tonight hes got 12 Music Applause its a team that hits 74 from the free throw Applause line will taking its time purn Hadley on the Block the spin back to Scott back to Hadley over to heurn Hadley gets it again nope cant get anything going heurn just throws it up right at the shot clck and lville just could get nothing on that possession excellent defensive possession by Applause ut oh and a foul called Barnes foul on Scott Scot thats his third its the third foul on Scott as you see the defense there Applause Barnes with two more free Music throws Devin Barnes really getting in the high pick and roll getting downhill putting pressure on James Scott in the painton getting in there trying to make a play makes that second one time out UT 72703 left Louisville with possession back after this to finish it up here in the Music bill game lilles trying to snap a three game losing streak and uteps trying to extend a four game a streak two four games a winning streak Jody dming and Larry O Bandon here and Larry you mentioned it its a possession game here for Louisville you have to draw something up here out of this time out to get a good shot put somebody in good position youre youre in the double bonus so you can be aggressive and go to the basket but you got to draw something up who are you going to I mean its got to be Terence Edwards right hes got it going hes got 22 points now what position do you put him in maybe do you run him on the Allen Aon to cut across the top maybe give him a chance to do a quick rip through or do you go to Javon javons been able to get some success inside against his matchup so you got a number an option but I would like to think you would either go to Terren or may surprise him with a with the rain away from the ball screen here for a wide open three hes got a number of options he could choose but I would like to think that he would get the ball in Terence Edon since hes got it going tonight 22 of 55 from the field just six of 32 from threepoint range and N no field goes in the last 2 Applause 54 P bur with it Applause Scott Hadley looked almost like he wanted to go to Scott there James Scott picked up his dribble a little early kind took him out of the D Hadley missed the three Edwards with the rebound ball batted away Hadley comes up with it and Louisville holds it 12 seconds to 10 seconds on the shot clock maybe look for a high pick and roll here look for Chucky to kind of get into the paint oh bat it out of bounds itll be Lal possession with 33 heer looking disgusted one at the uh the foul I think Pat Kels going to take a 30 second timeout and Im not sure yep Pat Kels going to take timeout Applause here theyre going to look at something here instead of taking play is under review going to look at the clocks here maybe to see who touched the last did he go off Chuckys foot no didnt go off his foot so theyre looking at the clock to see on the shot clock I would think ball hasnt come down yet I think its correct right looks like 106 yeah 33 to me the call on the floor stands out of bounds white that was a nice one cuz that gives Pat Kelce a uh a 30 second time out that he didnt have to use Music I dont think coach Golding liked it over there but three second three seconds you typically got time for pass maybe two dribbles terrain Smith missed it but Hadley with the rebound and hes fouled who else right who else rebound number Applause 12 missed missed everything and boy that was a nice way to draw it up right back to R and Rain you cant get much more open you cant almost make that thatall went all the way around except for down great set coming out of the timeout get rain a wide open three you couldnt ask for a better look and Javon just doing everything he can to secure the rebound get fouls got to make the free throw short arm that one Lille 22 of 31 now from the line come on baby makes that one Hadley now 13 points and 12 rebounds the crowd on their feet under a minute Barnes inside the lane to the free throw line the jumper is good and a timeout quickly by coach Golding Barnes and the high pick and rollers uteps last three possessions have mixed him in the high pick and roll where hes been able to use his speed to get into space you see him there getting into the midrange James Scott having to respect his speed having drawn a couple of fouls going to the baskets and now he had to give him some space and Devin Barnes PS up for the midrange jumper and makes some pay L with the clinging to a onepoint lead if you l here I think you you sort of run the same action I think you look for a high pick and roll you maybe put chy hurn in a high pick and roll with some space and opportunity if not look for an option for Terence Edwards to come off and create a shot for now only for himself but for our teammate as well UTEP with no timeouts left Louisville does have two possession arrow favors UTEP any free throw for Louisville any foul for on UTEP against Louisville is a double bonus thrown it in 15sec differential between the shot clock and the game clock all right so Chucky hurn is going to bring it across midcourt if you L you want to wind this thing all the way down you want to start your offense at about 11 10 seconds they started at 12 Scott Chucky comes back and gets it inside the Scott from the dunk purn to Scott great pass even better finish by James in traffic Miss and kooo with the dunk they dont have a timeout R Smith IS F F bares and a onepoint game thats Barnes fifth foul great pass by Chucky James Scott finishing UT coming right back Devon barns going in Kevin kooo finishing the put back Barnes finishes with 16 he fouls out rain Smith to the Music Applause line itll be Music two thats a big loss for Coach Golding hes been the one thats created all the offense the last three minutes here for utap and who do they put in the nations number one threepoint shooter its not a bad option to come off the bench is it B them four of five tonight on the year Amad bham is 23 of 35 Smith makes that one R Smith 62 seconds left no timeouts for Utah does Pat Kelce take Music one oh he does not bra Smith knocks him down to comma collectively Frasier they get an open look and they miss it the strip the put back Terrell not there and the Cardinal survive 77
