Forest on December 30th Brandon Rex Steiner gets the started point guard for an injured sha padulla Tyler Nicholl pulls up misses we are underway with a rebound from Americans Germaine Biser web getting his first career start today The Talented Matt Rogers is out with a twisted ankle he suffered against VMI yeah thats a big loss for Coach Simkins because Rogers was a multidimensional player a threelevel scorer who can step out away from the basket as well as be a threat on the Block comes Elijah Stevens with the shot clock running down Biser web able to get to the 10 Biser web the the native of Denmark really is a talented guy sevenfooter hes been injured been working on getting back in condition but but hes really a post presence in there at over sevenet hell be battling against ly kid the leading scorer for Virginia Tech a little over 15 points per game its been one of the bright surprises for Virginia Tech this year as Hunter Couture lets one fly and connects got you run out a threepoint shooter like Couture and hes got the patience to PMP fake take a dribble to the side and knock the threepointer down alltime leader and threepointers in Virginia Tech history Lincoln ball going up against the transfer from ODU maai long trying to find his way off of the glass and long is able to pick down the board comes Rex Steiner with a zip inside H scored quickly there Rex Steiner getting some valuable time before they get to like you mentioned ACC play starting next week hes played over 20 minutes in the last couple of games came off of the bench in the win against Vermont had the start against Val perzo this could be a big game for bager web to really prove himself to Dwayne Simpkins here that he could be a starter moving forward but Matt Rogers a player that was picked to the all Patriot League this season being out how can he compete here today with Biser web theres a turnover gives the ball back to American Shan padulla in Street close and swag over on the Hoke bench out tonight so this is a a very big game another start for Brandon rexer just a freshman yeah and hes proven that uh to to coach young that he can be trusted and uh you know now hes earning the trust of his teammates also oh Seager web gets blocked by Kid that may be a nice battle on both ends finding Lyn kid what a pass that was L kid how many people would have been surprised if you said going into the new year Lyn kid is the leading score for Virginia Tech mens basketball I I would say a good amount of people would be surprised but if you see the work ethic that we have seen from Lin kid in a lot of these nonconference games for the hokes you wouldnt necessarily be surprised hes having a successful start to the season Tyler niichel contested that shot they did not block out theres Mike young in his Fifth Season as a Virginia Tech head coach and ACC Coach of the Year brought the Hoke their first ever ACC Championship undefeated in Conference tournament Title Games in his time at Virginia Tech and wford so denardio kicks it out to Stevens crafty ball handler misses there potit and long able to combine for the board Music comes potit the big man backing his way in

George Mason coaching staff for the last eight years interesting chess match already Bailey and that the Lyn kid goes out and Biser web goes out at the same time theyre going to be matched up all night long but uh uh I dont I see a quick Trend here that uh theyre going to take him out at the same time and maybe put him back in at the same time well watch that matchup linkid already with a couple of buckets here today denardio going back to the bench Noah Jones is in along with Jeff Sprouse for American SP a good backup kind of combo guard really Music strong out to the corner for Smalls knocks down the three BK any time theres penetration and somebodys got to help somebodys going to be open when we talk with Dwayne Simpkins before this he said we talked about what could be the biggest challenge for the Eagles coming into this game he said were going to be able to score but how well can we defend against Virginia Tech yeah thats been their issue all year there you see it rear and its ugly head again they theyve had theyve struggled against field goals in general and in particular against the threepoint shot and they play really hard uh its just a matter of technique and execution hter Couture two for two from Beyond The Arc to start down inside to Noah Jones Lincoln ball going in on Long good defensive possession there for Tech and fought through on the throw in from potit good job of defensive transition that time but they they didnt communicate left Tyler nickel wide open on the Baseline on the back door cut 147 Nicholl scoring into the scoring effort joining in on the scoring effort here at make it 147 Music okis trying to make it a second straight game where they really jumped out to such a high lead at the beginning of the ball game and that first half LED 242 against Vermont a very talented team in their own right from the aec K long can do this grab a rebound and push it down the floor now drawn by by Hunter Couture bringing us to a break Couture in the Hokey up by yeah thanks Kendall did you ever get to coach against Gary Williams ma uh no Ive watched him practice a lot though when we used to go around and watch different people practice course know Morgan Wooten extremely well uh or knew Morgan Wooten uh you clearly the the greatest High School coach of all time and you see that DMV influence on this American roster lots of Maryland and Virginia represented for this team from DC and the two sevenfooters are back in we can call them both sevenfooters right right Robbie Baron also in for the first time for Virginia Tech out of the break we get a look at this for American five players from Maryland two from Virginia and a few others represented around the world as well theres Hunter Couture with a pickpocket right to the rim and rolls in K nice finish by Couture through a little contact Coutures been around so long he knows all the officials by first name I think he he was trying to get their attention like hey I that should have been an and one arent you on my Christmas card list like swing it out for Deno and Denio thats a player that waywayne Simpkins is pretty high on just how confident hes been able to he is so aggressive and so confident he made a big shot in their last game against VMI and turned around and talked to the bench a little bit love this guys attitude heres a long one for Camden he misses thrown back in to Colin Smalls denardio hits the three and a bit of energy there for the senior from Italy 37 I think his numbers are going to do nothing but go up hes a really good passer he can score the basketball hes Applause tough a outstanding Defender too Jaden young freshman trying to join the party instead pulled down by balis Seager web young and can two guys off the bench got a couple good looks left him wide open under the basket thats Greg Jones The Freshman Miss missed a lot of time last year with a miss his whole senior season I think with a back injury but athletic he played multiple positions Lin K somehow made that play work wow that was a tough catch and a tough finish in traffic by ly kid Music High Pace game so far Virginia Tech attempting to slow down here on the defensive end shot clock down to five Deno draws it foul Tyler nichel and MJ Collins ready to check in but first well go both of these guys will be missed and who will step up and replace this production Lorenzo Lorenzo Deno ready to shoot some free throws here a 71 free throw Applause Music shooter this is the first one for the Eagles erican coming off of a win against Music VMI Denio had 15 points against against the key D but misses both the American coaches for lobbying for that to be a shooting foul and the officials consulted each other and came up with that Jamie lucky Les Jones two veteran guys out there theres ly kid with a slam 10 points already for kid he hes quite a story he has really worked hard to make himself a really good player five for five from the field to start americ ran a little Flex action that time a little Gary Williams Applause stuff the shot clock down now to six top of the key for Stevens he has to shoot it got it off right at the buzzer The Talented guard able to find the bucket thats what I was trying to explain earlier he doesnt shoot until he has to but but hes pretty good when he does and way Simpkins actually said that hes almost too unselfish yeah I I called him an unselfish shooter which makes no sense at all you know what you meant though and so did Coach zins that was Tyler nickel with a step into the paint ly kin with a second chance points play play was set up by MJ Collins good to see him back in action after missing some time for the hokes ly kid six for six from the field to start out very productive first half no Jones with a lefthanded shot kid scores a couple buckets and look whos coming back Biser web sevenfooter ready to check in tough pass Stevens flexs comes Matt Mayo he can really shoot the basketball which you got to find him in transition was a good job by John Camden in transition to know where he Applause wasio up against MJ Collins pulls up its a good battle right there two physical guys two really aggressive guys MJ Collins running the point in this set did not play against Vermont and had a disappointing effort a disappointing game against Val perzo went 0 for four thats another question for Virginia Tech MJ Collins who turned some heads last year for his toughness and his ability so far this year in his sophomore season few questions about him yeah he he struggled you know scoring the basketball then have one great night with 20 points against Louisville but uh but he does so many things that Mike young trust he he handles the ball he really defend hes always in the right place and of course right now hes been pressed into a little bit of action at the point guard spot uh every now and then because of the injury to Shawn padulla Music Elijah Stevens looking for help against Couture wesler on the floor here in the first half for Tech and another three able to go for Elijah Stevens and you saw flash up the threepoint sign there maybe hes starting to believe he can shoot a little bit more than he usually does I think in the back of his mind he knows he does but he takes that point guard role seriously we talked about fact that hes among the nations leaders in assist theres Patrick wesler with a hand off to Couture wesler trying to get the rebound and ball instead swats it out to Smalls Music top of the key Smalls working inside good bucket for American Balls kind of backed Reiner down in the lane and shot it over him Eagles have hit six of their last eight field goals and Virginia Tech is not scored here for over two minutes a senior taking on that freshman Robbie Baron up to NJ Collins ends the drought for the pokes very nice shot talk about his scoring but and in practice he shoots the ball really Applause Music well off for ball its off Stevens a size mismatch up in the Deep Wing knocked away and that brings us to another break American making it interesting only down six 272 Lyn kid he 6 for six from the field yeah and the senior from Gainesville Florida has done it in a variety of ways on the defensive end you see him blocking shots offensively with the midrange a little floater at The Rim he scored all of those baskets in just eight minutes of play also you talk about efficient Lin kid getting some breathing time now look at the progression he started out his college career at Clemson came to Virginia Tech and we saw last year come up in a couple of big clutch moments as the hes force a shot clock violation seeing him play last year now to this year it has been a tremendous progression of not only how good hes gotten but really the responsibilities he has in this offense yeah and he had good good games a year ago but he didnt have good games every night and hes been really consistent three double doubles already this season while Rex Steiner still maning the point guard position for Virginia Tech got his second career start tonight no sha padulla as weve mentioned Patrick Music wesler into the big man wesler with a jump stop rattles Applause westler big guy runs can can make a shot has learned to play really hard red shirted last year getting in on some playing time here in the last couple of games here in the first half in this battle against the big man that American has thrown out there in Germaine baller web illegal screen that time American likes to show press they theyll theyll press man back to man sometimes sometimes theyll show a little Point Zone sometime a little two two1 down here is where theyve really struggled though in the half court they have struggled to stop people from scoring foul called down low on American now web again check for re Steiner on the penetration Wess with the catch in a crowd stays with it till the fouls called right here by Jamie lucky well weve seen some Nifty passes from the Hokey point guard tonights a talented young kid on rebound now for Sprouse Smalls now back in the Music deck bring down the shot clock again defensively the hokes are playing so hard right now where American has to work into the final 8 Seconds of the shot clock to even get some sort of look up but it is a foul called on the hokes yeah now B your web you know being out with foul trouble now hes replaced by Noah Jones whos you know you can see the the physicality difference already trying to find an answer here American only down eight now five of the shot clock ball has to move backing in needs to get a shot off the back iron Lin kid was there and another good defensive stance for the hokes yeah really good play by maai long maai long finding Rex Steiner thats a good feed just no finish there for the Freshman yeah rexer can make that he he shoots that basketball with confidence he he gets that kind of time and space hes a very high percentage threepoint shooter once again working down the shot clock down to five Noah Jones Strauss able to hit the three to keep American in this good job by American they made Lyn kid stay in the ball screen defense a little too long and then they were playing four on three when the ball came out MJ Collins ready to check in for the hokes as American continues to hang around TCH is led by as much as 11 wow wide open down low ly kid seven for seven yeah they have no answer right now its a really big mismatch Noah Jones at 66 sophomore hes just hes a smaller post player certainly looks a lot bigger than 66 but Smalls backing up it out for spouse again thats me almost got it pretty unlucky there for the guard I think it went in all the way in and came back out another inside lob to Lin kid l k what a first half timeout by American ly kid8 for eight with 16 points commanding this ball game yeah he is taking advantage of that size and you mentioned the Improvement year over year Lyn kid is making a statement for the hokes here tonight from the New River Valley has made its way out this blows already and to get the clock potentially shot clock has got to go to 27 like it jumped all the way down to 20 and then ran to 17 lets see what can be done here to get it fixed I got to say if I was a clock operator this would be my absolute nightmare everybody in the building looking at you everybody looking and not knowing what to do but thats but thats one of your jobs in the building looking well yeah but I dont have to solve a technical issue you have to teach the people who play tic tac to no well yeah thats true which I I guess I fail at that as well for anybody that has attended a Virginia Tech game in the last two years it seems like a foreign concept to so many people the shot clock has been Music fixed May attack again you know solid defensively AIO yeah that that always puts the official in a bad spot where both the offensive player and the defensive player are being an aggress an aggressor and uh in that time I think they got it right with Rex ster just being a little bit too much bodied up right there two fouls for the starting point guard for Virginia Tech so MJ Collins likely to run the point for the hokes Music Applause Al Seager web another player to watch out for with a couple of fouls has two shot clock down to five rebound for kid yeah coach Simkins in a bad spot got got to put Biser web back in the game despite the two fouls and hope he doesnt pick up that third Kai long probing inside and finds his way off the glass Old Dominion transfer average nearly a double double at Old Dominion last year maai long another one of those players trying to make his way into the Virginia Tech lineup because he has the capacity to average a double double almost did so last year with 10 points per game and right around eight rebounds per game and played against Virginia Tech very well down in Charleston when he was playing with ODU May Nails the three shooter over shooter right there Advantage May over nichel on that particular possession thats Mays first three hes attempted in this game little Zone Action change of Defense oh how does Virginia Tech respond to that zone went inside with long shot clock down to five oh tough pass from Couture miscommunication with Lin keeping American on that perimeter theres the penetration stolen by Couture lead pass to long back for MJ Collins MJ Collins good decision Again by long running the floor looking back finding the right guy a quick turnover in Hunter Couture the veteran knew exactly what to do took it to another veteran maai long going to Dish b a sager web high percentage look hes been impressive like you mentioned his first start on a pretty big stage here up against an ACC team out for the injury Matt Rogers who averages nearly 16 points a game round the Zone MJ Collins trying to heat up misses the three Hokies up by eight an American chance here to try to cut down this lead to two possessions instead another foul called on Tyler n second 15 foul against still no bonus this will stay on the Flor for Amer number one Elijah Stevens check for the h 11 and young step right in just 86 left to go in the first Music half be Stevens to take the final shot give it back to the guard and before that a foul another one and one more foul to give Virginia 15 L kid thats his first thats that smart basketball cut down now they only have two seconds left to do something forgin zie Dwayne Simpkins quick instructions from the bench to try to get a shot off here before the buzzer timeout called timeout Virginia sent from the field a lot of high percentage looks particularly from Lyn kid 8 for eight so does this go to May here hes proven himself as a threepoint shooter throughout the season its got to be a catch and shoot and Regina Tech will probably switch everything in this situation instead they go inside Baron a B to come up defensively to swat away that ball and get it so thatll be it for the first point guard for the first half that only turned the ball over three times thats pretty darn good and shot the ball really well like weve been talking Music about theres Elijah Stevens point guard that has been the name to watch out for for American today so far Stevens with Five Points as well as a couple of assists almost the ball ball out of bounds but it stays with American as the Eagles have worked down low into the shot clock in most of their possessions Virginia Tech defense certainly making them work for it yeah that Viria teex just not giving them any good looks at anything the Seager web backs in on LY kid good defense all around for the hokes they get the ball right back Rex Steiner with a jump hook returns kid lefthander kid Perfection nine for nine for ly kid he still hasnt missed and a back off to Stevens ball defense staying strong for Virginia Tech as Lin kid keeps the toes in heres kid oh his first Miss of the night I wondered if its almost like baseball do you just not mention the fact that hes perfect until the end I think thats probably the way it is thats probably the way its supposed to be in The Dugout anyway and the I think we have to announce right right and of course like everything the announcers ruin Laughter Music Applause it Tyler niichel pretty quiet night for nickel after backto back double digit performances just had two there in the first Applause half Couture made himself a lane and now to the line you talked about Tyler niichel not you know not having a a real good scoring night at least only one for four but uh I thought I thought it spoke highly of Tyler niichel that Mike Youngs first play he called tonight was for Tyler nichel to get a jump shot I thought that exhibited a lot of trust that Mike young has uh has put in Tyler niichel or Tyler niichel has earned from Mike young how about that it was a big name transfer that the hokes got nichel played at Carolina last year in a few instances and actually had his career high for the tar Hills against Virginia Tech when he was at Castle Coliseum last year look at that everybody likes to mention that and rightfully so vhsl alltime leader in scoring been a lot of great players in the state of Virginia now and he scored more than all of them when you start talking about Samson and Iverson and Curry and a whole lot of Big Time names its got to say Ralph Samson has to be in the top five right got to look into that therell be some names in the top 10 that you dont know right and itll stay with the Eagles Virginia number four ma long thats his first long first foul against the putting the hand on the dribbler right there KY long getting a good amount of playing time in this one at the start for the hokes just taken one shot Ma has two points another foul count the basket for Elijah Stevens El a clutch player not very big but he is explosing Music see hes already beat Couture the only thing Couture is tried to catch up he bodied him up tried to get him off balance and theres the foul right there good call Dwayne Simpkins said I think he could be an all conference player of the Patriot league first year for the head coach and that was one of his first impressions of his point guard he had a fairly small sample size but I would agree he he can really do a lot of things foul called to the back court Stevens gets booked for that Simkins not excited that might go the other way theyre trying to heat up the ball handler right there trying now a little different look a little Zone look trying to see if they trap when they come across half court they back out of it play man to man trying to improve on defense thats been the mo for American here so far the season lost the ball almost as Couture saves it Elija potit into a double team and well see a foul called on Noah Jones down low 21 Noah second foul for Jones coming off with the bench yeah aggression is not the problem for American at all they get after you really on both ends of the floor course coach Simpkins promised that he said hey Ive learned one thing were going to play hard round the ark NOP it looks so far for the hokes potit trying to make one and he does impressive play for the big man splitting through Defenders and thats what opens up folks on the inside if youre going to really do a great job and Run Virginia Tech off the threepoint line the post hasnt has a lot of room to work in there lead back to double digits for Virginia Tech Stevens know a mismatch and size in the paint shot clock down again ball gets it off of the rim follows his shot but he was the last one to take the ball out of bounds so MJ Collins ready to jog back in for Virginia Tech Tyler Nicholls to the bench Colin Smalls who made a couple buckets in the first half for American back in Colin Smalls Simkins said as his best defender on this team guy that comes off of the bench but could be a starter had started earlier on in his career and dealt with a back injury Cross Court lob Collins was open pump fake right to the rim thats an impressive play play for the young man from South Carolina nice patient play cuts his way to the hoop will have a free throw when we come back bringing us to another break in blackburg 4432 means a lot more to us guys thanks Kendall yeah that is really cool I got to wear a pair last year and I tell you what those kids do a heck of a job as as far as the the design choices they make I think mine were were green and orange there some really neat shoes yeah Seer Web Two Defenders look like one of them actually got a piece of the rim and American was wondering why that was legal and another one got a piece of him man missed that one right there eight points agree with Coach Simkins on that one Senor making his first start in an American Music Uniform Collins back to American that was an unpopular call by Jamie lucky so this crew of of officials Reed a good amount of games at you call or you coach back in the day right well Jamie lucky and Les Jones did a bunch now Adam has just started since I quit but uh uh but yeah Les Jones and Jamie lucky Ive had in a whole lot of basketball games we have gone back and forth a few times everything seemed friendly when you guys said hi to each other theres no bad blood from maybe a mischarge back in the day no Applause no number zero another whistle as the fouls start to pile up here its been a physical game and I dont think its going to going to get any uh uh any less physical as we go down the stretch to the line for American number 12 Jeff sprous so Jeff sprous goes to the line once again trying to make this ball game a single digit deficit the sophomore from Florida Applause misses you this game feels like a game thats a couple threes by American of being really close or a couple threes by Virginia Tech of being comfortable for them right and it really does feel like Virginia Tech has dominated this game and it should almost feel like its the deficit should be a lot larger than just 10 points when American is hung around and a lot of those offensive possessions for the Eagles have drained down the clock as well Tyler niichel misses Robbie Baron was right there Jake Collins lost the ball Jones picks it away for Music American another foul well this is a series between American and Virginia Tech that goes all the way back to the 1930s there been some close games boy look at that offensive Powerhouse of that first game 2923 and despite what you say ba I did not work any of those games well hold on 1972 were you there for that I was in school okay I was about to say not not the ones in the 30s Ill give you that Music Applause thanks to Tyler Nicholl another turnover at his foot out of bounds stepped out of bounds and and that press while it didnt force the turnover on the front end it it sort of had the Virginia Tech offense discombobulated on the back end Lin kid had a sizable break there now back out hes N9 for 10 from the field with 18 points leaving the way for Virginia Tech second leading score after that is Hunter Couture who is also currently on the Music bench not for long dble inside Robbie Baron crashes in to snatch the ball away Lin kid how did he find that ball I cant believe that catch I cannot believe he caught that ball just how Brandon Rex Steiner drew it up 20 points for lin Music kid thats that freshman confidence right there back to a 10point lead for Virginia Tech three on the way go mistake right there MJ Collins got caught on the screen you havent been a lot of wide open looks for America but that was certainly one Jeff Sprouse now with seven points hes got a pair of Threes on the Applause Music Applause night still hanging around 4740 MJ Collins great Dish Bar very nice play by Collins drawing the defense keeping his head up finding Baron Robbie Baron the transfer from Northwestern another player trying to see where he fits in in this offense he had that great defensive play earlier finding a bucket there turnover Applause American for number one bar again with a good defensive play stole the ball in the last possession that time forced the player out of bounds you see this great work by our crew picked that up when he stepped out of bounds for a Split Second Great camera work called by Jamie lucky and really good defense by Robbie Baron with a full court press here for American now dropping Music back L kid double teamed inside now one Noah Jones big Advantage right here and he has worth that Advantage hes still only missed one shot Music 22 points eight rebounds getting ready for his fourth double double of the here meanwhile Inside Out going inside again for ball up against Tyler nichel and the harrisberg Virginia native came up with a big defensive play back in for ly kid and one his night continues just too big 53 three to 40 ly kid with 24 points and a chance to make it 25 oh the the the little picture right next to him they said as voted by the co coaches Boston College number one popcorn in the AC okay I thought that was coach Youngs well I mean either way maybe if he was the only guy on the ballot that actually participated in that vote it technically would not be incorrect ly kid going to pull down another rebound hes got 25 a career high 12 of 13 shooting that was his 10th rebound for his fourth double double of the year its a guy that averaged Five Points a game a year now as a leading scorer for this Virginia Tech Team Rex Steiner lets it Fly wow MJ Collins skyrocketing to the rim Rex Steiner will count that as an assist MJ Collins now into double figures with 10 points coming up with a big rebound timing it up perfectly and a block on the other end Collins was there almost Sega web hell get another chance to make this an oldfashioned threepoint play MJ Collins got some Absolute Air here Mac we may be seeing this on a similar Network later today well maybe so he was right there and he knew as soon as that ball came off of the rim you could see it in his eyes rocking it home to make it a 14o game 5642 great views of that too from multiple directions ready for big plays to be made here at the Applause Music castle Robbie Baron made another good defensive play with a blocked shot but American came up with it and then Baron gets called for the foul hes trying to work out of the Trap and thats exactly what American wanted Elijah Stevens transition three Baron and MJ Collins trying to call same team there got the rebound anyway yeah Rexs got to make better decisions against that press cuz hes going to see it the rest of the Music game Collins hes starting to heat up MJ Collins first the dunk they now Al twoo has some really nice offensive plays into double figures 12 points in just 14 minutes coming off the bench five for seven from the field the efforts been there MJ Collins as well bounce inside he was wide open nice pick and roll oldest play in the book Stevens connect him with Battle of seer web one arm dish to potit here is Music Collins step back Rex Steiner rattles in and the bigger guy on it was able to shake it create some space PP fake for Stevens ball follows the Music shot Balls like one of those running backs who always falls forward hes always going forward whether its to get the rebound drive into the basket hes a really aggressive player best rebounder running back that falls forward please tell them to call my Steelers they need some help the next few games oh my goodness you really hard on this no I mean well lets focus on basketball here Im having way more Music fun talking the ball up for Tech Collins help potit with a paint touch out of the line people just fly off of potit when he goes when he turns and goes to the hole Amer number three small one big young man thats Noah Joness fourth foul yeah Jones is just outmatched in their sizewise height wise and shs but hes had some bad matchups today and of course thats where they missed Matt Rogers so much that we talked about him early in the game but not only is he productive but he gives them another big guy who knows how to play Down Low this an American team that has hung around this is a a larger lead for Virginia Tech that were seeing here at 16 points but Matt Rogers is second Team all Patriot league and hes not in the lineup today certainly making a different different or a big difference difference there with 16 points per game and a guy that shoots 51 from the field not being in for the American Eagles yeah thats the best in the Patriot League great offensive rebounder good shot Applause blocker Tyler nichel followed it whistle blue staying on this side of the floor another break hoky up 16 over American final nonconference game of the if theyre getting after it and building something of course theyve got four starters back but uh not all of them in the lineup right now because they theyve brought some good players in too but you get Rogers back on this team they are a theyre a threat theyre a contender in the in the Patriot League swing down low trying to get the layup to fall for Colin Smalls instead rolls away its interesting that ACC connection there for Dwayne Simpkins and Jackie Emanuel when we asked coach Simpkins what his favorite memory was playing in the ACC of course they played at different times but Dwayne Simpkins said my favorite one was beating North Carolina Maryland had just lost to Georgia Tech when they were a ranked team and then went and took down Carolina with a team that had red Wallace and Jerry stack house on it and he got to play an old cold Fieldhouse oh yeah side of some of the great games in college basketball history theyve been out a while now but something about the ACC particularly in basketball without the charter member in Maryland is a little bit different than it looked like when Dwayne Simpkins played yeah it doesnt seem the same Applause no Applause Rex Steiner still running the point for the hokes got the start today as two points and eight Music assists K lost the ball back down to the floor tieup points the way the hokes rexer just barely got that ball across in in the second limit and the bounce pass to kid got knocked away only 10 on the shot clock for Virginia Tech monies dont seem to be in any hurry either now they do swing it back around to Couture almost got it to go at the buzzer well coach Simpkins talked with us ma about Americans defensive effort and he wanted it to be better how would you grade them so far in this game I think its been about the same they they theyve done some good things theyve been aggressive theyve taken away the three ball pretty well but but theyve given up too high a percentage and thats been the story all Applause season still have held Virginia Tech to just three threes hes are three of 15 that gets washed away with a performance from Lin kid who has 25 and now 27 career high keeps getting added up for lin kid yeah and again you know in their defense they are playing without the the best center in the in the Patriot League 13 of 14 another double double for ly kid Stevens creating space just cant knock down the midrange and off Couture musle blows before the basket is no good yeah Baler web trying to get kid out of the lane right there Music 22 oh Lin kid with a chance to add on here to is already careerhigh at 27 points 21 Noah for the h been a good free throw shooter this year 86 coming into this game thats another positive surprise for Virginia Tech and by all accounts you listen to any of the coaches they all say the kid just works hard pun int accidental yeah I cant take credit I tried to take credit about you hey you could have lied I wouldnt have said anything 29 Points for ly kid Al for American this is another test before taking on UNBC block for kid Jones recovers another block this time though a bit too physical for the officials liking yeah I I think Baron had it he went straight up and then he he brought his arm down and that made Les Jones call that F correctly I told leson he looks like a much better official from this side of the floor when you got the headset on yeah instead of right instead of youre trying to win the game I think its the angle that I had all those years yeah are they happy to not have to argue with you anymore 100 oh no no I think they enjoyed it actually okay there were probably a few nights they didnt there were surprised some nights I didnt enjoy them either Laughter no good guys back around to Couture 18point lead for Virginia Tech most of that coming from Lyn kid who now has 31 points what a Music night rebound Jones sprous jump stop Mayo hes had a pretty quiet day but a pure shooter Jim Tex done a good job but J young got there a little bit late that time and he didnt need much Applause room working the clock down Music now Robbie Barons wide open Robbie bar just the fourth three of the night for Virginia Tech but Robbie Baron adding his first he is perfect from the field hasnt taken many shots ma thats just the second shot Robbie Baron has taken tonight yeah very unselfish its been hes been a force on defense came off the bench today with ma long getting the Applause start Ro clock rolling down Barons on the floor its high up called it stays with American so theyll have 21 to Work withans official another break hoky up by 20 out really well Clemsons been playing great basketball and Virginia and I missed the other one that was there Miami was Applause therei theyll be here in blackburg so Clemson A ranked team and then Miami a team that went to the final four last year story of the night for Virginia Tech has been the play of Lyn kid now on the bench 31 points 14 of 15 think an unsung hero that we could talk about Brandon rexer has the ball right now nine assists think it just his second start in his college career yeah hes had to go against a really quick guy the whole game and press most of the game Music certainly most of the second Music half shot clock down to three Tyler nickel needs to take it nothing but net really needs no room as long as he can catch it in Rhythm he is a serious threat to make it now five points for Tyler nickel Applause swing down low turnover westler getting a little more time I guess we may have seen the last of ly kid what a night he had 11 rebounds his fourth double double of the year only other player scoring in double figures for Virginia Tech MJ Collins came in with some valuable minutes off of the bench 12 points five for for seven still out there now here in the final two and A2 minutes Robbie Baron Robie double digit assist for Rex Applause ster so the Hokies taking on Wake Forest and make it nine days for Virginia Tech resuming ACC play remember they 1 and0 in the ACC after a win against Louisville but for league play to continue here is May hits another what do you think are the biggest things the hokeys might need to improve on after what youve seen out of them here in the first 12 games I think theyve addressed some things on the defensive end and they they know who they can count on I think the big question is who they can count on on the offensive in night in and night out they theyve had a lot of folks step up and have big games but so far its really been padulla Couture and kid and theyre theyre looking for that next score or two wesler looking for a way to back in pure lefthanded shot wesler this really help wesler get some confidence getting some playing time two 22er web has had a good game to the only player in double figures for American theres a push called on wesler 7755 this is such a a good win for Virginia Tech in terms of going into the holiday with a positive feeling going into league play on a positive note they played really well since they played the game at alurn also leading into a break for the team thatll likely be on the losing end of this one American upcoming schedule first game after this one will be be against UNBC then Lehigh Music play Patriot league has some good basketball Through The Years Buck Nowell and leeha and be and Colgate yeah Colgate picked to be the winner this year American pick to finish third Music so here are the teams that Dwayne Simpkins has to look forward to got a home game against Lehigh then on the road at Bucknell line for the h number 10 Brandon reer Rex Steiner first free throws of the night for the freshman Music bounce back out for Jones telegraphed by Collins Stevens there effort still there for Elijah Stevens cant find the bucket though as the hokes can start to jog through this 7755 impressive for Virginia Tech but historic night in Lin kids career HBY Baron kept the ball in bounds hump fake for Rex Steiner dish to Collins In and Out rattled all the way almost fell through Applause bounce inside Virginia Tech ball with the shot clock off check look at that field goal percentage Mac coming into this one 64 and you know most of that inflated by ly kit taking 15 shots and making 14 of them yeah and thats what we talked about right off the top the thing that American had struggled with they they play hard they execute got some offensive skills and of course they really missed Matt Rogers but giving up high percentage shots is what they had struggled with in Virginia Tech took advantage of that and took advantage of their size hok improved to 9 and3 on the season ACC play ahead for Virginia Tech American Falls to five and seven but a solid win for Virginia
