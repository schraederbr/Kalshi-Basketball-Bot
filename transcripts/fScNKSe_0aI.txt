Thank you Don Hes so old Hes also 23 Hes 30 days older than Tessa Ritter who just turned 23 this past Saturday Off we go from Charlottesville Because hes 23 they call him Captain America I was trying to figure out which one of you guys I should call Ank and which one I should call Captain America but I dont know if eithers a perfect fit Heres Witherspoon finding Pam Corin who lays it in And Pittsburgh with a good first possession cheering And you know Virginia their defensive numbers are pretty good but sometimes you watch them play and they really have a hard time containing dribble penetration Lewis from the wing Offensive rebound Ditter Its what Virginia does Second chance points for Malik Thomas And that is it Thats where they hurt you They get the ball off the board then they get it out Thats the best threepoint shot youre going to get And I was watching Malik before He missed eight straight threes He gets his first one Makes it Pittsburgh was in Clemson this past Saturday They lost by 11 They couldnt fly home on Saturday because of the snow They didnt fly back to Pittsburgh till Sunday and then Monday Travel to Charlottesville And theres Cam Corin knocking down just his ninth threepointer of the season cheering Hes got all five early for the Panthers for a Pit team that is exactly number 18 out of 18 in the conference during conference games in threepoint field goal percentage Aggressive take from Thomas deflected ball finds Corin Heres Demarco Miner with pit starting five starting five for tonight Starting at the one Demarco minor with myself starting at the two we got Simon Amari Witherspoon Starting at the three we got Black Cat himself Barry Dunn Alabama Spine Starting at the four we got Roman Steep the man And starting at the five we got Shaq Cam Corin heler and Hall are pretty good at this I think your jobs safe Youre safe I dont know Youre safe Well they they can play too Heres Witherspoon from 16 ft No good Rebound Thomas had a chance when they get off to a pretty good start Thats a travel Good officiating crew tonight Kip Kissinger Paul Cells and Keith Kimell Yeah these guys are really some of the best in the country Now that doesnt mean theyre good but theyre some theyre some of the best in the country Theyve worked final fours Im not going to pick on them You just did it Oh I did old habits Now Virginia in the manto man and they like to pressure They dont force a lot of turnovers but their pressure is they try to get you to play a little faster than you want to Hard cheering to make twos against Virginia but Pittsburgh having success early Roman Caleppas got an and one the ball Great position Virginia switching out at the top And we we talked about Roman Caleppa 66 220 and theres no way Don Hall hes 64 he weighs 200 but hes no match physical match for Caleppa inside thats one thing when you switch those screens youre going to need to get some help back in there thats a mismatch that hes going to take advantage of too strong and this is an area where Pit really struggles they have a tough time shooting free throws 17th in the conference in conference games at free throw percentage It has hurt the Panthers in almost every game Strong hedge leaves Bruno who kicks to the corner for Lewis to Ritter A second offensive rebound He lost it though and its out of bounds Into the pit bench goes Sam Lewis Pittsburgh ball Jim if youre Grun Low youre seven feet tall youre a foot from the basket Why would you pass it out for a three Yeah I think its something you practice and usually youre a little bit further away and so you want the three but when you get that close youre right Dan You have to finish it I know you didnt do that but I mean they can do that They can finish that in there Jim youre feeling feisty tonight The 900 tip off Youre throwing darts at the refs at your partner I wake up late Panthers three for five as Witherspoon attacks to the corner Dunning missed the three Long rebound pops up in the air and its out of bounds to Pittsburgh A pit keeps that ball but its very interesting because once again you see the dribble penetration and that time the defense came to help and they got a pit got a wide open threepoint shot and again they dont shoot the three very well but they could create some problems for the Cavaliers if they continue to beat the perimeter defense Ugo Aneno in the game for the Cavaliers Chance Mallalerie out there as well and Pit turns it over Jakari White also an early entry off Ryan ODMs bench Mallerie flips it forward to Ritter Thomas tough turnaround too Thats Malik Thomass cheering game He was the leading scorer in the West Coast Conference last year And the biggest best part of his game is getting the ball in there The midrange shots getting to the free throw line cheering or the manchild as Demarco Miner called him Closed off well by Ditter Corin cheering Thats not going to work Pittsburgh turns it over for the second time Now Virginia off to another slow start And part of it is theyve attempted six shots and four of them have been from beyond the arc And in conference play they only hit 31 out there Their last couple of games theyve shot over 50 inside Mallerie flips it up on the endo Kicks it back out The balls popping around for Virginia and Thomas is attacking but hes met at the rim by Barry Dunning Jr Heno didnt catch that ball cleanly yet but catch that and dunk it Again you have one of their seven foot guys right next to the cheering basket passing it out Panthers are holding their own on the interior right now Can they keep it going for the next 35 minutes Not from too much dribbling from Caleppa And ahead its Mallerie at the rim Boy Mallerie gives Virginia such a lift coming off the bench He gets things done Hes a little on the small side but he gets rebounds cheering He hustles He gets into plays He makes things happen Multiple steals in 12 different games this year To your point Jim he makes things happen Witherspoon tough step back Rick Town ahead White going baseline Lot of space for Mallerie They just look for that three and they as you said Dan they dont make a lot of threes They struggled in that area at BC Went 4 for 23 from deep 17 Still came from behind to beat Fost College by seven Thats a moving screen on Corin cheering You know Pittsburgh came out and ran the nicest play set you could run the first play and got a dunk And they havent gone back to the same type of movement And I dont I never quite understand If you run a really good play and you score lets run that again I think Mallerie got a knee in the thigh here as hes trying to get through that screen And you have to stand there if youre core and you cant lean your body forward and throw that arm out there Officials are going to call that every time Pittsburgh with three turnovers since they last scored Devin Tillis in the game for Ryan ODM White looked good the other day at BC This is Tillis from the corner They tell us sometimes he was hurt early in the season but I think he helps make them a much better team Well that time they got a great three look and they made it You know theyre going to get threes Theyre going to keep looking to get threes Big time score at UC Irvine Fun fact Jim 48 of their shots in ACC play are threes And Situs misses his first shot off Jeff Cables bench White looking for his introitis has the rebound and hes got the breakaway and he doesnt score And now here comes Virginia You got to shoot that one I agree Dan Lewis shoots it cheering Puts it in Jack Cables giving the same message you just delivered 10 nothing Virginia timeout pit Well be back in 30 We dont even count that When was the last time you played in the snow and built a snowman Jim 70 years Thats all The Panthers got off to a really good start but their offensive struggles have sort of bounced up again Its a foul on Tillis bumping Caleppa in the air Well he pushed Caleppa but Caleppa did you see him catch that ball I mean it was a very difficult catch and he was controlling the ball despite the fact that it was thrown poorly and he got fouled Anditis after an earful cheering from Cable throws it off the side of the backboard Did Anler get a piece of that Yes he did Yeno got it So thats if youre going to fake Lewis that gives Oneno a chance to take one big step and swap the thing And hes a big factor coming off the bench for him Hes a shot blocker a legitimate shot blocker an inside finisher cheering Mari Moore going to get more minutes tonight with Brandon Cummings out Enso gets his second of the trip No thats not going to work Theyre not going to work that Bonnie Ensos having a heck of a season defensively for this Virginia team Mallerie maintains possession Badgered by Miner on the perimeter Mallerie attacks scores I dont know how he got there or got it up Really that was this kid He makes plays He Der hasnt taken a shot tonight Mallerie unable to complete the threepoint play but he has impacted this game with his energy off the bench But Virginia they theyre really deep and they can play a number of different lineups Now they got their two point guards in the game right now Derritters on the bench Thea couldnt make the acrobatic catch and then Moore had it poked away in the corner Lewis comes up with a loose ball Look out Tillis pulls it back outside The BYU transfer Don Hall on the end drop Well its like he wasnt expecting the pass Well at the midrange there those usually thats why they catch and just pass When they try to fake the pass and go they usually are going to travel in that situation But its amazing to me that Ditter is not any part of this and theyre just you know theyre have no problem with these guys because they have depth As you said they got guys Ditter does have two offensive rebounds and two assists in the first nine minutes but no shot attempts Corin dead ends it off the bracket then rattles it through I love those shots Just an awful shot It hits the rim rim like it died and it goes in cheering If it was horse and he called it it would have been impressive Corins got seven of pits nine And now theres two inside for Johan Bruno Well Gruno did a great job getting himself positioned right on top of the basket And an excellent pass by Mallerie I mean you just look at these teams on paper and the size of Virginia and the way they get it to Bruno and Derritter and Oneno inside What Whats Pits game plan to try to match up with him Oh I think you have to try to drive the ball at the basket and force those big guys to come over and help But when they do that the guards drop down and Mallerie tip that one away again Got a mismatch inside here too Pittsburgh does get the switch on to Grunlow but that leaves Hall open up top Donning rises up for the rebound Rips it away from Mallerie It may have jammed his finger reaching in for that thing Malleries banged his thigh jammed his finger Hes having a tough first half Hes a pretty tough kid Hes in the thick of it Witherspoon Beautiful creation to Corin And thats what Im talking about If you can beat your guy on the perimeter the big guys come over and try to block the shot and that makes somebody open inside Well theyve been losing it on the way in That time he got in there and now they get the layup Theres going to be an interesting juxiposition all night as Ryan ODM keeps sending subs to the scorers table and Jeff Cable doesnt have that many options on his bench But heres a mismatch Tillis flips it inside Bruno draws the foul if thats on Corin Its his second and it is Thats something that Jeff Cable and company will have to deal with Meanwhile heres next Wednesday nights ACC Network basketball double header Jim Dan and I will be at Clemson for the 20th ranked Tigers hosting Virginia Tech Thats at 7 Eastern Then Wake Forest and Georgia Tech at McCamish Pavilion in Atlanta Like everything else both of these games are also available on the ESPN app Thats a week from tomorrow night on ACC Network You know the interesting thing Corin picked up that second foul and uh he headed to the Mullen was already at the scorers table to come in for him Well he went right to the locker room so I didnt see it What happened So Jeff didnt take him out because of the second foul He was taking him out anyway He just picked up that second foul before he can get him out of the cheering game Be interesting to see if we see him again in the next 840 Witherspoon forced into a lot of responsibility tonight Dunning nice finger roll When they dont lose it going in there theyre creating some problems for the Cavaliers Couple weeks ago we saw Pit miss 11 layups in the first half Theyre a little bit more efficient tonight White from the corner Got a hand on the rebound and its Ditter sticking it back up and in with applause the goending call Score two for Tess And again thats where youre in right there Dont pass it out Get to the basket Get to two Ritter just has such great hands as he goes up and then power dribbles and gets through that Hes a very physical player That kind of play Hes been a revelation in ACC play But youre right Jim Two seasons in the top Spanish league Hes got game Dick cheering hit by Grudo ahead of the pack Don Hall for Duke You can get in there but if you dont applause Thats a Grunlo can throw it I mean hes the third leading shot blocker in the ACC cheering Theyve got two really good shot blockers Well is the number two between Aneno and Grunelo Those two guys alone have more blocks this season than 15 of the other 17 ACC teams Just as a duo they are dynamic Dunning again puts his head down and yes he did He put his head down and picked his foot up Ryan ODM fired up by the Virginia defense plays like free throw line and then North Carolina They were outscored by 17 points and points off turnovers Theyre going to shoot a lot of threes They havent been making them in ACC play But as long as the wheels dont fall off in some other area they have enough depth and talent that they can win the game Oh we got a little miscommunication So cut a loose wheel right now It had fallen off Well now uh in in Ditters defense Jeff Cable was wide open and he was a pretty good shooter Out of eligibility and wearing the rock colors but other than that details details all details Four turnovers for Virginia half as many as Pittsburgh Panthers have been aggressive See Aleppo was fouled cheering by Gumlo this time Now weve seen guys from Pit drive the ball to the basket or be on fast breaks and pass it out because theyre worried about getting their shot blocked Well Ill tell you what Seal Up is not worried about that He gets going and hes going and he uses that 220 lb frame of him He goes right into Grunlow and forces the foul A little bit close incredible ball Caleppa coming on strong Double figures in 10 of his last 11 games and double doubles in three of his last four Yep Now hes not a great free throw shooter Only 60 in conference play Something to work on Another rebound for Ditter Cam corn on the bench with two fouls He is back on the bench after running to the locker room briefly Mismatch inside cheering Andra situs battling for position with Bruno Low Its Jakari White and a rebound for Derritter His third offensive board making his fourth Straightaway three wont go but a third chance coming for the Cavaliers Can UVA pay off this possession Its a foul on CF but staying here They just dont have the size inside to match up I mean look at the differentials here This five four five in six in Virginia cant make a three but they just keep getting it back Doesnt matter if you miss three threes if you get it back every time Back in the game Thomas throws it up and in And they end up with eight for three from the three and two points Again Thomas is really good going to the basket Very physical Curry Whites having fun out there playing defense fights through the seal up a screen Pick and pop And thats a foul on Virginia on the rebound action Its going to be on Thomas for ramming into Witherspoon Well Witherspoon is a guy that Jeff Cable thinks can really be a good player Hes a freshman Hes got good size Hes really athletic And hes a very good rebounder from the guard spot as he showed you right there Miner struggling to find someone to throw it into And that was very nearly a back court Throw it back there cheering Yeah but he caught it in the front court Almost fell backwards As long as your momentum carries you there you can do that Witherspoon Is he a leop just slipp slipped right out of his hands but he I mean theres Mallerie again is right around a play like that So the advantage here this is another turnover for Pit You never want a turnover Heres Corin back in the game But the Panthers they have allowed Virginia to get five steals and thats allowed the Cavaliers to get out and score seven fast break points which hasnt helped the pit call You know we spent some time talking today about how Ryan Odum has built this team with a guy like Ditter whos you know played two years of pro ball overseas and the transfers on Enso and Thomas as Ditter gets his second bucket for Chance Mallerie to assimilate into this group of veterans and be as impactful as he is from the backyard of John Paul Jones Arena is pretty incredible Hes just a tough little guy He makes a lot of things happen defensively offensively I mean you wouldnt think it but he gets offensive rebounds cheering 5 foot maybe 10 10 Pittsburgh turnovers Thomas a little hop skip and a jump No good for Ditter Pittsburgh clears Thats one Ditter usually makes Closing cheering in on four minutes to play in this first half Pit was up 73 and theyve been outscored 237 since cheering Witherspoon looking for a tough two Gets it to Corin playing with the two fouls Rebound Mallerie Tony Bennetts no longer the coach cheering but they still can DEFEND A NUMBER TRANSITION TO HIS special things Hes the loomest guy out there cheering Indraitis goes strong this time and finishes First two for Noyas Indraitis the Iowa State transfer But sometimes that happens when your point guard drives the ball all the way and scores Theres nobody cheering really back and so good job by Pit to push the ball by after taking it out of the basket See Donnie is 66 He cannot guard Ger Ger starts backing him down So theyre going to double team and then they make a very bad pass out That was for Jason Cable Indraitus counted in one Well Jason was open too Both Cable brothers and then recommitted the day after Ryan got the job Well hes got an advantage of playing with just big guys So everybodys worried about all these big guys hes got cheering He can sneak in there and get a bucket and theyre not helping them much off the big guys Virginia by 10 Pittsburgh is now just one for four from the line Theyre also one of four from three Ugo Onianso Hes got size and Court didnt want a foul and he did a decent job defending considering the circumstances The call on the floor is Virginia basketball Thats a shot that really has to make I mean hes going against a guy with two fouls and hes got a few inches on him anyway And you I mean your big guy has to make that shot Now hes not in there for his offense but thats a shot that hes got to make Corin back to the bench Two and a half to play in the opening half Allie a nice diving pass to Tillis who was fouled Theres so many mismatches out there Pittsburghs playing 62 three 64 63 I mean its its very tough They have to be physical They have to try to be physical but then youre going to get in foul trouble too Mallerie with a right hand for two assists were talking about They dont want to leave on Yenzo and so Mallerie makes him pay for it Mallerie is four for five off the bench eight points He also has three assists Not to mention the two steels Caleppa kicks it out Rise and fire three Miner cant connect Mallerie continuing to do special stuff but then throws it away He was in again He could have had that one Well even if he missed it Onenso was right there Mari Moore thwarted by Anenzo Hes worried about Onenso blocking the shot cheering Lewis has his pocket kick by Miner DeMarco Miner to the basket applause Thats really a good play by Miner Thats hard to make that play in that foul and he just got it clean as you can get it Multiple steals nine times this year for Polo Miner Minute to go Opening half Uhoh Connie knocks down the three Despite a lot of the doubters you watch him before the game hes out there shooting He can make them cheering Now hes going to think he can make a lot of them So I dont know Thats not always a good thing Your sevenfooter makes a three cheering If he can make that shot throughout the rest of his career hell make a lot of money See Alppa blocked by Onenso This is where he makes his money He just cant score inside against cheering him Hes just Caleppa is strong but hes only 66 And on the end youre right Hes only 7 ft tall cheering and long arm Hes like inspect gadget with those arms 8 seconds remaining in the half Hall out there with the Ritter White on the ino and Lewis and Pittsburgh gives the foul Thats their sixth team foul of the half Its also the second foul on Demarco Miner I dont know that Id want Miner given how thin they are on the back court given a foul Oh pick comes up with a steal intricitus to see with four TO MINER CORNER THREE Short rebound D to Ritter And that is how the first half ends Thats not what Ryan drew up Well you get a twoon one fast break Why do you threw a three when youre not a good shooter Why dont you go in and get a layup And you know you close the gap for 30 teams So they have to try to drive and thats not a good formula against Virginia Dare I ask whats the key for Pittsburgh What do you think Jeff Cable talked about at halftime Well they got to make some shots You know I dont think their defense has been that bad Now if Jitters going to have that much time and space hes going to score 30 like he did against Notre Dame Well if you dont double him hes going to score He knows how to score down there But Pittsburgh offensively they just have to keep mo move the big guys around Move them around and then go to the basket But its pretty solid This is a Virginia team that averages 84 points a game Theyre held to 33 in the first half but the Panthers just struggle to score Pit made a three early hadnt made one since Thats a tough turnaround for Witherspoon Thats the only shots Pittsburgh is making very difficult shots and youre not going to make a high percentage of those shots First two of the game for Omari Witherspoon cheering Hes looking for help Gets it to Grunlow in the corner Virginia looking to get to 19 and three tonight cheering back here at JPJ this weekend for Syracuse who lost last night Chapel Hill Thats number three on Corin Thats bad news for the Panthers But its just this is a really tough matchup And when you have two fouls you just keep your hands out of it You just you know hes trying to pass the ball Hes not trying to shoot the ball So theres no reason to be going after it like that Corin didnt realize that theyre trying to get him out of the game Jeff Cable coming onto the floor and frustrated that it wasnt well communicated Well music now theyre really small Well he has to talk to him Calm down He cant get involved He cant clear fouls like that They dont have enough inside So if you want to assign traditional positions to this lineup I think CP is the center Dunning the power forward and Ditters getting offensive rebounds against everybody Ditter is like 69 and hes in there Hes going against guys who are 65 and 6 6 or smaller or smaller Hes a good rebounder and hes going against no size So and hes and hes not skinny either No hes 23 years old Hes a physical man Thats what he is And you notice that when you see him in person for the first time He does not look like a freshman in college for sure The Ritter straight up and the foul is on who Dunning I mean Dunning was I mean hes doing the best he can Hes got the Ritter blocked out but the Ritters just too big necessary And either one of those would apply in that situation I think ironically he might have come over the back to get the tip but you know thats not relevant cheering when the finish of the play So flagrant one on Dunning The Raider one for two at the line And Virginia as a team now two of five from the free throw line Two teams combined are three for nine Whats going on here Grunlo sets the screen Thomas going downhill Kicks it out Tester Ritter Virginia just peppering the offensive boards I believe Thomas has a chance for a threepoint play They just cannot cheering compete on the boards with this team which they Pittsburgh plays pretty good defense Theyre trying theyre doing a good job keeping further Theyre forcing missed shots They cannot get the rebound Virginia did a nice job moving the ball and that caused Pit to have to move and so it put Virginia in really good position to go after that offensive rebound What do you guys notice about the way Virginia attacks the offensive glass Well theyre just big more physical and they go get it They try to go get the ball Well they send four guys I mean a couple of them are very big guys Pick gets a rebound Its almost fortunate It kind of bounces their way After the steal from Lewis Virginia could not capitalize but its a 17point game 2 and 12 minutes into the start of the second half Leading score for Pittsburgh is Corin with nine Hes back out there with the three fouls cheering Witherspoon fouled by Grunlow Number two on Johan And that might be a really good strategy if Pit can make some free throws As long as the two big guys are in the game they should move the ball as theyre doing and then drive it and try to get to the foul line which theyre really not very good there either So thats not a a a really winning strategy but at least it gives him an opportunity to get some points on the board Spoon 63 at the line this season Here is this weekends ACC Network gymnastics schedule Saturday number 20 Cal squares off against number 16 Clemson 6 Eastern 3 Pacific And then Sunday wrap up the weekend with the tobacco road rivalry Number 12 North Carolina number 22 NC State 400 on Sunday afternoon Both meets are also available like everything else on the ESPN app Well there you go Spoon knocks them both down And theres Pit Theres been nothing wrong with their effort tonight I say their defense has been pretty solid Theyve had a tough time getting defensive rebounds but Virginias one of the best offensive rebounding teams in the country so thats not a surprise Only Tennessee and Florida rebound a higher percentage of the offensive board opportunities than Virginia in Division 1 college basketball 365 programs Virginias number three on missed it short with a left and the rebound just finds Sam Lewis who wasnt even looking for it but then a steal ahead with a two hand stop they finally got the ball and a steal off the rebound didnt get a basket Ritter for three thats his first he had his first threepoint basket in his last nine tries puts him into double figures cheering for the 18th time this season in 22 games One rebound away from another double double Miner step back over Hall Got it And Miner hes pretty good with that step back Hall is 64 as hes got four or five inches on Miner But Meyer created just enough space to squeeze that one off cheering Nice answer from Pittsburgh trying to stay with it within range Catching it rhythm Thomas blocked from behind Witherspoon the other way for the Panthers Caleppa throws it away now He waited too long Thomas sets up Lewis triples it home Well you know its got to frustrate Jeff Cable You thought Caleppa was going to have a layup but he waited too long on it and then he lost the ball So those you lose those two and then Virginia goes down and hits a three Miner short this time D Ritter has the double double You better stop him Hes going all the way Third double double of the season for Tester Ritter with 15 minutes remaining And Dandy your point about Jeff Cable being frustrated that has been a common theme for him this season Unfortunately he couldnt wait to get that one up there after the first one in the first half He was going 5 and a4 minutes into the second half Virginia by 16 in these last three years Well Jeff Cable took over a pit program that was in absolute disarray and thats being kind and they really they really built it up Theyve you know the last couple years if it wasnt for bad luck they wouldnt have any luck at all But his guys go out there and they keep fighting Barry Dy Jr cant connect from three Its Virginia ball Its just hard I mean they dont have they cant play many guys The guys are playing usually against people who are taller than they are Dunning is a guy who can score but he has struggled as has his teammates from long range And look there are a lot of fans around the ACC that may not know the name Deshawn Jackson but he was brought into pit to be the centerpiece of this team at 611 transfer from Iowa State out definitely with a heart issue They really miss him The fact that hes not involved changed everything for the outlook of this years big program Yet they keep fighting They have good spirited shoot around today Corin sets up Miner passes up the look Pretty good defense from Virginia Theyre doing a great job getting back out to those shooters Dangerous throws it in That was a great defensive possession and Pittsburgh scored I mean you know its its crazy sometimes the way that happens A really tough shot but andrew Sidus interestingly enough in conference play is Pitts best percentage threepoint shooter Panthers four of six from the floor in the second half Problem is Virginias gotten twice as many shot attempts Boy Cor came really close that time to the steel or to his fourth foul or both Foul Stunning grabs a rebound and that he sneaks in Its been a while since he impacted the game with some thievery Well its been a while since hes been in GREENS cheering one way or the other Defense offense rebound something He gets something done If hes in the game you got to be aware that hes out there And Dunning just wasnt looking Hes turning putting the ball on the deck right away And Mallerie just took it Four steals for Mallerie Two shy of his season high By the way hes also number two in the league in assist turnover ratio His teammate Don Hall is number one Theres again he gets back in and gets another Mallerie flips it inside and Gruno brought the ball down Yeah you just cannot do that Just turn around and dunk it Anditis doesnt cheering get away with a push off Offensive foul Look at ourselves in this first season Well he built it from scratch obviously and you hear that all the time in college in this day and age in college basketball but you know I think hes done a really good job getting a combination of a number of factors and everything plays out here He wanted size he got it Hes got really good guard play They got guys who could score and theyve got experience I mean maybe not in uh you know they only have one freshman who came from high school but they got guys who played professionally whove been leading scorers in other leagues Jim what are they missing I I just think its time I think they need some time to get everything together The thing that would concern me a little bit is their threepoint shooting in terms of tournament play down the road Uh if they can make shots in the NCAA tournament they can win games against anybody cuz theyve got what you have to Theyve got three big guys and they can play the five and four Uh Ditter can play five probably play three if he had to So theyve got versatility there They got two point guards They got scorers So I mean theyve got what you need to have but I think they need more time together to kind of get used to each other in terms of the long run Malleries a blur White flips it to But Virginia is now 14 of 21 from twopoint range Theyre going to score Theyre six of 22 from beyond the ark So theyre shooting over 65 from inside the arc 27 from outside Look here But Virginia was a good threepoint shooting team in nonconference play They were right around 40 It has taken a noticeable significant dip in conference play 31 12 coming into tonight and theyre just 6 for 22 this evening And thats over the back Thats the one thing that will concern me going forward Thursday night at 10 Eastern after our womens basketball double music header the Nothing But Neck Crew will break down the night in the ACC with highlights and analysis of every womens game and look ahead to the best matchups on the schedule for the weekend and early next week Weve got you covered all season right here on ACC Network and ESPN And Ryan ODM said today they have guys that can make threes They just have not been making enough threes but they its not like one or two guys They have three or four guys that can shoot threes Its just they need to make it a couple more Well and what theyre doing is theyre probably going to get their 19th win tonight and theyre still putting things together It doesnt help you to be the best team in the start of February No theyre going to be good at the end Thats when theyre going to be good Game one for Amari Witherspoon First couple of possessions it looked like the Panthers were going to be able to exploit Virginia by driving past them and getting into the lane but Virginia has cut that off pretty effectively for most of the game Second foul on Mallerie Thing I really like about Virginia they play nine guys So they can put any of these nine guys in there Its its very few teams can play nine They play seven then they may throw a couple guys in But these guys all can play Theyre all capable of being out there All nine of the guys everyone whos played has attempted a three tonight Five of the nine have made a three Jakari White not bashful And Dunning saved it in the corner and its scooped up by Witherspoon Now White is a guy who can really shoot it but hes still recovering from that wrist injury You can see hes got that wrap on his left wrist and he doesnt have full mobility with that wrist yet and so it makes it hard for him to shoot it Ryan ODM did say Thakari really looked like himself at Boston College on Saturday for the first time since the injury Well of course Ryan ODM has seen him much more than I have but he went through White did that one stretch of game where he made 12 threes in a row Hes he struggled since hes come down Jakaris 0 for six tonight Mallerie went to the bench Fallon Hall back out there for Virginia Corin diving inside Get on up in the air and draws the foul on the big man Well the good news is you get it inside The bad news is Onenso is standing there between you and the basket you heard man good you got to get him up in the air got a pump fake you just cant go in there and shoot away hes going to block it hes cheering big hes tall hes long hes got good time but you got to get into his body cheering Corin in double figures sets his 10th point well Corin is another one of those guys he and they really play hard on the inside the entire pit team But you know the missing comes but more importantly you mentioned earlier Shawn Jackson he was going to be their center He was going to be enable corn to play forward Philippa to play forward so that they would have a legitimate big presence and that is just crushed their team not having him and he played all last year Papa got hurt that changed things too Hes out for the rest of the season after having knee surgery Hall extra pass to the corner The shot clock violation Really good defense by Pittsburgh They There was three or four opportunities there and they covered it They did an unbelievable job getting back in Not only did music they hit 14 turnovers theyve missed a couple layups Theyre not shooting the three well They are still in this game I mean theres a lot of time left and it would it would be a big turnaround for the Panthers but they havent been blown out They keep fighting cheering And both teams are struggling shooting the three Thats the whole key Virginia makes some threes This a different game That was not the out of the timeout play there Thats not the one they drew up Lewis steps into it knocks it cheering down Thats only the seventh threepoint basket for Virginia in the game And theyre in conference play theyre number three in the league in threepointers made So for the most part the Panthers have defended that pretty well Averaging over 10 made threes per game for the season Witherspoon sets up Harry Dunning Jr Pittsburgh just cant buy a bucket from that corner And that was a wide open shot You can run a good offense a good set and you get that shot and you dont make it Its like not good cheering Virginia popping it around Thomas driving it Corin playing with the three fouls Now its Hall with four to beat the buzzer Comes another one for Lewis Jim you said it Jim They got a lot of different guys who can make a three And that was not very much offense but they made the shot So its good offense Just like that a 12point lead becomes an 18point lead in a couple possessions Well Virginia knocks down a couple threes Pit misses them Anditis needs it He got fouled They call the fellow Malik Boston College Notre Dame Georgia Tech Wake Forest and Pit with half of the conference season remaining And as you say only 15 teams go So 16 17 and 18 are not And youve got a couple of three win teams there as well cheering And theres Bacon on the line here Bacon on this cheering But hey this isnt three free throws I dont know what the fine print is but I think if you get two misses you get bacon You got to miss two in a row Are you sure Positive Okay you read the fine print We missed two out of three Dan youre right Intritis on the reload Knocks down the three Its a fourpoint trip for Neyas Misses two out of three from the line and then buries a three Never understood that Its rare to get a fourpoint play when you make the free throw before you make the three laughter Very good point Now they got a mismatch Jerritter is matched up against Miner He needs to get to the basket Paul Henman looking for a shot but cheering he throws that one in for his 900th career point See and this is what were talking about and theyre making threes suddenly they really become an offensive juggernaut I mean because theyre theyre shooting 14 for 23 inside the ark Its its their threepoint shooting Theyve got a lot of guys capable and some nights theyre going to all be making them Theyre going to have a huge night All the six different Cavaliere to make a three today led by Lewis whos four of seven And really the numbers are even better if you exclude Jakari White being 0 for five Thats not going to bounce in Thats a heck of a rebound for Ditter unless they call him for the foul and its going to go on Caleppa music Now the interesting thing with Roman Cppa is he is really up against it because of the size of the Cavaliers music Caleppa who has had double doubles in three of his last four games and the only game where he didnt have a double double he had nine rebounds He has one rebound today Virginia just too big Theyre big theyre fast theyre skilled theyre experienced They got a freshman spark plug off the bench named Chase Maller Uh Chance Mallerie Does Pit have one final push in them in these last five minutes to try to make this respectable late again Brandon Cummings not available tonight to not make the trip The Ritter ended up on his backside Seleips cheering it to the corner and Miner bags the three You know sometimes this shot looks great and then the next time he throws it up crazy and doesnt go anywhere but that was perfect release Thats good ball movement by the Panthers Third assist for Caleppa whos a nice young player I mean Pitt has some pieces Its why they continue to compete and well coached White Caleppa got a piece of that one to Ritter kind of casually tossed that up hanging on Witherspoons back Miner not this time Caleppa heard you Dan Hes trying to get some rebounds Thats his second offensive rebound of the evening Oh Ditter blocked it right off Witherspoon out of bounds to Virginia Its a heck of a play from the big Belgian A week from tomorrow next Wednesday night the ACC Network basketball double header features Virginia Tech and 20th ranked Clemson at 7 And then at 900 from Atlanta Wake Forest and Georgia Tech Thats a week from tomorrow night on the ACC Network and on the ESPN app 14point game as we tick towards four minutes to go Virginia led by 13 at the half and it has been a doubledigit lead throughout the second half Lewis has been the hot hand Mallers had a nice night too Great ball movement Thats just when theyre going to move the ball that quickly Its just hard to cover everybody I think one of the keys is White getting going again Hes just struggled since hes been back and hes still not making shots and he was a prolific shot maker cheering till he went out All of a sudden Virginias made four of its last five from deep Theyve got double digit threes for the 13th time this season Cavaliers by 17 Really know what to say about that Dan music lets talk tournament resume Well Virginia you know theyve theyve played obviously very well Theyre you know four quad one wins and their net ranking at 18 You know that doesnt mean as much as the other teams You know the net ranking of the team you beat is actually more important than your own but Virginias got themselves in a situation where they could very easily be a top four seed in the NCA tournament Of course thats still six weeks away Virginia with only three more ACC road games at Florida State at Georgia Tech and then the late February date at Duke Boy they just continue to pull down the offensive rebounds Mallerie fouled by Andraitis This game is all about offensive reboundings and getting buckets and getting fouled throwing it out and getting threes I mean theyre just too big and too strong for Pittsburgh Pittsburghs doing the best they can playing for defense and then cannot get the rebounds 13 offensive rebounds now for Virginia and theyre just three for seven from the line Meanwhile our Thursday night womens basketball music play for K double header right here on the network in the ESPN app 25th ranked North Carolina hosting Clemson at 6 Eastern Then Florida State will be in Raleigh to battle the Wolfpack Bacon for 0 for two for the home team or is it just the road team I think its just the road team but its a fair question Jim Im pretty sure thats what it is Pittsburgh heads back to the Steel City after this one to take on SMU on Saturday cheering SMU battling NC State Good ball game tonight in Dallas Theres a three Seal up is a pretty good threepoint shooter when hes got some time and some room Eight points for the Australian Caleppa And its a 14point game with two minutes to play They just wont go away Theyre going to fight you the whole way Pittsburgh is 5 for 10 from three in the second half Thats a block from Caleppa Pittsburgh needs points and they need them quick Jeff Cables got a sheepish grin on his face cheering Miner pulls the trigger and run low deflects the rebound to Tillis ahead to Lewis cheering HAMILTON Now I know Miner is trying to stop the play but a sixfoot guy is not going to block that shot on the fast break I think coach Owens leaving White in the game to see if he can get him some Yeah buckets just to see if he can get going He was a big part of their early season making shots and he hasnt made him kind of hanging his head a little bit but you know to his credit hes taking shots Hes trying to get there Hes played tough defense but hes continuing to shake his head offensively Hes 0 for eight 0 for seven from three Theyre going to need him Well but if youre not making shots then you find another way to help your team And I think hes done that can I Hes trying Feel like that threepoint play was probably the the knockout punch and Ditus with other ideas But theres not enough time left Pittsburgh just cant score enough It doesnt matter what happens Good Chance Mallerie gets a nice hand as he departs 11 points had four steals three assists drew an offensive foul Theres Pittsburgh with a season high 17 turnovers tonight cheering which was one of the reasons why theyre down by 17 points Virginias going to be 19 and three in 37 seconds Johan Duro makes it a 20point game Now hes seven guys whove made a three tonight Correct cheering Actually eight Eight Okay Everybody except Jakari White that has played for Virginia has made one Thats a little bit of depth from the threepoint range I know it doesnt work this way but if you remove Whites 0 for seven then Virginias 11 for 24 Well it doesnt work that way cheering What a job Ryan ODM has done in year one applause Hes really put together a good basketball team Size depth point guards shooting guards guys that can score Really done a great job Cavaliers win it by 20 6747 is the final
