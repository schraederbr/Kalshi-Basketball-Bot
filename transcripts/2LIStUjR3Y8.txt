confidence for his own offense So far so good especially over these last four games A veteran officiating crew Lee Cassell John Gaffne and Brian OConnell Wade controls the opening tip Its Miller against Cal Right away Spillers right away Youll see Wake Forest run towards Juke Harris Hes the guy at the end of the shot clock that makes things happen But SMU multiple guys on the floor that can make different decisions Its the big three BJ Edwards Boopy Miller Jeron Pierre Jr those three guys are the ones to keep an eye on Boopy greeted by a course of booze BJ Edwards to the tip The tip in no good by Catu All five SW starters average double figures in scoring Juke counters makes it go for Wake Forest 20 points per game One of the most improved players in Division One Oh theres no question about it Hes going to be first in line for most improved player in the Atlantic Coast Thats for sure But even over his last three games even better Close to 24 points shooting 50 And Jim Pia Jr can light it up as well Yeah he was the scoring champ and the player of the year in Conference USA last year for Jacksonville State See a lot of Wake Forest trying to get some movement side to side and using E IU in ball screens Hes going to be able to find opportunities but J Carris at 67 68 Hes grown four or five in since getting to college He has been terrific all season long Look for him to operate in that 15t range Hes got the first five for Wake Forest Had 15 and nine in the Saturday win against Florida State Booze for Boopy Miller He get to down low Thats going to be a challenge for Wake Forest They have struggled all season against bigs and bigs with size Absolutely And Cooper Cooper Schwigger listed at 610 That he that looks generous beside absolutely massive in the paint Every bit of 72 Got to do your early work against him Schweer making his second straight start Thats Miles Golden from three the Purdue transfer and son of former NFL linebacker Roosevelt Co Theres BJ Edwards His scoring up considerably this year and hes got news He had 20 points recently in a game at Duke Just a nice player One of the best defenders in the conference towards the top in steals And I like the pace this game is being played at Both teams willing to get up and down the floor averaging north of 80 points a game should be alive for some really fun basketball Miller the three and that silences the crowd I asked him before the game how are you going to deal with the bruise and the reaction He said Oh no I feed off that stuff First thing youre going to do too if youre going to double team the bigs Nice play draws the foul on the recognition to take advantage of the mismatch You get a switch against 72 You need to drag him out and attack him with your quickness This is what Cal has done well over the last four games You get the switch You play off two feet Nice up and under move Youll get two free throws Steve Forbes felt Cal was too passive too differential early in the season Hes now more aggressive seeking his own shot Well you come in with a handful of transfers and the first guy you see when you walk in is Jude Harris Well thats going to be your score Then you have Miles Coleman who comes from Purdue Then you have Trayvon Spillers whos a dog on the offensive end of the floor in the defensive end of the floor Youre thinking well I have to fit in Thats not how coach Forbes has had his guards play Landis Williams even Boopy Melo going back to Tyreek All guards that are assertive looking for their own offense first All those guys all conference players Hunter Salis too A turnover there by Jaden Tunes the freshman Theres Cal Moose Fourth school in four years Started at Lamar and went the Apple Cup circuit with Washington and Wazu Spillers no good Tons the rebound cheering Miller again Hes hearing it every time Edwards knocks down the three 34 from three this cheering year for BJ Edwards Hes got five and he is a pest on the ball Like I said one of the best on ball defenders in the league BJ Edwards a Knoxville Tennessee native started his career for the balls and Indianas happy that hes down in Dallas now applause Coven able to draw the foul on Cory Washington Washington an all conference selection at both Witchah State and St Peters Its a nice player Saw him last year at Witchah State Ended up with 20 plus points and 14 plus rebounds This is a guy who really boards for his position Playing the four here for SMU cuz theyre playing fast But just a guy who fits really well a connective piece beside all these guards Cal got a little bit of room on the big and he knocks down the triple Weve got some offense today SMUs made its last five from the field cheering and they get a foul on Kov Fast start for a late game at the Joel SMU and Wake Leonard Hamilton let him use his gym as a personal workout guy in Miami when Leonard Hamilton was the head coach there took a job later with nice helpside block Took a job later at Florida State with Leonard Hamilton Was there for a while gets back into college coaching and the success has been great Turnover by Boopy Miller Yeah by the way told the Leonard Hamilton story He was trying to find a gym for his clients when Hamilton was the coach at Miami and he said Hey Ill pay you if I can use the gym to teach my clients and work on their shot And Leonard Hamilton gave him a quizzical look for about 30 seconds didnt say a word then handed him the keys to the gym as Kovven airballs the three And he said Listen you can use it whenever you want You dont have to pay me but if you see my guys in there feel free to help them out too Thats right And if they happen to walk in the gym just let them hop in and work out Hows that sound Was working out Glenn Rice made an allstar team with the Charlotte Hornets Big time shooter One of the best tombs down low Hes a wild card for an SMU team that doesnt get a whole lot of production from the bench Absolutely Hes had games where hes played really well really skilled freshman about 610 big body shoots a decent ball from three Percentages arent great but you can see the potential just starting to scratch the surface Nice move by Juke Harris really fighting for that down low Hes got seven I hope youre enjoying it now for us fans because J Harris has a real shot Good defense Were off and running Cover throws it down Chin at the rim stuff cheering Panish standby for all call laughter Never a guy that lacks for athleticism even at Purdue Pierre often looks for a shot This time kicks it back to BJ Edwards whos had the hot hand early Hes got eights A young man with two triple doubles this season You mentioned his defensive prowess ACC leader in steals Harris getting to the tin Knocked out of bounds by Miller Everywhere in nice drive How about the defensive intensity Theyre keeping it on the sideline Tri on Spillers And look at that Oh My goodness Somebody called Luke Skywalk Thats got to show up this weekend Chin at the rim with some force for Miles Coleman What a twoman game Calm bumped by Miller to the delight of this Wake Forest crowd First foul on Boopy Miller the former Deak Its a game of guards This one especially Calme super quick in the open floor with the ball in his hands Boopy Miller not many quicker Its an exciting matchup Heres the deal too And these small guards dont usually move on all that quick to the next level So what you end up getting is guys that get older in college What pass Omaha balloon SMU wants to play fast Theres the love Germaine ONeal Jr cant finish And yes that is the son of the six NBA Allstar How about the athleticism to just catch that ball and be around them That sequence tells you how SMU wants to play Beloo Another three Not there The rebound to ONeal SMU wants to play fast They get a third of their points in transition in their wins Wake is very comfortable making this a five on five half court game Edwards traveled Four turnovers for SMU Thats offset their hot shooting Seven of 11 from the field Four of four from three One thing to keep an eye on while youre watching this game When Yikatu gets the ball on the block theyre sending a second defender but theyre never sending another guard So its going to be post on post Theyre going to send two post players his way And the activity on the rest of the floor is so critical for Wake Forest today as they move forward throughout the course of this game You have to be active Thats a page out of the old Tony Bennett packline playbook Beloo playing above the rim The former McDonalds AllAmerican Just a terrific pass And Belaloo great cut Easy finish Well they went from below to just boo real fast Sam Walters junior who played at Michigan and Bama born and red in the game for SMU Pierre no good He looks for his shot 17 a game applause Calm sawu and retreats Mai Mason Shot clock at 10 Schweagger hard drive and it goes in for the Valpo transfer I love it Thats a grown man move Get baseline pass the first defender Play straight up through the defenders chest Nice finish by Swagger Ron Pierre Jr scored in double figures in all 18 games this season Its been relentless for Miller Pierre left it short ONeil Jr tracks it down Wake has struggled on the glass this year Walters catch and release three Hey Walters is a guy transferred from Michigan played with Alabama before that never really found his rhythm in college Not shooting great percentages but hes one of those guys that can get hot hit two or three Four for 15 from three on the season but 37 last year with Michigan 39 as a freshman at Alabama Had some back injuries that halted halted him last year Heres Miller from 15 That goes five for Boopy Miller Thats where hes most comfortable about 15 ft You saw the damage he did off the feed from Mason Thats just really good Low man has to come over a little bit further to cut off the roll guy Miller draws the cheering foul plus the bucket Thats the speed of a Miller Its incredibly quick Andy Enfield beside himself right now with his guys on the defensive end But Poopy Miller behind the back through the legs makes it happen Four so far today Oh excuse me Three of three so far today He has been terrific here early An outstanding free throw shooter 89 Although in that Virginia Tech game last week he was 11 of 16 from the line Miller gets a breather SMU brings some pressure SMU will go 221 back into a 23 zone Theyre active and they they usually do this when they have two bigs in the ball game Jaden Tombs and Cemetu on the bottom of this two3 zone They dont feel like they can guard man with those two playing at the same on the three Big offensive rebound by Omaha Belaloo Wake amongst the worst in the ACC in offensive rebounding percentage but Draymond Spillers uncontested down the lane Thats big time Youre up against a 23 You hit the middle When you have somebody that can attack the rim you better get out of the way when the trains come through Here is Germaine ONeal Jr seven and ready Now BJ Edwards Neil the son of the six NBA all fades from the baseline Weve seen dad do that Yeah we have And Andy Infield thats one of those No no no no Great shots Thats what that was Mason too strong on the three ONeal there for the rebound Im a fan of Germaine ONeal Jr This is a guy his games not all the way refined yet Nice split Edwards to long too many steps I think he took three too many steps But Germaine ONeal Jr this is a guy just got away with that Thats right Hey how real quick You go up against a two3 get him out of position Trey von spillers up up and away They felt that in Turkey That is where Yigato was from 72 center for SMU Co Great position cheering Thats how you pierce the two three zone isnt it Theyve done a nice job so far And when you swing the ball from side to side that zone loosens up a little bit Edwards not there Offensive rebounding Golu and a foul down low It is on Sebastian Aens And I have to compliment Wake Forest Their activity on the defensive end of the floor has been pretty good so far but its really been superior play making at times for SMUs guards who you dont have to call much Those guys just figure it out So much talent on the offensive end of the floor for the Mustangs Crisp basketball Both teams have assisted on the vast majority of their buckets Eight assists for SMU on 11 made field goals Nine assist for Wake on 11 made field goals We have a foul on Mai Mason Its his first fourth team foul Say this the size discrepancy at the four and five spots is readily evident with these two teams applause And out of bounds Wake Forest and thats been a concern for Wake all season long They have not had the type of size theyve had the last couple of years to match up with some of these bigger teams down low And that was the loudest point of emphasis I heard today at shoot around Make sure you finish possessions out so we can play quickly Thats just lazy Edwards the ACC leader in he is fouled at the rim We will step aside Akens picks up his second foul ACC men of the net So really we can talk about quad systems all we want Anishh but at the same time we really dont know what its going to finalize as until the march time comes to call But EJ Edwards played well so far He is off to a terrific start 10 points to lead all scorers A threeyear starter for SMU and hes the head of the defensive snake Spillers over Eatu offensive rebound Coven poked loose on the ground We get a tie up Jump ball Possession arrow to Wake You know whats interesting is the first thing that Andy Enfield talked about with Cory Washington was he just does winning stuff consistently Hes always the first guy to the floor Hes always doing those little things and and whenever you have so many ball dominant guards on the roster you need somebody that does those winning things thats willing to buy into his role This is a guy playing a little bit out of position but hes just so valuable even though his numbers arent super loud Yeah Not a guy that you have to create offense for necessarily Absolutely Miller getting ready to check back in Here is Pierre Hes always looking for his shot cheering Double teamed Edwards with five Works the baseline Theres Washington with the shot clock running down and its knocked out of bounds but we get a foul on Spillers And thats disheartening if youre wait for us because that was a quality defensive possession Were going to take a look And whenever youre playing for Wake Forest you have to finish your possessions out because you are smaller You need to grab you need to grab the ball and hang on with two because you are outsized by 56 in from Yigolu And Trayvon Spillers whos a junkyard dog type of player you have to finish possessions Steve Forbes was kind enough to let us into his film session today Not to reveal all the state secrets but there was an emphasis on his guards helping to rebound tonight They know SMU has the size but Steve Forbes knows for his team to rebound and to make up what is right now a minus 7 margin on the glass in league games they need help from the guards Absolutely Just float around the basketball get to the free throw line and if one of your bigs gets it get to that outlet spot Nice play Nice pass Holton cant finish A foul down low Washington just got teed up Saturday the ACC Network has a mens basketball double header for you It starts at noon Eastern Pit travels to number 18 Clemson Tigers losing earlier tonight at home against NC State and then UNC Tough tough West Coast swing losses to Stanford and music Cal They go to Georgia Tech on Saturday Now for Washington the technical cheering also counts as a personal foul So his foul ledger jumps from one to three And again you got to remember SU doesnt get a whole lot from its bench So this may be a game where they need a little more from Tombs at least consistency Maybe ONeals got to step up You know its an interesting roster makeup for SNU Its a lot of old guys and then it goes straight from seniors to freshman Theres not a whole lot of guys in those middle sophomore and junior years Strong recruiting class though Top tech class that Andy Anfield brought in Really good Really good with a lot of potential moving forward A lot of it has to do with Jaden Tombs and how talented he is but weve already seen Ger Germaine ONeal Jr a guy whos not the most refined offensively but is an elite defender already Theres a lot to look forward to if youre an SMU cheering fan Tombs and ONeal top 100 prospects Shot clock winding down Calmese lets it fly Harris the offensive rebound over to count it cheering I like games with offense How about Juke Harris who has been fantastic this season so far Quick offensive rebound You got to finish possessions Gets a freshman off his feet Drew Harris strong move Has really improved his body I I think if youre going to point at one singular thing for Drew Harris he grew a couple inches and then it looks like hes added 20 pounds This is a guy whos really worked on his body Its been disciplined last offseason and youre seeing it pay the dividends over the course of this ACC season Yeah hes in double figures now as hes been in every game this season He getu to Tombs Thats the high low action the big big action I should say with Sati Golu and Tombs That was another point of emphasis right You have to drop You send that second player down You have to drop as a defender J Paris a second too late ends up in the layup quiet in this first half Another steal by Edwards Accelerates blocked by Coleman He got that off his chest He jumped too high I thought he was going to use his face to block that one And if youre Wake Forest that rotation has to be quicker Drew Harris not there in time You send that second player and then you have a steal in transition and BJ Edwards I thought he should have gotten rid of this one but look how high Paul is Thats a volleyball spider Edwards off the shot fake in and out snatched out of the air by Spillers They need him to do more of that Wake has missed its last seven from three Hold it through the three using the window Talk about athleticism right So athletic He keeps his balance despite the defense pulling the chair Still able to finish among the trees cheering More booze for Boopy Miller Edwards out of the double The three goes That is the freshman BJ Davis Ray Just his third three of the year Young player out of St Louis Cal at the other end cannot answer Spillers the offensive rebound Schwagger trying to back down to 72 Turf Tombs gets in there Jump ball this time to SMU And here you have to do a better job of realizing where the helps going to come from That is not great offensive decision making Youre going up against 72 and SMUs constantly digging If youre not going to beat him with your quickness get the ball out Set a ball screen Use your quickness as a team Just going flippantly through the lane Theres too much size and length on this SMU team Now possession arrow forest Begy pardon Edwards in the passing lane again Hes got a couple of trailers Instead he draws the foul on Calish About SMU on the defensive end of the floor BJ Edwards has been everywhere so far Hes in the passing lanes You turn your head Hes finding the basketball And in transition if youre counties just get back and play straight up Make him hit a difficult shot behind you Four steals already cheering for Edwards in the first half Only Vanderbilts Duke Miles came into tonight averaging more steals for a power conference player And you see he just takes advantage opportunity You turn your back he swarms to the ball Just so active on that end of the floor And I talked to him earlier this season This is a guy that went to Tennessee didnt get to play much but he said he picked up a lot of good habits playing under Rick Barnes as far as film study understanding where I can take advantage of opposing offenses And buddy its paying off here at SMU Harris with 11 to lead Wake there Left it short Its tipped to Miller Tombs lets it fly and there was a reason he was open cheering and applause They say he can hit that shot Had a wrist injury early in the year SMU shooting 50 Yes The Hornets too Hornets too If you have 150000 that guy hes got a bio on social media Its not enough to buy a team My mans got 150000 Hes looking good I saw him bringing a backpack earlier today Point game Theres Miller Kicks to the corner Too strong Rebound How fast does Brooklyn Miller change direction Edwards with his fifth steel retrieves and hits the three A game high 15 for BJ Edwards Now is down grabbing at his left ankle Were going to take another look real quick Outlet flat pass O that is not comfortable cheering Calm me over his last four games averaging almost 23 points per game shooting better than 50 from the field almost 50 from three and oh by the way two gamew winning field goals in that span Yeah last game he gets Florida State Big time floater over the top These are two teams that love playing it close Right now though SMU feasting off of live ball turnovers from the Demon Deacons spearheaded by BJ Evans SW only has three fast break points but theyve played with the kind of tempo that Wake doesnt want to see them play Well if youre constantly scrambling with these live ball turnovers it makes it so difficult to get your position Harris with five Aens another three No good Right now three of 14 from downtown Pierre gets the baseline Nearly lost it Walters No Edwards flying in for the rebound And its knocked out of bounds by SU BJ Edwards in a word is at I mean we talked about two triple doubles so far this year One of those against Arkansas State was points rebounds Oh no excuse me Points assist and steals are always around the basketball Hes halfway to 10 steals tonight Akens Spillers and a foul and that will send Spillers to the line One and one Its a nice pass by Akens Thats not an easy thing to do to thread the needle like that and still give your guy enough room Trayvonos if he plays with a head of steam towards the rim he can be effective applause especially if he sets a ball screen out way high and uses his athleticism and speed The latest in the Were number one documentary series chronicling the 93 national championship winning Tarheelss led by Dean Smith It all continues on ACCN It is streaming now Well get never before seen footage interviews players and coaches that was a team to beat Michigan and the Fab Five in the championship The infamous Chris Weber timeout I think it gets lost that North Carolina won that game Thats right And people think more so about Oh nice steal And transition Here comes a finishes cheering youre going up Hes a good player in the Summit League from the Charlotte area now at Wake Forest Hes going to be relied on today He led the Pios in assists last year Summit League freshman of the year And BJ Edwards has been nothing short of a human tempest in the first half 17 for Edwards Talk to BJ his mom runs a food truck in Knoxville Hes serving up buckets today 17 first half points What a block Igato with the block Top five in the ACC in that category Wants it Knocked away by Spillers It comes to Mason Turnovers for SU Mason cheering against the SEO Schwagger Aidens I think those are Do they have redwoods in Texas I dont have sequoas either Im not a botist Im not an Arbor Day guy to be honest with you Hey Wake Forest You needed a little pace to play with Get a rebound Play fast Kai Mason though transfer from Washington Got to be better around the rim but playing him off the threepoint line He can get to the bucket Needs to be more efficient around the cup Edwards with 17 Tombs lets it fly and it rattles in Jaden Tombs very strong starting five And heres the great part about it too If hes shooting the ball well from the perimeter they can go huge at the four and five spots between him and Yugati I I mean it just makes it for such a difficult matchup But on the defensive end of the floor you can really clean up on the boards Henkins takes it back out to Schwigger by SMU with its largest lead of the game Nice play Spurs the corner three and that doesnt go He is two for 12 from three entering the game 26 for his career Wake has now missed Its last 11 for deep And I think the hard part is is since theyre not just knocking down a couple everythings shrinking in and Draymond Spillers you got to make that shot eventually It comes down to being a make or miss league You can only be set up so much Lets see what Boopy Miller has to offer here in the last 10 A former Demon Deacon first game against his old team Step back three No good Offensive rebound Tombs lost it Schweagger with two It comes back to Tombs Shot was blocked The follow was released after time expired 23 a game over his last four twoame winners in that span Boopy Miller has heard of Boo every time hes touched the ball and he finds Edwards who picks up where he left off Hes got 19 SMU extends to its largest lead of the game at 11 You know what Ive appreciated so far about BJ Edwards He hasnt forced the issue at all A lot of guys that get hot get 12 to 15 points in the first half Hes just played within himself on the offensive end of the floor Another good defensive possession The close out on the countys three Moyes spent a season at Wakefered to SMU and he finds Igolu Missed the dunk Harris cleans That was a lot of contact there Goguer That is one you have to knock through Start out this second half Long two by Juke Harris is good 13 He leads the dicks You know whats interesting about Juke Harris We talked about how much weight hes gained His ability to hold this position and his patience really stands out on the offensive side of the ball Tombs had a strong first half with seven 15 points off the bench for SMU team that normally doesnt get a ton of bench production and a lot of that was with Cory Washington being on the bench over the last 6 and 12 minutes with three fouls One of them a technical size advantage for Harris over Miller takes advantage Hes got 15 They need him to be the guy this half He has the size advantage over anybody that SMU is going to put on him on the perimeter Has open eyes eyelines to the rim Demons need him to be aggressive Edwards has it swatted away by Juke Harris Harris ahead of the P block from behind Its Edwards again Theres Pierre Thats the Conference USA player of the year for the season ago while at Jacksonville State Its been the game so far hasnt it I mean Wake Forest and SMU both finding shots but so far today Wake just cant seem to get consecutive buckets Tombs with the help coming late from Kovven PJ Edwards is everywhere Anish look at the timing number zero coming in from behind I mean his defensive presence has been out of this world good He had one thing to pick at My mans got six turnovers but hes more than made up for it in other areas of the game screaming Five steals already cheering One thing that Wake Forest has struggled to do this year they struggled to get to the free throw line but their opponents get to the free throw line a lot In fact Wake opponents get almost a quarter of their points at the foul line And a lot of thats because theyre theyre outsiz And the problem with that is if youre hitting first you typically dont get the foul call but a lot of times theyre kind of in recoil mode and they end up fouling on the way up They have to be more physical at the first point of contact And Juke Harris if he gets going watch out Hes been the offense for week 18 Hes got all seven of the digs points in the second half What a split Miller threw the contact blocked at the spillers and he stayed with SMU They juke Harris has been terrific But how about the split by Harris not able to finish Good activity by Trayvon Spurs Hey thats scouting report defense right there Wake Forest talked about that little over the top pass You have to be aware Miles Cole terrific job Spillers left alone and hits just his third three of the season and all of a sudden Wake has closed to within four Timeout Andyfield The pendulum has swung I thought we were going one syllable and you completely took me off into left field there Look at you Harris with 18 points two away from his eighth 20point game of the season One of the top scorers in the ACC Edwards with 19 to lead all scorers Feeds cheering inside to the to no get a foul Its going to be on Wake Forest and Drew Harris his first You know I always find it comical at least I chuckle to myself when a point guard throws an easy layup to a guy and he doesnt get the assist how frustrated that guard gets cheering Speaking from experience I never passed an Hiller the baseline fade away Thatll quiet the chorus I I mean but thats what he does right You you look at his game his shot making ability When they played against North Carolina it was just ridiculous some of these shots Harrison number three No good offense Find that guy some way shape or form and let him get a look Heres to shoot around He feels a lot better Had a tough bout with the flu recently Missed a game Lost about 8 lbs Thats a nice feed Cory Washington for Miller First two for Washington who spent a lot of time on the bench in foul trouble in that opening half and the threat of the jump shots What made that happen in the east You have to come out and guard the three And Boopy Miller starting to come alive a little bit for SMU You want to talk about degree of difficulty out of 10 Im going 95 Boopy coming alive Its the late Rodney Rogers Randolph Childris Tim Duncan Augie Boges amongst others Its been a while since Wake has been on the big stage though 2017 the last NCAA tournament cheering appearance That was under Danny Manning Steve Forbes has come close very close the last few years time and time again Its been tough Theyve been right on the line Harris thats tough Defended well Schweger The offensive rebound Thats a good effort cheering Good effort by Schwigger Rewarded They got to in the air and stepped out of bounds came over from Valpo where he led the Missouri Valley Conference in rebounds and double doubles last year Piers got five He averages 17 Second leading scoreer behind Booby Miller Washington contested cheering the words on the follow He is everywhere Omnipresent I I mean how good has he been today It seems like every time the ball bounces BJ Edwards is in the general vicinity Just an unbelievable attention to detail Hes going to be at the right near the tea Look at him You cant turn around and watch the play happen When youre matched up with BJ Edwards you have to constantly be alert And so far today hes been spectacular When you have a guy who plays with that motor whats the trickle down effect on the rest of the team I I think its a general sense of trust first and foremost and theres a sense of calmness knowing hey I have one guy thats going to bring it every single night and thats not always a given at college level but this guy has been incredible today and he doesnt usually score quite like this and the threepoint line continues to be an issue for five for 21 SMU in the midst of a 70 run theyve matched their largest lead inside and out Thats Washington for three And thats what Steve Forbes cautioned against the three off of the paint touch Well there that might be a dig situation where you dont go all the way in because thats a long rotation from the guard thats up on the wing and it happened too quickly to give any sort of contest Wake in the midst of a three plus minute scoring drought SMU in the midst of a 100 run Akens the lob to Spillers Aikens has given Steve Forbes quality minutes off the bench cheering tonight Just a really nice pass I think the underrated portion of that offense is J Harris was the Rays guy So the defender had to stay out on the perimeter giving Trayvon Spillers the open alley Washington another three Good Two for a dollar for Mr Washington Hes got eight Spillers down the lane And theres that soft left hand 11 for Spillers Now Miller Crews have not been as loud in the second half to Booby Pierre the little dip Thats an old school up and under Thats the you reach I teach Thats exactly what that is Thats fantastic offense And if youre wait for us theres no home run shots after you score You better get back and communicate defensively Omaha Paloo bounce pass Spillers No call Now we get a whistle applause Little bit late but good call A lot of contact Beloo going up for the jam But nice pass You get the ball in the middle of the floor Im sorry Beloo makes the pass Spillers not able to connect Something to keep in mind here 1213 time stamp That was SMUs first team foul of the second half Sometimes thats good sometimes thats bad Wake Forest just not able to make the shots when they become available here Wake the lowest free throw rate of any team in ACC games We remind you on Saturday weve got a mens basketball double header at noon It travels to Clemson and UNCC heads to Atlanta to take on Georgia Tech How about NC State knocking off Clemson tonight and then the big shocker Florida State getting his first ACC win for Luke Lou going to Miami and knocking off a very good cheering Kanes team Middle of conference play right now This is when it gets weird right Thats good Thats a foul on SMU Hey look Thats a veteran official seeing the tricks of the trade right there Were take another look Boopy Miller gets by Mai Mason Look at this off arm The grab the hold the flail Not today Boopy Spillers has scored the last nine for Wake Mason contested Youre shaking your head I would like to see a little bit more going in the first How do you get Juke Noah or excuse me Juke Miller Juke Harris the ball in space to where he can create this game Pierres three not there battling for the board to Aens Denver transfer Summit League freshman of the year season ago One more Harris Now its Beloon sets up too strong Miller tries to keep it in bounds and does You know whats crazy Lee Passing and catching is such a skill If that was a pass that was on target cheering Juke Harris has a wide open three And thats your hot hand right now Pierre from Miller got it applause This SMU team offensively is outstanding They move the ball So many weapons on the perimeter They can knock down shots I thought they were good Theyre even better in person Spillers devoured by Gatu How much of a concern longterm press for us under his depth or do you feel cheering that these freshman that they brought off the bench will continue to get better Miller launches Foul on the floor on Beloo Save that for when we come back Right now Jon Pierre Jr Those two guys you get them the ball in space and theyre going to give you a chance every time You cannot have that happen every time You have to be more physical if youre Wake Forest A simple wrap around the front Youre Duke Harris You need to be more physical right here But back to your question SMU like youre kind of breeding some confidence with these younger players right Like Jaden Tombs hes now in the mix Theyre trying to get the timing reset Were going to have a challenge Steve Forbs going to challenge the out of bounds call Forbes not happy You You have to come out of a timeout ready to go And and I dont know if were going to be able to take another look at the entire set Call on the floor His last touch by Wake Forest Wake Forest head coach has challenged that call Elite haircut by Lee Cassell by the way as always Unbelievable So you need to have at least one timeout to challenge A coach gets one challenge to begin a game If youre right then you get a second challenge And an outof bounds play is something that you can challenge again Call on the floor Last touch wake Does it hit Edwards I I dont think it does Its close But if we could go back and watch the inbounds play from the beginning Id like to be able to talk about it a little bit because if youre Miles Kovven and youre guarding the inbounder if somebody goes around the front you have to protect the basket or you have to go ahead and switch and J Carris can take the inbounder That that communication level has to be a little bit better Were going to take another look at it Six underneath You get a wrap around the front You have to protect the bucket That is thats something that after further review was last to touch the ball The challenge was successful Wake Forest will retain their 30cond timeout and have an additional challenge the remainder of the game So Wake keeps the timeout and now they get to challenge one ball Remember the plays that you can challenge anything in the restricted area block charge you can challenge cheering basket interference goending and then whether that ball was out of bounds It went off on and that took about 10 games for players to understand like you cant review foul calls like the NBA That took forever And then once you get under two minutes or you go into overtime the only thing a coach can challenge is an out of bounds play Correct Its a new wrinkle in the rules this year Weer Akens Spillers and Juke Harris are the only two that have scored in the second half for Wake Akens Machetes down the lane Add Akens to that group Hey this is a guy who has some potential Real speed Good player at Denver last season Quality depth Hes find some consistency from beyond the arc Pierre hunts a shot back iron Offensive rebound Edwards a fan of all seasons tonight 22 points eight rebounds five assists and a handful of steals ONeal with six Knocks it down Germaine ONeal Jr created by BJ Edwards Edwards Yet another steel and the cheering flush Its BJ Edwards world were living in Plunder to thunder and SMUs lead Mushrooms to 19 With that basket BJ Edwards ties his careerh high with 24 points eight rebounds six assists six steals Thats a lazy pass And if youre W for Steve Forbes thats got to drive you crazy I mean youre trying to run some offense open up the floor and then you make a lazy pass to the top of the key BJ Edwards is sitting there waiting on it Now this is a stretch but hes got six turnovers too So hes got a couple of triple doubles this year Theres something for Infield to complain about A quadruple double potentially in play A quintiple double Is that what you call it music A quintiple quadruple Im not smart enough to even attempt to be much I mean listen Im just saying its a its a long shot but there is an outsized possibility that he can finish with 10 plus in five different categories tonight Hes been outstanding And Im giving him the benefit of the doubt on the turnovers Hes made enough good today 24 eight and six Thats not counting the steals Got six more Elmise has had a quiet night for Wake Harris Catch release Got it 21 points for Juke Harris Eighth 20point game of the season A backtoback 28point Adams earlier this month against Miami and Carolina ONeal from the baseline We talk about dreaming on this bench made up of a lot of freshman ONeal Tombs theres pieces there Just getting more comfortable These young freshman top 10 recruiting class Baldens three rebounded by ONeal now Boopy and they get a reachin foul against Wake to number six Thats his third Third foul on Kovven Sixth team foul on Wake So the next one puts SMU in the bonus Whats impressed you the most about SMU tonight besides BJ Edwards I think its just how many different guys can get you and in a day and age Nice play nice pass is just not able to knock through But the amount of offensive versatility plus a couple of guys that can really you know defend on a given possession like this is an team loves to play fast This is the orchestrator of what dunk was it called Dunk City Dunk City Dunk City Like they play a certain tempo and its fun to watch but you got to have some tough guys too S has that space Edwards may have gotten away with a 3second violation but Walters knocks it down to answer the Coleman three Harris on the drive foul NC State going to Clemson handing the Tigers their first ACC loss Florida State getting Luke Lax his first ACC win knocking off rival Miami in the process Its a big win for Florida State Luke L trying to get some momentum They play a certain style start knocking down shots They could be a handful but how about NC State tonight Will Wade what were hearing a lot right now Theyre four and two and leave Uhoh Split forehead Sam Walters wearing the red badge of courage on his face right now Go take another look Looks like an inadvertent elbow there by Beloo Thats 12 to six right there That is not comfortable What do you think Okay previous plays under review And nothing intentional here Id be shocked if this was anything more than just a play on but Sam Walters didnt lick And that this is not comfortable And a lot of times too and you know this in being being a football guy were going to take another couple of looks but that forehead if you cut your forehead open you bleed like a stuck pig Speaking from experience Exactly right I mean right here Thats just Ouch That hurts Nothing intentional there Nothing intentional Common basketball play Lets move forward And thats what the officials rule They looked at it Go play on Now they are pointing to some blood on the court So theyre going to have to wipe that up What a performance by SMU so far music If youre Wake Forest youre looking to get stops and get out and run play quick right now Theres not a whole lot of long possessions Andy Enfield music has his crew playing at a high level And over the last few games too like this is an SMU team that has been right there at it right Loss at Clemson Was a one possession game towards the end End up losing 7470 play against play Duke without Boopy Miller You know you look over the course of these last five games they won a few sure but theyre right in the mix And it it just kind of gives me confidence in what the Mustangs have on this roster that come ACC tournament time this teams dangerous Yeah Virginia Tech that was a game where they made a big defensive play late and then Booby Miller hits the half court shot fell to Virginia That was their first home loss of the season on Saturday A game that again they were right there They struggled on the defensive glass Virginias got some serious size which gives a lot of teams problems If Virginia is not a top 10 team in college basketball I dont know what Im looking at You look at Brunlo to Ritter they got a bunch of shooters off the bench Turnover there by Washington Harris up ahead with Coington He is fouled Buck by Washington applause Its going to be his fourth Thats the type of possession you need though if youre Wake Forest Get out the passing lanes Live ball turnovers Find a ways to score quickly If youre going to crawl back in the line tell you what Miles Coven you know hes a guy that was at Purdue for a for a few years Never really got to touch the ball right because he was playing with Brady Smith Fletcher Lawyer Zack Ed all these guys I mean he was a participant in Team USA camp That dunk he had in the first half I mean you see the kind of athlete he is Chin at the rim type of dude He has more than doubled his scoring average this year He played in 31 games on that Purdue team that the championship game two years ago A valuable piece and quite significant minutes just wanted a little bit more opportunity to see what Steve Forbes has done with transfers and the success that theyve had Hes a Purdue legacy guy Dad was a great linebacker with Purdue later cheering in the NFL Another steal by Edwards but he cant keep it in balance Hes unbelievable cheering Theres people to my right screaming Pay attention I mean he comes out of nowhere You got to know where he is Hes like a lurking free safety I mean his anticipation skills are second to none SMU back in this little zone Calm has had a quiet night Finds Colton Three goes Thats the third and three for Coleman Hes up to 17 And thats the flip side right If you dont get the steal the defense is vulnerable cheering Tons of gold at the end of the rainbow This time applause cheering wants his teammates to move around a little Thats a hard screen for Harris Lost the ball Then we get a foul and its on Pierre charged to number five Play quick Get in your pistol action on the side of the floor What I mean by this pitch it up quick If youre Cal you can get back into some of your actions And beloo Look at this This is a tough screen 13 foul on SMU Beloo working on Tombs Good defense by Tombs Wake whistle Well go against Wake You got to shoot it right away Theres no thinking about it Bel picks up the foul And like youve said and hes a former McDonalds all American You struggle to find his rhythm Sometimes the best thing you can do to try to find your way again is just take the simple play right Catch it in the corner Let that thing fly Hes impressive though Jaden Tombs What hes done short close out cheering understands the scouting report Hes had a really nice game A freshman who missed the early part of the year with a wrist injury Hes made his impact felt in some big games 16 against LSU 23 at Duke a double double against Virginia Tech and he was the headliner of this top 10 recruiting class top 35 player coming out of high school Played with Termaine on their junior on the same team The drive nation on the EBL circuit 15point lead for LMW They have led by as many as 19 Get another whistle to zero BJ Edwards So with all the activity being around the ball thats just his first foul Well for what its worth most of his steals have come off the ball right in the passing lanes Seldom the primary defender He just kind of lurks and understands where the rotations are Out of bounds SMU ball Another turnover Number 11 for weight The last two years Steve Forbes watched his team suffer some bad losses late in the season They lost four of six in each of the last two seasons to close the campaign Miller fouled by Coven and that cost Wake a chance at the NCAA tournament The ACC cheering is a different beast this year Theres more opportunities for quality wins You know this loss would be a quad two loss at the moment for Wake the Digs dont come back but could end up being a quad one loss The issue for Wake right now they dont have any quad one wins but they do have opportunities cheering Have to play better than what they did today Coven just picked up his fourth foul Thursday night 10 Eastern after our womens double header The Nothing But Net Crew breaks down the night in the ACC Highlights and analysis of all the womens game plus a look ahead at the best matchups for the weekend and for the week ahead A dozen for Boopy Miller has returned to Lawrence Gold Coliseum played for Wake seasons ago then transferred to SMU last year when Wake went to Moody Coliseum third in play He was hurt Theres the 72 Turk the Istanbul Eatu with his second field goal Call that a Turkish delight That is a Turkish delight laughter Tell you what this late start guys are reaching for some Turkish coffee Theres no question Plenty of time Belu in the corner and out Tombs is there Theyre getting the shots right Anishh I mean eventually you just have to make a couple of them Edwards I get a foul Edwards flirting with his third triple double of the season 24 points eight rebounds seven assists not to mention the six steals G charged to zero Omaha is third Third foul on Belaloo cheering He shoots a nice ball doesnt he Yigov two seasons playing in Turkeyys top pro league Welcome to the defense 23 has become a much better shot blocker this season cheering Youth national team player for applause the Turk Turkish national team I I do I would like to see him play with a little bit more of an edge You know you rim run What does that entail I mean dunk a ball every now and then on somebodys head I mean this is a guy that you see how skilled he is Hes got soft hand shoots a good free throw Going to be mean sometimes Calme to Spillers time they drew You get to hold out and lob it over him We talked to Boopy Miller at shootaround He said he was excited Theres not really hard feelings between Wake Forest and Steve Forbes Its the nature of the transfer portal era You know why guys leave and Miller made the decision he felt was best for him But he said he was looking forward to reconnecting with some coaches He said there was going to be some uh old classmates and friends of his But he also said Hey you look at the Wake roster from two years ago Theres not a lot of guys left who I played with That too the nature of college basketball Omaha Belaloo at the free throw line missed most of last year with a foot injury after transferring in from Iowa State Hes had to battle a foot injury this year as well at points Has not missed a game Gets both free throws Four points tonight for Beloo for your team Number seven ice in Calmese to the bench Tough night for him Just four points one of five from the field He was visibly hampered from that turned ankle though in clears throat the first half Had a really hard time getting out of the blocks especially with his left hand because he struggled to push off that foot Mitchell Holmes the red shirt freshman 610 230 out of Fort Worth Another guy with size deep on that SMU bench Heres Isaac Carr with Portland Wild cheering shot tombs tied up Theyll get the foul on Isaac Cartoul to seven And that puts SMU in the double bonus cross country call was the number one player in Oregon last season Freshman can shoot it cheering I think day and age today too like we forget freshman are allowed to be freshman and it takes time to grow into these roles because we have 20 freshman a year that are just outstanding cheering And then you have a lot of freshman who go to a place and if the expectations arent met cheering they leave ChickfilA for the people ChickfilA for the people Wake them up on two minutes to play This would count for the moment as a quad one win for SMU Jaylen Cross another freshman from Greensboro who had been playing the last three games misfires You know whats interesting about you saying that is the fact that youre right It does count as a quad one opportunity but theyre beating Wake so bad that its going to move Wake down in the quad system in the net rankings where it might be a quad two Yeah game by tomorrow For the moment For the moment And again the win values change before the seasons over and not watch it Three No good That was Cross ran into a triple team Two carries down the triple 24 points four of six from three Hes been a bright spot tonight for Wade Just hasnt had enough help Thats exactly right Trayvon Sper played decent today Just play for team just not able to get enough stops Thats really what it came down to today Dennis Ray now its Germaine ONeal Jr his dad was part of one of the great draft classes of all time 96 Four Hall of Famers taken in round one Alan Iverson Ray Allen Kobe Bryant Steve Nash and then you got a handful of guys who had some unbelievable pro careers including Germaine ONeal Antoine Walker Sharief Abdul Rahee Pia Stoyakovich all in one draft class Thats just the first round Stefon Marberry I was about to say I think Stefon Marberry was a part of that class too That guy Zadrunowskis Lithuanian legend Eric Dampier I believe was in that first round Eric Dampiers son one of the top prospects in high school basketball Well that it means everythings rolling forward You see Germaine ONeal Jr who I think has a really bright future at SMU and hes a guy still kind of coming into his game right But as you look at the five out on the floor right now for SMU I think theyre all freshman They are ONeal from the baseline Offensive rebound per year Hes stuffed Final 10 seconds Cross down court Hes blocked by ONeal That tells you a lot Late in the game ball games essentially over and the guys on the floor still hustling to make plays Well theyre finally getting opportunities Young fellas got to eat too now Niche Harris thats good Hes got 27 and his fifth threepointer of the game Impressive road win for SMU They led comfortably for most of the second half
