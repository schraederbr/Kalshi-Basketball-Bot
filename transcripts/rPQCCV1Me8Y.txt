that trend today Its a polar vortex outside but if youre watching this one at home hopefully conditions are perfect Lets have some fun enjoy some college basketball everybody Georgia Tech and White Clemson and Orange were underway here in Atlanta Lamar Washington whos played some terrific point here of late for Georgia Tech averaging over six assists a game and takes it right at the rack and draws the foul Well Washington has a nice strong body physical gets on the inside He is a southpaw really crafty at getting to the basket Well see him distribute the ball a lot but here just really attacking the basket with the lane Is able to create that space attacking the gaps Now hes at the free throw line Washington 75 at the free throw line Hes led this Tech team in assists now the last 14 games and he was such a big pickup after losing their allconerence point guard a year ago to Syracuse Lamar Washington is the guy that they needed to pick up his play Got off to a sluggish start but now is playing some outstanding basketball for Damon Starttomire Well coach startmar loves his physicality as far as being tough and hes a leader out there for the team right now cheering Clemson comes in The offense is strong Really led by the defense but they can bite you on the offensive end as well And theyve got some versatile bigs Tried to feed one of them there but the pass to Welling is stolen And then Clemson steals it right back Quick hands by Porter Here come the Tigers all the way A strong take by RJ Gotthrey RJ he is a man out there ladies and gentlemen He is a train coming right at you So good defense Well see by the Tigers Boy they happy to have him back after a pit stop at Georgia He was part of that Elite 8 team for Clemson a couple years ago And theres the man we highlighted in the open Kesi Reeves with a triple Well were seeing both of these guys that is RJ Godfrey of the Tigers doing his thing on the inside and Kesi knocking down shots as well And they had one for Godfrey on the other end And so the two players we highlighted have scored all but one point here in the early going Doesnt usually work out that way but appreciate the players playing along with us here Godfrey 672 240 out of Sani Georgia Theres a a theme for Clemson not just on this roster but over the years a lot of players from the Atlanta area have starred in the purple and orange for the Clemson Tigers Godfrey is a 67 free throw shooter and sinks it to give Clemson a 54 lead Here you go Clemson after the free throw there applying fullcourt pressure here We will see them turn Georgia Tech over left and right They are really up in you defensively Ball comes right wing out of the hands of Thongo Thongo runs into a brick wall finds a cutter and just leaving it short was Fleming But we have a whistle We saw some good defense out there Could not get in the lane right there That was Dongo But the cutters coming for Georgia Tech attacking the basket was right on point Late call but here you go In his previous 15 years Brad Brownell has only had one losing record That came a long time ago Five NCAA tournaments an Elite Eight a couple years ago Again the biggest roster turnover that hes ever had and hes only got one guy that played any minutes from last years squad and that was Dylan Hunter But somehow he always seems to make it work Well he says that he its all about recruiting You got to pick the right guys and thats uh not everybody can do that Not everybody can pick the right person or make the right decisions and hes done that with his personnel and theyre playing as a team as we see here The Clemson coaches to our right screaming out the play Baseline drive and a beautiful finish Attacking the rack was Dylan Hunter Oh just good execution there That ball went from the right side to the left A little long close out there by Georgia Tech and theyre able to attack the basket That is Clemson Of course younger the younger brother of Chase Hunter who played in a Clemson uniform for six years Two years difference in age for Chase and Dylan Trapping action Ball comes inside and then slipping and falling Coughing it up Here comes Godfrey leading the break for Clemson Spot a three Got it Justin Porter the transfer from Middle Tennessee State Well that all started down here on the defensive end Defense is igniting the offense and in transition theyre able to spot up for that three and knock it down Both teams are doubling though Look at look at this as we go through this first half Clemson a perfect four for four from the field Washington float game gets it to go Washington good size with the Florida runner there We will see a lot of space and gaps out here for Georgia Tech to penetrate cheering Willing looking to get it down low but the pass is off his hands So once again Georgia Tech disrupting the passing lanes Both teams Mike will be playing solid defense They are active in the passing lane as far as not just contesting shots but they contest pass So when you talk about defense its all about car Concentrate anticipate and react to the ball And both teams will do or display all of that this afternoon See Damon Starttomire now in his third season leading this Georgia Tech program He called that last win against NC State the overtime victory the most important during his time here at Georgia Tech and he obviously he picked up some big wins last year but that might be a turnaround for the season when you think about it and that would make it so important Yeah you need that momentum They needed a good win on the road against that was a quad one win for them the first So that will carry some weight as they go into ACC play In the corner three on the way Kicks off the iron and a weak side rebound scooped up by the Yellow Jackets Rebound was by Dongo whos had some great success against Clemson over the years Three double doubles for Dongo over four games against the Tigers And were going to see a great matchup with Forward play here today We got good hideout here with Clemson They come at you from 69 to 610 And then with Georgia Tech youll see a lot of athleticism But what I like about the Clemson Tigers that three words theyre versatile theyre effective and theyre efficient Yeah Dongo gets a breather Clemson brings it up the floor up by two as we approach the first immediate timeout of this game Probing the right side but a foul called down low And that will go against Georgia Tech What Tech does a good job of doing is spacing You know coach startmire NBA coach has a lot of motion or sets out there that allows his players to really read off of each other and play off each other But in order to do that you have to have great spacing Godfrey hands it off to Ace Buckner the son of the legendary Greg Buckner at Clemson Shot clock now under 10 Porter drifting left looking to go down low instead goes up top sets up a wideopen three and a little bit out of Godfreyys range Not a terrific threepoint shooter by any stretch Not at all Doesnt shoot many threes but he will take a few Inside kick out Open three Mustaf had a big ball game a double double in that win against the Wolfpacks Well when you see Georgia Tech knocking down shots that is a good sign for them Theyre shooting about 36 from the threepoint line And against North Carolina State they were knocking them down So right now this is going hey pretty good for them And another hold called on Georgia Tech down low So things getting physical early on and a nice onepoint exchange here in the first stanza 109 Yellow Jackets So they both have been upheld So the score remains the same 109 Georgia Tech Clemson pulling the trigger on a three cant find it And a tough rebound by Reeves Yellow Jackets coming in two and four in conference play Reeves launches from downtown Offensive rebound Cila He does that awfully well And then Clemson RJ Gotthrey on the carum And weve got a player down And I believe thats Cila Yes it is Theyll stop action Cila who has been battling an ankle injury He missed four games And now the question becomes is that the same ankle or is this a different injury Starttomire quickly out on the floor Cila a top recruit Everybody in the country wanted him 610 freshman McCamish Pavilion has become hushed in silence with the concern over their dynamic freshman Moila You know Mike he was out the previous four games just got back in and you hate to see that right now but uh tough break right now for Georgia Tech They definitely need his presence on the inside And as you stated he was one of the most highly touted freshman coming in to college basketball this year But lets see what we have Oh yes Came down in the shoe Look like RJ Godfrey there You see his right touch up position number 11 by well if there is one luxury that Georgia Tech has they can take one big out for another ultra talented big in Dongo the 69 junior so they they wont get too small even if CIA is not able to come back to this game both teams have depth inside in the post so well see some rotation from both sides Seven on the shot clock Buckner throws up a leaner and banks it home Ace does a good job Thats Ace Buckner coming off ball screen able to turn that hill get down use the floater to runner to score Red shirt freshman He actually red shirted last year And of course the son of Little John legend Greg Buckner Turnover Here comes Clemson Threeon two break They set up a three for Johnson Nails it Butter Johnson from downtown The 64 senior out of Huntsville Alabama Butter just stepped right in there Hands and feet were ready to knock down that shot Dongo inside and a block foul called on Godfrey Dango is going to have to play in all likelihood extended minutes in this game and really be a force Yes And Dongo has the capability of doing that As we stated earlier you know hes had double doubles against Clemson right there He really got lucky because he just lost his lost his balance So unfortunate call there on Clemson But Dongo will definitely battle on the inside And as we stated earlier they have depth in the post But we want to watch out and see if he sees a lot of double teaming on both sides of the court in the post Craft checking in for Georgia Tech Threepoint specialist inside Dongo got it Absorbed the contact and laid it in Oh that was just a great pocket pass in there to get it to Dongo where hes able to finish through contact to score And then a turnover on Clemson Thats five early turnovers on the Tigers Very uncharacteristic of this team whos ordinarily been very careful with the basketball Indeed they do value possessions They take care of the ball Reeds boy weve seen a heavy dose of leaners and floaters from both teams Just playing reading off of each other Offense is about reading and reacting And this Georgia Tech team is doing a good job of doing that This is shaping up like a typical Clemson Georgia Tech game Back and forth we go Tied up Offensive rebound Davidson Davidson Little hook shot Kicks off the iron Loose basketball scooped up by Clemson A scrum and a tieup See bodies to the floor 5050 balls But heres Kesi right now just coming down Able to just pull up off the bounce in rhythm in flow Feeling it Hey hes got good shots right now Mike And hes uh hes playing well for the Georgia Tech Gambling Rack Certainly is You know a player like that we know he can shoot the three but hes hes expanded his game by shooting more off the dribble and even attacking the basket as you stated earlier Mhm High post for Welling Theres the double Theres the double and a great job of swinging the ball around sets up an open three Thats a good look and Rey Kesi Reeves tears away the rebound Way hes playing both sides of the court Kelly got caught up near the sideline and calls timeout Will step aside as well All mounted up 14 apiece both ends on that play Yes indeed Mike Good way to double Good way to break it Reeves gets it up top Clemson always suffocating defense and more of it right there on a steel Beautiful defense by Whan Whan at 610 Hes got length Clemson a little bit chilly now from downtown Thats a one for seven start from behind the ark Dongo Thats where they want Dongo Heres Dongo going downhill And thats where he belongs in that painted area where he is a force Again just going back to coach starter and his sets Hes got a little flow action here You got basically five out motion And these guys are just reading and playing off of each other You see cutters going through Didnt have it So now Dongle he just takes it Defense cant rotate over for the help in time And now hes at the line to shoot too They will say okay they will say before the shot Okay before the shot on the floor Excuse me Threw us a little curveball there More great denial that time Theyre trying to get Dongo on the wing But Nick Davidson whos the transfer from Nevada and hes been terrific for Clemson this year by way of Mission Viejo California 610 235 cheering Craft having trouble getting it in Gets it in last second and it leads to a thunderous slam Kiraak Cole Kiraak who might have to play some additional minutes now with the injury to Cila Yes he will come in and play some minutes as he just go a great chance to just come on down and get through and score And a tear drop on the other end by Whan Back to a tie ball game Craft little shake and bake He throws up a leaner and misses everything Good defense there by Clemson Tigers to make Crab put that ball on the floor because he is a spotup shooter Whan big to big inside lefthanded off the window and in for Nick Davidson Again you have the Tigers have size They have versatility All right And depth with that size 610 611 out there Reeves showing off some midrange game Boy that shot is so pure off the right hand of Kesi Reeves Kesi Reeves is hes got sweet spots all over the floor but right now were seeing him doing it off the bounce So its nice and smooth Just your typical Clemson Georgia Tech battle right 18 all This game is going to come down to execution and valuing the ball possessions Waylands got the green light on that three Shoots him at 35 on the year Godfrey about to check back in for Clemson Skip pass into Reeves Reeves spinning up and under Throws up a fader No And tearing down the rebound and drawing the foul is Davidson Davidson got bumped by Dongo Little tough shot that time for Reed trying to spin maneuver to get the shot off should have probably kicked that back out but hey he was feeling it So I know coach start didnt mind going with that one Guys going for the ball It is physical down there off of those rebounds Davidson straight away gets it back from Border Clemson remains cold from behind the ark The one thing they have not done well so far in the start of this ball game Washington the floor general sets up a three from Craft And thats why they brought him here They need Craft to hit those shots stretch the defense As I just stated earlier he is a spotup shooter you want to crowd him but right there they could not catch up with him and he had an uncontested three and it was swish and sweet three on the other end and again Clemson ice cold one for 10 now from behind the arc cheering Got to credit right now Georgia Tech they are really defending out there and there cheering you go just taking it off the drive Washington with the nice teardrop Margarest lead for Georgia Tech 238 Again Georgia Tech has shown Spurge they can really shoot the ball When that ball is falling down for them theyve got some momentum flowing cheering inside and a double team Clemson fortunate to get it back cheering Three ball from the wing and finally it drops Dylan Hunter who shoots him at 39 They needed that shot Clemson was able to move that ball around Theyre still poised This is a game nobodys going to get out of character for the most part Heres Reeves leading the way with seven points Kiraak finds a guard Craft always hunting threes Washington late clock down to three Kiraak skip pass to Reeds on a three ball off the iron Good defense there by the Tigers cheering forcing that shot clock to rush Clemson just cant buy many now Two of 12 from behind the arc Theyre all good looks Oh they are They are good looks I think we got a uh an official timeout as one of the players has blood on their uniform Well clear that up up Clemson got out to an early start and some transition points that helped them on but weve had like you said some lead changes but its hey its neck and neck Theyre right there and theyre theyre battling Mike of course a story to keep an eye Oh Silas back in the game Thats a great sign for Georgia Tech Mo Sila a talented freshman center is back in the game and gets it here Fleming up top Fleming late clock desperation three missed it and tapped out of bounds by Cila It will be Clemson basketball Most CEA was anxious to get back in the game but yet out of position to try to get that offensive rebound for over the back call but you love to see him back in the game as you just stated Mike That is definitely whats needed by Tech Well I mean considering he he missed four with the ankle and he was down in what looked like excruciating pain earlier you had to doubt the fact that wed see him back in this game so quickly Yes Twopoint game Clemson a chance to take the lead or tie with a two here and thats going to be a goalend on Cila Great take off the pump fake by Nick Davidson Yeah when you look at the Tigers as I stated earlier with their post play theyre theyre three things Theyre versatile theyre effective and theyre efficient at scoring passing shooting and just making great reads as we saw right there by Davidson Washington just lost his footing and just coughed it up out of bounds We talked about how much better that young man has played here of late And Damon Starttomire his tolerance level as a former allAmerican point guard for those kind of turnovers not very high Not at all I mean hes uh you know talking to him yesterday at practice as well he was like Hey turnovers turnovers We have to minimize those inside Oh just a little bully ball on display there by the 610 Nick Davidson Yeah we just saw Nick Davidson take the ball off the dribble from the top of the key and that time hes inside able to bang be physical to convert Had a career season in his final year at Nevada before transferring to the upstate of South Carolina and backto back turnovers by Georgia Tech Thats just those hurt I mean you you have to value every possession And again weve saw some just unnecessary turnovers both by Washington But here you go just battling down This is Davidson getting inside going over that left shoulder to finish Hes got length and reach Hard to contest that Clemsons on a 70 run and looking for more here Wont find it on the initial shot Offensive rebound and Thunderous slam by Godfrey As I stated earlier he is strong and explosive and we saw that right there A year in Athens but before that rep the Tigers Well part of that Elite 8 squad two years ago Now its Georgia Tech going cold from outside Gotfrey leading it in the front court Luckner crossover stopped and just throws it up off one leg but got it back Sets up the big man on a three Davidson cant hit Yellow Jackets need a bucket here and a fivepoint lead Theyre in their five out motion Fleming not a bad look but hits the back iron Under five minutes to go first half cheering Yeah we see a little horns action a little drag screens up top But what I really like about the Tigers they know how to turn that corner when theyre getting downhill Buckner drops the triple and its a 120 run for Clemson Well thats the first threepointer weve seen from them after going two of 12 Ace Buckner is able to knock it down Theres nobody there Hes able to step in and just uncontested shot Makes it good for the Tigers Baseline drive rejected Davidson returned to Sender on Fleming Yeah you have length out there with the Tigers post play 610 We dont know their reach and their wingspan but I can tell you its tough to shoot over that Another three That one woefully short out of the right hand of Jake Whan What Georgia Tech needs to do they need to get some transition baskets here Kelly draws the contact Hell go to the free throw line when we come back But right now Clemson is on a roll Yes Clemson Tigers just passing that ball around getting a feel for the Were the open man But you see RJ Godfrey there getting offensive rebound going up strong AC Buckner able to catch the ball in spots up and knocks it down and they just win games Well you said it right there a staple of consistency I mean its its hard Check this out Mike Its really hard to do that when you youve only got one returning player coming back So what you know Brownell is able to do or has been able to do hes been a maestro with this team as far as orchestrating the defense putting the players where they need to be A coachs main responsibility is to place players in a position that is most advantageous to display their natural talents and ability and we see that from the Tigers Of course they always have one of the best defenses really in the country and that always travels That ball just squirted out of the hands from of one Tiger Went into the hands of another but a miss down low Three ball Now its Georgia Tech getting a little cold from outside but a nice tap out Washington alley pass Reeves hauls it in and drops it through Georgia Tech needed that basket Did not settle for an outside shot Got the ball inside Reeds able to convert cheering Welling back into the hands of Hunter over to the wing and Johnson and then a foul down low Thatll go against Reeds trying to guard the much bigger Carter Welling Yeah just nothings working on the outside Creep that baseline back there Watch a make the great pass to Reeves and hes able to finish there Carter Willing to the line shooting one and one Nine points for Kesi Reeves Hes going to need a little bit of help for Georgia Tech Welling out of Draper Utah 611 240 lb junior He was the whack defensive player of the year at Utah Valley I know it was a tough loss against NC State the other night He had a one of his better games in a Clemson uniform 14 points and nine rebounds Yeah he stands 611 240 He is a force to be reckoned with on the inside But again I stated that those post players got depth and versatility with the Tigers there Kelly and Washington playing catch on the perimeter Baseline drive Tough shot almost to make for Fleming but not And the rebound into the hands of number 21 Ace Buckner Give and go Double stuff Georgia Tech was there to meet it Heres Washington Surveys Great ball movement Sets up an open three Yes Kesi Reeds now with a game high 12 And Georgia Tech closes to within two Well here you go Georgia Tech able to move that ball but the Tigers are still executing out here cheering Rocker step pull up midrange No good Offensive rebound Welling cheering Under two minutes to go and under 10 minutes excuse me under 10 seconds on the shot clock cheering Under five Just completely out of control A heave and a miss Great defense there by the Yellow Jackets Oh excellent defense there by Georgia Tech cheering And then a bump foul on the perimeter on Clemson Thats only 16 fouls so one away from the bonus Well were seeing the offense just execute here But heres a great block anticipation by the Jackets And then theyre coming down You see ball reversal closeouts Cant get there in time And theyre able to knock it down And theyre right back in this game Right back in it Yeah both teams Mike are are executing well from the defensive standpoint and their offensive game plan So again its going to be about possessions Georgia Tech again just having trouble inbounding the ball Clemson getting after it on those inbounds plays They have length out here and what they do is they shrink the court But that length making things difficult So you dont have when you dont have when you shrink the court you dont have that many gaps or lanes to either drive or pass inside Kick out to Fleming up top Heres Kelly launching Got it Big time three for Kelly who shoots 47 from downtown Oh definitely big time shot as you stated Kelly spilling it cheering You just see these guys playing poised making right decisions out here But here you go They get it to Kelly Hes up at the top of the key music able to knock it down Feels good Got a timeout called Road team has won all four cheering Yeah theyre both executing on the offensive end as well as the defensive end And here you go Looks like a offensive foul Illegal screen on Davidson 17oul begs to differ Foul Officiating crew Claire Arbory Justin Porterfield and Bill Cington Under a minute remaining here in half number one Washington drifting up top Dongo trying to find Reeves Hes shadowed on the play by Whan High ball screen for Washington Sets up a three and the lefty missed it too strong Offensive rebound Reeves Reeves jump ball and the arrow goes to Georgia Tech Possession error in favor of Georgia Tech These guys are scrappy I mean thats both teams Here you go Could not get anywhere But that is a offensive rebound there by Reeves defense is able to tie him up here We got 18 seconds on the shot clock Look for a high ball screen Here it is Kelly leaner missed it and the rebound to Clemson Bodies falling on the other end as Dongo was battling for an offensive rebound Shot clock is off Clemson has missed its last five field goals cheering Clemson flattens it out Were going to get a high ball screen perhaps cheering Buckner with seven Buckner with five Buckner no screen Has to defer Last second Hunter Hes going to have TO LAUNCH QUICKLY YES AT THE BUZZER Dylan Hunter drains it You see the first half summary Much like the score is fairly even So too are a number of the statistics including field goal percentage Talked about the six ties 11 lead changes Clemson with that balance In fact they have a stat We we looked it up cuz Id never seen anything like this RJ Godfrey leads the team in scoring with 122 That is the lowest of any team in division one The lowest points per game for the leading score of a team And yet here they are 6 and one in the ACC Wayen gets the basketball passes it back up top to his fellow big man teammate Davidson now inside Godfrey musling his way inside Boy is he just strong and physical Well that was just good execution there to go right back to RJ They tried to double in the post didnt get it Came right back to him He was able to go over that left shoulder with the that right shoulder with the left hook Porter pounding the ball and Washington gets it off to Reeves Reeves cant get it and the rebound taken away by Wallin cheering Saw some good defense there Well see what happens again in this post Wallen and Willing the two Utah boys on the floor for Clemson Both giving you great size Wallin is 610 Welling is 611 We talked about how they can mix and match big bodies at you Clemson has a lot of height and length in this lineup And they can they can not just mix match you with the bodies they can hit you from all angles here Were trying to do a high low there earlier but here again well see what they come out and do Wall going to have to launch Five on the shot clock and he buries the triple Jake Wallen from Provo Utah gives Clemson a sevenpoint lead Knocking down the three with the size out there is Wallen Washington probing the left side runs into a double and a turnover forced That was forced by Carter Welling When the ball goes gets around you just see Wallen stepping in able to knock it down with the three You have size out there Mike and those guys are versatile Thats the depth of the Tigers with their post play I mean theyre really stretch fours Wallen and and Welling They can both hit the threepoint shot Really versatile big men And you can even throw Davidson in there So yeah they just keep coming at you Keep coming at you in waves Yellow Jackets down by seven with the basketball here Washington averaging over six assists a game Heres Murray on the drive Murray all the way Rejected Welling got that one Were seeing pitcher perfect defense by the Tigers Now this is where Georgia Tech needs to take advantage They need to push that ball in transition not allow the defense to set up where they are good That is Clemson Tigers So that time Fleming just got sandwiched in and threw it up there with his back to the rim Not sure if thats the look that Damon Starttomire is happy about Not at all Not at all Tigers so methodical on the offensive end Hunter into the corner down low Welling Shot clock at five Rejected Big time swat by Dongo Well that is great defense right there As we talked about earlier they are that is Georgia Tech They are doubling in the post You have this offensive guys able to split but there you have help the helper That is good defense right there rotating over but bad defense to split that double team So I know coach startmire hes like hey fellas look we cant let that happen but good defense come over and block that shot inside and a shot block violation Brad Brownell wanted a foul in the contact of Godfrey The officiating crew said the defender went straight up and walled up Well here you go Just the timing Good defense Good defense So you hope this can ignite Georgia Tech right now with the stop But here you go Unforced turnover A live turnover And then Porter will slow it up and let Clemson set it up in the front court Clemson going back to the end of the first half Is in the midst of an 80 run And the reachin foul that time as Davidson had it stripped Jaden A tough opening stanza here for Georgia Tech Not much going well on the offensive end and Clemson finding success Yeah thats just tough right there There is the double coming again Its on the queue on the dribble Mustaf just puts his hand up in there If hes just solid you know sort of reached for that ball got his arm across thats a hack Three fouls now on Mustaf Shot clock at 10 cheering Down to five Godfrey wheeling Dealing Missed it Short Out of bounds Georgia Tech basketball Clemson players pleading to Brad Brownell to challenge it and get a review here It looked like Bango just lost that one but good defense there in the post by Dango cheering And they did give it to Clemson after all So they reverse the initial call which was Georgia Tech Drive high off the rim No And Godfrey called for a push going for the offensive rebound Thats three on him So foul trouble could play a factor with a whole lot of time left Clemson up by seven ESPN app powered by your favorites And of course Clemson right now would be one of them Addition theyre trying to keep one of the longest road winning streaks in ACC history on the line time number 22 You see theyre going right inside He goes in Hes at the line now But to the line Now you see the ACC brackettology Of course Duke at the top as a number one seed Virginia as a four and then Clemson Louisville Carolina all with six seeds The biggest part of the story here to me is the last time the ACC would have had nine bids which is what you see on your screen right there You got to go back to 2019 Theres been a lot of discussion whats happened to the depth of this league Its always great at the top but wheres the depth been Well this year youve had a number of programs step it up to where you should have a high number a high volume of teams in the big dance and maybe the most in seven years I think we will see that because right now look at all those teams with their their their ranking but at the same time their their record two loss three losses four losses just one game in between So youll see a lot of quad play in ACC for the remainder of the season here for conference play Clemson not afraid to bleed some clock again Shot clock at five Shot clock at three Shot clock at one Good if it goes And it almost did for Porter And then out of bounds off of Georgia Tech So Clemson basically steals an extra possession as the Yellow Jackets cant reel in the rebound That was great defense here by the Yellow Jackets Able to double in the post here Almost tie up a jump ball Gets it out And heres the rebound They just cant bring it in Inbound pass to Davidson cheering And Davidson called for the offensive foul Little shove on Davidson His second third team foul Here you go Thats Thats an offensive foul when you extend your elbow like that Unnecessary but youre not going to get away from it away with it you know 40 ft from the basket either That opens up the door a little bit for Georgia Tech Down by six 15 minutes to play Again the road team has won the last four meetings between these two schools Reeds hot in the first half missed that point right now cheering Yellow Jack has got to find some more production Reeves is doing it all but and hes not making it He needs some more team support coming through Continuation Theyll give him the basket Thats a bucket that wouldnt have counted under the old rules but college basketball has gone to continuation more like the NBA And thats an and one right Get that extra step You know its uh just getting downhill playing off the screen refuses it plays through contact and now you have Johnson at the line to try to make three the oldfashioned way cheering But Johnson a threepoint play And that is three fouls on Reeves So weve got three key players with three fouls And on over 14 minutes to play largest lead for Clemson up by nine What do you want to see Georgia Tech do differently on the offensive end They got to continue to get more ball movement man Well thatll help A three ball from Mustafa top of the key Definitely helps knocking down shots but still just a little bit stu too stationary right there Two things with Georgia Tech Get some buckets off transition Thats a pretty move Putting a defender on skates was Ace Buckner Hey he had him right there But going back to Georgia Tech here Ace knocking down that shot Georgia Tech coming in Its hard for them to score in this half court defense because of the Tigers really shrinking cheering the floor with their defense Wild shot off the mark with Cila just throwing it at the rim Every shot that Georgia Tech has taken is contestants for the most part and half court set Another three and another make for Ace Buckner The largest lead It swells to 11 for Clemson And a timeout for Georgia Tech Here we just see the Tigers doing what they do Playing off the ball screen here Ace Buckner feeling it B gets his guy on skates as you state Knocks it down Another open shot Uncontested and hes able to knock it down career as well and chip off the old block Ace Buck the time learning and red shirting last year probably helping Ace Buckner this year Yes it has I mean hes only averaging seven points for the team but thats not indicative of what he can do as were seeing right now as he scored 10 points but just that red shirt year in this system has given him some experience and just matur maturation 11point Clemson lead Georgia Tech could use a run here Shot clock under 10 Wheeling dealing and had it blocked Tough shot by Mustaf Tigers continue to play off the pick and roll game here Making the right reads Three knocked in by Davidson What theyre doing a good job of Mike Again theres you got the high ball screens and theyre able to make the right reads either coming down that hill turning back for the throwback or take the shot So were just seeing good execution by the Tigers Bumped and fouled inside on the alleyup attempt is Cila Just wide open guy Defense is collapsing in the throwback right there Nobodys contesting that That is a wide open shot Yeah I mean Brandon as a as a coach when youre trying to defend all of these bigs that again are stretch bigs they can all hit the three ball how difficult how much stress stress and pressure does that put on that defense Were seeing it It puts a lot of stress on there where you have confusion miscommunication guys are not getting out there But you got to credit the Tigers for setting good solid screens and making this thing really effective for their offense Open three and that is knocked down And what a big shot that might turn out to be for Jazz Kelly cheering Needed bucket by the Yellow Jackets Now you need some stops but its not coming The Tigers are raining threes Justin Porter from downtown First half the Tigers werent making shots Now theyre making them in the second half Again right now this is playing to Clemson Tigers advantage in the half court defense as they get a stop right there Georgia Tech just really finding it hard to get a good look Some of these shots are high degree of difficulty whereas Clemsons getting wide open looks A rare turnover that time by the Tigers Buckner tried to thread the needle What the Yellow Jackets have to do is get that ball to go from side to side Get the defense to shift and one Washington A much needed threepoint play opportunity for Georgia Tech 1133 to go Clemson has dominated the early part of this second half Washington stepping up just being physical and strong driving creating contact and scoring through that now at the line for an and one out there And that defense of the Tigers is just that they are jumping to the flight of the ball Theyre rotating Theyre on a string Its just great defense that were seeing on the same page same paragraph same sentence to make things cohesive Eight points now for Washington after the threepoint play Its back to an 11point ball game What do you want to see out of Georgia Tech defensively Defensively contest shots Tigers have gotten a lot of wide open shots So they can just put some more pressure ball pressure out here on the ball and be able to contest Wallen They go late clock They bleed nearly 30 seconds and then Wallin buries the three You got a defender there but the hand was down man down as Mark Jackson would say That is a back breaker for Georgia Tech You played good defense for about 28 seconds and then you give up the three Yellow Jacks are too stationary They need more cutters more ball movement And again thats a contested shot but Kesi Reed says I dont care Im still going to nail it Hes got the cotton up the nose He had a bloody nose earlier in this game Georgia Tech needs to bloody Clemsons nose defensively here Stop the bleeding Tigers finally miss a shot Theyve made their last six Coming up on 10 minutes to go Again like I said earlier we saw a lot of cutting with the Yellow Jackets Well there there was a cut by Kelly but Washington threw it to where he was not where he is Just bad offense there But here you go just being able to get wide open shots Defense there But you shooting a 610 guy over a 64 guy hell knock that down But here on the other hand again these shots are contested but Reeves is able to make it down Knock it down Hunter up top They work it around into the hands of Johnson who gets it back Lob pass down low Little lay in And a foul on Georgia Tech is taking it right to the rim was Nick Davidson Kelly Yes Mike We just saw great execution by Clemson That ball went from left to right back over to left and then inside Thats just great basketball here Reversal comes down Nothing is there Throws it back out Got the high low Hes ducking in Hes right there Now youre at the line Able to shoot Davidson doesnt cheering make it but great execution to get to the line Well and again with all that action and all that motion you get a big on a 63 guard and thats an easy post up for Davidson Yes it is Yes it is Defense is shifting Mismatches are created Good ball movement good execution Right now unlike Georgia Tech theyre just one side no movement Then when guys are moving throwing the ball to the stand So they got to do a better job coming down to execute Thats the loudest the crowd has gotten all day Apparently if you miss two free throws in a row if youre the opponent some crowd gets uh some free shake shack So I mean you know on a day like today some free food not a bad not a bad idea I dont know about a free milkshake in this polar vortex That ball has stayed on the right side the whole time once its been passed Its a step back three again I mean every shot Georgia Tech Georgia Tech is taking is a struggle Well its it that was just great defense there The ball never went to the other side of the court so its easy to defend cheering See if the Yellow Jackets can find a little flow here on the offensive end as Mustafves Heres Reeves He was fading left as he shot it Offensive rebound and the follow is no good Boy you had a good look at the rim Dongo did well You just look at the body language right now of Georgia Tech Theyre theyre theyre defeated taking bad shots which are contested shots and then theyre not making shots and putting their heads down Body language is is says says a lot Theres a steel breakaway dongo cheering Needed steel Good anticipation Got to pick it up Youre going to have adversity in the game but you got to play through it more so than anything Got to be tough But we know right now here we go The Tigers they will move that ball around get the defense to shift as we see it Wall drives the baseline left it short tapped around and a hoop and harm situation for Davidson Clemson size too much for Georgia Tech right now You know with the bigs out there theyre not great at putting the ball down on the floor but if you give them angles which they can take off the dribble and drive theyll get to the basket through that lane And then you have offensive rebounds coming in with size Davidson at the line Hey thats just good execution Mike Nick Davidson a transfer from Nevada 12 points and five rebounds for Davidson And we will take a timeout with 804 remaining Clemson up by 12 Will be the time You see the bottom right Oh the clock just froze Yep Thankfully our alarm clocks didnt do that this morning BJ I mean laughter a noon noon tip You never know Polar Vortex got a lot of things going on down here but we got here safe and sound Got the early wakeup call Another entertaining game between these two teams Ordinarily its been very close between these two teams several overtime games as well But Clemson has really had the upper hand in this second half as the free throw is up and in from Davidson a 73 free throw shooter And Clemson again flirting with its largest lead 13 points now Time for Georgia Techs offense to get a wakeup call Yeah now the Yellow Jackets again they need to get that ball and go from side to side Get more man movement as well and get the ball inside If you cant score on the outside get that ball inside for a minute Its outside the paint They kick it back out Craft to Mustaf Missed the three Offensive rebound and a foul So a trip to the line upcoming by Flemson By Fleming excuse me for Clemson This is an impressive streak that I think would surprise a lot of people longest ACC road win streaks in history In history youd expect Duke there NC State going back to the David Thompson years Virginia and yes Clemson they have won 11 consecutive road games in the ACC trying to make it 12 today Just a tremendous job by Brad Brownell on a stat that goes back to last season Hes doing it by putting the pieces of the puzzle together You talked about clears throat being a collective hole Were seeing it out there and its been done Georgia Tech could use some stops here Clemson again Methodical in the half court Good spacing out here by the Tigers even off the dribble drive Wallen spot and fire Got it Nothing but the bottom of the net for Jake Wallen That was tough That was a crosscourt skip pass Thats just high IQ basketball by Clemson right now 15point lead for Clemson The largest of the game Tech has tried to go inside to get some production which they need unfortunately there But here you go Just nice buckler getting that crosscourt skip pass When you have some crosscourt skip passes like that when it forces this long closeouts defender cant get there in time youre at the mercy of that close out the length that they have the size The Tigers are still able to shoot over you as we saw just there Well Godfrey would love to have that one back He just committed his fourth foul So hell have to go to the bench here with 634 to go Really didnt need the foul Georgia Tech still trying to find some space find a good look and theyve struggled to do that against this suffocating Clemson defense today Again what the Yellow Jackets need to do is truly try to get some points in transition Top floor for the rebound is Ace Buckner Strong take and the finish by Buckner Just too easy Got to be able to contain the drive You got the lane open Nobodys over there to contest and contain Bust responds as he gets downhill Need more of that by the Yellow Jackets getting in the lane and getting downhill Lets see how Clemson is against the fullcourt pressure Wallen showing off some handle at 610 610 and hes bringing it up the floor and now hes driving and hes slamming Jake Wallen breaks the pressure lulls the defense to sleep and then has a rack attack 16point lead and a dangerous foul on the other end And hopefully Fleming is okay He came down hard It was the right cut back door cut overplayed Bodies collide in the air Look like hes about to get up here but here it is Just little black back door cut here Good pass Good sign Fleming gets up at that lower back right now Is certainly feeling the ill effects of that fall See how the free throws look upcoming here with 530 to go Again Georgia Techs coming off their biggest win of the year Really one of the biggest of the coach starter era A tough win against NC State And you thought okay maybe Georgia Tech has turned the corner Sometimes a game like that will really kickstart your confidence and momentum but Clemson has just been too tough in this ball game Theyve completely outplayed Georgia Tech in this second half Again I we know Clemsons defense is just stifling out there But for the Yellow Jackets on the offensive end theyve got to get more production from the team Kudos to Fleming after that nasty spill Calmly buries a pair of free throws Still plenty of time in this game And at some point Georgia Techs going to have to get some stops here Picks up a foul near midcourt Its only the 15 foul though Still have one more to give if youre Georgia Tech Well theyre down by 14 Look for a lot some more pressure Maybe some running running jump but they have to be able to do two things They have to put pressure on the ball Theyve got to also be able to guard the basket or protect the paint Sper directing traffic up top See what they do on some of these ball screens If they will adjust make some traps Switching out on it Got a mismatch down low Porter and a rebound at Georgia Tech Now push a great screen Push got numbers Five on four Sets up the three A miss Tapped around and finally reeled in by Clemson Got a mismatch down low still if they recognize it Hunter on the drive draws the pack Dylan Hunter the one returning player that played any minutes for last years Clemson NCAA tournament squad Hes actually leading the ACC in assist to turnover ratio In fact hes got the best career assist to turnover ratio in Clemson history Three assists for every turnover and splashes the first one The latest in the We number one documentary series chronicles the 1993 national championship Tarheel squad led by Dean Smith Neverbeforeseen footage and interviews with players and coaches music Available now streaming on the ESPN app Hes Brandon Johnson Im Mike Morgan Great to be with you here on a Saturday afternoon on the Flats Georgia Tech and Clemson two teams that have had some classics here the last few years The road team has won the last four And the road team here is up by 15 Washington trying to drive Theres nowhere to go Even though he has an angle the defense is collapsed Its its hard to score on the first side the same side when youre pushing that ball up Youve got to be able to score from the second side or get that ball going Reeds just slithered his way into a wideopen spot down low And then Clemson has to call a timeout to set up the press break Georgia Tech not going away 424 to go Clemson still up by 13 half Yeah First half they were only four of 16 but second half they come out now theyre six of 11 Theyre getting wide open shots uncontested shots and you have six guys that have scored knocked down threes for the Tigers Clemson doing Clemson things Nobody getting too high in the scoring column but three players in double figures Godfrey has nine Hunter has nine You see theyre igniting from behind the arc in the second half One makes shy of their season high which is 11 But I would say an even bigger story than the threepoint shooting has again been the defense and thats just a staple of a Brad Brownell squad Yeah it has stifled the Yellow Jacks off Yellow Jackets offense out here Fullourt pressure by Georgia Tech See how Clemson can handle it Plenty of time Mike Just got to get some stops but you got to get your defense Here we go Here you go Heres the stop Theres your steel Here comes Washington downhill Washington draws the foul As I stated earlier transition bucket points are needed by the Yellow Jackets Its hard to score in the half court setting playing against one of the top defenses in the ACC for that matter in the country the Clemson Tigers pushing it good right there That was a music good play right there It It seems simple but what Washington did is he split the court He was on the right side so now once he just takes the ball to the left the defense has to shift And now theyre on the opposite side So that lane was open for him to get to the hole Now hes at the line So good heads up play by Washington splitting the court to get to the free throw line Washington is 75 on the season at the charity strike one of the league leaders in assists averaging 61 a game nearly 12 points five rebounds Been such a valuable grab out of the portal to help lead this Georgia Tech team Coach Stoddardmire talks about his toughness We havent seen him distribute the ball that much today because theyre not making shots but hes got to continue to push Hes an unselfish player Hell find his players Theres a steal Turnover off the press opens the door up for Georgia Tech A chance to pull within single digits cheering Reeves three Missed it Had a good look Offensive rebound Yellow Jackets again Dont need to be stationary Get some movement Get some movement through that defense there to the paint A lot of standing around Washington probing just threw it up wildly at the rim and that time Clemson more of that suffocating D causes a bad shot Grabs a rebound Yeah theyre doing the same thing That is the Yellow Jackets You got to understand you cant drive as we see a blow by Dylan Hunter Yellow Jackets are getting easily beat off the dribble and theres no rotation over to help Washington missed it at the rim So Clem excuse me Georgia Tech had two golden opportunities and cant convert on either one Clemson will bleed some clock under three minutes to go Porter finds Wallen whos played so well in this second half Wallen crosses over Wallen takes it Running left hook shot No And a shot clock violation as the ball did not hit the rim Took the ball Good defense there by the Yellow Jackets for the violation But still not great defense on that ball being able to contain the drive while is 610 Hes not 63 62 guard driving You got to be able to slide over keep your guy going east and west as opposed to getting downhill So something that the Yellow Jacks going to have to work on is containing the drive defensively Kelly trying to find some space Got blocked Kicked it out up top Reeves rocker step Now the drive and rocks the rim He was lengthy and on that one to finish Good take off the bounce there from Reed And the Tigers have to burn another timeout off the fullourt pressure from Georgia Tech A much needed burst of momentum for the Yellow Jackets with 210 to play Yeah Reeves just nice shot fake Lane opens up Hes able to take it down and hes flushing it just out with length for the Yellow Jackets at the play particularly in the second half from Jake Wen Yes Wolen just doing music it inside and out Hes three of six from the threepoint line but at 610 hes able to shoot over the defender They come out now and contest the shot He makes the right read music by taking you off the drive getting to the lane finishing strong So youre just seeing great Im being redundant but youre seeing versatility All right And just efficiency and effectiveness by the Tigers out there Another turnover after the timeout off the fullourt pressure and Brown Vel is looking at his point guard Ace Buckner saying come on now were better than this What it does is it keeps Georgia Tech very much in this game Two minutes is a long time Georgia Tech though theyve got to come back strong mentally You know they dont make shots They dont get stops They put their heads down Reeves inside Driving kick Craft on a three Got it Its an eightpoint game Needed bucket See if they can get a stop Gives him energy right now Got to contain the drive though Buckner lost it Clemson got it back And then the foul on Kelly Thatll set up a one and one 17 foul Tough tough break there Good solid defense But here you go Ball went from one side to the other Mike thats what they needed to do Gets it inside Now coming down trying to get a stop Unfortunate foul across the body there But again we saw Georgia Tech do some good offense there Got the ball to Ree able to knock it down We have a ninepoint game Its a lot of time Hunter is 81 on the year and sinks the first one Clemson as a team 72 at the line Youd like to cheering see the the Jackets have a free throw press break here cheering missed the second ninepoint game cheering Push it up in transition not allow the defense to set up Thats your advantage Kelly hunting a three The Tigers will certainly milk some clock Finds the guard Porter Porter step back three Porter drops it and that might be a dagger I think it is I think it is Good separation there by Porter Thats a goto move of his Bottled up inside Just a rough shot And those long arms and big bodies Theres nowhere to go cheering Clemson is going to pick up its 12th consecutive ACC road victory An impressive stat and an impressive performance particularly in this second half The 11 threes incidentally for Clemson today that ties a season high 11 threes They started off at one point We know theyre at two for 12 one of 10 but theyre just coming back making the right reads creating separation passing the ball finding the open man getting uncontested shots and thats what you call great execution and a good game plan by coach music and his Clemson Tigers cheering You know Michael Johnson drops the first Mike this is a good team I mean coming in here ranked 18th in the country right now were seeing that But what you got is were seeing on both ends We saw defensively you they they stifle you with that length They shrink the floor and theyre just strong Good communication good movement And offensively they dont have just a star player out there scoring 15 22 points It is by committee that theyre doing it and it is by great decision making Reeves to Washington Going to have to score quickly here Well thats return to center Porter blocks it And then on the other end then the smart play just milk away the final 19 seconds The Clemson Tigers applause will improve to seven and one in the ACC pick up its 12th straight road victory in conference And its now five straight road wins in this series between the Tigers and the Yellow Jackets 77
