but the zoo has been in here the zoos been here its early its snow didnt affect that walk over across Applause campus here we go pit in the home white Louisville in the road wed Bill cumington Justin Porterfield Ryan Sano are Music Applause officials pit did not score over the final eight minutes of their lost to Duke earlier this week they burned the tape didnt even watch it coming into this game five to shoot for Applause lean and the rebound Chucky heper Here Comes Javon Hadley fresh off a 32point performance in the win against Clemson most by an ACC player this year good first possession on the defensive end of the floor by louville forcing Leed into a contest twopoint shot and then the same for pit and this will be a game I think itll be just a hard for game it wont be clean these are two really good defensive teams as you see by the first defensive possession on both ends of the floor with pit forcing a turnover well pit certainly looking for better offense from its starting five than they had against Duke Jeff cable told his team when they broke the Huddle at practice yesterday prepare for a fight against the cards today he told the guys go to bed wake up early expecting a fight and when you get here fight fight its going to be that type of game under 10 the shoot again open three for Leed thats the one part of pits offense that hadnt got going yet is the threepoint shooting of low and Leed oh good feed inside the James Scott couldnt finish the bunny still fighting for it and draws a foul and will be headed to the free throw line I know you think rebounding in this game maybe more than any other stat category is the one to attacking the offensive glass but pit is just the numbers when they when they win or tie the offensive rebounding total battle theyre 12 and0 when theyve lost that theyve lost those three games and theyve lost by a margin they minus 37 in rebounding and those three losses and theyve got to do a really good job of controlling the paint and boxing out because Louisville shoots so many threes so your defense is spread out that they long rebounds and youve got to hit and go get its just as simple as that its a will and a want to and both of these teams do 90 seconds into the game both team still scoreless pit has had a couple of good looks though late in the shot clock for ishmail lean heres low I believe nerves is playing a bit part of this too theres a lot big build up for this game lot of hype with the cards winning five in a row moving into the top four in the Applause net and really coming off that Bubble Watch many have them in the tournament heres Terren Edwards for three low saved it Scott put it home and finally the first points of the contest the second chance opportunities however you get them will be the key factor I think in how this game is decided unless someone just elevates their play and has one of those games just overall just two really good defensive teams played really hard heper off the steel numbers for Louisville watch out Smith from downtown inserted into the starting lineup and hes showing you why leads the ACC in May threes you have to know where he is at all times and hes most dangerous in transition you have to identify where he is crowd his space and take away the threepoint line but its a lot harder to do hes a guy you dont want to see get going early was one for nine from downtown in the win against Clemson one for one to start today low tough shot with the left hand goes I thought it was really good defense by H bur there just a better shot offensively by by low Edwards extra pass hatb bur open three Tap Out by Scott Smith reloads and the rebound G mod Diaz Graham someones got to put a body on Scott hes going to the offensive glass every time down the Music floor Zack Austin has been tremendous 55 in white since being inserted into the starting lineup Gan got his Miss puts it in Chucky heurn still down and theyre going to count it and the foul this is what we talked about yesterday I mean its just no excuse coach cap was screaming guys getting back on defense transition and this is just a difficult shot by a really talented offensive player guy makes a shot like that you tip your hand he was held to just eight points on three of 12 at Duke tied of season low and Jeff cable told us look between low and leged he felt like both were pressing a little bit in that Duke game Duke team with Incredible length defensively well theyre the key to this team and when the team start to struggle sometimes they take it upon themselves to just personally try to get the team going and Jeff wants them to get off it a little bit just trust your teammates a little early and then once you do that and the other guys get going then it allows you as a player to kind of get yourself going and get to a game and Jeff just told him relax dont put so much pressure on yourself trust your teammates and well be fine urn defended by Leed no Waterman checking in off the bench for the first time PB bur Stripped by leot and here come the Applause Panthers Leed fade away and a foul on Terrence Edwards good rebounding effort by guo Diaz Graham and this has started the way we anticipated physical and tightly contested 10 in a host of categories including Steels and they have been instrumental to this teams success coming into the game 12 and three their three losses to quad one teams theyre also excellent rebounds they account for nearly 10 rebounds a game and a turnover by Damen Dunn willll give it back to Louisville good to see done back in the lineup for pit this just his second game back since the thumb surgery yes and an excellent Defender transferred from Houston so we know if you play there you have to defend meanwhile Noah Waterman coming off a thumb surgery of his own both wearing wraps in the game today thats a three from lean great sign again struggling from behind the line so far this season only 28 doesnt lack confidence and no shitty 80 Pittsburgh run Waterman tries Applause again and last Touch by the Panthers those are the opportunities to be pick you got to secure that rebound its you dont want to give second opportunities as Waterman there his numbers are down hes battling a thumb injury and he is a better threepoint shooter than his numbers show both guys he and Damen dun both say it doesnt bother them anybodys had the thumb injury shooting doesnt bother you as much its the dribbling and catching the basketball that bothers you Waterman the rebound but theyre going to get him with the push underneath thats where the dirty works going to be done on the glass Waterman just got the hand in the back a little too physical there and Diaz Grand brothers are going to have to win the rebounding battle against Waterman and Scott in the front line of of the Cardinals Music Applause Music Applause pit Trail five zip early all five of Louisvilles points off turnovers and since the Panthers have scored 10 in a row on the L the corad when these two point guards get in in a paint and force rotation it its its just lethal you have to keep them out of the the middle of the floor and you got to keep them out of the paint theyre just too good at finding teammates and finishing at The Rim cards on a three minute scoring drought and heer toughly stops that drought on Q just like we talked about you got to keep low and heer and out of you out of the paint catch and shoot Zack Austin has been money from downtown over the last six games hes the ultimate 3 and D guy an athletic Wing guards every position on the floor and this year shooting over 40 from behind the threepoint Applause line Waterman still over for from distance now Louisville one for eight the only make by rain Smith low lob yes sir back to back to Gad just counted again he gets to the rim you comeing to help hes gonna find a teammate their Pat Kel seen enough of Applause that Corin comes in and cam comes in and catches an Oop There from his teammate low and loow says why not if it work one time lets try it again wont get a better easy easier looking shot than that pit strong Music Applause early Jeff Cables pit Panthers have been exceptional at home this season in their nine home games averaging over 90 points per game while shooting 40 from downtown that has continued to track early in the first half here against Louisville Jeff Cap was one of the best coaches out there and just his adjustment here with this this team couple of years ago trying to figure things out and once he went to that small guard lineup is is Chucky hebburn getting in the paint were going to be saying this all game long these point guards get in the paint forget about it theyre going to draw fouls theyre going to create for themselves or their teammates first foul on leot you just got the sense Louisville had to have that coming out of the pat Kelce timeout well again hes the God and and whenever these teams need a bucket or a good shot theyre going to run their offense for their point Applause guards Pat Kelce coming off backtoback trip to the NCAA tournament with the College of Charleston reigning Colonial Athletic Conference Coach of the Year low a three got it from downtown the body movement and ball movement of pit early thats been noticeable got gotten loose behind the threepoint line a couple times rebound Hadley offensive foul and that is number two on the Colorado Applause transfer just a great job there there miscommunication by het bur and Edwards of getting to low on the shake and when youre late on that guy he makes you pay and thats just a communication eror by two veteran guys and now the lone freshman on the Louisville roster Kai ruths will come on for Hadley who goes to the bench with two fouls good deflection by heurn itll stay Music here hasnt played like a freshman in the words of Pat Kelce theyve relied on him hit a big shot in the win against Clemson on Tuesday night but hes not afraid of the moment I mean he he gets his opportunities and he makes the best of him hes capable score but he knows he gets in there hes got enough scoring around him defend rebound run floor let the offense come to Fourth turnover of the game for pit and the lob to Scott and now Louisville has scored seven points off turnovers its just not much you can do with that dribble hand off you the guards L youre so afraid theyre not a great threepoint shooting team but they shoot a high volume of them and youre always concerned with everybody making shots and when you do you start scrambling open up an opportunity for guys like Scott and their bigs to get lobs and dumps Applause heern wide open three BR the rebound Smith and now heers going to pull it back out T to shoot and itll be Louisville ball with 7 seconds on the timer when we come back its a great great start here by pit just coming off finally Scott no one does a better screen and live job and Scott here he catches it and finishes this game is going to be a nip and Tuck battle all game Music long well Pat Kelseys team enters the afternoon on a fivegame win stre they are one win shy of tying the twoyear combined total from the previous two seasons it has been a turn around in short order for the first year head coach doing it with all transfers they did not return a single minute from last seasons team and a part of that is he brought in a couple of players with him from College of Charleston but hes recruited winners guys that have won is hes drawing up another play and I think everyone expected him to be good I dont know if they KN hed be this good but thats a reason why we were just talking in the break that out of time outs hes as good as it gets good defense by heurn low goes to the floor and theres a whistle and I believe L will stepped out of bounds it was Edwards trying to push it and gives it back to the Panthers and youre not going to find a better Coach that hes always looking to design something here and its a good defensive possession and that was landed out of bounds steing on the line there is so itll be pitball underneath 20 on the timer low kicks three from Applause Cummings great drive there by loow and kick Cummings unable to knock that down those a good shots and the shots youre looking forward a great job there and get the first lot put one of the guards in the back screen and Ruth able to catch it in there and finish you had atoss highlighted on your pregame prep for Louisville its its its part of the reason they win games they its one of those ways you steal baskets its youre not going to surprise anybody when they see film and how you play you know when you guard pitch you got to get to that guy and you got to rebound the basketball those are not surprising but when its after dead balls and timeouts and Baseline out of bounds thats when you get to steal a point here and there and when you get in the conference plate in particularly a game like this this game is going to be nip and Tuck all game long those points add up and they matter at the end of the Applause game still no Javon Hadley for Louisville went to the bench early with two fouls as Noah Waterman checks back in for the cards Applause low pushing cannot get there and hes down behind the play numbers for louville Smith left open thats a three and its back to a onepoint game thats the one thing youve got to do if youre jayen low youve got to stay on your feet and I think this is something for all guards not just him when you drive the ball to the basket and you hit the floor and theres no foul its its numbers on the other end and you cant you cant you just cant do that against a team like Louisville hes got to stay on his feet and get back so they can set their defense cards on a 70 run Smith d off the hill Edwards a second chance cards have been crashing the offensive glass here early and Edwards takes advantage five offensive rebounds and it forces a Time out by Jeff cable we will step aside and be back in 30 seconds Louisville on a 90 run Applause Music Music Applause mataka Randolph chers with you Randol you mentioned it early in this game Jeff cable told us it would be a fight and it has been big runs back and forth well we knew it be a dog fight with both games and when youre talking about you know pit lineup youve got to get back one and here this is what if we can can you stop here backing them down we knew this part of it theres supposed to be a double team coming and Jeff Cap saw that instantly and looking at his guys like wait a minute previous possession you gave you didnt get back in transition you gave rain Smith the three those are two defensive philosophies and two keys to this game and he gives them up back to back so we callus a quick timeout like hey guys finding rain Smith in transition was key number one and when they start that Barkley back down with all the their big wins hes like we got to come in double and they didnt do that either time that is the second foul on Waterman so now two on Hadley two on Waterman who fouled out of the Clemson game on Tuesday night we had talked about case prior and his injury and him being out so when it comes to the front line of the Cardinals theyre already thin well Frank anelim eBay did not see the court against Clemson on Tuesday night but Pat Kelce going to his bench early because of the foul trouble under 10 to shoot for pit trying to get it into Coran defended by eBay two seconds heurn what a save by the Wisconsin transfer Edwards short on the Up and Under andelay The Applause Rebound when youre playing Lille you just got to match up you got to know Personnel body on a body and when a shot goes up you got to rebound oh what a shot by the former Sun Belt player of the year with a shot clock expiring in a hand in his face theyre going to shoot him theyre going to put him up throw the percentages out by percentages this is the worst threepoint shooting team in the ACC but in volume theyre number one theyre going to continue to fire away the the best shot is the next shot its the Mantra with the Louisville cardners in the midst of a 120 run over the last four minutes they will get him up and in high Applause volume Edwards saves it ruths keeps it alive youve got to rebound the basketball long shots long rebounds you cant keep giving this team so many extra possessions oh veteran move there by heper draws a foul Jaylen low didnt like it but it has been all cars after they scored out of the timeout 4 minutes ago they lead at 2218 but make no mistake about it this team is about dribble penetration getting to the glass and fighting on the glass and getting offensive rebounds This Is How They spread you out and its the second chance points in free throw they put so much pressure on you both of those shots coming in Opportunities come from dribble penetration and then the fight starts when the ball gets up on the glass and forget the threes the number threes you better fight block bodies out and when theyre knocking down threes they make nine a game which is second in the lead but they first in attempts and its just you know theyre going to shoot them but its the free throw attempts and the second chance points that just elevates this team thats why theyre going to be in every game they come into the day in League only games number two only to do can rebound margin and when you talk to Pat kelse you said look that is a stat thats all about effort yes and grit and we want to be known for that in his tenure at Louisville it you look like I said everyone talks about the threes because of the modern style of play the analytics everybody talks about forget all of that when you play the Cardinals you better hit a body theyre coming theyve already P his drawn two fouls just boxing out theyre coming they just make them run you over if you dont youre just going to be in a d and and thats the way they play theyre going to keep throwing bodies at you no matter who comes in the game theyre going to crash the glass Javon Hadley will come back onto the floor with two fouls hes been out during this entire 140 Louisville run over the last five minutes meanwhile pit needing a bucket theyre not going to get it here offensive foul will give it back to Louisville done there just on a dribble hand off you got to be still stuck his hip out there and great job its just running through a drawing Applause foul oh great back door feed better defense by Zack Austin Applause Music in inside to Coran and the Florida state transfer ends a six minute scoring drought for the Panthers Cam Corin thats how hes going to be effective for this team hes not a threepoint shooter when he sets these ball screens and you switch hes got to win that match up posting up the guards there just overpowering him to the Applause Applause Music rim quick shot there by the Panthers I think with head burn out look for low and like it to be really aggressive off the bouns trying to get get to the rim I hes one of the best if not the best on ball Defenders in the ACC and hes out now got to take advantage of it oh what a take by the freshman ruths and right as you said that Chucky heers break is over hes back to the scores table yeah come out sit down take catch your breath 5 seconds later all right go back to score table thats long enough well you look at these guards rof they rarely come off the floor Jaylen low has played 37 minutes or more in each of the last three games for pit fighting to get free here this just such a part of their teams identity and you lose that when youre not taking it to the hole with five and draws a foul and that might be number three on Javon Applause Hadley lets see if someone raises their hand and try to that foul theyre going to give it to rain Smith which is huge because you get three on Hadley in the first thats just a great decision by low realizing Hadley has to let him Music Applause go well weve got a huge game in the Big 12 top two scoring offenses Iowa State on a 10 game win streak that is later on today 2 pm Eastern from lck on ESPN loic will be rocking yes it will and if you like offense make sure you tune into that one Applause 5 and A2 minutes left in the first half your thoughts on the way its played out so far its what we thought it would be I mean both teams will go on runs but neither one of these teams are going anywhere theyre too good defensively they take the identity of their coaches theres going to be a toughness level to them and it wont be pretty itll be competitive Scott off the bounce how about that by the 611 sophomore from fville North Carolina draws foul number two on g o Diaz Graham you can see the concerted effort to attack G mod Diz Graham either off the dribble or at The Rim on the rebounds and hes got to get himself going hes got to hold up on the defensive end of the floor but I think also on the offensive end of the flo hes got to start knocking down shots Jeff capable senses that and brings cont and he bringing in a level of physicality and rebounding that Papa con will bring and now Scott 0 for four from the line this afternoon for Louisville cards with a fourpoint lead in the midst of a five game win streak something to watch out for for Scott late in the game hes only shooting 44 coming in late in the timer for pit its been a theme in this first half five to go done what a take by the Houston transfer showing his toughness in the paint Jeff Cap told us with dun is a confidence thing with him hes spent so much time he became a better defender in Houston but hes also an offensive guy Austin with the block Louisville recovers 15 to shoot oh rain Smith is lethal from downtown talking about a guy that just thats what he does just stays behind the threepoint line and H him up but his release is so Applause quick talking about quick we talk about jayen low and his speed and youre never going to keep him out of the paint its just too crafty too fast with the basketball youve just got to Coral Applause him cadir trior up and under no and the tap back is good by Scott flexing on legged and thats on the guards when a dribble penetration come kte comes over to help on the drive someone has to put a body on Scott dun extra pass Leed off the bounce tough take by ishma Leed who has become the man yet again after he was the man two years ago in Rhode Island hes just a winner that bur no in the rebound Austin Le it pushing Here Comes low like a fright train and its a foul on low drawn by Applause Smith fans doesnt like that at all its so hard to get an offensive foul charge and Applause transition threepoint Louisville lead in a tightly contested ACC Showdown Applause Applause yeah thats we saw this play here rain Smith is moving thats nine times out of 10 thats called a block and hes shooting two free throws and you wont see that called a block many times with the the new rule one thing that impressed me yesterday about Jaylen low really young guy just a sophomore from Missouri City Texas first year really being the primary guy for this team you wouldnt know it with how calm he was directing the practice yesterday at least amongst the players hes the vocal leader of this group it isnt just just play I mean he was talking up guys and just saying hey you know telling them their assignment hes the ultimate quarterback I mean hes leading his team and scoring but hes so unselfish and creating to others as as Chucky HB bur is on the other end as well blow a projected second round pick in the upcoming NBA draft currently on the bench with two fouls final three minutes of the first half in Pittsburgh now this is the luxury I had Damen dun back done contact draws a foul this what he brings now we talked about lobi and so much of the identity of pit you got 2 minutes and 40 seconds left he goes out now the first thing they do is put the ball in Damen duns handsam L well its interesting because you know Randol at the time that he went out he was their second leading scorer and in the words of Jeff cable their second best maybe their best perimeter Defender you know with is legged and whos a really good on ball Defender himself he brings you Daman dump brings his size 65 hes able to play even bigger than that you know just the luxury of having a secondary ball handler a shot maker its why youre so excited about the pit Panthers going forward its its what this young man brings to this team Justin Porterfield just called timeout hes going to go over to the scores table and hes having a conversation with Jeff k cap who didnt like the fact that there was a break in the Rhythm for his free throw shooter not quite sure but theyre taking a look at maybe the time yeah and theyre just confirming that that foul was on Terrence Edwards he currently has two if the foul stands the fouls are starting to pile up with luu whos not a deep team you know theyre theyre not a very deep team and already with a couple of guys on the bench Watermans on the bench and hatleys already on the bench with multiple foul on 24 Chu foul from Terrence Edwards and put the foul on Chucky heurn now both have one thats what Jeff C was talking about and we had to ask him that like cuz both of these coaches are trying to protect those guys they trying to protect low you got to protect headb bur and you get a foul on one you want him to make you want to make sure he gets that foul Don missed the first and the second falling away on the free throw there like to see him scking stick that out and knock it down he has that wrap on his hand and he says it does not bother him when he shoots him I know I would have told Coach if I miss two free throws my hands to little its a little sore coach little sore rare misses for the 75 free throw shooter less than 10 to shoot here for Louisville urn with five and its picked off by done fifth turnover the first half for the cards and having had the end on against a guard thats usually Advantage L but with dun he has the size and strength to to hold up inside speaking of size and strength the 610 Jr cam Corin has made his presence felt in the paint Hadley friendly bounce just play so much bigger than he is and so many other matchups just cam corn and Hatley match up inside you dont want to switch smaller guards on them because theyll punish you inside Here Comes ruths oneonone sent Away by Austin Applause Edwards did he travel nope theres a foul first called by Ryan cesano and you can hear how the folks at Peterson Event Center feel about it yeah from the live it looked looked like he spun and just lost Applause Music balance yeah thats a difficult chall call there for if youre a pit panther fan that was the second on is Leed and you and I always say Matt with guys its its protecting those f fouls and I thought the second foul on jayen low and the second foul on Leed or on a normal day those go the other way shooting has not been kind to either team Louisville now three for eight pit three for five hey this game wont be pretty this is a this is a 12 round fight middle of the Ring throwing Haymakers but its super competitive and exactly what Jeff cable told you he anticipated on the block by Scott and the recovery by Jorge Diaz grah the twin brother of guo makes it a onepoint game theres no back down in either team just constantly attacking Edwards floats it in less than 50 seconds to go in the opening frame Applause no jayen low on the floor for pit done running the offense leg it lost it and the rebound one back by Scott thats thats where you know they missed low that ball would have been in his hand to Breck down see the quick hands there getting the hand on the butt I hadnt lost it no eligibility left for you though no not at all thats a Miss opportunity for Louisville they could have taken the last shot of the first half now you give it back to pit with a chance to tie going into the halftime locker room and youre exactly right you want to hold that out not give pit a chance to tie or cut into your lead if youre loable you got to really lock in here on the defensive end of the floor but thats a mental error there that you hope that cost you low back in for the final possession of the first half dribbling through the defense and theres a whistle which will send low to the line for one and one you want to talk about what he does at an elite level and its just getting to the pink you cannot keep him out of the pink I mean you should just practice your rotations with a guy like that because youre not going to have anybody keeping jayen low outside the paint second foul on Chucky Music heurn now rain Smiths going to come on for Kadir trior presumably Louisville will have one more look at the basket Music here great job there by K boys puts low in for the last possession knowing he had it offensively and now hes going to his defensive substitutions got to remind low how many fouls he has you dont want any one picking up a foul here with Just 4 seconds to play and now theyre going to S out to ensure he doesnt pick up a third as Cummings comes on to the floor low will go off final 42 in the first half Louisville on top by one Scott the inbounder to heurn with three heurn hes and a onepoint lead for the Louisville cards at at the break both teams with massive runs but were able entering this afternoon quad one opportunity for Louisville Q2 opportunity for pit Hadley a three he has five after sitting for much of the first half with two fouls great job by pit defending the first action then Louisville comes in and gets the dribble penetration and get Hatley whos starting to heat up from behind the threepoint line coming off a double double performance 32 and 10 versus Clemson where he was hot behind the threepoint line and had foul trouble here early but good sign early in the second half knocking down that shot jayen low trying to force the issue we give it back to Louisville you know its a great point about Hadley hasnt been their leading scorer Louisvilles top three scores in that game against Clemson were pretty much ineffective thats the great thing about Pat Kels team this year they found ways to win in different ways next its the next man up you know Chucky HB bur is the guy that controls it all but everyone has a role and everyone Buys in and a lot of times they just buy into the defense dictates who gets the shot just be ready when your opportunity Falls rville own the rebounding battle in the first half and outscored pit 143 and second chance opportunities deep three hey Edwards no Hadley fighting for it and its one back by the Panthers great job there Hatley had a hand on it and Oh I thought Diaz Graham got lucky there he whistle for the foul and yo has to get himself going in this game hes got to get himself involved and his ability from the threepoint line to stretch it its got to be a factor inside to Corin double cut Corin no and tapped into the hands of Hadley here he comes well pitch shot well from downtown in the first half 38 which is right around their season average percentage wise theyre the better shooting team they dont shoot at the volume that Louisville does good sign here just on Q if G could have knocked that down and hes got to figure out a way to make an impact to this team adley goes right into his chest counted in the foul for the Colorado transfer Papa con will me in soon I think he just brings a physicality thats needed and G odz Graham has struggled with the physicality and to have an impact on this game there as you see Hatley just gets right into his chest you like to see did gr uses length picks up another foul there thats number three for the Spaniard who will head to the bench meanwhile Damen dun back onto the floor for pit smaller lineup here for the Panthers and last Touch by Louisville but this is a a very strong shooting lineup on the floor for Jeff cable between dun Austin low and of course Leed he gets his best perimeter players on the floor his four best perimeter guys and it it allows cam corn to actually dribble drive and now be the benefici of the lobs and forces you to dictate how your coverage going to be low off the bounce draws a foul on Chucky heern and that is number three for the senior from Omaha Nebraska CH and now decision time for Pat Kelce to roll the dice with your best player in point guard with three fouls well coming up massive double header in women Hoops of course top five Showdown first ever meeting in Columbia between Texas and South Carolina with the horns joining the SEC only the fifth time those two teams will have played meanwhile a fourpoint lead here for Louisville who trailed by a handful in the first half Scott Off the Mark here comes lean see with hatb bur picking up that third foul pit has the luxury of putting Le it on him and lets see if they make the change and when the defensive end of the floor no theyre going to continue to keep head burn on low oh great move there by dun and a offensive rebound for pit in this game leads to free throws and that is number three on Hadley well pit doesnt go to the offensive glass as much theyre focused on getting back and establishing their defense there and but again now with this perimeter lineup they have they spread you out those long rebounds lead to offensive rebound so its giving louisv a little taste of their own medicine Applause so both Hadley and heern with two fouls make that three foul Kelsey decided not to roll to dice too much there get doesnt want Hadley to pick up his fourth you got to leave heper on though right yeah I mean its early enough you dont have to but it this is where the trust comes in the dangerous part is that hes guarding two really good aggressive guards and theyre going to constantly attack him so its just a tremendous amount of trust that you see one hes earned and that Pat Kelce has in him sended by lean and sent Away by Corin its great block there by Corin because if he does not block that shot James Scott is crashing every time and someones got to get a body on him see him come over and if he somehow gets that to the glass I think James Scotts doing a tip drill dunk on the rim tough shot by heurn late in the clock and a chance for pit to Tire Take the Applause Lead has multiple handlers out here Applause now leg it stripped heurn wins it back Edward s that was aggressive defense play there by hurn with three fouls Corner three canned by Edwards the former James Madison star who is quietly putting together a nice afternoon here in Music Pittsburgh low kick leg it a three and response I was just get ready to say theyre not going anywhere Pace has quickened here in the second half great defense by Austin already has two blocks in the game Smith Off the Mark done on the Move great box out there by Dunn on Scott dun the three pit grabs the lead and a timeout taken by the cards we talked about this game going back and forth done with the rebound with the push and the three to give pit first lead of the second half and we got ourselves a ball game folks it knocks down to three and he started he was on a minute restriction against Duke and was supposed to play 10 minutes Jeff laughed at us and said when he played over 20 so I think hes throwing that out and exciting to see what hes bringing to this team as his conditioning improved it only adds to the depth of the Panthers great job defending at the timeout we just alluded to Kelsey and the Cardinal are so good at heer floats Frankel eBay was fouled on the catch and it will go against cam Coran we will step aside for a moment in Pittsburgh the Panthers with a onepoint lead but in foul trouble their point guard Chucky heern with three Javon Hadley also with three sat for long stretches of the first half with two he is still on the bench for Pat Kels team Noah Waterman just check back into the game hes playing with two fouls and you mentioned it earlier Matt Schumacher Rand off chis with you Lille is not a very deep team they just got Kadir trior back within the last two weeks theyre down Cas prior theyre down a couple of others for the season its just their style of play is it great steal there by Lowes talk about het and low shows you why hes top five on the league and steals as well but foul trouble is forcing guys to step up and bman just hadnt played a ton of minutes Bru taking it to the rack and an aggressive move by The Freshman draws Two Shots a great job by low there anticipating that reversal and gets the hand out in front goes down and lays it up andou its going to be tough s today it wont be easy for anyone of those guards low draws so much attention as long as hes creating for as others game like this just continue to defend and pick and choose your Applause moments foul impressed with Ruth as well and they changed the foul from Damian done to jayen low and so now the pit point guard with three fouls now we notice now look weve changed the lineup theyve taken H bur and taking him off of blow first time weve seen that bur now on Leed and hes really as aggressive with the ball in his hands just nowhere else to put him though Austin a Applause three at bur rims it out rues the offensive rebound 12 offensive boards in the game for the cards Edwards in the land of trees bodies on the deck one by dun thats the first time weve seen the the correct execution that coach C wanted on the back down of the of the Lal guards and The Bigs coming to help Jeff capable and the Panthers worked on this relentlessly yesterday in practice when Edwards and Hatley backed those guards down he wants the opposite big cracking down to come over to help and creating a turn over there and they missed a couple opportunities in the first half you saw him we he saw him call timeout early to address it and they seem to have corrected that on the defensive end of the floor one of the interesting things to watch next 13 and 12 minutes the free throw line pit outscoring Louisville 10 to four at the line when Louisville has not only had the most makes but theyve had the most takes in the conferencing League Play began louville has made more free throw attempts than their opponents have attempted to give you an example but it starts with like again we keep talking about the threepoint shooting but they attack the paint and the fouls that theyre drawing from attacking the paint and pressure that both of these teams put on the rim is what makes them effective Applause that bur deep three on the reload yes Scott with his hands on another offensive rebound tips it out to H bur and he knocks it down back to a onepoint game stopped the two and 1 half minute scoring drop for Louisville and low has asserted himself over the last couple of minutes he goes back to the line but thats the problem theyre going to have if he identifies Smith on him and Smith gets that corner three heres Scott running in tips it out you get those opportunities because the guards of pit really rebounding basketball they got to come in a paint and helping but someones got to get a body on Scott his activity is always a problem you know his head coach Pat Kelce after their win against Clemson called James Scott Inspector Gadget because hes got the go go arms yeah yeah hes active hes playing for the Energizer Bunny no one has more energy than Pat Kelce so the activity level that James Scott plays with is a perfect match for Pat coming off a double double and now has seven rebounds in five straight games goes to the bench for a breather threepoint lead for pit 13 minutes to play Hadley back in with three fouls peer no Coran fighting for it and itll stay here with four different players on their back sides at the end of that play and dun gripping his head and those are four three offensive players theyre all battling inside and the guards have got to come in and help see the dribble drive Applause there everybodys going fouling this is just what this game is it wont be pretty but it is competitive it is hard for it its a battle everyones in the middle of the Ring just throwing hay makers here Old School Big East battle now in the ACC here we go Javon Hadley can he get something going here got the mismatch inside with low who has three fouls low has to do a good job of fronting here at burn through contact no call and the rebound secured by Zack Austin great job of contesting a shot and not fouling it here comes Lo Applause jayen low leads all scores with 19 really aggressive this second half has gotten it going and again you cannot keep him out of the paint just try to do your best to stay between he and the basket and hebburn has to be careful with him because he has three foul Hadley Baseline draws a foul on dun and that is number two and the foul goes on guns upset hes like hey playing with all this physicality out here let us play now some chippiness as Hadley was walking through the pit huddle to get to the free throw line jayen low with some words as he walks Beyond The Ark I think D has a statement there the initial contact was Hatley dipping his shoulder into his chest I didnt think he committed a foul and there a lot of chirping going on and we talked about no back down in either one of these grooks just the Fit made free throw by Louisville this afternoon loow and Hadley still chirping at one another the officials come in and say something hes like hey they talking to me Im just answering back now you got to be smart here after the officials warn you where this next whistle goes great rebound by trior stolen by Leed Jaylen low has asserted himself over the last few minutes game high 19 10 coming at the foul line deep two yeah hes feeling it and a lot of cushion there backing up so gifted at getting in the paint speaking of Terence Edwards with the Baseline floater hes had the biggest adjustment I think playing for Pat Kelce when his JMU when he was in the Sun Belt he he spent so much time thats his game driving getting in paint finishing around the rim and he comes to Lille and hes playing outside in instead of the other way around is year going to sort this foul out here as this game has gotten more physical as time has gone on twopoint pit lead dont go anywhere its going to be good finish here in Pittsburgh Big Time ACC battle here this afternoon and over the last couple of minutes the heat has been turned up a notch or two some chippiness after the whistle its exactly what we expected Matt Schumacher the Hall of Famer Randolph childrenis with you its what we expected I mean we said it was going to be a fight and when you play either one of these teams once you get past Personnel the game plan your defending actions everything else you better be prepared more importantly to win the fight and thats what you see out here right now Louisville has not been in the NCAA tournament since 201819 under Chris Mack right now they are in the field according to Joe lonardi meanwhile pit as we remarked earlier last year felt snubbed when they did not get an at llarge bid despite being a top 42 net team team and having nine quad 1 and two wins today would be a quad two win against Louisville and cap talked to us about how he expected after last year what he did to his scheduling to get his team come on Daman done man on a mission trior open and calmly lays it home L has to be pay attention Jaylen low on the weak side there its got to see who hes guarding TR with the back door cut hes guarding a a bigger guy who has a motor and a level of activity under 10 to shoot for dun deep three might have been a foul there between legit and heern heern wanted a little hold but instead its going back to the cards no whistle just driving a level of physicality and officials are letting them play thought there could have been some call there on a drive and dung just letting them know so much for that minutes restriction hey when youre trying to win thats it only way hes coming off the floor if the docker pulls him off and that is going back to pit the 11th Louisville turnover both teams have done a really good job I think of taking care of the basketball for the most part in the game this Applause competitive its been tightly contested largest lead for pit eight early in the first half largest lead for Louisville six early in the second half no doubt this games going down to the wire low Off the Mark well defended by the length here Edwards Smith Bang is 43 the lead you got to find R Smith and hes just deadly in transition and youre running back and most teams you run to the paint and build out you have got to identify number six if youre playing a Cardinals and hes the one guy that can beat you from the threepoint line rejected by trior numbers for the Cs oh sent away Austin with his third block and a three in response by leged the activity and pace of this game is picking Applause up what a block there by Zach hon just grabbing it out of the Applause air and that might be number four on Hadley it is look at this block just give me that not only blocks it gets it off the glass and stares him down let them know we dont play that here in the zoo loow tole it get used to that what a game just a heavyweight fight we talked about it no back down to need team and you can fast forward the clock to one minute if you want to this game will go down to the very end score wont matter the lob Coran cant finish and now Edwards draws a foul on Austin who did not agree with the call and Edwards will go to the line for two shots I think Edward got a away one there he saw Zach Marty coming he just got the contact I dont think he was looking to shoot it he never tried to shoot it watch him here hes expecting a contact just sort of put the ball up by the rim and hope for contact there well he saw the last possession he saw Zach Austin snatch it out of the air and he didnt want a 20 there and well we talked about it free throw shooting down the stretch would be something to keep an eye on both teams very close to the bonus pit with five Louisville with six fouls meanwhile Javon Hadley back on the bench for the cards hes playing with four personals and were tied at Applause 57 Javon Hadley what a run he has had during this fivegame win streak eight points two rebounds today in a game shortened by his foul trouble haper with a steal wheres number six she got hit back Smith yes sir from distance and a threepoint Louisville lead you got to find rain Smith in transition you can see when the guards dont attack theyre looking for Applause him Smith with 15 to lead all Louisville scores and you know thats what he does he just shoots it from GRE but you just cant stop it get caught up in the game and worried about everything else forget about him in the blender jayen low with 21 this is automatic as R Smith is from the three Shen low spending time and the paint is automatic he cant stop him from getting there heer three short done the rebound under eight minutes to play onepoint louville Applause lead pit has multiple gu to attack off the bounces you got done with Cam corn at the threes there multiple guys that can attack Applause you low with less than 10 to shoot rain Smith on he switches off quickly you just got to help him rotate leg it extra pass down to Applause three timeout pit it all starts with j lows penetration but on one end you got to find R Smith hes known for raining threes of headb burs penetration and on the other end low creates done the beneficiary what a game hit up to Music well D hes coming off a double double and a monster win against pit why not follow it up with 36 and he is on our wooden watch presented by principal and it I mean you look at this list its hard to argue with any of those guys and so many of them worthy and nothing more than Cooper flag I mean 36 on 14 shots are you kidding me would you ever get have a game like that away maybe its been a while I may have had a game or two to the tapes hey what a game weve had this afternoon at the Peterson Event Center seven ties two lead changes twopoint pit lead in a game that both both teams want badly for NCAA tournament resume purposes as they both also try to keep Pace with Duke in the ACC standings Javon Hadley back on the floor with four fouls you surprised as Smith ties it at 62 you have to be doubt in an after timeout situations against Louisville and and particularly when rain Smith there they usually run some type of action for him to get him a three or a shot great job by pit running him off the line but even better job by Smith and curling to the basket adley the rebound surprised to see him in with so much time left and four fouls no I mean this game is its just every basket now matters and its just trust put guys out there to make plays and youre going to trust the veteran guys this is an experienced loal team thats why hes back in the game thats exactly why hes in the game 10 points for Hadley and lets see if pit maybe runs some go screens some ball screens with him to try to involve him they bring Zack Austin up the screen for Music him put him in some actions to see how he Applause guards done spinning flips it Coran cant pay it off rebound snatched away by Inspector Gadget good play and pass there by done cam corn just unable to finish urn wiggling around dun finds Applause Edwards Hadley three ball 13 for the Colorado transfer coming off a career high 32 against Clemson adleys on his own personal 0 run and all of these shots are coming from again talk about threepoint shooting theyre getting to the rim low had it deflected Austin oh just missed out on a threepoint play opportunity but he is headed to the foul line just another dribble drive there and again you get sucked in the paint and Zack Austins late closing out Hatley makes him pay Applause you can hear Jeff Cable in the building saying next play to his guys plenty of time so much time plenty of time theyve answered here the chance here to cut it to a one possession game just a next play mentality and this is a game of runs its been that way all game long and I expect pit Dan winning big at the free throw line right now 15 for 17 on the afternoon and its back to a one possession Applause game floater and Scott doing what he does the twoand jam defensive mistake there by letting Hatley reject the ball screen drive down Main Street this is nothing you can do Scott hes in a dunker spot big time three by Damien Applause done wow just getting getting his legs up under him getting more and more comfortable and hes having himself a Applause game now the double teams Applause coming that burn with five three to shoot oh that is a dagger by heurn late in the shot clock step back Reed front of his bench late clock just Applause money just his second made three of the game gives Louisville a fivepoint lead low to respond and he draws a foul on Terrence Edwards back to back fouls here by Music Edwards no one sits in a dunker spot better than James Scott you come over and help just put two wins Scotts knocking it down and Chucky hit bur with the sweet step back going left Applause Music K want to yeah thanks guys you talk about struggling to win true Road games its been a struggle for anyone to win at pit they have won 15 in a row in this building including nine against ACC opponents this game has lived up to the billing eight ties three lead changes its a two possession game as Jaylen low will go to the line for three shots and pit has done something few have been able to do and that is outscore Louisville at the line today Rand yes they have and as we said it earli in the cast Louisville made more free throws they make more free throws than their opponents attempt and thats been flipped and I think its why pits in this game because theyve given up Second Chance points its 205 20 to5 in Second Chance points which is what Louisville does theyve knocked down 113 so far but its been pit its been the more aggressive teams drawing the fouls and more importantly knocking their free throws down something that look to as we get down to the m the last three and a half minutes here because the cers have missed eight free throws meanwhile jayen low 13 for 13 makes it a twopoint Game T to shoot for heurn back door feed Smith cant pay it off great defense by low numbers for pit numbers if they take advantage of it Austin gives pit the Applause lead timeout Pat Kelce with 16 on the timer and the pit defense is ratcheted it up to another level as they regain the lead just a great job of low earlier forcing rain Smith to cut back do fortunate enough he misses the shot but again Ive said it before guards fall down theres no call you got to get back cant leave that guy open Austin has improved a three ball shot 29 last year thats old news shooting 43 this year knocks down a big time three in front of the bench watch shot making has been here when we needed I mean its not many turnovers this second half it started out rugged physicality has been there the toughness has been there and now the shot making and the play making is showing up here in the second Music Applause half its important now to you dial into the Scout reports and remember here we talked about Pat Kelsey and after the timeout situations got to keep an eye on where number six is hes going to be involved in the play in some way there he is for three got it from downtown and Rain Smith with his six triple to give louv the lead again those are the mistakes you just that just hurt you so much with Louisville but their execution is just so great you got to know where rain Smith is after timeout low no rebound Le it draws a foul and pit will go back to the line Applause you can see it coming hes going to be involved in a play once way and Jaylen low gets stuck on the screen he was anticipating a back screen with Zach Austin thinking he was going to switch they slip him out hes late to get to the corner and thats good night with the way rain Smith shooting the basketball right get first free throw trip today and TI it with a make on his second attempt the amount of energy these guards have been spending legged and and he bur on both ends of the floor four ties 10 lead changes final two minutes and Applause change the matchups are what you want now you want Zach Austin un hatling and this is where Jaylen Lows got to step up on rain Smith 22 for R Smith one of two transfers to follow Pat Kelce from the College of Charleston relishing the opportunity to play on the big stage theyve taken theyve taken in on a chin theyve taken on all comers low tough take left it off the front Applause end here comes heern getting the call from the sideline by Pat Kelce watch some type of action again rine Smith slip here Smith oh yeah come on 7 threes for the Australian had to know it was coming still plenty of time leg it responds from downtown and a time out by Jeff Capel just shot making at its best what a second half here by rain Music Smith I can tell you the pit bench is disappointed in their defense thats one of the plays they reviewed and they went over in a scouting report but sometimes you can play good defense and a better shot and you wont find a bigger winner in college basketball than is legged and he just makes plays when they matter and right now everything matters here so were in a one possession game with just over a minute to play Louisville looking for its best start in ACC play since the 201920 season pit with their longest win streak still intact at home since the 056 season this game was everything we thought it would be I mean this is this is man I wish I had a jersey could still ho this is the type of game you want to be in right here wow this is why you come to these schools and you play for these programs and you play for these coaches games coming down to the Wi some pressure here by pit twopoint game adley playing with four fouls one timeout for each team pit in the bonus again watch some type of action for rain Smith hes going to look for the curled and hes going to come off he ghost it in fade screen five to sh heurn stripped Austin was there and heurn burns Pat Kels final timeout for the Cs meanwhile if youre just joining us looking for the BYU TCU game that has started over on the ESPN app we will get you out there on ESPN 2 immediately following the conclusion of our game great recovery there by Zach Austin he was beat able to use his length and knock the basketball the way coach Kelsey used his last timeout so youre coming out of your final timeout Pat Kelce weve talked about if hes been a wizard all year and frankly in his entire head coaching career After Time Out where are you going here well hes discussing not only this play but hes discussing his time mats are out hes hes telling his team about what theyre going to do whether theyre going to foul or not if theyre down two or these are all things they practice but right now hes drawing up a play that can put that make this a twopoint possession I mean this essentially is not it will be a big dagger here if they can find a way to score its only 5 seconds if Im pit Im switching a lot but when you switch you got to worry about the slips you got to protect the basket but more importantly right now expect rain Smith to be involved in this play game you have got to lock and Trail and try to force him to be off balance because hes on a heater right now 7 for 11 from downtown with 25 points he has hit a couple of Threes in after timeout situations already this afternoon and his last one was just ridiculous and if they run a play for him he its its okay if Im guarding him he could get a shot but Im not letting to get a three if he wants to shot fake me and drve thats fine you have got to lock and Trail him and be there on the catch here we go five on the timer 41 seconds to play in regulation heres Smith back to Hadley three ball short rebound Hadley and a big offensive board at that for the Cs you dont have to foul here but you got to get a stop and a foul by legot they had one more to give and so the next will put Louisville at the line for one and one again cards do not have a timeout and the offensive rebounding and second chance opportunities have been why Louisville is leading in this game they have and that was a bad foul there it was 11 seconds left in The Possession the shot clock and then you foul now it gives him 20 it adds 9 seconds do you defend this out if youre pit or do you foul you defend it out its one possession now you just have to get a stop this is their identity its on a defensive end the floor you challenge your guys to get a stop you got to switch this for to shoot he bur floater oh yeah Chucky heer stealing Hearts 10 seconds low for three no coren Off the Mark and Louisville is going to win their sixth straight
