BT Smith Tim clockery and Eric Lewis will be our referees here this evening from the Donald Al Tucker Center the Eagles and the seminal have met a handful of times before including most recently a season ago it was a sixpoint win for Florida State in a defensive affair right around this exact time a season ago late in nonconference each of these teams off to a good start 2024 though but a big difference for Florida State this year theyve been playing defense from day one and last year Florida state was not playing defense till coming into the new year with that said we get underway the Nolls win the opening tip Kwan Davis will bring it across the timeline well take a look at fsus offensive set to get things going Malik Yuan down in the post underneath nice move and FSU strikes first just what we were talking about getting that post position down low its going to really be hard for Eagles to keep him out of the paint this is a veteran Laden win through team one of the five starters is a freshman everybody else is a senior and that is a good response right out of the gates talford is the best scorer and the head of the snake for winter and him getting out of the gates early is solid a more familiar starting lineup for Florida State save for dayquon Davis who makes career start number two and two in a row Boston Hol the transfer out of South Dakota tweaked his ankle a few days ago in practice hes in a boot on the FSU bench and so its Davis getting the start everybody else for the most part has been the routine starters for the nlls absolutely and putting Davis in there the Freshman whos really been coming on of late is not a real setback hes leading the team an assist certainly is K Harrison also leading wiri and assist he operates with the basketball at the top of the key theres the freshman Jones II operating off the right Applause wi tend to shoot in the lane for the Freshman Harrison calls his own number and a goal tending call will come against Florida State put two more on the board for the Eagles the point guard was on the board coach talked about him in practice said he is fearless and mature at going into the paint and hes right theres not scared at all going against you Harrison a guy who Mark crer as head coach said is selfless in fact at times too selfless calls his own number to go to fact there dayquon Davis does the same nice job off the offensive glass for tailor B Bowen rebounding has been fsus Achilles heel to this point this season thats a good start for the sophomore duet drove into the lane had nowhere to go and kicked it into fsus bench even though the Eagles have seen this defense and they saw it last year as we talked about in the open its not the same defense they saw last year this team is playing Florida State style Leonard Hamilton defense tied up at four and brings the Press Watkins did well to get it away to the freshman in the corner but J Juan Davis couldnt handle the pass and coach proster was telling us he likes to crank up the heat like he just did and calls that turnover with that double team on the ball I asked him how often he runs that double team and he said I just like to surprise I never like anybody to know when its coming well we saw it for the first time early in this matchup first two minutes of play in the books Four Points a piece between the Eagles and the seminal here at the tuck Harrison gives it up to ducet ducet working on Chandler Jackson spin move lost the handle and right there to clean things up where so he thought was Johnson he could not get the lay to go and a wrestle for the loose ball well see who it comes away with I like the aggressive enough to trying to get that loose ball but they got to stay in control dont get a foul down there well while we got a second well check in with Mark Crosser his fourth season as wins head coach was formerly the associate head coach at winr before becoming the head coach at Western Carolina so winr Western Carolina back to winr and when he was the associate head coach the Eagles made an NCAA tournament trip back in 2017 and unfortunately like Florida State when he was at Western Carolina they were the victim of the 2020 cancellation and they didnt get to go uh to the inway tournament extended conversation between our referees so far I think theyre going to get jir with a foul yeah jir Watkins was called for a foul coach Hamilton is not happy you see the aggressive fight for the rebound we knew tford was going to be all over the glass down there wrestling with it and theres a little bit of a hand flop into the face and if he made contact by the letter of the law this a hot topic of late is the replace you know its uh you watch a lot of the national broadcast and everybodys talking about why do we have to take so long at the camera where in the NBA theyve kind of narrowed it down and got it knocked out well and to your point Leonard Hamilton was also demonstratively pointing at the monitor when the officials were huddled up on the FSU logo saying hey if youre going to go to the monitor go to the monitor were finding out now that a wasnt just a foul called on jir Watkins it was a technical foul that was called on fsus veteran who transferred in from DCU a couple of seasons ago or at least I should say a season ago youve got a veteran crew we we talked about that in the open with with Bert Smith and it goes back to the nonbasketball play versus basketball play and he has his legs wrapped up and while hes got him wrapped up he kind of elbows K right there in the face and the facial contact that can be escalated quickly and thats could not be a fun ending for state but its a free timeout here you make a quick adjustment anything youre unhappy with your recovery on defense whats happening on offense and hard to get into a rhythm when in the first two minutes of play here we are at the Monitor and its not just a trip to the monitor but now this is the second extended discussion weve had on either side of that trip to the monitor absolutely you see thats Tim clocker looking at us and Bert Smith on the right and Eric Lewis on the left as we mentioned those are some veteran officials and you you see right here windrip and Coach prer talks about his veteran team hes got four guys scoring double figures Four Guys returned from last year theyre huddled up together talking through it without their coaches thats maturity that thats what you want to see Shan from your leaders as they work together that goes to show you the kind of team hes got this year and how he feels so confident in this nonconference schedule in the meantime it looks like we may have officially sorted everything out and just as I say that one of our officials goes back to the scores table I think Berts breaking it down for the official score so they can put it in the book usually they coming in four mons next it will be K Harrison going to the line to shoot a couple of free throws for winr Harrison an 804 foul shooter to this point this season Harrison played his first couple of years of division one basketball at Lamar coach Hamilton getting an explanation so I presume well be shooting free throws here in a second or at least I certainly hope so but in the meantime perhaps fittingly went through ball ready going to the line that is what they do Jacob they shoot more free throws per game than any other team in the country absolutely 315 attempts through this today and theyve attempted 12 five more free throws than opponents so far this year which is a staggering stat theyve you know its just hard to believe everything that winr does is aggressive we heard that word used time and time again in their practice I think its also worth me mentioning before we touch on their aggressiveness in general Florida State also does a good job of getting to the line theyre sixth in the country in free throw shooting so a chance for each of these teams to earn plenty of trip to the charity strike traveling violation on du set right in front of Florida States bench but while we have a dead ball Jacob aggressive on both sides of the floor well get a chance to see how winr operates in their defensive second yes you know their their defense is aggressive their rebounding is aggressive their offens is aggressive because they ATT attack the rim and kick it out for threes its just everythings about their speed and aggressiveness Chandler Jackson sends it into Malik Y and he got the scoring started Yan nice find Jackson with the finger roll the help from ducet cut the back door behind him and and gave the layup but thats what they was working on practice is getting Malik yui off the block for the help on defense 65 Florida State Nick Johnson the transfer from New Hampshire had nowhere to go down in the post took the extra step and that is another traveling violation on the Eagles you see that cut right down the paint duet was over double teaming so that he couldnt Spin and get the easy basket but it ended up being an easier basket with a good look by Yan great at Distributing the ball for a big man you is third turnover in the first three minutes for winthrip here in Tallahassee tonight jir Watkins had his pocket picked great defense by KAS Harrison ducet lays it in in transition the veteran coming on the floor Harrison picked his pocket Applause and six win Watkins fouled on the way in Harrison Waits on that spin its a patented move by jir Watkins and the court Vision to draw the defense and then give it to his teammate du set to finish at The Rim through the shot Blocker in BO that foul called on Nick Johnson no free throws coming for jir Watkins it was a foul on the floor Johnson was the leading scorer for winp against the nolles in their meeting a season ago another foul this time down in the post duetts unhappy with the call but unfortunately hes a little under siiz hes got a good body but hes only 67 and for the Eagles he seems to get in foul trouble against these high level teams when he plays these ACC opponents with Virginia Tech and Louisville Louisville he was on the bench in two minutes and two fouls so juet as you mentioned now will sit a spell after picking up the personal heres the Freshman Davis swinging it to Jamir Watkins Watkins tries to turn the corner nice finish through the contact Sean and back and forth we go 87 Florida State Bryce Baker checking in so to is Tommy camarra Jones dishes it out to Baker good vision of the Court by The Freshman thats a big bonus for winter the bakers hitting 80 of his shots are from three here comes the double team once again and if you can pass out of the press typically good things can happen but that is the second time Florida state has turned the ball over after initially breaking the pressure so thatll send us to our under 16 timeout here in this first half in town North Carolina and shot blocks in high school I think hes fourth in the Big South right now with 15 blocks a game speaking of blocks Florida States number one in in blocks in the ACC five blocks a game 55 total blocks already this year but youre looking at two teams that want to play defense aggressively and theyre trying to turn you over Sean Ryan Jolly checking in tiller bow Bowen got tripped up lost the basketball it will remain with the nolles though you see that aggressive defense right there theyre FL theyre flogging to the ball not to make an eagle reference but theyre down there just trying to get that ball every opportunity possible I wouldnt have minded Eagle pun early I would have been impressed actually hey its still early its a lot of time we got time we got time Chandler Jackson running out of time Florida State now just with 10 seconds left here in the shot clock heavy pressure once again by winr who got a hand in there and jolly knocked it out of Play It Still Remains with Florida State itll be Watkins to send it in with just seven left short clock right here see how they do its going to be a ball screen something quick real quick action for a shot Davis off the screen and Yan cleans it up off the weak side thats what youan is phenomenal with his soft hands around the rim to just stay with it and not get the goal end you can see the confidence of maliku in growing Leaps and Bounds and there he comes down with the defensive board he has been a lean mean rebounding machine and this guy can also score the basketball at a good clip as well hell be called for the traveling violation though down in the post got a little out of control trying to do too much just get that jump stop kick it out to the guard and let them attack beside of you youre still going to get you rebound Jacob you mentioned how each of these teams plays aggressive defense they are two of the best teams in the country in terms of forcing turnovers Florida States got five turnovers winr with four and we are just over 5 minutes into play youre going to be a Dolly Madison Factory around here is which one do you want apple or cherry cuz there going to be some turnovers with this defense well that wasnt the pun I thought we were going to start off with but all right hey than I could appreciate it right did it make you hungry a little Music bit youan tried to knock that off an eagle instead a wrestle once again for the ball down in the post and it looks like Wilson will C it for win through you can see these dudes both teams want to win this game you know they they realize the importance of this game and and keeping this ball alive Yans great at trying to throw it back off somebody and just look at the bodies jumping on the floor and the Huddle to the ball its like it means something tonight for these guys no timeout called by winthrip even though Wilson had secured the basketball and so with the possession era pointing to Florida State a jump ball was called it goes to the n and jir Watkins jumper is Off the Mark so heres Wilson with the kick out to Baker and Baker lost the handle even though they go against this pressure defense at home in practice every day the size and length of Florida State coach proster was talking about that today his concern with the length and athleticism of Florida States def yeah thats just something you cant simulate in the practice gym even as good as you might be and as aggressive as your Defenders might be two and a half minutes without a point for winre Florida State will try to cat that in and there they go jir Watkins picks his way through traffic and FSU takes the lead jie swings it to the wing du set nice move to get to the basket but could not lay it in Watkins thought about it off the give and go down low hes fouled coach talked about this and practice today about closing out on Malik I mean jir Watkins and you see right here Jamir Watkins is drawing the entire defense as he goes to the rim he thinks hes getting fouled but hes doing the right thing and staying strong and just going to the rim dont wait wait on the foul go score the basket well I mentioned that winth through has been particularly Adept at earning trips to the free throw line Florida State top 10 in the country as well Jamir Watkins on his own ranks in the top three in free throw attempts third in the country in free throws made hes made 80 of Florida States 210 made charity shots so far this season he made 19 of 23 against T land the three he attempted against the Green Wave the most of anybody in D1 in any game this season hey and he was only four of eight from the field he got 29 Points and hes just cleaning them up from the free throw line and a lot of those fouls are aggressively going to the rim and getting hammered and then knocking his free throw down hes improved his free throw shooting from the beginning of the Season hes at 727 right now he was struggling early he was shooting down in the 60s and hes hes historically a really good free throw shooter but hes coming together and I know coach Hamiltons talked about it on how much shes put his work in to get his shot back in the free throw line let those two free throw makes Watkins now has six in the game Florida State leads it by four the most breathing room either team has frankly had to this point so far in this contest and tord right there drawing in the crowd he felt the defense coming coach prer was talking about he wants it to kick it out tonight not force it up but he he was able to draw the foul Jerry Deng called for the for the personal Florida stayed on a 60 run over the last couple of minutes and with a free throw make tford would put an end to a scoring drown of 3 minutes and 14 seconds for the Eagles and its not uncommon here to see this close score early and you can see first place with rebounds per game third in his field goal percentage 15th in points per game I mean 14 steals a game hes um hes a a load for the mid major ranks and win you know is a high level mid major lets keep it keep it real theyre not your average mid major program yeah the last two times they made the NCAA tournament they were a trendy upset pick in both of those tournaments didnt end up panning out for the Eagles but they do Garner a lot of respect as far as mid Majors go and he is going to be a handful for a lot of folks foul called on the floor itll go against Jones II The Freshman put his hands two hands in the backs an automatic foul when a guy catches the ball down low thats a freshman mistake you dont really have that rule in high Applause school and an offensive foul will be called against Florida State maluk draws the foul and gives the foul the young guy still struggling up top to control his body sometimes on them hot ball screens and uh picked up one its been an interesting start to this one Florida leads it byers got to be happy with where his program is right now with this where the score is 14 11 only down three set Nifty move working his way into the paint and duet Banks it off the glass I was about to call him crafty and he just put some craft work together Jerry dang thought about pulling the trigger for a second hings it back down puts the ball on the floor now its Jack getting to the Baseline thats too strong Eagles have numbers for the moment good job getting back on defense by the Applause nolles Thomas left alone too strong bodies fly everywhere Sean whether its a for a rebound or close out Max effort on both sides of the floor Thomas keeps it himself in transition and throws it down better be careful swinging on that Rim coach bruss is over there looking around like hows he get away with that Thomas the senior from Baton Rouge Louisiana played most recently at UTSA super athletic Wing player for checking all the boxes for leard Hamilton style going say coach Hamilton calls him a real natural a guy who can pick it pick up the game and do just about anything really well coming off the bench and here he goes bringing it back across the timeline for the NES inside to the Freshman air maluk maluk off the turnaround Deng tries to tap it back up and in and he will likely be called for going over the back threepoint lead for Florida State Midway through the first half half of the first half in the books here in Tallahasse and in case youve missed the action defense has been the name of the game Jacob ryh there are hands everywhere both teams are phenomenal defensive squads at stealing the ball and they are just everywhere you can see aggressiveness on rebounds out of bounds plays and theyre just dont throw a l ball loose one CU theyll pick your pocket and go for six boom baby Thomass dunking it home he certainly was each of these teams two of the better defensive teams in the country and there you see it at least in terms of the turnovers that they for 169 167 both top 15 each forcing six turnovers and we are not yet even 10 full minutes into this game neither one of them are going to keep their turnover that down tonight because the defensive level for these two Crews is just Elite and and thats why winther has a chance to win their league and thats why Florida state is back at the level theyve been at of late minus a couple mishaps Nick Johnson couldnt get the lay in to go in traffic now back comes Florida state with a threepoint lead 1613 Justin Thomas lost his footing ducet down low and there he is to clean up that Miss duet and talford are really good bigs for winter at what they need and they both rebound well and attack the glass as we talked about their offensive rebounding was unbelievable Chandler Jacks is playing a point right now for Florida State hes not your normal point guard position so theyre off could be a little Applause sluggish Jackson drives off the corner draws the foul off the Freshman Jones the third thatll be the second personal tack on to the Freshman just tell for just going at the rim and doet doing what you got to do is just follow the ball grabs it off to front set makes his way to the bench three for four so far hes got six hes got such a good budy transfer from Fort Valley State just like a like a steel for win coach Mark crer said they really did a good job of developing him at the D2 level and FSU wastes no time off the inbounds play Malik you and a perfect three for three from the floor hes got six Johnson pulls the trigger Neu clears the Applause glass Watkins thought about pulling up in transition theyre picking up kind of High T night they may be in a Zone yep every now and then they do a match up Music Zone inside 10 Yan what a start for Malik Yuan hes got hands that are just hard to come by in this sport its like he can do anything hed make a great receiver or tight end so far you name it Malik Yans been able to do it so it wouldnt surprise me if he could provide some services to Mike norell in the fall as well he has been the man of the moment at least of late here at the Tucker Center for FSU hoops and that is out of play basketball back to the Music seminal well weve been talking about him lets take another look look how he just spins and and finishes up high the defense cannot get to the ball and here he just this his guy sleeping on him he just turns the shoots right over him taking advantage of his length and that soft touch Florida State leading by five you get the impression Jacob that if youre Florida State youve got a team in winr here whos made one of their last seven you need to start separating yourselves youve afforded yourself that opportunity and thats been the problem offens L is the ls for Florida State youve got to keep scoring the ball and thats a good way to do it hey count the ball up high keep running to the rim baby hand off to the teammate 60 run over the last minute and a half for Florida State they have made each of their last three sevenpoint lead the largest it has been for either side so far Harrison tries to break it down in the lane five left Johnson through two Defenders foul called on the floor and thatll take us to our media break the under eight here in Tallahassee with FSU Jacob stepping it out to a sevenpoint lead a three time ACC coach of the year and J I thought it was interesting we had a chance to chat with him earlier and hes pleased with how his team has gotten off to a start the the the rolling start out of the gates if you will for the nlls but hes also said that with so many young guys he hasnt had his full compliment of players at at at every single game so far and he said look this holiday break after we play Louisville will be a real chance for us to set the table go through a lot more film and really figure even more things out as we get into the meat of ACC play but he feels like theyre in a pretty good spot for now right he was mentioning hes just trying to get through the weekend get through this game and get a victory if if possible you know and theyre on that way right now and then with Louisville coming in this weekend to get through that game but the holiday break gives you a chance to no distractions with classes the other students arent around so your players are focused and youre able to get a lot of work done and and tweak things get your offense right you know get a guy shot correctly work on his handles a little bit T you off to a decent start this season trying to get off to a good start in ACC play as well Watkins from the corner FSU still looking for their first made three in this game Dio fac the double team by the NES now its Dio up top in and out Dio keeps pulling the trigger oh for four now on the season Watkins will pull the trigger himself catches front iron theres Malik Yuan doing Malik Yan things rebound and soft touch at The Rim Malik being Malik you and you were mentioning this in the media break Jacob has nearly as many rebounds himself as win does as a team just goes up follows the shot keeps it high look how he just bobbles in a little bit and still just stays right right over the defensive arms the guy has like we were talking earlier in this season where Batman needer Robin and to jir Watkins and Malik Yan coming in here I think hes Beyond robing now I dont watch The Avengers but whoever the next best Avenger is thats who Malik huan is unfortunately I cannot help you out on that either Im not I I have not watched The Avengers myself so Ill take your reference I appreciate the reference and uh because I cant help you out any Ill get back to basketball down low Watkins and with that Batman does his thing scoring on the Baseline jir Watkins has encountered a lot of contact down low and has finished several times through it Jolly up top and reason to be jolly for Ryan he cashes in the three they worked on it all day during shoot round today they must have shot 75 of their practice just working on their deep shots when you look at this win roster up and down they are not afraid to shoot the three a lot of guys with a significant number of attempts 100 the one guy thats really doesnt shoot the is tailford and thats because hes still good in the paint oh nice pass to Watkins yes sir hes like shooting ducks on a pond if you just let him sit there catch it in Rhythm hes going to knock it down something he worked on all summer and still worked on an hour before practice today while we were here ninepoint lead for Florida Music State and a jump ball will be called itll remain with the Eagles you in right here just unselfish to the back door cut by jir Watkins and then jir catching it and stride way downtown baby but Jamir Watkins you know he struggled with his jump shot of late a little bit but but did you really say he struggled if hes going four for eight and hes having to shoot free throws hes getting foul you know Applause its a hard foul there Ryan Jolly knocked to the deck fighting for the loose ball off that block Thomas aggressive going after that long rebound bumped Jolly s with his eye a little bit look he may have caught a elbow slightly this is kind of what we would expect a lowscoring game we didnt expect a lot of points because of the defense Florida States offense though has turned it on here over the last few few minutes they made each of their last three six of their last eight get the feeling that the Eagles are in desperate need of a bucket to try to get back within touch here still only trailing by single digits but the way this game has gone every possession is Paramount Jolly scrambles for the loose ball a jump ball will be called it should go back to Florida State thats probably our fourth or fifth jump ball I dont know how to check that stat we check it we may have a a record tonight with the way these guys are trying to get a hold of every loose ball and anything that hits the floor and you were just touching on this win had it right there in like one or two possessions until two quick baskets by Florida State open it up a little bit just over five minutes left in the half the nlls lead up to nine Daquon Davis giving it up to Chandler Jackson now to KNE two at the top of the K again the double brought on here Watkins he breaks through tries to lob it up to the freshman and a foul called on the floor the good look NE to thought he was going to get on the initial roll and Walkin waited till he had a better opportunity but he did get hammered down there on the Baseline camat called for the pur Nole will be three throws for the Freshman out of Canada Christian me four five this year Sean so he can shoot it hes had had a lot of opportunities you to a guy who a seven minutes a game coming into this matchup getting acclimated to D1 Basketball top 44 in the class of 2024 originally signed with Indiana State sore has had a heck of a year last year absolutely with a really good post player down there best day since the Larry Bird run a lot of folks were upset that they didnt make it into the NCAA tournament in fact active hands once again Daquon Davis knocked it out of play should remain with the Eagles though those active hands theyre everywhere for both teams every possession has been tough work for either of these two teams theres another Swipe by Davis nearly knocked the ball away from ducet left alone though the Freshman Jones thats a weak side rebound for tford spins between three semal and finishes through the trees tfre keeping it up keep control of it Le down to seven thats a big bucket for win Davis Up and Under got the roll Davis hes Fearless a former football player in high school high level recruit out of overtime Elite in Atlanta you can see why hes a good sub at the point about to take over most of the minutes before the seasons over the way its going here comes Florida State in transition Taylor B bow knocks down the three from the wing everybody likes one in transition and thats one of the things they talked about at PR day controlling that transition defense and right here Florida States going to work on continuing that in the first half against winr and Malik Yan has been a massive factor in a chick oh his bucket right here keeping it high giving it up to his team teammates too with jir Watkins with the finish and then dont count him out on a putback he gets those rebounds and keeps him high five for five for the night 66 from the field for the last six games hes raising his stats tonight if he keep shooting it like this hes going to be up 75 yeah already in double figures six rebounds so far for Malik Yan and still four minutes left here in this first half hes hes a man among boys we talked about it in the opening and and great job with the graffics back there at the house giving us those up early about Y and how his impacting his game was going to be and hes hes living up to the task tonight fsus Road loss to LSU 11 offensive rebounds what is believed to be the most offensive rebounds by a seminal in a game since that has been tracked statistically so theres a period of time where we dont really know but as long as its been tracked thats been impressive and so has Taylor B Bowen over the last few minutes three at the at the threepoint line right there at the last time out and then with a big dunk but jir Watkins with the unselfish pass 14point lead fsus on a 70 run theyve made each of their last six boy and they thought they came away with a turnover Malik Yans going to get called for the personal look at this onehanded whipped B BL baby get out the way look at him he just explodes off the floor love it big man getting paid for running the floor buckets seven minutes or seven points for Taylor ball Bowen in the last couple of minutes right hey you know hes hes hes like Peaks and valleys you get a lot of good he he his consistency is going to come with his maturity kind of like coach prer said with his team with their maturity and with the maturity of tbubble and getting relaxed in every night bringing the same energy not letting a bad play hurt him but he hasnt made many bad plays at night but you cant let one bad game affect your game next game and just stay consistent do your thing got a big high five from Stan Jones as he made his way over to the bench this coaching staff is a real staunch believer in Taylor B Bowens potential oh they love his upside and he does have a lot of upside hes a phenomenal athlete hes got a good shooting touch and a good motor stop me if you heard this before Malik Yan caral a rebound that should be number seven for Yan now takes the ball off the low block working on tolford Yan draws the contact off of tolford Florida state is in the bonus so thatll be a one and one for you tford being victim of just a good post move hes sitting there got his position but he got around him you know its his ability to sneak around the rim down there for you and is uh is high level coach Hamilton has talked about he might be one of the most skilled big men hes ever coached and um you can see it happening in front of us you in a top five Jo transfer the top rank Joo Center coming into division one basketball this year previously played before he went to the Jo ranks at Old Miss only played 14 games with the reevs out in Oxford certainly a massive pickup for Florida State Juku allame a season ago made a trip to the Elite 8 so high pedigree and it was just a matter of when he was going to get comfortable hes comfortable now absolutely hes not really an aggressive guy Sean hes like a laidback passive guy when youre around he hes humble you know its but and thats you can see it in his play but its not affecting this play of late I mentioned his Joo career at South Plains Community College played in 34 games average 15 points nine boards shot over 60 got back his own Miss and lays it in coach brosts over there just raising the roof saying he crossed the line too quick but he just beat everybody to the rebound and Florida state has busted this thing open theyve made each of their last seven they lead by 16 duet athletic rebound there for jir Watkins but he traveled on the way down the best rebounder is the guy that missing it looks like he stayed behind the line to meet everybody else is slow to react I tell you what Jacob you know youre having a good day when your only miss comes at the free throw line and you follow that up by cleaning things up and sticking it back up and making your sixth bucket of the game hey you know obviously hed rather get two instead of one so keeping those field goals intact but the score right now is not indicative of the game weve had for the first 18 minutes 17 minutes whats going to be the key here for win through to get themselves back into this make it manageable as they head to the locker room over the next two and a half minutes well they they got to get back in transition dont give up any of these quick baskets because thats whats happened its been some bang bang bang bang quick offense for Florida State thats really hurt the winter Eagles and theyve just got to take better shots they taking some quick shots on offense you cant get it all back at one time duet trying to work around KN to good defense by Florida State once again but nobody was there to accept the pass from Jamir Watkins getting clean looks but you got to make those shots Davis pushing back the other way thats a tough one for tord thats his third foul went straight up he move by The Freshman to go into his chest and just go get the Applause foul just penetrate straight in there and it is a tough complaint from coach prer about the foul tord was straight up in position and hes going to ride Bert Smith for a while and really Eric Lewis is the one hes mad at cuz he called the foul yeah that is a massive third foul hes one of the best players not just for winther but in the entire Big South hes fun to watch too its one of those things where you know its its its going to hurt everybody if he fouls out its like Malik Yan leaves the floor for Florida State Hamilton talking to Jackson trying to make sure they manage the time properly coming down here with the two minutes left in the game in the first half Florida State without a few players in the win over two land coach Hamilton excited to get more of the troops back and allows his team to play their system more effectively and not so taxing on the players that he does have on the floor and thats what is indicative of this score spreading out a little bit too is the uh the depth of Florida State its an FSU team that wins by committee and contrary to the fact that it feels like Watkins and Yan have been the two dominating factors the way historically it has gone for Leonard Hamiltons teams couple of guys with eight six 5 four everybody chips in they win by committee and thats what theyre getting back to coach was talking about that in shoot around today coach Hamilton was talking about how its very unusual that hes got two heavy dominant offensive players its usually just as you use the phrase committee its whos going to take the big shot going back to like a Michael snare is a freshman hitting a big shot at Duke to win at Cameron you know then he went on that year to to make three more game winners but thats not how it would happen David is donkeys dropping 30 points on Carolina here its its this its different for him this year where hes getting everything from two guys well you just took me back to two of my favorite memories of my freshman year hey thats what Im here for but he like those are Monumental games that anyone that watches college basketball remembers those games the Carolina game the dke game it was Big Time flest State days Watkins doesnt get the roll but will shoot a couple of free throws hey for his stats he gets two more free thrs there you go aggressive at The Rim theres not much you can do to stop him if you cant keep him in front hes going to the rim and you going to score get fouled or miss four of eight from the floor here in this first half hes a perfect two of two at the line and so feels quiet but a chance hes already already Jacob in double figures so far in this game and a chance to get up to 13 with still 2 minutes left in this first half quickly they add up real quick yeah and again these two teams two of the better teams at earning trips to the line wi through nobody better than the Eagles in the country 31 A2 free throw attempts a game Florida State 271 just outside the top five in six and I just got a text uh Luke L I havent readit but Im sure it says who threw the ball to Michael snare for that game winner of dude Luke LS whats he done hasnt he had a great career professionally yes he has Im surprised hes not sitting on any Bay tonight but I know they played last night they must have the night Applause out that one swatted out of play remains with win for the moment look at the congestion with the defense down there Taylor B boen just not in my house baby hes dunking it hes shooting it and hes blocking it tonight doing a little bit of everything Mr Bowen into to do set winr needs a basket and they get it courtesy of the senior three different punt fakes to get that finish it has been a tough day at the office so far for the Eagles Runner doesnt go for Chandler Jackson Harrison triying to break it down out to the wing that doesnt go one of the last nine now offensively for the Eagles fsus got numbers snon wide open in the corner too strong yeah its good look hes wide open right there but sometimes its good to throw it on down to the big man let him finish it HE2 was waiting on it Baker off the trailer Florida States going to slow things down here with Chandler Jackson timeout called by Florida State the way theyre shoot the ball were not going to have to worry about changing the Nets out after the game Florida State leads by 16 well step aside for the moment on E fsus final nonconference game of the 2024 202 uh 2025 season next up the wolton Cardinals will come into town this weekend its a good match up the new coach up there Pat Kelce uh coached with Mark prer uh and work for Mark Pros dad skip prer with Forest Taylor B Bowen launches another three gets the rebound fresh 20 for the nolles and Taylor B Bowen knocks down the floater nice high finish with that ball back to that Louisville game that Louisville match up will be two similar teams its kind of like this matchup thats a foul on dayquan Davis got him with the hook tried to hook his body as he tried to get that deflection win is in the bonus itll be a one and one wins going to have to make some shots in the second half right now theyre at 29 from the floor and Florida States at 60 so its Florida State keeps the hot hand in the second half its going to be a tough he to climb for win Eagles are only last n absolutely they are but even the free ones arent free here in this first half for the Eagles especially of late Taylor B Bowen traveled with the basketball nearly lost it out of play its a turnover nonetheless with 10 seconds left not a bad turnover at least he didnt give up a live ball layup under the basket but he left his feet to give kind of an outlet pass which is a bad move but you know hes allowed one mistake with the game hes having here tonight offensively 96 boards two blocks for Taylor B Bowen in the first half that ball was kicked out of play remains with win through kind of got an odd match up out here A bunch of everyones new on the well three new guys and two returners for Florida State theyre two most veteran guys and Jackson and Bo boen you got the Freshman Jones here a lot of youngsters on the floor five left Jones calls his own number Hits front IR NE to brings it down and that will put an end to the first half here at the Donald El Tucker Center Jacob inmation of the first half it was close until it wasnt what a strong final 10 minutes of this first half for Florida State exactly both teams played great defense early and kept it snug but then Florida timeout youre down a little bit second TV timeout youre down a little bit more by halftime youre down 15 20 points and like its just hard to recover when you dont have enough forces in your stable to keep up with these athletes like as far as they has as we get the second half underway here in Tallahassee a quick look at whats at stake wins looking for their first win over an ACC opponent in a decade the nlls are looking for their best start to not toer play since the 2019 2020 season thats what coach froster wants to see coming out of the shoots knocking it down the first off for The Possession its worth mentioning at least for Florida State sake you know you go into Co year where everybody started in December you got into conference play pretty quickly so theres a little bit of context that needs to be applied there but suffice it to say the ns are off to a good start and their best start now in some time Taylor B Bowen went up there to get the loose ball and it got knocked out of Play Hey Kelton tford said not with me today you better jump a little higher oh Bo with a massive rebound but look at Kelton tord just throwing that thing in the front row showing off that motor hes got right Motors were going to touch on that in a second hes got a heck of a motor Florida States going to try to motor this ball down to the basket 10 seconds left Chandler Jackson knocks down the three from the wing talking about Motors we talked about this in the break coach prer said he recruits Motors he wants his players to have a high motor on defense on offense on rebound and he said thats why they rebound us so so well is they have that motor of attack and I had an NBA Scout tell me one time if you go buy a car dont you want to look at everything you better not buy on looks alone you better buy a good motor certainly important Johnson picks his way through traffic and will earn a trip to the free throw line Chandler Jackson knocking one down from Deep the bench all fired up look at shooting the arrows baby threes from Deep worth mentioning that was the second foul on Malik Yan that will send Johnson to the free throw line but I think it is interesting Jacob right when you talk about D1 basketball youre talking about the best of the best kids coming out of club and coming out of high school and theres so many people that play basketball growing up that you know when skills are the same theres got to be something that separates you and its those intangibles that are what land so many of these kids on these roosts absolutely and at a at a school and a level like wiri thats where they exhale they go after a kid that fits their mold you know Mike sheski makes a reference about its hard to when you have your hand wide open he goes what can you hurt with your hand wide open he goes but if you put your fingers all together and make a fist you can punch through a wall and thats exactly how win through recruits they put a puzzle together versus just getting a bunch of pieces and hoping it works off the deflection Taylor B Bowen puts that ball up and through and Florida State opens up an 18point lead once again here within the first couple of minutes of play in the second half Johnson gets the roll and one Johnson putting that shoulder down taking the contact adding to those free throw attempts and Im sure coach prer just talked about this the halftime go to the rim guys we attack the glass you see right here hes got his veteran doing what he likes to do attacking and if you dont have it kick it out but theyve got to be who they are they kind of fell off in that last 10 minutes of the first half they werent working the ball they were taking quick shots they they worked in practice today they had five or six shots that you had to pass the ball six times during their workout before they could take a shot and they had possessions here in the second half in the first half where they were just jacking up Johnson cash is in the and one and if wins going to make their way back in this game tford is a stud for sure but Nick Johnson is going to factor heavily into it he had four points in the first half in the first three minutes of the second half Jacob he has eight and thats thats what they got to have you know hes hes got to deliver they need his energy and what he brings to the table uhoh we got another huddle not they dont go in the camera though thats a good thing caser just joining us we had a huddle within the first two minutes of the first half and a trip to the Monitor and a technical foul and conversations with both coaching staffs and it was a slow start to say the least here in Tallahassee but were Up Tempo and here we go Applause J Harrison with the feet tford looking for room nice move couldnt get the Finish he never had a good grip on that ball when he took it up too many long arms in the way Jackson comes to a stop nearly traveled doesnt get called for DeQuan Davis pulls it back out and its Jackson once again with it now back up top to Music Davis 10 Watkins looking for room off the shot pick thats not really why can shot you know hes he he he usually finishes going at The Rim where his momentums carrying and hes got an uncanny his unbelievable touch the way he can go at the rim and release it there he kind of did like a pullup jump shot which is not his move going inside B was last Touched By An Eagle so it goes back to Florida state with a fresh 20 on the clock will see if they can do better with this half cour set inside Yan its a great way to get it done great clear out got everybody out on the perimeter and Yan sealed his man on his backside Malik Yan seven of seven hes got 15 points and he also has 10 rebounds a double double for the Jo transfer just no help to get there Johnson tried to reach in at the last second but hes so much taller than cord he cant believe anything about it massive Collision down low it will go to Florida state ducet will be called for the personal the shove of Chandler Jackson thats his third for duet can send him to the bench hes a big piece of the puzzle for them hes their second post player really and he gave him the old shove going to call that every day so Jette picked up his third now at one point count tford was listed as having three in the first half somewhere thats been revised because now hes at two thats a blessing I was going to say with two set with three if you had both of those guys with three thats a totally different picture those are their two horses in the paint theyve got a a lot to Corral down there in the paint tonight tough task to come back on this Florida State team that has really played well from the halfway point of the first half on you and has been nearly perfect couldnt get that one to go and Harrison brings it across for winth they did a great job getting under him and keeping him from getting to the rim that was the first Miss from the floor for Malik Yu and a tie up but a personal foul will be called this time on chanler Jackson he did a great job trying to rip that from the ball away from him on the drive but he didnt get a good grab so he dont get the jump ball thats got to be a foul third foul called against Florida State here in this second half one for winr so theyll uh theyll balance that out here in a little while and well see how that shakes Applause out Nick Johnsons been the hot hands and that pass was hot as well that ball nearly became a souvenir Im just glad hes throwing it at the guys in the front row and not you and I over here at the table that happened to him early in the game they tried to penetrate you penetrate leave your feet youre susceptible to be throwing the ball the wrong spot and that kind of happened to him right there he already left and thought he was going to pass it his teammate cut when he put it on the floor two minutes in counting now without a point for win through not the recipe for Success when youre trailing by Music 17 Jackson nearly tied up gets it to Taylor B Bowen had it swatted away good work by Florida State making the best of that Watkins spins and was fouled on the floor crer is super unhappy here as we go to break here in a second but he he thinks he walked and now we have to work this out wat can have an heck of a game today on the offensive and defensive glass so far he said hes been harping on it since they got on the plane to fly back from South Florida talking about rebounding because the 40 to 27 on the glass with two lane highlighted by Barnes grabbing a 16 point rebound career high and then going back to the Florida game they got out rebounded 40 to 27 they were lucky to get the win against tan but they they really have got to step up the rebound and going into ACC play theres another offensive rebound for Florida State making all the effort in Hustle plays decoin Davis had it rejected though Hamilton no serve good look in transition camarad cant cash it in and maluk got tripped up trying to Corral the rebound dwen Davis had a good look and Ty Hamilton just said no sir as we mentioned earlier 46 blocks per game in high school led the state he leads the big or hes fourth in the Big South with 13 blocks a game long young player that coach prer is excited about to kind of play alongside tord and DEET at times yeah there are certain basketball States when you see a kid come out of a state like North Carolina or in Indiana and theyre the best Blocker in the state that alone just looms large you know cuz shot blocking is a skill its you can be tall and not block shots just cannot buy a bucket they cant get over the long arms of Florida State speaking of blocks its not always a block when and that wasnt a block that was potentially o a charge yeah an offensive foul I believe called against air maluk he got his he got him one late in the first half up here top of the key right in front of us with a moving screen and they tack one another one on him here 1450 the young fella still thats growing pains for a big guy especially and then you got a young guy that reclassified he really should be in high school had one more year Village Billy reclassified and came into FL State early so off the offensive foul the lead is 17 nice job there defensively by the nolles here they come running the floor Jackson all alone lays it in in transition yeah a lot of contact down here on that layup and then heading back the other way b b blocks back to back blocks B Bowen camarad once again left open cant cat that one in either another look for camarad that is short Applause not making shots both teams trying to win everyone crashing the glass its a recipe for confrontations everyones going to get tested coaches are going to get frustrated its a really good block from behind Taylor B does a great job Maloo jumped with him I can see you thinking there was a foul but that was a pretty clean defensive possession by Florida State coach prer is definitely working the refs and I would be too if I was him he you need everybody on the same page tonight players and the bench as it stands win of trailing by 19 I mentioned they have been able to buy a bucket of late theyre 0 for their last eight they havent scored a single point in nearly 4 minutes meanwhile Florida state has opened up their largest lead of the game Justin Thomas trying to stretch it and will along two for Justin Thomas lot of coaches get mad if you take that thing as a two but got to take what you can get from the sidelines couple inches get you an extra Applause Music point tford fouled inside Thomas trying to get the steal the quick rip calford had a good grip on the Music ball looks like they did score it as a three I thought he was just inside so did I all right well Justin Thomas has made a three here in the second half hell gladly take it and Florida State opens up the lead now to 22 jir Watkins tried to close out there on Baker but Baker beats the D and Cashes in himself Baker loves to shoot to three knock one down the first half also Malik Yuan didnt get the benefit of the role that time nice move to give himself an opportunity there to clean things up off the weak side tford but a foul called on the floor before theyll stick back got him with a push Isaiah Wilson Isaiah Wilson heading to the line a guy that has not played a whole lot of basketball over the last couple of years two catastrophic knee injuries hed only played six games over the last two seasons hell shoot a couple of free throws as we do make a trip back to the moniter what we understand trying to make sure that all the clocks are in perfect synchronicity we got the shot clock where it needs to be and the game clock and there it goes back to 13 28 as a fan at home you you go like why is he going over there but you know that the seconds add up especially if this game were tight you know a couple seconds on the shot clock a couple seconds on the game clock late in the game really determines the outcome of the game and so its its frustrating sometimes as a fan at home when you dont really know whats going on kudos to our crew letting us know what was happening and in that case looked like they put 12 seconds back on a lot of things can happen in 12 seconds especially in a tight game Applause no words hey 19point deficit um its been that kind of day right he came in uh played really well early winter was in his game and a good position and now its its a little different than it was certainly to say the least and well Ill say this as it looks like is Wilsons going to get some medical attention over there in front of the bench bued his elbow when he went down last thing you want to see is a kid whos been banged up throughout the course of his career getting hurt yet again his coach Mark Crosser was telling us how fun its been to see him back on the floor and how much hes commended Wilson who transferred in from Richmond just in terms of the guttin to not only come back from one injury but two yes and its its re cing is challenging you know most people are are are fans of sports havent played that much Sports as these guys have and being inundated in your sport is your life and then it gets ganked away from you instantaneously and you have to work 6 months sometimes nine months just to get back up to the level you need to be physically and prer is so excited to see Wilson fight through that twice not just once but twice hes been through that on top of that too as he makes good on the second free throw attempt Im going to quote the late great Michael Ojo who said to go places youve never been before youve got to do things youve never done before and if youre win trying to get back to the NCAA tournament a lot of these guys havent made that trip Wilson did when he was at Richmond and thats what he adds to this team and Coach Brer talked about that when we were talking about today nice over the defense pass from D Feed it perfectly from about 50 ft away and that opens up a 20 point lead for Florida State after then goes over the top to Yan Who cashes in yet again Johnson got off to a hot start in this second half dribbles that one off of AJ swintons foot itll remain with winth at this over the top almost finished for the dunk but youan smart makes a headyy move to Corral it and go back up for the easy finish 17 points for Malik Yan who on the backside of going 17 and 177 at LSU graling 11 offensive rebounds which again in terms of record keeping is a record for Florida State then set a career high 23 points in the very next game against NC State now he dishes up daquin Davis whos short on the jumper showing some of that point forward skill he has from Junior College got that right all that to say you and has a chance to have another really special showing here with still 12 and 12 left of the half still no luck offensively for winre no and calford right there to get that rebound stolen and cleaned up by Johnson wrapping it up and drawing the foul and apparently that is what it takes for winr to get back in the scoring column just one of their last 11 not only getting the elusive field goal but now getting an an opportunity just a good look talford got position goes up there thinks hes going to get the rebound a RI it from him and then Johnson comes in gets the steal the Relentless defense constantly constantly putting pressure on the ball went for the defensive style good looking free throw there for Johnson who has 15 in this game 11 of which coming in this half tied what he did last year against Florida State leading score on the floor over the top the NOS go again to Malik Yan he tried to get that back to a teammate and bounced it out of play like the effort for the Jo transfer this patented move on that Baseline when he leaves his feet to try to slam it in hard off somebody to get a bounce out of bounds 17 point lead lead for Florida State who led by 18 at the Music half tough bounce pass from 35 ft you want to make that a air pass Harrison driving Baseline Baker had it knocked Away by Yuan Here Comes Justin Thomas floating it up top Swinton couldnt cash it in daqu one Davis with the Steal and the nles have numbers Yan down low dishes it to Thomas who pulls it back Applause out nice move for Yan it goes watching that ball goes out of play and that will send us to our Under 12 mediate timeout here at the tuck the nlls leading by 17 at a couple of times it feels like if theyre going to work their way back into it Nick Johnsons going to be a key factor he is a key he struggled early in the first half had some turnovers had some bad shots that didnt fall for him and kind of just couldnt get it going but here you see in the second half he has turned it up and he is getting it done he scored 20 against Queens recently 15 points against their victory at Coastal Carolina started the last six games hes shooting 52 from the field and you can see right here hes turning those numbers around three for four here in the second half right back on track 15 points for the game hes a guy that his head coach Mark crer said is a dynamic paint toucher and a lot of those guards really get the job done getting into the paint then they get those kicks out theyre a team that historically shoots the ball well off of those looks and he said frankly he came into the season with an injury and its been over the last couple of weeks that hes gotten up to speed and is looking more like his old self which is makes sense why he didnt start early you know but you know its funny that hes a paint toucher and steal almost half his shots are threes that just shows you his intelligence to know when to drive and when to pull up for the jump shot so here come the Eagles theyve held Florida State without a bucket for 2 minutes theyve got to cash in on their own camarad cant do it from Point Blank Range and there to bring down the rebound is Justin Thomas his pass though picked off theres motorman Tel for just what we talking about whoa AJ Swit okay young man young F from Maryland is a big time athlete from behind just does a great job of making it clean and not trying to do too much with it a lot of time a youngster will swing his arm real big and get a foul he just kind of poked it like a volleyball Music a much needed three another freshman Jones II Crosser talked about in prac day on how hes just found his way into the starting lineup for them this year yeah we got a whole bunch of veterans to see a freshman in there he said if you would have told me in June that Id have a freshman in my starting lineup I would have told you youre crazy he said if you told me in August that I had a freshman in my starting lineup I would have told you youre crazy he said but we got into camp we got into the meat of things and we realized hes pretty good and hes been really good of late yes hes hit hit some crucial shots against Louisville in that game up there and his ability to just make threes with confidence you know as a freshman the games really fast when you first get out here as a young guy and hes obviously its slowing down for him its its showing in his play thats coach said that there isnt a moment too big for him a great quality to have as a freshman dequin Davis also a freshman picks that ball up good ball Movement by Florida State and Taylor Bal Bowen throws it down two guys sharing the ball and one guy being selfish and throwing it through the rim Taylor B Bowen big stuff for Taylor B Bowen he then goes to work defensively and clears the glass great pass by Jones the third to get that interior bounce pass though Yan unselfish gives it up to Taylor B Bowen thats the Peaks and valleys we talked about earlier with Taylor B Bowen he does some great things and then hell hell struggle a little bit Johnson left open couldnt cash in foul called on the floor and thatll give us a chance to collect our breath and take a look at some highlights the fall gets loose dayin Davis says Im not in my house Im ringing That Thing Up it takes it in transition and Jackson with a little oneand touch B Bowen with the Finish teamwork working together unselfish not trying to force a bad shot up big and still getting clean good transition possessions leard Hons got to be happy with where his teams at right now 6145 Florida State one thing working against the nolles though they have put winr in the bonus the Eagles have only committed three fouls and for a team that shoots a bunch of free throws you would like to think that could be their pathway in but you got to make them yes and theyre only shooting in the mid60s I think its 65 as their free throws as a team so they dont make all of them but they get a lot of them off of their attempts and theyre drawing fouls as it stands it is a 60 run for winr over the last 255 and speaking of drawing fouls and going to the free throw line jir Watkins is the expert at going to the rim put it on the floor and taking the contact Ill correct myself 62 run because Taylor B Bowen destroyed the rim on the back side of that my little stat monitor hasnt updated quite yet so I am guilty of just reading at face value what was on there itll be Davis to send it in with 901 left Music Watkins 10 left on the shot clock thats knocked away it remains with the NES Johnson on that own ball defense was refusing to take that screen from you and way he fought over got his leg and whipped his leg over the top defensively as a coach you got to love to see your guards be aggressive getting through those ball screens and it goes to Chandler Jackson and that is again knocked out of play wi has turned up that defensive pressure and intensity on Florida State made a little bit tougher for the NS to run their offense over the last few minutes yeah you know theyve cut it to 16 it was starting to look like it was going to get way out of control just keep it close and have a chance at the end tough look there for Chandler Jackson and there is Malik huan once again with another offensive rebound top five in the ACC in offensive rebounds coming intoon has a handful more and finishes as well Malik Yan is on a heater and it is a pleasure to watch him do what he does hes smoking hot the way he backed him down he had great defense on him talford did but just too much from Yan tolford shaking up off the foul its a clean looking basketball play to me but were going to go check it out I saw the tly finger from Bert Smith contact to the head or the face its our second visit of the evening folks if youre joining us here in the second half 18point lead for Florida State and well see if this ends up as a common foul or if it becomes anything egregious On The Backs side of this review and lets talk about you know Winters doing a little better job on the glass right now yes like they they had struggled in the first half Im sure coach Frost went har that at halftime about after getting cleaned up on the glass early talford goes up strong and yeah thats just a a fluke you know its its a tough break hes up there trying to tip it and and decoin Davis hits him in the face on a loose ball its not a a crazy aggressive intent but but but we were saying the aggressiveness is back up and yes and went through now with going to the class how was it when I was a student and he went on I remember when he graduated hes like Im going to work for the Broncos Im like what you going to do with the Broncos hes like Im going to be the mascot he he was making six figures like to be the mascot and like Im like thats phenomenal and he makes hes like I get tips for doing birthday parties like its a place where everybody would athleticism interesting interesting didnt realize that mascots do birthday parties yeah man sign up thats fun I uh missed a boat I should have got a mascot for a recent party at my house but I forgot theres always another chance sons graduation party is going to Auburn I should have got Obby down there for it its only threehour Drive gas and some cash people do about anything speaking of opportunities wi has an opportunity they have trimmed into Florida States rebounding Edge theyve trimmed into the lead tford took a step forward there at least in terms of the team from the free throw line but you cannot lose Chandler Jackson on the perimeter that is his second three of the game his value on the team is so much greater when hes making threes and you better call out them back screens get the guys teeth knocked out Jones the third in and out was halfway down and it came it came Applause out and with that we go to our under eight media timeout here in Tallahassee the NOS lead up to 9 team mascot and thats one that Ive seen in person Ill also say this puddles at Oregon right up there when you have your mascot making guest picks at college game day thats pretty iconic stuff pretty solid no doubt well nolles and Eagles and mascots oh my this commentary has kind of gone to the birds here of late as we get back to the action Malik Yuan going back up top Watkins in and out one step off a shot Watkins is way better a step closer to that threepoint line off the give Johnson swings it to the corner good ball Movement by Winthrop and the Freshman couldnt cash it in Davis Jackson will go to the free throw line guess who grabbed that rebound I mean do I have to guess Malik you and getting another one and another one and another one 13 on the night to go with his 19 points becoming something of a trend isnt it great pass by dayquan Chandler Jackson trying to finish a little bit of contact if he makes that they were going to let it go I would bet but good piece of officiating with the bump youre better off calling that foul so both teams dont get frustrated Jacksons had a really nice night for Florida state that is his 13th Point careerhigh 19 against Boston College a season ago so quietly starting to creep up on that is Jackson number zero in white one of just three veterans to return to Florida State so just on that basis Alone look to as a leader and the coaches and players all love them yes you know he hes really brought a lot to the table here coming into his junior year but he big minutes for him to tonight because with Holts injury with this foot Jacksons having to to pull more point guard duties where he plays a little bit of offg guard in a normal rotation 14 points for Chandler Jackson to go along with three boards and an assist Johnson inside gets the finish all this coming together explains why I heard coach Hilton at practice go a real okay playing Chandler at the point now we know why Chan playing point guard tonight was important Applause that Balls knocked away Yan wins it back Watkins Rises and fires and Cashes in from Beyond the perimeter right in his wheelhouse right outside the line he can knock it down all night 16 points for jir Watkins athletic move but it goes wanting Florida State brings down the rebound Chandler Jackson giving it up to Justin Thomas Watkins for three more yes sir he looks at me said I can shoot it from anywhere dont be trying to tell me where to shootter from with that NBA range a 60 jir Watkins run over the last 28 Music Applause seconds meanwhile winr still cannot get a finish that is yet another shot that has done everything but drop can they cash in here you bet Bry Baker from the corner left wide open got all three of those definitely one of their best Shooters when he gets a good look hes going to knock it down time out Leonard Hamilton and Florida state with the lead up to 22 and I think thats interesting Jacob youre talking about winr shooting the basketball and theyre a team that over the last handful of games has shot it a little bit better there was some question from Mark Crosser though will it translate against a power four team nice three by Baker hes made a couple theyve made six as a team but its six of 30 yes and you know he talked about that he stood right here in front of us leaning on the table and says you know we really cant expect to shoot it as well its not going to be indicative of the amount of the quality of our Shooters against this team tonight because theyre so long and big but theyre going against the number one threepoint defense in the ACC at 267 a game is what theyre holding their opponents to Florida State on threepoint shots so you should expect this to 73 of 273 attempts by States opponents have fall have fallen so you know its its not surprising that theyre not making threes because of the Florida States defense their rotation their close out on the shooters proster was spot on and he as you said you know hes not worried because hes played now four pretty good teams that have hurt them they struggled to shoot on the road you and I talked about that off camera earlier and uh he knows thats going to be different when they get the big South so as it stands as Eagles Trail by 22 to Florida State jir Watkins has been flooding the stat sheet here especially over the last couple of minutes and he will go to the free throw line here momentarily thatll be on K Harrison thatll be his first personal foul of the game as we talked about hes been to the free throw line third most in the country and division one NCAA perfect four of four tonight is jir Watkins with one make he hits 20 points in this game with a couple of course eclipses that and no problem there for Watkins who as you mentioned earlier in the show Jacob has been finding a stroke at the free throw line yes you know we we struggled early he was in the 60s the first first five or six games he really struggled for jir Watkins uh considering he was a 80 plus free throw shooter last year and so hes got to build that number back up you know hes got to make a lot to get those negatives go away makes both of them there and Florida States lead swells to 24 Brian Jolly Back Off the Bench brings it across the timeline Baker cant miss from the corner here over the last couple of minutes and reels in the soft pass down the floor Beggars their best threepoint shooter looking for another one k Harrison tees him up and he cashes in again three a charm three times in a row I see you Bryce Baker 15 points five of 10 from three and thats another turnover by Florida State why not off the heat check its short b b right there to reel it in nearly another turnover in fact it should be for Florida State willll be a dead ball turnover right into the bench and the turnovers as you and I talking about off camera theres not a lot of steals you know its five steals for um for winthrip and six steals for Florida State its like bad passes live ball turnovers just out of bound bobles but the defense causes that too because you have to whip the pass different because of the way the defense is rotating Jolly side steps in and out tell you what wi is dialing up some of their best looks from Beyond the perimeter here over the last couple of minutes theyre getting some open looks Baker to his credits made three over the last two minutes or so jolly did everything but drop there but lined it up pretty well you know you I give Pro Coach prer credit where hes got his guys you see Baker right here hes just been on fire here in the last like 90 seconds but theyre not quitting you know theyre in this game they came right here to Music play Wilson drives into the paint Baker left open on the wing you cant lose him especially over the last two minutes minutes look down he talking a little smack time out Leonard Hamilton and Coach ham is n too pleased as his team heads over to the bench Bryce Baker trying to get the Eagles hes a capable shooter got his career high second in threes last year for Old Dominion before the transfer this year having a great night morsell North Carolina native also home of NASCARs finest yeah it is NASCAR Haven up there also some of the best jet skiing youll find in the Lake Norman area Justin Thomas cant get his three ball to go I think Wilson was holding Ds Jersey on that rebound I got him for the hold and trying to be sneaky so D will go to the free throw line he has yet to score and still has yet to score Malik Yan wasnt able to clean it up effort play to Coral the rebound but wasnt able to cash it in for a couple more points JY trying to make his way around Dan dishes it to Hamilton and Dan swaps it away good job getting back on D by winr Thomas pulls it out and gives it up to Watkins Yan was expecting Chandler Jackson to continue cutting to the basket and its a misconnection by the NES the young sophomore Hamilton he kind of thinks he gets by the first Defender he doesnt realize hey here in the ACC theres another Defender coming too with the same length the big long arm dang swatting it Music away going to keep it eye on though its a 90 run for wintha States turned it over four times while the Eagles have scored those nine points so theyve given themselves the slightest of opportunities here but every possession increasingly important for the Eagles on both sides of the floor Yan fouled on the Drive Hamilton just trying to everything he could to get the ball from you starting at the top hes kept being a pest on the way down the lane will be a one and one for Malik Yan mes not yet into the double bonus just the eighth foul on winr as a team here in this second half you in a 63 foul Music shooter Baker brings it down but crashes out of play it will go back to Florida stay tough break for Baker May got a little contact but somewhat Music incidental so 227 left itll be Chandler Jackson who will send it in for the nlls FSU in the business of milking every possession at this point taking their time swinging it to Watkins pull up on the Baseline that is strong Taylor B Bowen wrestles down the offensive rebound and that is a worst case scenario if youre win through as good a rebounding team as they are they cant wrap them all up Yan Music floats it up off the glass got back his own Miss and finishes Jolly thought about pulling up in transition instead dishes camarad now back to Jolly in the corner bring the double minute and a half left here in regulation Wilson nearly lost the dribble and thatll be a goal tending violation I imagine here for Florida State Baker hasnt seen a clean look since that last time out Leonard Hamilton called shutting down that hot Applause streak as you mentioned you got to love the fight yeah Florida State doing the the manly thing and not trying to score quick and run the clock down shorten the game here they can take it down just to just over a minute about a minute and two seconds once the shot clock expires assuming they milk all of it Watkins bumped on the perimeter thats a lot of contact that wasnt called against Jamir Watkins should remain here with Florida state three seconds left on the shot clock going to get a lob or a quick jumper the short clock into Thomas he puts it up and Justin Thomas knocks down the midrange J Florida State hits 80 athlete from Baton Rouge showing you his quickness Wilson nearly lost the dribble Jolly puts it up from the corner that is short Watkins brings it down Bowen carals it the clock continues to tick Florida State on their way to starting off 2024 9 and three and the continued steps forward as Leonard Hamilton has rebuilt the program yet again looks like another positive step for the Nolls here tonight foul called on the floor against camarat oh Bowen had him a heck of a night tonight with 13 points and 11 rebounds his first career double double hes thrown in a couple block shots to go with it hes really had a good game hopefully carry him some momentum going into Louisville this weekend well we got a second jir Watkins is going to go to the Line This is a story that I thought was neat that fsus terrific Sid Chuck Walsh put in his notes if Folks at home remember jir Watkins his number was two last year its one this year in high school he wore two and one he wore zero at VCU wore two last year hes wearing one this year kind of h a happy medium going back to a number he used to wear and also for jir Watkins the fact that hes going to be the first person in his family to get a college degree hes especially proud of that and I think a lot of times folks forget that theyre student athletes and there is significance to what they do in the classroom as well and I thought that was cool that hes so proud of that that hes changed his number to one yeah youre right and its the age of the transfer portal people forget it is about academics first Athletics second its becom an Athletics first with that foul but coach crer talked the same thing about talford this past weekend graduating with his degree and how proud he was and twifords parents and family it was such a big moment for win uh but its its about academics and Athletics Mark crer Hamilton two on the screen right there not step on you Sean but yeah youre good uh the big senior broke a lot of Records there at winr and its uh its tough for him to sit here and watch this game sck away from them and you go back to his coach and Florida States legendary head coach Leonard Hamilton two men who do things the right way on the court off the court kids graduating has been a staple for Leonard Hamilton here at Florida State especially and of course you look at Mark Crosser his dad the legendary skip Crosser ran a tremendous program at Wake Forest his predecessor Pat Kelce took the mantle and ran a great program he will be coming in here next with Louisville and so you just sort to see a lot of really good people that have done a really good job on the court and off the court its probably a good scouting report for Florida State too because Kelsey and prer run some similar things so theyre going to see a similar offense and a similar defense coming in this weekend but a little more little more oomph coming with Louisville more horses better athletes ACC play conference play is coming in hot and so is Florida State who improves
