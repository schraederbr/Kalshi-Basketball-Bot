should be noted that one of Cal Stars Andre sko yakovich the son of Pedra sakovich did not play in that game Andre is healthy and in the lineup here tonight starting for the Bears with the basketball in their home white uniforms and theyre 12 and 15 Record 5 and 11 in conference play here is Andre sko yakovich averaging 18 points per game his first year with Cal after playing as a freshman across the bay for Stanford to on blackshire they need to get him going offensively he struggled as of late leaner misses there as the shot clock was winding down last three games for Javon averaging just two points per averaging 10 on the season so well below his averages this year and for the SMU Mustangs you mentioned all the scores BJ Edwards Chuck Harris KY o Kendo quendo came over from Oregon theyve got opportunities up and down the lineup to score the problem is can they stop Cal from keeping Music Applause Music two on the shot clock and banked in first bucket of the game for SMU with their 20 and7 record overall but 11 and five in conference play and really Cory the issue for them has just been not enough of those Marquee wins 0 and five in Quad One games this year indeed and theyre a team that I believe is tournament worthy I think theyve got to help themselves over the next couple of weeks try to get as many wins as they can obviously tonight would be a good solid win for this club Rus betrus with three on the shot clock heaving one up good defense by Matt cross the senior from Beverly Massachusetts cross driving in the lane good defense Inside by Monty sis sissoko and a finger roll there after the loose ball picked up by BJ Edwards Applause C still searching for its first bucket of the game so yakovich short on the Applause three we welcome a new audience joining us on ESPNU Berkeley California for ACC basketball here in the B as the Bears get on the board with Mi soku the layup there Eric Rothman Cory Williams here with you as SMU firmly on the bubble according to Joe lonardi as Chuck Harris buries the three for the Mustangs right now SMU according to Joe is one of the first four out theyve already defeated Cal once this year but the issue hasnt been stacking wins in ACC play Cory theyre 11 and five the problem has been the Marquee wins theyre 0 and five in Quad one game this year and thats going to stick out all coaches and programs know that is part of the criteria theyve got to figure out a way to get it done SMU is without their leading score Bry Miller whos injured and missing his fourth straight game Cal with the basketball is 5 and 11 in conference play this year currently ranked 15th in the ACC the top 15 teams in the conference make the conference tournament so the Bears equally as motivated here tonight to get a w certainly dont want to deal with the unfortunate embarrassment of missing that postseason tournament theyre going to have to get a timeout to talk about it SMU a couple of threes and a couple of layup Andys first year as the head coach with the Mustangs and the team has not been to the NCAA tournament since 2017 so trying to do it as a debutant as a head coach for SMU build up that resume get off the B well as joardy currently has SMU as one of the first four teams out right now SMU is shooting 57 from the floor on a 60 run and Cal getting nothing going on the offensive end DJ Edwards who knocked down to three just before the break and yakovich the rebound its going to be key obviously for Cal tonight can they limit send you to one Applause shot Atrius in the lane and hes fouled already early on for SMU top the rebounding battle 7 to3 and that was a key in the first match up between these two teams when SMU won 7665 at home on January 29th they outrebounded Cal by 10 you know e basketball is a simple game if you dominate the glass you have a very good chance to come out with a win thats why coaches preach it and you look at that stattic can always tell you whats going on in the trenches in terms of physicality hes being a little more mentally tough trius at the free throw line ends a twominute scoring drought for Cal head coach Mark Madson in his second season what was his rival when he was a player at Music Applause Stanford sure had to feel a little weird putting on the Cal corn zip the first year that he was the named the coach cross in the corner that was something coach maton told us in warmups today we have to limit we have to limit Matt cross getting open threes they didnt do it there well right he didnt do anything to get open the motion got him open Cal had to rotate and of all the people you need to leave hes not one of them off nearly a 40 threepoint shooter on the season Thea baby hook in the lane Brad transfer from Michigan State Michigan State how about the buzzer beater to beat Maryland today as Chuck Harris quickly answers for the Mustangs well you can see the Mustangs really are going to test cows oneonone defense if youre not up on them theyre going to let it fly and invite you to pressure them and theyre also good off the bounds so its just hard when guys start making threes defense becomes more and more difficult to playu four for four for three is Soko back the offensive rebound he missed the shot but it was Rus pus there to it in and we talked about petrius earlier today hes the blue collar guy does the Dirty Work in the paint there you see him winning the extra possession sweet Touch by S yigu The Freshman from Turkey well he is a big body they love to get him the ball on the Block and you dont see a lot of sevenfooters with that kind of touch 18 to7 lead 6 minutes into this game in Berkeley California ACC on ESPN BR Cory Williams at the hos Applause I right now SMU just shooting lights down 64 from the floor four of four from three meanwhile Cal just 27 from the floor and when youre dealing with somebody thats four for four from three you got to start to run them off the line cuz it is contagious theres the block quendo got a hand on it transition opportunity here for SMU SMU likes to get out and move second and scoring offense in the ACC this year at 82 points per game and Chuck Harris has 11 points in the opening 6 and2 minutes for the Mustang well I just said it a moment ago you got a problem now four for four from three invites that fifth one and there you saw it five for five and you can guarantee that no one is going to hesitate shooting threes when they havent missed one yet J C turn around at the elbow 217 Mustang Off to the Races go on Keon androse Hilton contact no whistle reverse layup is good patrus tried to sell the charge didnt get the whistle and now a steal on the inbound its BJ Edwards walked from behind K TR his good recovery outstanding recovery after they made the mental error on the inbounds and a transition fre just with the Bears needed and its Jeremiah wilon the star freshman whos averaging 20 points per game in the month of Music Applause February Edwards looking for some help kcks it out to Harris who has the hot hand hes four of four from the floor cut off on the Baseline four to shoot and a foul against SMU as haris was too aggressive trying to get space in the L and youve seen this calls much differently over the past three or four seasons the offensive player not allowed to dislodge the defender right there a little too aggressive on the post up from Harris Michael Greenstein Randy Richardson Ryan Sano the three referees 123 to go in the opening half SMU one of the first four out according to Joe lardys Bracketology getting some help though from Wake Forest losing at home right before this game to Virginia so that will help SMU maybe move up the ranks if they win here Music tonight from behind just a matter of time before Wilkinson started to make his impact on this game beautiful hesitation let the defender get on his back a crafty guard thats going to get a chance for an one foul called on BJ Edwards as the star freshman Jeremiah Wilkinson trying to get Cal back into it hes not just chucking him up its Chuck Harris from Deep knocking him down for SMU early as they enjoy a nice little lead Music here just play that when youre recruiting kids this is how much fun I like to have he was having fun today at shooter round hes got a good group of guys trying to keep him motivated obviously trying to make the ACC tournament second season for Mark as a head coach with Cal he spent four years as the head coach of Utah Valley had a lot of success success there was the whack Coach of the Year twice in those four years and got a good talented young group especially with Jeremiah Wilkinson leading the way hes got six points after that free throw as Cal cuts the deficit to 10 1150 to go here in the first little bit of gamesmanship right now they go to the two3 zone and they force a Miss three the first one of the night Applause interesting strategy on a team that hadnt missed a three you go Zone and invite the perimeter shot DJ Edwards did not miss by much as SMU now five six from three stolen away good defense in the passing L onj it right back SMU out on the perimeter defending as if Cal has made five threes theres a nice take to the ri The Freshman with the English a young man has it all right now hes got a couple of layups in a three got an and one definitely in the zone offensively can they follow up with a defensive stop here he likes his layups like he likes his muffin with England heres Cross of a frantic possession here by SMU George powering into the lane good defense and a Oh I thought it was going to be a hell ball instead SMU had a player on the Baseline out of bounds and itll be Cal basketball well the worst thing you can do is crowd a lightning quick guard cuz hes going to give you one of these right to the rim little bit of finesse massay off the glass like I said he is a handful has the outside J working and right there gets all the way to the rim hes going to get a breather in the corner but they know hes out there Music C has already played nine different players so far in this game nine and a half in is coach Madson trying to find a spark after going down the early deficit Mahoney a 10footer whistle on the floor against SFU and dealing with big deficits has been an issue for Cal theyve shown the ability to come back in those games but not being able to get over for the hump and win happened most recently against Georgia Tech a couple games ago but you saw them earlier in the year against Stanford had a huge double digit deficit came back just not able to pull off the r coach Madson would like to avoid those big deficits early yeah and its a combination of you know defensive intensity getting stops but more importantly offensive Rhythm when you go long stretches in college basketball without getting a bucket those types of things take place and Cals suffered on both ends they havent particularly had a great Rhythm offensively at times and then it just didnt get consecutive stops if youre not making shots and getting stops youre still in the game cross got his own rebound put it up and Matt cross whos senior played a couple years at UMass most recently a year at Louisville and a year at Miami before that ends A8 nothing run from Cal and extends the SMU lead back to double digits Wilson boded fouled Applause Chuck Harris picks up the personal thats his second thats a big foul right there Harris off to a great start getting his second foul with 10 minutes a little under 10 to go in the half and I think coach Andy enfields going to go ahead and get him out of there Harris 11 points four of four from the floor including three threes but picks up the second foul and sends Wilkinson a 78 free throw shooter to the line Applause college basketball Sonic Blockbuster on ABC features Janai groom and number one Auburn taking on the 17th ranked Kentucky team at rup Arena coverage begins at 1 Eastern Saturday on ABC to bet gorer senior from Turkey transferred over from San Jose State checking into the game for the first time for SMU Andre soak fish back on the floor for Cal and that is a familiar name that needs to get going for the Bears he can score in bunches and right now they got a stop and an opportunity to get this to a two possession game rovic scoreless so far but averaging 18 points on the season in the corner its Jon blacker a foul underneath against Cal believe its going to be on M Soko Applause his first Andre came over from Stanford theres his dad Pia long career in Sacramento comes up to almost all the games here in Berkeley threetime NBA Allstar and now his son a McDonalds AllAmerican averaging 18 points as a sophomore here for the Bears well hes such a talented player he makes a lot of things look easy on the offensive end going to be a great throw DJ camp with the Music Music Applause Swip loose ball as money coughed it up Edwards the other way slows down tried to draw contact got the bucket off the glass you see live ball turnovers nothing really changes in college basketball coaches talk about it all the time those type of opportunities SMU taking advantage of that turnover getting easy too Cal just being careless with the basketball right now a little shaky somebodys got to go grab the ball give the offense a little bit of Rhythm five to shoot for sko yakovich in the corner its DJ Campbell missed everything Campbell just a 26 three point shooter on the season under eight minutes to go here in the half Edwards inside to Colbert for the slam you know e we talked about Cal and the dry spells and if they had the turnover and they just had the air ball three this is one of the possessions where you want to get back right get some offensive Rhythm not a big possession but important and they almost turn it over here again oh they did turn it over the hell B in favor of SMU and its a near 4minute drought for the cow offense and right now SMU bringing the defense on the road getting after the ball turning it into an easy two points in transition SM Conference tournament meanwhile SMU looking for a double Buy in the ACC tournament also looking to get out of that grouping that Joel Lard has them in right now as the first four out of the NCAA tournament Eric Rothman Cory Williams here in Berkeley SMU a 12point Advantage doing it without their leading score boy Miller whos out for a fourth straight game due to an injury Matt cross flips it up and in out of the timeout cross has seven for the Mustangs cross doing a little bit of everything oneonone already knocked down a three right now cing scoring drout miss their last four from the floor sko yakovich off the heel knocked out of bounds itll stay with the Bears you know the way they spread the floor you give your guys opportunities to make plays like this he takes this all the way from the left wing right to the middle of the lane Up and Under good solid move and when youve got Shooters theres no help so you just get to go oneonone thats see you 59 from the floor five of six from three and on a 60 run but it ends right there with and one for C Lee dor the junor from Dallas will go to the free throw line a very nice unselfish play by the point guard Wilkerson he gets in the air but he sees his big fella now he can pull the trigger on that but he drops it off and thats just wait room right there cross goes straight up but Dort does a good job of taking the contact getting to the line now we have to keep an eye on fouls not only for Chuck Harris who has two for SMU but Matt cross who picks up his second foul 631 to go here in the half D got his own Miss bonus possession here for Cal they get the two points they go right back to G he gets fouled Applause again just a 63 free throw shooter but another foul on SMU its against s yigu the freshman and Cal now in the bonus how about that seven fouls on SMU just one on Cal here under six and a half to go in the Applause first cross on the bench Harris on the bench two of the leading scorers for this Mustangs team throttled because of their foul trouble as D missed a boat and E for SMU youre not exactly upset about things right now youve got 12point lead on the road you come out youve knocked down some perimeter shots executed pretty well Johan trayor the Junior from France who transferred over from Santa Barbara gets his first bucket good execution against the zone right there for SMU 18 points in the paint for SMU compared to 12 for c g had it knocked loose and a held ball its going to stay with Cal talking to Andy Enfield the SMU head coach in his first year he said listen if you would have told me at the beginning of the year wed be 20 and S overall 11 and5 in conference play Id say all right Ill take that but we need to win our last three games four games of the season because we got higher hopes now we want to make the NCAA tournament illegal screen goes against Cal its against Lee Dort his couple of missed opportunities on that series for Cal they got a chance for some buckets at the free throw line they got an offensive rebound and then they just give it away on a moving screen but these are the types of things where they can chip away at the lead but its just like they have consecutive bad Applause possessions go to the freshman igu passes out of the double team Warner for three that ones good SMU six of seven from three in the first half well that play was over when they didnt come up with the steal it was just a matter of time before SMU would find the open guy but when you gamble like that you open your team up largest lead of the game for SMU Wilkinson tries to respond o quendo the rebound even with the foul trouble SMU adding to their lead thrown away there see if Cal can make him pick huge play by Soko right there to get the deflection in the steel Campbell misses the three and now Cs one for nine from Deep you know you want guys to be aggressive and shoot the lane but if you come up empty like this right here and you dont get it now its just penetrate kick and stick SMU absolutely lethal from Beyond The Arc yeah Wilkinson The Freshman sold out trying to get the steel six on the shot clock for dor was pushed in the back excuse me thats Soko and he will go to the free throw line believe thats the second foul now on Yu thats actually his first okay so just the first foul on the freshman but still Cal getting some opportunities with the clock stop 432 and Soko at the line the Golden Bears need to do themselves some favors at the free throw line right now four missed free throws in a game where they find themselves down Applause 17 15 Point differential in the threepoint column as smus made six and has only made one well its good news bad news and the good news is theres no way SMU is going to continue to shoot 85 from Beyond The Arc bad news is theyve hit six and you youre down 16 so youve got to address that at halftime and not just hope because as we well know hope is not a strategy Edwards tra away good defense by Cal off the inbound TI in by sovic they say back interference oh thats basket does not count as it was in the cylinder oh thats just what the doctor ordered for Cal they go to the Press they get the steal they get the layup and it gets waved off referee felt like the ball was still in the cylinder that shot was coming out but he just got a little too aggressive changing things up with the Press theyve got Corner in no mans land but a foul and Mark Matson Furious as Reus petritis called for the personal right here there you going to see the shot in the lane the balls hit the back of the rim and start to bounce out no question that Balls about to come out but its still on the rim and to yakovich touches it SMU had a little difficulty with the pressure break the Press there go inside to yatu good turnaround jumper for the Freshman who played some pro ball in Turkey in the second division for coming over to the US that was a pro move right there seal the defender in the paint get deep nice little baby hook wilon with the push shot SMU maintaining the 17point lead without a couple of their leading scores who are on the bench due to foul trouble petrius a on the Finish well hes such a blue collar player always in the mix getting steals deflections tough buckets in the paint we see if Cal can build on that little bit of defensive energy right couple years Air Force where he led that team in points rebounds and assists last year now another Ste Wilson The Freshman climbs the ladder and wants a time out Music and just when you think SMU is going to pull away Cal with the defensive energy the theft and the Open Court Jam from the little fella we got a game here in Music Berkeley him off those turnovers the lead though still at 13 318 to go here in the opening half the hos Pavilion at Berkeley California Eric rman and Cory Williams here with you the ACCC on ESPN SMU according to Joe lardy one of the first La first four out right now of the NCAA tournament and a mustwin game for them according to Joe if they want to keep their hopes alive right now SMU a couple of people with some foul trouble theyve got to try to get this offense clicking again with the lineup thats out there and theres a good offensive rebound one of those players with the foul trouble CH Harris came back out during the timeout and missed that three hes got two fouls along with Matt cross and you got to go at him I know that theres plenty of time left in this game but you try to get a third foul on him limit his Effectiveness for the game great look and finish by yakovich yakovich whos been scoreless here in this first half sooko for the slam 11 Point Advantage for the Mustangs Now 60 Run for the Bears Cal being very aggressive on ball screens you see switching it out but theyve got to rotate over beautiful rotation in the steel Atrius the interception so yakovich up ahead bod and foul talked about petritis being the blue collar guy he reads the defense makes the steel and ignites the fast break another great defensive possession but right here the defender stays too long great vision laser pass down the lane one of the easier buckets Cal has had tonight and E we talked about their stop and go offense the way they play up and down and right now youre seeing them put together the defense and the offense they got a chance to get this to single digits foul was on toet corer senior picking up his second foul Cal has lost four in a row theyve lost six of their last seven theyve already lost to SMU once this year but we saw the energy in the practice today this is not a team thats given up by any means theyre still playing hard you see it here in this comeback attempt and sto yakovich has to be the guy right I mean you look at his numbers this year compared to what he did at Stanford last year they need to get him going right now just 10 of two from the floor well hes a self starter he can shoot the three he can play oneonone but right now ball security and getting good shots is how you get back in this game and thats a close defensive assignment but I thought he got away with a walk he did he got away with a big time travel no call from the officials Yu with the duck for SMU yakovich had it stripped off his leg and out of bounds did you see brke the ball his hands I got a riddle for you e how do you get a dunk without putting the ball on the floor you take one two three fourward steps oh my goodness complete blow but cow with the steel with the pressure chance to convert and they give it up heres Harris the other way slows up off the glass and in both teams just giving the ball away with nine turnovers Cal with eight yeah excuse me Harris just is such a smart guard thats old school where you slow down try to bait the defender into giving you some contact but Cal with some opportunities on the defensive end just not taking care of the ball 13 points now for Harris at trius slips Falls one minute to go in the Applause half Campbell spinning floating Soko the offensive rebound and a foul on SMU 10 team foul on the Mustangs fouls 10 to3 here in this first half so you talk about not being able to capitalize Cory not only you have the turnovers that Cal hasnt been able to capitalize on and now the foul disadvantage you havent been able to capitalize on either theyre seven of 12 from the free throw line and these offensive rebounds that was an outstanding effort right there by Soko to go skying in there and grab that board now hes at the line knocks one down the opportunities have been there for C just havent shot the ball well and turnovers have been the story Keon Ambrose Hilton called for his first personal as St stovich takes a seat again stovich did not play in the first meeting on January 29th on SMU W 7665 Dallas but has been very quiet offensively here in this one as he takes a seat with one point and Reus pdal called to the foul just the fourth team foul on cow but the second on petrius Cal can take some gambles here defensively like you said theyre not shooting just yet but more importantly you want to get a stop and going in a high not thats another dangerous pass press break has been dicey foru to say the least thats a great choice of words there you see another Ticky tack foul out front on Wilson his first so if youre C youre going to get the ball back no matter what so you want to get a stop and hit the locker room on a high note so a holding hit get a stop try to get a score your SMU you want to get downhill as he does right there picks up the Applause foul so now the sixth foul on Cal three quick fouls here in the final minute here first personal on Christian Tucker 49 and a half seconds to go youu bodying his way in fighting for his own rebound knocked loose and it will stay with Applause SMU second and a half difference between the game clock and the shot clock Music J Edwards got seven points here in this first half Andy Enfield up calling this last possession he knows exactly what he wants he wants the one5 screen Edwards lobbing to yatu double pum and rejected by soku the tror the he comes up short its a 42 29 lead for SMU at the break solid defensive effort right there by c as it was a couple hours ago but theyve dropped the spot according to Joe lard come on Joey brackets hes on the East Coast its late hes grumpy you know hell probably get up in the morning have some coffee and get the Mustangs right back in the mix I didnt know he actually slept this time of year Im going to give him a text in the morning see if we straighten this out BJ Edwards the seventh threepointer for SMU on nine attempts here in this game we talk about their outside shooting and they get right back to it to start the second half PS three C was just one of nine from deep in the first half and black Shir gets his first bucket of the game I dont me to exaggerate but that was a huge three right there for Cal because this SMU team wants to run away with this in the second half and if youre cal every possession matters there you going to see an offensive foul can Cal chip away at this lead they they had a few miniature runs in the first half feel like they need to get something going here early foul was on eatu his second and maybe thats one way to get back into it a lot of whistles in that first half went against s you giving bonus free throws to the Bears pretty early on they were 8 for 14 from the free throw line here was sto yakovich who was without a field goal in the first half had just one point got it from the free throw line three on three Harris from Deep Yu keeps it alive on the offensive Blass puts it to Harris underneath Stripped Away and out of bounds back to the Bears Cal really dodged the bullet right there they give up the offensive rebound he can totally make some beautiful shovel pass but Cal has the quick hands to knock it away Jeremiah Wilkinson leading the way for Cal with 12 points mty soku soku I should say with nine points they love to get going last three games averaging just two points per game shooting 11 from the floor for a guy who averages 10 points per game on the season so he breaks out with five quick points to start the second half team shot 33 in the first half so somebody had to do something a shuffle of the feet and a turnover solid defense in the Applause post U called for the travel violation right here Soko just holds his ground and keeps him from spinning to the inside turnover number 11 on SMU heres Wilkinson the team defense on him sto yakovich misses the three sto yakovich now o for four from the Applause floor Harris turns the corner burst of speed and Chuck Harris has 15 points well Chuck Harris is just too big once he turns the corner black sheir says thats me my bad but hes just doesnt have the size to deal with Harris when he starts getting downhill Wilkinson bothered from behind by BJ Edwards quick possession there for Cal heres okendo hell go to the free throw Applause line two straight line drive starts with a little bit of a ball screen but not really but he just gets him on the h and goes up and over thats just big boy basketball right there by Harris you talking to and the nfield about Harris you know said his role has definitely changed the last three now four games with boy Miller out of the lineup Harris having to handle the ball a little bit more he likes to play off the ball naturally and you saw that in the loss the other day against Clemson when he had a career high or season High I should say six turnovers to go along with his 16 points and Coach andf says you know what its just not his natural position hes not used to handling the ball that much he has limited those turnovers here in this one and leading the way for SMU with 15 points yeah Clemson has those bigger guards that can really get after you great pass and find by black J in the lane Harris just to cap the point two turnovers make it three as he caught that one up they got four on two they got numbers and black are double dribble how many times have we seen that today Cory where California a cal I should say gets a turnover and immediately gives it right back yeah thats unfortunate because when you put forth that effort to get that turnover you got youve got to be more concentrated with the basketball make better decisions those are big plays that can get you back in the game 12 turnover foru nine for Cal the Bears coming out with some pressure here it gave SMU fits in the first half its barely breaking the Press on that one SMU falling over here by us trying to get us involved in that nonsense I know your ball handling days are over right e for a long time you saw me you saw me shooting around with one for today but C sticking with that full for pressure just to disrupt the Rhythm anything they can do to try to cut into this lead well it seems like the Press working it worked in the back half of the first half they come out with you here a little bit early SMU just does not seem comfortable in that press break theres no substitution for a solid point guard to help you handle that pressure yakovich the feed the patrus it licks out Petrus got his own rebound and Applause one and E Ill be honest with you I thought he got fouled on the last layup he had in the lane but right here a beautiful find by stovich he short arms it but stays with it right here gets it up in the crowd I dont know that theres a ton of contact right there but great effort a chance for the three to hard way now we Lo in double figures now for petrius and heres the first pressure again J George breaks the timeline as cber picked up his second foul that set betrus to the free throw line cross part the double team oh quendo thats a goal T and thats unfortunate cuz I dont think that shot was going to get to the rim Soo went up and grabbed it gives the Mustangs an 11point advantage some momentum for Cal can they take advantage of smus mistakes coming from behind trying to make the tournament still three four regular season games left plus Su chance to make up some ground and earn some quality win and improve that resume Eric BR and Cory Williams here with you in brookley California as Jeremiah wil hit the three for Cal coming out of the break and now a single digit lead for SMU well you start to hear the student section come alive Cal shooting around 30 all game but the silencer for Mr Harris Chuck has 17 points Wilkinson for Cal has 15 as they go back and forth Point Advantage season high for J and now youve got SMU in the zone defense trying to slow down this offensive momentum late in The Possession little one action rer got tripped up should say 21 points the season high for Chuck so not too far off at 17 now for Harris and a foul on the Music floor nice bit of strategy right here from Andy Enfield in the Mustangs to go Zone as the Bears start to heat up and get whatever they wanted offensively foul is on Jerell Colbert his third fourth foul on SMU Wilkinson misses the Applause Music three now off the ball against SMU and this is the same story as the first half as now SMU in foul trouble once again thats a silly foul when you have these screens between the one and the five the big men have to get set picking up a cheap foul 30 ft from the rim its not what you want offensively its against Colbert this Applause fourth Campbell thought about it in the lane awkward shot and gets bailed out its on Chuck Harris thats his third plenty of time left in this game coach Dy Enfield has a decision to make here new star player picks up his third this is why they pay coaches the big bucks do you let him rock or do you take him out you got a lead on the road I think hes going to let him stay out there six fouls for SMU as a team one for Cal our ESPN Thursday Prime Time womens basketball double header starts at s Eastern with Duke Carolina from Cameron indor and then number number six South Carolina heads to Oxford to take on old miss that one at 9 Eastern Thursday on ESPN DJ Campbell the free throw 244 get pressure off the inbound and regardless of whether they get a steal or not what ends up happening is now SMU gets into its offense 20 seconds rather than 30 seconds we hope that that can make the difference Applause Harris dancing with it up top to Edwards seven to shoot drives and fou and DJ Edwards will go to the free throw Music line first foul on Javon black Shir and theyre trying to pick on him in the oneonone and he had great backup coko came flying over for the rejection in those situations let your big man do the Dirty Applause Music Work Andre sakovic back into the game you see there nearly 18 points per game the average on the season just one point so far and this one has yet to make a field goal on four attempts now another whistle chop second half too aggressive coming over the back thats actually going to result one and one thats the third foul on yigu and a bonus upcoming for the Bears youre in the bonus 14 minutes to go well its a freshman mistake right here you see an opportunity to get a rebound but you got to know the forearm in the back just a little too obvious right in front of the officials but more importantly your cow this is huge theres almost 14 minutes remaining and youre shooting on all contact for the remainder of the game can they take advantage and get to the line and they didnt shoot it too well from the free throw line miss another yeah they missed another one there now 11 for 18 foul trouble for SMU Colberts got fouru and Harris both with Applause Music three thats going to be an offensive hook oh blocking foul its against C oh that really could have went either way its on sasoko his second youre going to see both things youre going to see sasoko right here on this Chuck but then youre going to watch that arm inside very easily could have been a hook thir foul on the Bears as sooko takes a seat lot of whistles here in this second half physical game DJ Edwards gets the Applause Music inbound cross drives and hes fouled Reus Atrius call for the personal its his third I was watching defensively as he was moving his feet looked like cross stumbled a little Applause Music cross at the free throw line he comes up short 72 free shooter on the season cross has been really consistent this season hes got 10 straight games with 10 or more points that is the longest streak of that kind at SMU since 2013 and hes got eight points here in this one trying to extend it out to 11 games with 10 or more points scor to get some flow going here too many whistles for my liking Cory well its a physical game and Cal trying to make up for lost ground make up some lost ground here in the second Applause half gamble well Off the Mark California now struggles from three as Campell intercepts the pass in the back court and and one opportunity for DJ Campbell and coach Mark Manson is I rate because he wants a technical foul at the conclusion of this play got to be more careful with the outlet great steal and anticipation and then you see the player punch the ball and Coach Madson wants a technical but great anticipation for Cal good opportunity here by Campbell thats still unhappy well he has a case yep I mean in no point in basketball can you do that and get away with it another Miss free throw for Applause C 13 minutes to play in regulation 54 46 lead for Applause SMU o quendo off the glass and in good play drawn up by the Mustangs on the offensive end beautiful execution but a great finish against the sevenfooter in the lane from CH Tucker is good at this point Cal definitely willing to trade threes for twos as theyre trying everything to catch up its the fourth made three on 15 attempts for Cal Edward stops and Pops he answers the Bell 14 points for DJ Edwards and SMU will take a timeout boy that is a big shot by Edwards Jr ice in the Music veins 5949 Chuck Harris and BJ Edwards have combined for 31 points for SMU right now SMU looking to get it done with Harris on the bench resting him for down the stretch can Cal continue some of these nice offensive possessions theyve had Harris also has those three fouls St yakovich finally gets his first field goal of the game set play out of the timeout get it to your best scorer on a curl move to his strong hand cross dribbling out of the pressure another 12 minutes to go Applause Edwards dumped it off tried to get it to trayor off his fingertips and out of bound takes us to immediate timeout an eightpoint lead for SMU a turnover back Berkeley California Eric rord Cory Williams here with you the SMU lead is down to eight the SMU turnovers Cory allowing Cal to stay in this game 15 turnovers for the Mustang have led to 18 points for Cal youre starting to see the effects of the missing point guard out there turnovers inefficient offense can Cal capitalize they get it to their scorer in the lane sto yakovich will go to the free throw line you can TR of get the sense its go time for him hes trying to take over get some looks he get some free throws here the last time the lead for SMU was under eight points the score in the game was s to two and Ill give you one guess at whos at the scores table checking in yeah for SMU its Chuck Harris with his three fouls coach edfield says enoughs enough we got to get you back out there with your 17 points ton of time left in this game Cal looking at cutting to a two possession Affair Cal brings back on their star freshman Jeremiah Wilkinson hes got 15 points and now a fivepoint lead exs going make it a sixpoint lead for SMU they led by as many as 17 and if sto yakovich can get cooking that will change this game dramatically hes been relatively quiet and Cal trying to get within Striking Distance swing it through to O quendo nowhere to go for him seven to shoot kick out cross top of the key oo the offensive rebound well thats great hustle getting SMU an extra possession he takes it right to the rim and hell go to the free throw line a chance at a threepoint play I mean they are playing with such focus and determination theyre not getting rattled big play after big play the offensive rebound and a chance for an one Tucker called for his second foul a quendo to the free free throw line thats just the seventh free throw attempted by SMU theyve made four compared to the 21 attempted by Cal whos made 13 Cal cant forget theyre shooting the rest of the way so they want to be aggressive dont just settle for jumpers if you can get free Applause throws doovic to his left and the put back slam by Jord his motion creates so much for Cal he didnt make the shot but he got it on the rim the big fella took care of the rest Edwards looking for an angle away stovic and Wilson There complet It Again stovic takes two guys to the rim C gets the rebound and SMU right where where they didnt want to be fivepoint game 945 remaining n lost it and a Applause Music whistle going to be on Lee dor for reach again e you see this a lot when the ball gets on the rim everybody chases it but nobody boxes out there theres the nice put back and on the transition right here good defense in the passing Lane going to take both Defenders get airborne Cal with the easy put back second foul on d 16 foul on Cal n and a half minutes to go if youre Dort you only got two fouls you can afford to be physical out there Harris muscles one up and in he was hoping to get whistle instead will have to settle for just two points I mean hes angling for contact he shot that ball on the way down amazing degree of difficulty and now youll see Mustangs in that zone 19 points for Harris Miss threepointer in the corner for Christian Tucker when I say Music defense Harris L the E to settles underneath loose ball C has Applause it t knock down foul onu you see this duding section getting into this game ball bouncing over here once again theyre trying to get you involved e good reflexes there thank you try to protect this This Money Maker you know face for radio pretty sharp this time of night East Coast time you so youre up late I dont know where I am Tucker at the free throw line double bonus for the Bears I got tell you Tucker really went out of his way to initiate the contact there and he got the whistle yeah for a moment I thought he was going to give it up to the guy ahead and keep the break alive but he ends up getting to the line and Cals been sticking with this press for the entire second half and sometimes they get a turnover but mostly they just slow them down enough where they only have to play defense for 20 Applause seconds Harris trying to do it himself off to oo four to shoot fires a three Ru the offensive board for big offensive rebound right there for the Mustangs Edwards with the left loose ball and a whistle against SMU thought maybe there was some contact on Edwards layup but no call and the obvious over the back going after every ref every offensive rebound and thats the fourth foul on cigu the big seven right there lot of contact no call on sto yakovich and just a bear hug from behind easy call for the RS there I think he may have got away with one though I got to tell you yigu does not hide his contact very well all of the fouls hes picked up today have been very obvious aggressive player you need that physical presence and hell learn to defend without fouling as time goes on but right now you love that energy so both yigu and darell C with four fouls each and here comes cber back into the game as Yu takes a seat on the bench SMU has to have big men available down the stretch Soko and Dort are going to need somebody to keep them in check for The Bigs for S you cannot foul cross was trapped in the corner and a foul called against cow will send us to a break the Bears have pulled themselves within four just under 8 minutes to go here in Berkeley oh Applause Music Applause game for them on the road here tonight now looking to spoil the party Matt cross at the free throw line SMU in the bonus Al in the double bonus 759 to go here in regulation Music CR a second Miss free thr though that was a big opportunity right there to put some points on the board and kind of stop the bleeding theyll go to that 131 Zone and see if Cal can overload get to a shooter or get some high low action for Cal Wilkinsons been real quiet just two points in the second half and 15 in the Applause first and the main thing about that play right there is culbert couldnt do anything about it cuz hes got the four fouls great recognition by Tucker a one possession game and Tucker the steal Here Comes Wilkinson Tucker the offensive rebound loose ball and Cal has it a chance to tie or take the Applause lead Tuckers been a burst of energy coming off the bench five to shoot away that is such a tough play because he had to put the ball high enough to get over the defender but it was just too high for the roll but right here youre going to see Tucker attack the rim kyp know your personnels big fella has four fouls take it right to his Applause Music chest and this game has turned on a dime the crow the energy Cal on Applause defense Mustangs searching for some offensive productivity this is who you want with the ball late possession 19 points for Harris he pulls up from three offensive rebound cver puts it up and in hanging on with those four fouls big play by cver we talked about how SMU makes the plays they need to make that was huge right there snapped a three minute drought for the Mustangs yakovich s packing Colbert still being aggressive on defense yeah he has no choice its crunch time right now two big plays by Colbert right here desperation three at the end of The Possession is Off the Mark and good swim move gets to the basket rockovich leaning in on Harris and Harris called for his fourth foul thats a big one with 604 to go yeah and Harris has to be careful because when youre guarding a player like sakovich on an island we all know who his father is you know his work ethic he knows the oneonone NBA game and right there he was just going to take his time and get to his spot Harris Colbert hiu all with four fouls Bo that six minutes is an attorney in a game where both teams were in the bonus and you got guys in foul trouble soov makes it a twopoint game what sticks out to me is the amount of energy that Cal is expending on this press and then theyre still playing solid defense at the other end oh good defense out by Campbell and the shoot for Edwards Lo not sure if that was a pass or shot either way it wasnt good yeah hes short armed and I thought he was trying to throw a lakovic was tripped up and I think that might be the F KN cob it is talking about an extremely intelligent High basketball IQ player and Andre soy yakovich and he takes it right at Colbert any type of contact is going to result in free throws and this play right here is going to send the big fella packing step through stumble easy call a chance to get two free points so Colbert disqualified they bring in igu to replace him whos got four fouls as well six of his eight points have come from the free throw line so both Harris and eatu on the floor for SMU with four fouls and you almost feel like with Harris hes got to give up shots because hes too valuable in the offensive end he a lot of this game tie ball game 66 each 530 to play har being guarded by sakovic isoku pushed the back of yatu and its his third F and thats a good call theyre being consistent down the stretch they were kind of letting them play in the first half but now I think this games tightened up and both teams in the bonus first free throws attempted tonight for y to 59 free throw shooter on the year its the front end of the one and one see that e you tried to put him out there say he was 59 and he makes his first one he heard you he heard you big fell stepping up crunch time freshman hanging on with those four fouls one point ADV foru we havent heard a lot from Wilkinson whos just been out there running the show other guys have been stepping up you wonder if hes got a couple of tricks up his sleeve two points for Wilkinson in the second half Atrius pinball is Ratt off the face of Soko and itll be SMU Basketball that hit about five different guys was the right idea just couldnt make a clean Applause pass Harris pressing lobbing eatu the Ali thats how you break the Press oh beautiful execution you saw that lob developing and the confidence to throw that lob SMU creating that breathing room every chance they get making some plays cell Baseline pull up short arm that got his own rebound lost it not going to get the call in there with the Applause Music Applause trees and on a shot clock for Edwards oppos it inside to the big sevenfooter Yu lost it going up got it on rebound fouled on the second attempt and if its on Soko its his fourth foul SMU making the plays to stay alive in this ACC battle transition give it to the big fella to send it home what was a 17point lead earlier in this game Mustangs dealing with foul trouble derell Colberts already fouled out U whos at the free throw line and Chuck Harris both have four fouls for Cal theyve got a couple guys with four fouls as well sooko and petritis I got to tell you either big men are so pivotal over these final four minutes which ones can make their free throws which ones can stay on the court without fouling out really way are heavy in this game fourpoint game with eatu at the free throw line hes a double figures now 10 points seven rebounds seven footer from Turkey Andy infield looking to go a little offense for defense on a made free throw here they do substituted Johan trayor yigu comes out its a pressure now in the full court from SMU defensively lead back to five Cs had multiple possessions where its been a one possession game and they couldnt get over the hump this 131 zone for SMU has been pretty effective intercepted BJ Applause Edwards what a huge play by Edwards made a couple of big plays earlier but that one really silenced the crowd 16 points now for Edwards petrius flat lines the three its out of bounds SMU Basketball 70 Run for the Mustang this is just anticipation little sloppy play out front one arm pass just not seeing the defender great anticipation Music Cal will take a timeout 70 run to make the ACC tournament currently ranked 15th out of 18 teams in the ACC Cal just four for 17 from Beyond The Arc you kind of feel like theyre going to need a three or some big play to kind of get this momentum back in their favor if youre SMU the clock is your friend take your time try to get a good look only minut left Harris has been their leading score with 19 he has it up top with six to shoot left hand off the glass good move good Patience by Chuck Harris who ties a season high with 21 thats the next level play right there NBA Style keep the defender on your hip its all about geometry got it off the blast where the shot blocker couldnt get to it o yakovich just struggling to shoot the ball here in this one one for eight from the floor petritis no CS had some really good looks down the stretch but they come up empty you feel like right about now nine points going to be really hard for them to overcome over the final couple of minutes SMU just milking the clock now seven on the shot clock Harris picks up the dribble and he Applause travel you know Harris is so good in the ball screen youre going to watch him PE soakage on his hip so that he cant recover and then the nice onehanded scoop off the glass heres Wilkinson for three 9 wisson now with 20 points got a two possession Applause Music Applause game minute 30 to go and a foul up top DJ Edwards reaching in on DJ cell excuse me DJ Campbell reaching in on BJ Edwards so Edwards will go to the free throw line hes been really good at this one 16 points four rebounds five assists for the Junior from Knoxville Tennessee substitution some confusion with the substitution for SMU The Freshman Yu a little confused as to where hes supposed to stand as theyre check checking him in and out offensive defensive sub Applause stitutions cant say I saw that Applause coming J Edwards a 78 free throw shooter Johan trayor into the game for Applause SMU for a minute and a half to go Cal have one more run left in them they really have to slow down against this Zone theres not a lot of quick hitters they got to work for a good shot Wilkinson blocked by trayor P tral and puts it up and in fivepoint game one minute too and Andy Enfield won a time out we back in 30 seconds with bucket a few moments ago and Im surell try to get the ball back in his hands right now DJ Edwards has been just as good 17 points for him pulls up from three lift out and a foul underneath against SMU believe that going to be the fifth on E so yigu has fouled out of the ball game theres a lot going on with this play youre going to see the Miss and theres the box out and just again Soko kind of sells the foul but when youve got your hands in the lower back area the officials assume you gave them a shove and be a couple of free throws here so sooko four of seven from the free throw line in this game that one the 30th free throw attempted by Cal theyve made 21 of Applause them hbert hiu fouled out Chuck Harris still out there with his four fouls o quendo the rebound and a Applause foul its on petrius and thats going to be his fifth foul Music petrius fouls out on the rebound and I dont know about this because hes trying to create the jump ball situation and he doesnt get a clean grab at the ball so obviously theres a foul there but the right frame of mind force that jump ball possession arrow favors the Bears right now but he couldnt get to the ball cleanly and thatll be it for him at trius is done 12 points on five of eight shooting and Christian Tucker checks in wend at the free throw line with 41 seconds to Applause go teams in the double bonus and Cal will take a time out too they go to the hot shooting freshman if they Cano at the free throw line trying to extend the SMU lead big free throw here for Applause SMU 7872 SMU looks like theyre going to drop back into their 131 Applause Zone lens in with a head of steam rejected by Ambrose Hilton now just 35 seconds left were going straight manto man for the remainder of the game stanovic to inbound sooko not the guy whos going to shoot the three for you but he goes inside double pump at the SL good job by SMU to get it over the timeline and milk some time off the clock as well 22 seconds to go in a fourpoint game crowd kind of going nuts they felt George got away with a shuffle as they beat the pressure there hell go hell go to the free throw line Applause where and coach mson is going to use his final timeout and it will be BJ Edwards the free throw line 22 seconds to go two free throws up coming for him Applause fivepoint Applause game whatever you get its got to be quick now needs a big shot they need it quick sto yakovich charging into the lane kick out in the corner Campbell pump fake for three moose ball picked up by Tucker they got to go stanovic for three no Soko the rebound 5 Seconds to go in the gas and L Applause Music great effort by Cal to get a couple of different looks Soko cleans this up in traffic hes been huge all night I know theres going to be no fouls somehow he gets whacked on the arm for an one you almost want him to maybe missed this yeah so you can run down and get a chance at a three no time outs remaining for Cal Applause either threepoint game 5 Seconds To Go Soo twopoint game press break has been an issue all night for SMU theyve got to get it across one more time they inbound and 39 seconds to go and Matt cross will go to the free throw

night that may have put it Out Of Reach for Cal renson to inbound gets it to Tucker back to Wilkinson three seconds 1 second Tucker for three Off the Mark and SMU keeps their tournament hopes alive as
