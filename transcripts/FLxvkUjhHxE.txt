I love it Clemson they have had their way recently in this rivalry Clemson they have that win earlier this year December 2nd that was down in Clemson Steve Forbes is actually 03 he has never defeated the Clemson Tigers won and how about that for a quick bucket Kevin Galloway Galloway starting off and pick it up from where he left all had 17 in that Victory early this year against weight so Wake Forest basically just spotting Clemson a two to begin the ball game demon Deacons taking their time this has been a potent offensive team so far this year their first shot is Miss but Johnny on the spot and thats one of the things that wake will do car is one of those guys that can shoot the three but hes going to hop around that Rim whos got to do a good job but make sure they keep him off the balls ball is last touched by Appleby itll stay with the Clemson Tigers Brian while we have a moment tonights keys to the game brought to you by your local Ford dealer they call him keys for a reason man when you look at both of these teams for Clemson inside out this is the team tonight the three that will established PJ Hall early and for Wade you want to convert the miscues is the team that will put pressure on you try to go points for turnovers Robin Galloway misses from Deep hell fire it up some long range Music we talked about him in the open and his ability to be able to knock down to three he is a bucket getter the last thing you want to do is allow him to be able to get off early 43 from behind the arc not bad Clemson cant answer shot is missed by Hunter Tyson you watch out we come down pass under the screen hes going to say you know what Im gonna make you pay for it could have gotten the N1 one right now but you can look at his face this is the guy thats got a little swag to his game Eric second in the ACC 178 points per game he has been everything Steve Forbes could have dreamed about when he got the transfer to come over from Gainesville kilbrick misses the turnaround Music Applause thank you Chaplin gets it out of the double team Galloway nothing there Beatles are Lefty fires up a lefty one after and its true interesting to see how he steps in for Chase Hunter Hunter out tonight with an ankle injury needles one of those guys who want to run your offense but you also want to take what they give you beetles starting for the first time as a college player Ryan you remember your first start oh absolutely I remember back way 86 were gonna have maybe 12 points six fours and a lot of butterflies absolutely Andrew Carr a lot of dribbling for him shot clock is down to seven for those of you who have not seen that movie played this dude is electrifying again he gets going you see hes got the crowd into it already got a little bounce to his step right now how did he ever get out of Gainesville TJ Hall fights the ground and its the guy there for Clemson you want to establish PJ Hall coming up for that 26 points got a little bit more Rhythm when I talked to Brad ronell said he started to get his legs underneath them theyre going to try to feed him off tonight water Applause Applause you see this last time Appleby come on off that pick and again give him a little daylight hes got great lift to that jump shot you see right now he is definitely looking over the Clemson fence here its going to be a long night baby first shot of the game and Dylan Hunter comes in freshman Guard from Atlanta younger brother Chase Hunter who will not play Hunter comes into the ball game a little bit of a heat set for three minutes into our game piano runs down the long rebound his Hunter his first touch Music Applause jumped down to Hall good post position and if youre Marsh all you want to do is just challenge you want DJ Holmes shoot over you contestants offensive reset with Appleby Mildreds in the corner nobodys fouled thats a mistake by Josh Beetle later on the blows out its gonna be three free throws for Cameron hildred since last week good penetration that would be realized defense converge gets it over the hills with DC Beetle jumps into him coaches always tell you challenge dont foul now Brian you and I were here two and a half hours before the game of the game we saw Cameron Hildreth first person on the floor shooting free throw after free throw after free throw that tells me hes in a good Rhythm and wants to stay there or yeah until now hadnt scored and for a guy like that you want to see the ball go into the basket opportunity to get to the freethrow line and see him go in and helps him to get a little bit of a confidence and a calm down a little bit first two havent been perfect but theyve gone down another substitution for Clemson were gonna go with some link Chauncey Wiggins comes into the game 610 freshman from Grayson Atlanta talking to Steve Forbes earlier he said for him the key is to win the first four minutes of the game you see right now weight off to 116 wives and he breaks that game down being able to get the first four last four minutes of the game in the eight in the queen oh my goodness Chauncey Wiggins was in the game for all of six seconds and no hesitation as well I like this kid grass on the field Let it Fly baby Andrew Wake Forest off to a great start Tyree Appleby from distance Two Shots a combined 60 feet six points for the senior get access to the care you need with coverage in all 100 counties I had a real fun evening here at the Joel Joe Coliseum WinstonSalem North Carolina Wake Forest they had been Picture Perfect here in this building 90 well tell what theyve got on the floor like Tyree Apple be with the enthusiasm here in the stands its a nice mix Andrew Carrs at the line trying to finish off a threepoint play made a layup while getting fouled right before our last break Applause five Music Applause RJ Godfreys checked into the game he wears 22 this is hes touched the ball twice for a grand total of a second and a half and hes got six that was going to say the same thing hes not hesitating you know again not having Chase Hunter they got to find some other scoring you see Wiggins has come in hes like hey PPP coach I am up for it for those of you who dont know Chauncey Wiggins has 14 points in 11 games this year hes already got six Lefty off the window Cameron and hildred and again he talked about hills if hes one of those guys the 64 does not mind playing aggressive being able to put the ball on the deck and took PJ hall for the right in his chest theyre finishing that duck hunter come on finally the defense closes out on Wiggins Clemson their secret weapons not so much of a secret anymore Godfrey keeps the ball with the Tigers Tysons been quiet Applause rebounded by a couple of Wake Forest Demon Deacons Davion Bradford has checked in he wears number 20 for Wake Forest Applause enjoy Ed Music eldrift working the Baseline a lot of dribbling here put a lot of effort but heres the thing when you saw Hills with it doesnt bother him that last time he had Hunter Tyson and it has him about a few inches basically decided hey lets treat you like a mouse in the house not afraid to go little on big Appleby Glides to the Elbow and a foul going for the rebound thats going to be against Clemson as hitting the deck is Bradford Washington a lot of guys down there when they see a bigger guy hes like you know what clear out I got a mouse on me let me go ahead a little up and over and then like I say finish it around the rim hes one of those guys in the beginning he struggling to get going those three free throws then he scored his last two buckets you see him get a quick breather car missed everything run down by Wiggins Lamar Monsanto back into the ball game he wears number 30 for Wake Forest loose picked up by Applebee Appleby singing and zagging and thatll be a chance for a threepoint Play What a mistake by Godfrey he interfered with the ball that was never going to go in and now Appleby whos an elite free throw shooter has a chance for a threepoint play and as you see right there one on one you see Appleby come up with the steal and in Hunters and dead man land because again is the guy that put you on the skateboard and then you see the and one how about the Star by Tyree Appleby right now taking the game Into His Hands letting it come to him but hes showing you man that hes off to a hot start tonight that foul was on Dylan Hunter thats two weve told you about the depth issues with Clemson and Dylan Hunter has to lets just stay in the game play with two fouls this is interesting Im sorry thats the first ball on number two Im getting my twos and ones got to come up with a better system its the first team foul on Wake Forest and weve played almost seven minutes they call it on Bradford Wake Forest 90 at home the Clemson Tigers 70 in League Play and a blocking foul called on Monsanto on Bradford that leads free throws for PJ Hall we talked about Hall and the fact that they havent had a chance to really establish Hunter Tyson if you want to go ahead and give him a heavy dose of PJ Hall again Applause so PJ Hall at the line 77 at the freethrow line for a hall Music Applause double good looking free throws and with the two mate free throws Hall will lead then middle Brooks comes into the ball game sophomore from Fort Lauderdale Florida foreign Applause Music Applause hanging Hunter no and Carr claws away the rebound Wake Forest the leading the ball up by eight open floor opportunity getaway with Octane and thats what to Winston they Thrive with being able to turn you over in there and turn that good defense offense see Hunter come up with Castile and the Galloway will be able to turn the two points Music Williams didnt like Monsanto both transfer through East Tennessee State they both had history with Steve Forbes believe in him Bradford knocked off the spot maybe he got away with an extra step scored a goal good cases Bob Bradford being able to realize hes got Middleburg down there use the rim to Shield him off and to finish at The Rim Wake Forest nine for 16 shooting the basketball missed Inside by middle Brooks Applebee is it gonna be a double dribble it is he gets tangled up and tried to restart his dribble not allowed rare mistake for Wake Forest theyve got momentum and an eightpoint lead 111 remaining in our first half its time now for the fresh market discover the best when you look at this Clemson team off to a 70 perfect start thing is theyve been Rogue Warriors too four of those games have been on the road and you see that best start in 70 seats of AC Hunter Tyson with nine double doubles I told you your boy was he flat out been bowling its not just this year until you go back to last year end of last season the Clemson Tigers have won 11 straight ACC regular season games by Far and Away the longest best stretch in program history I mean you look at them tonight theyre playing without Alex Hemingway wanted a better threepoint Shooters and you got a PJ Hall and its trying to find himself and get his rhythm just imagine when they get all their parts and pieces and everyone healthy this team has definitely shown that theyre one of the tops in the league by their Play Already wake Force theyre going to bring back their big Matthew Marsh back into the game Marsh played the first four minutes of our contest didnt attempt the shot or grab a rebound now give it a second opportunity 89 on the year thats a significant playing time Clemson has the basketball Galloway cant leave him open who touched it last Wake Forest and heres the thing Eric with Hunter Tyson even though he has a score checked one of the things that you love about his game is that hes not going to force it hes going to still give you all the other things hes going to get the rebounds hes going to play solid defense and then whatll happen youll slowly see him start to warm up to this game I love the fact he does not press and try to force the issue they just one of their last seven shots from the field Music foreign Applause Applause Wake Forest on the other hand they had made six of their last eight shots to run this lead up to eight hildred thats his foot I think Applause oh I guess it went off of Reverend Galloways toe thats all the same thing you did I thought that went off but maybe thats the reason why Im sitting up here with you and not down there Bobby Clinton has checked in for the first time for Wake Forest freshman from Sweden where hes number 34 Applause hes playing with one step I mean he went down to downtown WinstonSalem on that one man you see hes just parted as he went straight to the cup 10 points first man to double figures oh what a dime by Galloway The Beatles good back back screen got beaten wide open on that cut Applause Music Wake Forest had a lead remember folks in that game in Clemson back in December only to lose Clemson had a tremendous second half rally picked up the W that was back on December 2nd Tyson everything but down for Galloway but an offensive rebound Wiggins has been nice left hand and middlebrooks called for the foul trying to get back his own Miss its been a frustrating start for the sophomore see PJ Hall coming back in from Middlebrook again so far its been all week in this first half Clemson you want to make find a way to be able to get their bigs involved still havent been able to find Hunter Tyson and get him going yet Clemson has now committed six fouls the next foul will put Wake Forest into the bonus Wake Forest only two teams foul so Clemson is a long way away from the bonus loose ball picked up and shot is missed oh my goodness not going to get a better look for Clinton but it stays with Wake Forest Applause he can shoot it man Demari Monsanto Monsanto third in the conference is almost three three pointers a game shooting a 40 clip you see Clemson call a timeout Monsanto when he shoots it it just looks like its going to go in thats just a beautiful looking shot county report says youre going to put a hand up on him you can allow me to have daylight lets see wake with their biggest lead of the game so Wake Forest leads 2918 now a message from Coyote Tractor from my experience if you work the land you gotta be a jack trades you gotta have a little bit of and a whole lot of getgo Wake Forest fans have not seen a loss all season long perfect 90 is Steve forbess team here in this building Music but one last hurdle for Steve Forbes to climb over and thats beating Clemson oh and three the only team its Steve Forbes this is third year its actually saying something the only team he has not defeated in the ACC is where orns done and I talked to him early and he said that he thought that when they played Clemson that first half pretty much did what they wanted to do but then that second half four shot selection and then not being able to Corral the inside play so theyre a little a few tweaks that theyve made you can see right now gang rebounding and when Clemson touches the paint theyve got more guys converging on the ball no look passed down on the block thats Tyson who got bumped no worries thats just the third team foul on Wake Forest heres that last time when you saw Hunter Tyson get the ball you saw three guys from Wake right down there on him and talking with Steve Forbes he said every time that theyre putting the ball down to hall or the Tyson theyre going to have a wall around them and force them to have to pass that ball out Music foreign Applause got that free license to be able to pull whenever open has been over four from behind the arc Galloway now one for five his 28 threepointer on the season Appleby Clinton Monsanto and a mistake by Clemson they cant clear the rebound and weve got a Timeout on the floor Clemson Tigers a perfect seven teams from the ACC Eric and thats always good for the league to be able to get that kind of Pub for the NCAA tournament especially in January I saw Jim Phillips looking at a box score he probably noticed that uh Wake Forest has outscored Clemson eight to nothing Second Chance points and that has a large factor in the fact that Wake Forest leads by eight points thats the difference Applebee bumped to the floor and with Wake Forest in the bonus thats going to be a oneonone situation for Tyree Appleby Applause this wave team has come out and it seemed like they punched finishing in their mouth and Clemson trying to find their footing again cant really get any rhythm on the offensive end and so far wake is able to get what they want to the basket you see right now already in the bonus Music Capital if you missed a free throw earlier hes not going to miss another this half okay one shot one thank you Applause ten point ball game Clemson running their offense leads to a wild missed three by Dylan Hunter I think Crimson is going to get back in this game you got to find a way to establish PJ Hall to get Hunter Tyson rolling car resets transfer from Delaware spent two years playing for the blue heads Applause Applebee Hill grip gonna have to fire someone shot clock down to one didnt get it off did they no wave it off though its gonna be your look deck its going to be looked at crimsons got to do a better job of being able to box out you want to keep giving weight those extra opportunities first blush I thought this was after the shot clock had expired Im going to trust your gut in the field now you see that penetration lets see yeah I think youre right Mr Collins uh yeah balls still in the left hand at least a second and a half Music the call on the floor was no basket and thats going to be confirmed shot clock violation and it will be Clemson basketball but they trailed by 10 Clemson last loss back in December 10th a loss to Loyola of Chicago Applause one of the hottest teams in the country down 10 under seven to play first half Galloway made it three a moment ago gives it up were doing a good job of being able to make PJ Halls Touch of his good play by him again they couldnt really get him on the post because you see Carr fronting him that last time going to that mid post be able to put the ball on the floor in a little midrange jump shot hopefully that get him going second field goals for Hall car turns back to the iron one and done rebounded Tyson Applause Music again going through hall both sides of the Court he called him turn around you saw that last time Appleby came down to double but then Hall was able to get through that double team and again two backtoback buckets that allows him to get on a nice little run slow start to the year for PJ Hall but he is playing like PJ Hall we all seen for the last couple of years now threepointer up and down Monsanto again I see Monsanto again we talked about his ability to let it fly Clemson definitely got to make sure to read The Scouting Report make him put the ball on the deck Applause Pauls got the last two buckets for Clemson Applause Galloway defense is always shocked when he puts it up there I dont know why Tyson trying to get his had been relatively quiet hits a long midranger and again you see Tyson having a hard time getting some offense find himself wide open with one again guys like that all they need to do is see the basket and the ball go in the basket Applebees Applause a little bit off the mark for Clinton empty possession Clemson down by seven Applause PJ Hall 4 30 remaining look at him and Hildreth is clobbered a little bit of showtime and it results in a couple of free throws for Cameron hildred I see both teams trying to find a little bit of offense you see Hunter Tyson right there finds himself wide open hes like you know what dont mind if I do another agency healed with realized hes got oneonone a little blow by I see you later take that contact Hildreth is a bit player as a freshman Four Points three rebounds per ball game hes up to close to 13 points and six rebounds and this is soft fourth season changes for both sides back into the ball game Port Clemson is Ian shefflin back in for Wake Forest Damian Williamson its hard to get a little bit of a rhythm all around all ball players for Steve Forbes team that was the area almost got that steal earlier in the game early in the year had a triple double I think thats the first triple double in the League this year its the third in Wake Forest history first of course being Tim Duncan you mentioned Tim Duncan and anyone and thats a compliment thank you Tyson took it away from him right at The Rim Hildreth kicks it right into the waiting arms of Galloway who got knocked to the floor thats the second time I believe that hilders has dribbled the ball off his foot hes got to slow down a little bit but you know what you get with him man hi octane how about this block over 100 Tyson thinks hes got one and then Carr comes over hes like you are denied meet you at The Rim take that back with you no suit for you tonight car listed in 610 Tyson 68 Paul hey figured it out thats one of the things we talked about with his game is that you know that he is a load underneath the basket give him the opportunity to get those feet set and he can knock down that three 15 threepointer for the junior shooting over 42 from behind the arms good shot for him Applebees car three ball nice penetration by Applebee forced the defense to have to converge and found car wide open over there three balls one of pocket dug down shefflin is fouled on the entry pass Carr was holding him do you see both guys you see PJ all say you dont fake it off knock that down and you see right now Clemson trying to climb that presented by Toyota visit your local Toyota dealers today Toyota Lets Go Places and by CPI Security CPI home security that protects what matters most pretty nice allport Advantage this year for Wake Forest 90 at home Demon Deacons 52 in ACC play but looking up at the Clemson Tigers who are still perfect 70 how about PJ Hall hes got seven of the last nine for Clemson a couple turnarounds one on the right block one on the left block and then a straight on threepointer and you see how theyve been able to climb back in this game again being able to establish him and he couldnt really get anything going but he got a couple of buckets to knock down that three professors they sit back and keep feeding him final 310 of our first half Linda strong take comes up empty rebounded car solid defense by Andrew Carr being able to stay solid shuffling hasnt been maybe about 10 pounds you realize that good solid defense by car March back into the game the man the pivot setting a couple of Screams Appleby is bunked off his Mark and because of the one and one its going to be well the bonus will have a one and one for Appleby Applebys a hard guy to guard because youve got to respect the fact that he can shoot the three real crafty with the ball especially if you put him in picking roll action that last time Hunter got caught with his hand in the cookie jar thats the third personal foul on the Freshman Dylan Hunter his older brother Chase Hunter out with an ankle one and one for Appleby Applause make sure you stay tuned for tonights Ford fast Flint thats coming up Tyree Appleby who told you he started at Cleveland State in the Horizon League spent two years in the SEC at Florida he originally is from Jacksonville Arkansas just outside of Little Rock and as good a player as Tyree Appleby is hes got a long way to go if he ever wants to be the best shooter born in Jacksonville Arkansas that is the place of birth of one Glenn rice wow how could I not man and you know what you dropping juice tonight baby I did not know about that one folks uh open up the history books Michigan Wolverines all everything Glenn rice he could stroke score the goal and a foul PJ Hall come alive and you if you pick you pay attention to how PJ Hall how low he was able to get Mars on that backside watch how he gets this post and what he does immediately goes and doesnt allow them to come with a double team Marsh tries to stay solid we talked about the fact that is a low down there because hes so physical and he jumps into your body well on pajama night here at the Joel Coliseum who would have guessed that PJ Hall is now 14 points for PJ Hall 220 here in our first half way quartz has been playing from in head the entire ball game Music yeah Applause pretty shot Damien Williams hit a three good shot by Williamson you know why he got there because Appleby had his man on a nomad Zone everyone was focused on the penetration realized getting right over to Williamson knocking down that three Paul failing it rebound run down by Parr 10point lead remember Steve Forbes knows his team cant get too comfortable they LED at the half against Clemson back in December and had it all disappeared December second game Wake Forest LED 3326 after 20 minutes offensive rebound Williamson oh the sixth footer almost had the play of the night and a foul committed by Marsh somehow after getting bopped in the nose youll see Mars go up oh my goodness he got some bad end of the play on now Applause Marsh fouled Tyson with his nose Applause oh my goodness yeah and roll the music thats a tough foul thats a tough if youre Matthew Martin that is a tough foul if you are Matthew Mark I think one of the Fishers may have caught the replay on that one partner yeah Applause Matthew Marks from Cornwall England so anytime hes involved in anything its an international incident so theyre going to review it just to make sure that everythings on the up and up I think one of the officials was able to see that that replay and you watched the play shot goes up by wins and then Russell down there and then I make the argument that Marsh actually fouled shefflin with a lefty that I can see because I thought that he gave chefland but heres that play by Tyson with a quick elbow to the chops I think the original foul was correct it should have been on March and then that incident on contact with Tyson and Marsh collided so the officials look and Demon a common foul again on March and will come the other way and have a freethrow opportunity for Tyson Applause foreign Applause Applause Music Tyson makes a pair thats what the grad students do playing in their 125th game eightpoint game final 80 Seconds of our first half pilgrim gets a running start bounce pass Carr he is a tough physical down low player and dont let the slide frame fool you because hes super aggressive in the last two games averaging 22 and hes a guy it does not shy away from contact you see that last time goes straight into the chest and hes found the appropriate level he is an ACC player through and through sheplin an offensive rebound Galloway he can hit it from there and going for the rebound a foul called on Clemson so well come all the way to the other end with 48 ticks remaining in our first half and itll be Carr shooting two he now reaches the double bonus for Wake Forest Ryan Oliver youve been associated with college sports since what mid 80s yes sir earned your Halcyon Days playing for Bobby kremen to serve at Georgia Tech did you know that Andrew started his college experience played for the school that has the only division one female nickname Music its the only division one basketball female nickname no I did you didnt know that but I did because it was familiar but I could not have brought it out as eloquently years Elena Delle Donne either side hes got to be the best ever come out of Delaware in the basketball hey look at that the senior Hunter Dyson rings the bell hey you see Steve Forbes is irate with his team understanding that thats the one guy you cannot leave open so with only 38 seconds remaining in the first half Steve 4 people finds it important enough to call a timeout because of the shot wide open again Reverend Galloway gets it over to Hunter Tyson wake has done a good job of being able to keep him quiet but you know thats the garbage not while Ill get going because theyve already established Jay Hall SD Forbes Owen three in his career against the Clemson Tigers saw a halftime lead of seven points evaporate back on December 2nd against Clemson is super intense right now let me see Brevin Galloway get the ball up to Hunter Tyson Watch the fourth hes like oh man no come on fellas yeah Steve Forbes a student of ACC basketball he knows that Hunter Tysons now played 125 games here in this great conference hes seen enough to know that shots going down absolutely that you need to watch Were important for Wake right now is you want to take your time and get a solid shot probably wont try to run some kind of pick and roll ball reversal touch the paint force them to converge try to kick it out for maybe an open shot Difference game clocking shot clock is eight seconds Here Comes card instead of screen for Applebee Monsanto got pushed oh thats a mistake thats a mistake by RJ Gottfried The Freshman bumped Monsanto who is a great freethrow shooter and well have double bonus free throws for Monsanto heres the thing you gotta honor Monsanto because his ability to knock down the three you see that last time on the penetration see that foul right there allows him to go to the line off in the corner its interesting oh if you stepped on a wet spot what that was but he was Applause still concerned with something going on with the the Footwear but smiling about it fishing nine points in the first half that is a good looking stroke if you know anything about basketball or take a look at that that you can tell he can shoot it all right this is what it is did he slide against someones beverage Applause I dont know what it was stepping up some gum or something didnt affect him at the free throw line made him vote final moments of our first half Tyson shot is Off the Mark and that will do it for our first 20 minutes here in WinstonSalem so far so good for the whole team Wake Forest up 10 remember they were up by seven back on December in Clemson when Clemson came back to steal one away from Wake Forest 3630 Central Notre Dame Clemson and womens Hooves Thursday on Valley Sports Southeast starting our second half Wake Forest trying to hand Clemson their first conference loss Wake Forest does have history on their side the last two times that Wake Forest has taken on a team seven or better at the time of their game theyve won both times and the second half begins with a onehander made by Tyree Appleby and you see the iso he was able to get beat on oneonone with a nice little scoop shot in the first half way doing a great job 50 field goal shooting you see a turnover Applause very patient has Galloway on his back back out to Appleby remember Clemson playing without Chase Hunters playing without Alex Hemingway what a Time by Appleby on that back cut the car see Ray coming out good started early you see apple be there you see great back cut by car and the dime by applebeej all a little late on the rotation Carr had 11 points in the first half with nine rebounds just a double double in the first half alone and heres the thing when I was talking to Steve Forbes he talked about the fact that playing four minute segments he said the first floor of the game the last four the first four of the second half is critical for them yet another turnover thats how wake is able to speed you up because they want to get the turns and those points off a turnovers crazy shot taken by Monsanto he was clearly feeling momentum was on his side tried to capitalize Galloway bumped off his course and which demon Deacons going to get called for the foul weve got your choices hes gonna be on hildred and heres the thing Eric if youre Clemson you are not one to let Wade speed you up because thats their Temple they want to speed you up good turnovers settle down get the ball run your offense give PJ Hall some touches allow Hunter Tyson to get going take your time with your offense Galloway the 25 year old misses Inside rebounded by Hall just the strongest man on the floor right now and you can see hes just bullying them out there because again crashing the boards being able to come up with those Second Chance opportunities much needed that 15point lead for Wake Forest was their largest of the night while going for the rebound its not a good night for Matthew Mark Matthew Marsh continues to just be confused right now going after the ball getting called from foul get hit in the face got called profile passion attempted a shot hes played 13 minutes one rebound and now three pounds Applause Josh Beadle had his pocket picked lost it Appleby oh goodness Applause thats how they do it in Jacksonville Arkansas and Clemson a little bit rattle right now first dunk of the game for either side and it comes by a sixfooter trying to calm his team down and make sure that they dont get too caught up that was a nice little silencer by Beetle being to get into the lane Applause Wake Forest 90 at home Clemson 70 and ACC play and a foul called on beetle trying to stay in front of Appleby Eric now when we talked in the pregame man we talked about whats here Tyree Appleby will steal you cookies now I knew that one but I didnt know he was going to go hit him like that goodness oh my God look at him I didnt realize he had bunnies like that after that you look at the bench and Meg was like go ahead and put it on him foreign Music Wake Forest leads by 13 Applebee Music Paul has stolen away Monsanto one man to beat and he beats him and again this is what Ray wants to do you see that last time on PJ Hall they sent a double forced him to have to come off of that Monsanto doing a good job of being able to read the pass in lane and thats what they do is they turn you over in this little voice off of turnovers two Demon Deacons already up to 15 Galloway calling for the ball shepler quick spin nice move by shuffling realized that he had heels with on his back didnt wait for the double team opted to spin quickly before somebody could come and double first field goal for sheplins 12 minutes of court time Marsh sets the screen Appleby just flat out lost it the defense they forced that Baseline didnt allow Appleby to come off that pick and roll and touch the paint Galloway had to be a goalten Carr couldnt stop himself score the goal for Brevin Galloway and then again Steve Forbes is upset with Monsanto realizing at last time turned his back and then you see the ball hes a little closer yeah I think that Steve Corps had a beef Applause Appleby Monsanto Carr and Marsh four minutes into our second half will be Applause Tyson numbers now for Clemson Music Galloway shuffling good pressure by Marsh fouled in the open court by beatola and with that weve got a Timeout on the floor you see both teams going Monsanto say I might be able to shoot the three I can still at any point brought to you by a coyote tractor talk about points off with turnovers and you see for weight being able to come back and turn that good defense into offense we talk about the fact that they will be able to get in those passing Lanes when they go there we see plays like this going down to the middle and again a little fella being that we go up top and again forcing you into those turnovers This Is How They thrive on Santo being itll be the recipient to be able to finish wake being able to open up this lead by 11 and that is your Coyote Tractor Tony Turning Point Clemson see those numbers shooting nowhere close to what they normally do from behind the arc and Wake Forest converting on those miscuits wow been an issue and now fouls becoming an issue for Clemson they call that foul on Brevin Galloway but Brian the bigger issue is the point guard situation for Clemson Josh Beatle just a moment ago picked up his fourth personal foul Dylan Hunter is already throttled with three personal fouls and this is where you miss Chase Hunter because again when a guy like Tyree Appleby he puts so much pressure on your defense not so much but just the scoring his ability to break down the defense and get into the lane Bradford got it out Appleby late so whos going to run the point right now for Clemson Music they are very thin right now at the lead guard spot then middle Brooks is in for the first time this second half and the senior the grand transfers Kevin Galloway calms things down and again his ability to knock down there three again not shy I feel like that they need another guy especially with PJ Hall on the bench hes got to be able to get them going but you gotta be able to get stopped because it seemed like wake is really good at being able to do what they want awesome Music 70 run for Clemson and it stops threepointer gabari Monsanto great ball movement getting around the hormone Santo wide open in the corner again Scout report tells you got to put a hand up on him and make sure you make him put it on the deck that is Chase Hunter didnt dress he has got an ankle issue his brother Dylans got three fouls the other point guard gots petals got four fouls and a turnover called on Clemson solid defense by cam held with you see that last time Reverend Galloway going to the Baseline and then extending that arm anytime you extend that chicken wing were gonna call it the other way Urban foul is committed by Galloway it scored as a turnover oh yeah right there a little chicken wing 25 years old but he could get away with it come on give it to me Music feeling it looking for a priest hes got Chaplin in front of him great defense by sheffman phenomenal defense by Jeffrey tildren misses the hell Mary but that possession was decided by the defensive chefland leads to the runout Tyson nice time by Galloway on a Tyson being able to get behind the defense that was a good stop by Clemson as much as you see that thinks wake is going to open up his sleeve Clemson still finds a way to be able to get it on the 10 Clemson hasnt lost since December 10th pilgrim kind of flipped it over his head playing with the confidence this year that maybe he didnt have last year and a blocking foul on Hildreth you see both teams being able to find good plays the last place you can see Hunter Tyson getting behind a defense nice dime by Griffin Galloway then on the other you see the penetrations but shuffling on a little bit of a skateboard right there Listen Now You See Me Now you dont finish it at the rim and you see that last one receiver not being able to get right there last time was able to draw the offensive foul and called for that block after that play oh nice wonderful opportunity for a threepoint play those are two grad students combining Galloway to Tyson and you saw the time again watch this back door cut and you see right there Hunter Tyson was like hey bro Im wide open another dime by Galloway again we talked about the fact that it seems just one week is about to seem like run away with this thing Clemson comes up with another play another ties with opportunity to cut this lead now down to eight you can tell the Tysons played five years in the ACC went up strong with two hands knew that theres no chance anyones going to take it from him Applause left some meat on the bone though missed free throw keeps it at a ninepoint game Bradford to Appleby Natalies got to be careful hes playing with three fouls Bradford tried to muscle it up nothing there Tyson rebound good defense by shuffling on Bradford being able to come over and just stayed solid Clemson trying to steal some minutes with PJ Hall not in the game Galloway all around good shot he said there were PJ Hall coming on going on the bench somebody from Clemson need to step up as of late its been revving Galloway with points and being able to create offense Steve Forks has seen it up Wake Forest catch the call to timeout their leads starting to evaporate it is a seven point game Clemson may have made their last four field goals to make this a ball game again getting those wins on the road Wake Forest trying to avenge a loss against Clemson December 2nd at Littlejohn Carr face up along the Baseline working against Godfrey and Godfrey wins the battle good defense by Godfrey was able to stay solid step one Dylan Hunters checked back into the game freshman point guard playing with three foul I havent seen Josh Beetle since he picked up his fourth foul Hunter comes up short rebound run down by Carr hes already got himself a double double Applause third double of the season for Carr first here in the ACC transfer from Delaware Monsanto Applebees Applause at one point Wake Forest led by 15 they now lead by seven this has done a much better job of being able to lock down that penetration close up that zone right now they need a bucket Tyson just wouldnt fall PJ Hall has checked back into the game for Clemson and Eric I think that theyve got to find a way to get the ball down to PJ Hall and see Carl right now would look like he had a wide open three option not to take it all the leads scored for Clemson hes got 16 Monsanto a couple hard dribbles found a spot thats the guy thats not shy he doesnt say you know what get me to rock babe you know what Im feeling it good penetration again Monsanto is able to get that midrange jumper because you got to honor that threepoint shot arent too many guys with his kind of stroke from Deep who could power dribble and pull up like he just did Hall is open for a moment hell get another try missed everything good defense played by Bradford if youre home I think hes got to go early I think he was anticipating the double team hes got to be able to go and not wait and uh oh thats a foul on Hunter both point guards for Clemson now with four personal fouls Wake Forest feeling their oats leading by nine thank you on Georgia Tech then you got Boston College and Notre Dame that follows at two oclock check your local listings ACC basketball right in the middle of the conference slate good basketball all the way across the conference glad youre with us with Brian Oliver on Merrick Collins Hudson an unfamiliar environment right now theyre trailing theyre down by nine with about halfway through our second half Brad Brown elf now in his 13th Year trying to get his Clemson Tigers a road win but its not going to be easy look at the foul trouble two guys who have mainly run the point today Josh Beetle Dylan Hunter both One Call Away from elimination Reverend Galloways got three fouls see Terrell Clemson great Terrell McIntyre over there they may need to suit him up and before long get him off the bench yeah the story today Chase Hunter not available he would normally the guy handling the basketball quite a bit averages over four assists a game but hes got an ankle not available so no chase country Dylan Hunter fouled Trevor Josh beetle in foul trouble and oh my goodness trying to tip dunk and landing on his rump is Davion Bradford hell have free throws using a penetration by Hildas right there coming up short you see Hunter Tyson Blake that was a takedown wow see that last play right about here Bradford going for that tick oh man Hunter Tyson five years in the ACC thinking he knows how to get away with one but when you bring a seven footer down to the floor with you Bradford seventh for 20 at the free throw line I was wondering whats going to even out came into this game 84 from the field 8421 for 25 but to get something you got to give something clearly hes giving something away at the free throw line Applause Galloway long two Applause look at Applebees crafty tried to draw a foul from behind sets up Bradford and Bradford will have two to a tone for the two he missed just a moment ago you see great penetration by Appleby being able to find Bradford wide open again you see the breakdown he was like wide open hes in late Rotation by PJ Hall and a little frustrated with himself can come up with the N1 so Bradford the transfer from Kansas State theyre looking for one to fall this is going to be a common theme for Wake Forest coming on the stretch Brian Clemson has already committed eight fouls which means Wake Forest will be in the bonus for the remainder of this regulation and obviously if youre awake you want to put the pressure on with a guy like Appleby you want to constantly try to penetrate push that lane hey Bradford knocks the second one down lead is 10 me Galloway Shetland Paul Tyson and Wiggins playing together this is Wiggins score it and a foul chance for a four point Play We called out Wiggins earlier in the game they got it came off the bench gave him some offense you see Hunter Tyson passing over Wiggins set oh and again you see that foul again its one of the things that you do not if youre Williamson you do not want to file a shooter give him an opportunity for a fourpoint play so Wiggins who came off the bench early in the first half and nailed his first two threepointers now with his free throw an opportunity to have 10 points off the pine there it is he came into this game with 14 total points in 11 games this season hes got 10 this evening Im going to tell you the next time he touches if hes wide open its flying its going better be fourpoint play makes it a sixpoint game a little bit nervy here at the Joel Hildreth finds Carr uhoh we play on and Carr takes advantage nice play by car realizing the refs had allowed him to play on being able to initiate that contact good move and finish at The Rim Applause Wiggins no sheklin really fights on that glass numbers for Wake can they find the mismatch Applause Ed some dogs are bullied that last time Reeves are wide open Applause and goes off the shoe of Hall look at the great Hustle but what hes going to do is he gives the Wake Forest a run out opportunity numbers Advantage Williamson two four dollar that last time he was like you know what find me point Im not going to let you down the play was set up by Appleby being able to touch the paint Force the defense to have to help and gets it over to Williamson one of the few times that hustling actually hurts you PJ Hall hustled to save the ball and then led to a fast break for Wake Forest Galloway and a blocking foul its called on Applebee bad things are getting hectic getting kind of hectic 759 remaining in our ball game 11 point lead for Wake Forest Wake Forest leading Clemson by a score of 7059 the locals sure know what Wake Forest is a perfect 90 at home but if you dont know it nationally folks Wake Forest Is For Real 135 overall five wins in seven conference games Brian Oliver theyve won three hit their last three straight in five in the last six well you see how theyre able to do it this is a team again that will turn you over and try to get points off of turnovers theyve got guys that basically can score inside and out tonight you looking at theyve already got four guys in double figures you love how gritty theyve been playing theyve been able to shut down Clemson and not allow them to be able to be as dominant inside theyve shut down Hunter Tyson has made it really hard for them to be happy to have any rhythm the officials are looking at a place just before that last time out involving 21 in Orange Chauncey Wiggins Music see right there as Applebees going by Applause not really sure what were looking at there well the officials have all moved away from the Monitor and we play off thank you all right Brian Oliver going to put your feet to the fire Clemson 70 in conference play they have won their last 11 straight ACC regular season games dating back to last year if theyve got any chance at all what do they have to do in the final 7 59 I still feel like theyve had a chance to get the ball back into PJ Hall when they were able in the first half to get going they were given a heavy dose of giving him the ball inside thatll free up some things for him Hunter Tyson has been pretty much on lockdown with Cam hildre its got to be able to get the ball in the PJ or maybe get something going with Brevin Galloway this is Galloway slides it over to Hall good team defense played by wake Force no damage done they still lead by 11 you saw even on that time you know theyre building a wall around PJ Hall every time he gets anywhere near the room uh Rim theyre sending multiple Defenders to challenge him right at The Rim waiting for that pass able to set up his Defender Bradford is fouled and hell go back to the freethrow line passed by car but I thought that once he touched the paint that was one of those I thought he should have let go pretty much he sold the punk fate watch this pump fake right here right there wide open I thought he could have taken that shot but again salt Bradford down there and thought he was wide open but the way car shoots the ball I would have liked him to shoot the ball on the catch Im sure Steve Forbes his thing thinking the same thing and last foul was on Ian shefflin he now has three Applause effort the transfer from Kansas State its amazing how much the roster has changed from last year this year but Steve Forbes still has his Demon Deacons playing his brand of ball middle of the season tough that Bryant on you and thats pretty good offense Applause Music Wiggins size Advantage Paul and this is where they miss Hunter Tyson all night long cam Hildreth has basically stayed right in his back pocket with a blow by Cameron hildren and again with Hildreth if you allow him to get going Tyson was backing backpedaling and he basically just went right by him to the cup Flynn offensive foul fourth foul on shefflin didnt talk about cam Hildreth watch as he gets downhill on him realize hes got Tyson backpack give it a little bit of a heavy being able to say okay you know what see you later part and Im gonna go ahead and give you these deuces well its never a good sign if youre Clemson and youre replacing one guy with four fouls with another guy with four fouls but thats what theyre doing Ian sheplin goes to the bench with the four fouls Josh Beetle comes back in playing with four fouls foreign Applause runs down the rebound and those are the 50 50 plays that Steve Ford preaches his team give you another opportunity Blakes done a better job of taking care of the ball this half only one turnover Clemson already with seven oh that was a tough chance for Hilton almost hit to step back three all right can Clemson figure out some offense their last basket came with the 9 34 Mark so its been over three minutes and a reach in foul to get anything inside the lane see that foul trouble right there Josh Beetle Hunter shefflin Galloway thats a lot of guys weve got a short bench yeah no chase Hunter because of injury no oh Alex Hemingway because of injury one and one and dont wave it off before the shot oh lane violation PJ Hall got into the paint and wiped it away its got to be a hard one for Brad Darnell as you try to climb back into this game you see right there PJ Hall called with his toe right in the pool under six to play wake trying to avenge a loss at Clemson in December Music pilgrim Applebee Tysons got himself another DoubleDouble Music Applause 10th double double this season for Tyson theres Tyson on the opposite because Tyson penetrated you saw wake again we talked about that wall that theyre building down there being able to get some separation smooth stroke stops a 70 run for Wake Forest time is on the side of the demon Geeks Applause Williamson Bradford oh good blocks it the other way that is Galloway what a recovery block Kai Andrew Carr more rejections in the Harvard Law School Wake Forest leaves by 11 hildren that would have been the kill shot Applause four and a half remaining Clemson beetle is fouled and well have two free throws Brian Oliver lets take a look at tonights protecting the paintbron cycpi security we talked about the blind party on both ends you see PJ Hall coming over on the weak side to block that by Bradford and then what looks like an easy one you see Andrew Carr spotting out a way both teams participate in this block party its your CPI Security protecting the paint partner only bit of bad news in a long while for Wake Forest just happened that foul on Cameron Hildreth its a sport such a solid allaround player Hildreth will have to leave here with 425 remaining in our ball game hell be protected back into the ball game comes Matthew Marsh and damari Monsanto and now with hilderist on the bench interested to see if that frees up to 100 Tyson because most of his struggles has been Hills with being able to fight through those screens not giving him easy looks interesting to see during this time how long does Steve Forbes keep him on the bench especially if Tyson can get rolling Beetle makes a couple of free throws remember Beetle was denied because a lane violation just a moment ago another what if for Clemson Applebees so quick oh my goodness he got knocked to the floor this is trouble on multiple levels for Clemson its going to be three free throws for Appleby and Beetle has just fouled out when you saw how he throws Vito on the Fate and again trying to challenge that thats one of the thats a huge loss for Clemson especially with Beetle watch this replay basically comes out fakes the mayor goes up and then Beetle Challenge and thats contact Beetle didnt agree with him but you watched that last time up in the air that kicks that leg out you know it convinced me that there have been better point guards or quicker point guards in the ACC over the years than what Wake Forest has produced Tyree Appleby the latest in the long line of greats team ish Chris Paul Childress what do you want keep going Appleby misses the first came into this game shooting 83 percent at the line been kind of an adventure today four for six oh my goodness four for seven at the line for Appleby leaving a lot of meat on the bone here you see budo over there was like ball dont lie Ive never seen anyone go oh for three after getting foul shooting three never in any level of basketball this doesnt happen one out of three is Appleby have you seen anyone missed three straight free throws up between 12 season three yes wow okay Tyson one and done Clemson running out of time and this is where Steve Forbes talks about that last four minutes of the game youre up ten the clock is your friend execution is key you realize if you run your plays and then what you do is you take advantage of the mismatch and try to touch the paint here the last few moments of the game and there are two two pumps in it and mishaps happen like that and what you found is Applebee had two guys on them they were so so worried about having the penetration you found Marsh wide open thats how you shoot 89 if youre Matthew Marks hes abducted one shot so far today in 16 minutes and its from two feet out and he finishes with two hands you see right now a double team and he said get it down to Marsh Marshal say you know what I would gladly take this right now wait open it up by 12 cool record they lead Clemson by 12 take a look at the upcoming schedule for Clemson brought to you by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina you see that Virginia Tech game Virginia Tech been playing up and down basketball Hunter Couture scheduled to come back hes been big for them and then they go down and say theyve got Georgia Tech on Tuesday and you look at weight they can go ahead and win this would be a huge win and they welcome the Tar Heels here on Saturday and how about that matchup next Wednesday against Pitt I like Clemsons got the basketball do they have one last kick theyre playing without Josh Beadle whos fouled out playing without Chase Hunter who didnt dress with an ankle and Alex Hemingway who is out right now Claire fraschitis Music Applause Tyson thats a big shot the rotation guy the rotation PJ Hall saw the double team came didnt out for us he got the ball out of his hands a good rotation over to Hunter Tyson theres a guy in the front row wearing a robe trying to jaw with Hunter Tyson doesnt have much teeth to that bark Clemson theyve got it back Galloway long rebound Tyson all pushed from behind by March because of the bonus this would be a oneonone situation for Hall I like the fact that Clemson did give him another touch because the last time you see watch how low he has Marsh sealed down there march with a twohand push in the back Music opportunity for PJ Hall to cut this lead down Marsh has four fouls so he is on the verge of expulsion one and one Applause and Marsh is slowly walking back to the bench hes going to be looking at Davion Bradford comes back in possible strategy for Clemson remember Bradford is not Elite as a free throw shooter and heres the thing if Im Brad Bonnell I would entertain fouling Bradford I mean but who can you follow this you know everybody have to foul all right hes already had one guy foul out Brad Brownells figured out smarter than most you see Clemson extend into a 131 Zone skip pass Applebys got it and a foul one of the freshmen being forced to play Big minutes RJ Godfrey and Brian you look at the guys on the floor and Clemson a team that is 153 ranked 19th from the country two true freshmen playing here with two minutes remaining RJ Godfrey Chauncey Wiggins kind of figured out on the fly as young players absolutely and in this in this league youve got to have solid point guard playing not having Chase Hunters really hurt them not so much for his scoring but how hes been able to run this team Appleby totally frustrated with himself has not had a great night at the freak going on but he does have 20 points next to his name and heres the thing too you talk about weight this weight team is a good ball Club they beat this dude team here and then again youre talking five and two in the conference obviously when they played up at Clemson that was a game that they should have won they were actually up playing against Carolina so you talk about the two losses in conference play comes with two really good teams on the road still going inside this is Paul Tyson and a fall what a big play by Hunter Tyson I see Hunter Tyson getting being able to get by a cam Hildreth he goes up you see that nice little play and then Hunter Tyson comes out no one puts a body on him being able to flush and get the one in the foul that is a big time play for that to happen with 207 remaining man third foul on Andrew Carr this is the closest that Clemson has been in a while now youre talking a two possession game right now if youre Clemson you want to play solid see that one three one hell just back into the game for stability reasons hes got four fouls again if youre awake you want to try to get into the teeth of that that zone try to pick him pop Williamson hilldrift Applause Big Bob big big bomb again good penetration by Williamson forced to help allowed Hilder to have a wide open three Tysons been the man lately short and a foul on Bradford didnt need to do it he hit checks Hall to the ground watch this last player and you see nivium Williamson penetrate forced to help being able to get Kim him wide open being able to Tee It Up knocked down that three you can win a lot of ball games you guys like Cameron hilgrim he knows what hes doing Bradford called for the foul now double bonus situation for Clemson two free throws for a hall hes a perfect five for five at the strike tonight he may never miss it again thats a good looking free throw hes had a solid night tonight to 18 points eight rebounds Applause still keeping Clemson within Striking Distance all right shoots a pretty ball Wake Forest can make another change Bradfords going to be lifted Monsanto back in Appleby Hildreth Monsanto Williamson and Carr playing for Wake Forest youre looking basically is your friend a little more over in a minute three possession game lasting unit Ford is a turnover youll feel like you got to penetrate the teeth and for a nice little kick out Applause and were under a minute to play Applebee is fouled Wiggins commits the foul two free throws for Appleby Wake Forest leading the rebounding War by just two but the most important rebound of the game probably just happened a moment ago when hildrift ran down that loose ball before absolutely they gave them a free opportunity with 19 seconds left to go you pick a little more time and then you get it into your playmakers hands Appleby had a spurt in that middle of the game where he couldnt hit the free throw but hes hitting the big ones now absolutely Galloway knocked Away by Williamson Music Clemson running out of time if youre Clemson you need a quick score you want to go ahead and stretch this game out we need a quick sport obviously youll look for three but I take a quick basket and try to play the foul game Wiggins Hill Griffith the rebound willing to the hunter Tyson was wailing at him and Hildreth will March the other direction and fire up the double free throw Clemson Tigers have looked into the future and CNL coming theyre down nine with a very good freethrow shooter shooting the pair at the line for Wake Forest you see hilled with 15 possibly 16 points nine rebounds I want to say it was the defense that he played on Hunter Tyson not allowing him to be able to have much Breathing Room fighting over those picks and making a challenging knife for him they really paid to play the dividends Applause oh with a hammer and before that ball even went through the rim a timeout called by Brad Brownell he saw what was happening and said I want to time out immediately its now nine point game you can see penetration by Galloway getting the ball over nice powerful finish at The Rim by DJ Hall Im going to the Wayback machine but a guy used to dunk like that cocking it all the way back and touching his name plate Larry Nance oh wow vintage Clemson from about 40 years ago I learned into the sky man every single time with two hands who would always touch his name plate and then finish when those pullups at The Rim long socks too Music Applause moment for Brad Brownell how about this for a factor youre gonna remember this one Brad Bonnell has never been a conference coach of the year is it what he was coach of the year when he was at UNC Williamson to play and they they play in the Columbia Athletic Association technically not a conference he was coach of the year at Wright State but they play in The Horizon League its a league technically not accomplished so if he wins coach of the year in the ACC this year will be the first time hes been conference coach of the year you know what thats surprising for me because I thought maybe six to eight years ago I thought they had a really good stretch where hes never been ACC coaches anymore Im going to trust you you are now in his 13th year youre always dropping Jewels let me go ahead and give you that benefit of doubt and a foul in the backcourt Applebee wasnt going to give it up once two more free moves the third foul on Hunter Tyson about this wave team you know four guys in double figures cap will be closing in huge Knight Monsanto with a huge nice 17 points Andrew Carr was 16 DC Notre Dame two oclock on Saturday Wake Forest came into this game leading the conference during conference Play points per game and thats going to go up they have 85 points if we play our final 30 seconds about the stat line for Tyree Appleton 237 dimes and five steers Cal grits with another steal how about an exclamation point and she called the Jerry on the top Steve Forbes has slayed his personal Dragon for the first time Steve Forbes has defeated the Clemson Tigers after losing the first three times against Brad Brownells bunch how about this Wake Forest team they refused to lose at home they are now 100 here at Joel Coliseum first time in the long Rich history of Wake Forest basketball that the Demon Deacons have started backtoback Seasons perfect through 10 games at home and they set the tone from the beginning of the game I thought they came and established their offense Limited
