found it like nobody else in the country carolina had won six of its last seven before a loss to clemson tuesday duke had won two in a row before a loss at miami monday neither roy williams nor mike shashefsky pleased with his teams most recent effort we are ready for the tip of our sonic blockbuster another installment of duke and carolina as soon as roger airs throws the ball on the in the air is underway here at cameron indoor stadium and out of bounds itll go over to the tar heels north carolina 116 on the season six and four in the league unranked they are in the also receiving votes category just outside the top 25 and one thing that both of these teams have in common jay right now they get a lot of young players and we see freshmen in love and walton again starting in the backcourt for the heels very young backcourts for both teams freshman backcourts that tend to turn the ball over little horn set to start for carolina going highlow and you can see the youth of duke as well with freshmen in roach steward and williams starting the two teams have a combined 13 freshman on their two rosters shot clock down to two caleb love off balance off the back of the iron and down with the rebound is mark williams the big guy seven footer a freshman for duke who jay getting more playing time recently and given the size carolinas got up front you got to believe williams is a very important guy in this game for the blue devils yeah playing more physical but north carolina in their first possession in the half court getting about as difficult as shot as you can get glendale moore junior into traffic and he turns it over on a travel turnovers a common refrain from both roy williams and to mike schizewski what did we talk to them yesterday about their most recent games well north carolina turns the ball over at a 21 rate thats 268th in the country and you turn the ball over you cant defend a run out and you cant offensive rebound a turnover thats why taking care of the ball and getting a shot up is so important for north carolina because how well they generate second shot opportunities garrison of brooks defended by matthew hurt turnaround will go and carolina strikes first and theres the most important player for north carolina garrison brooks i think should and can have a great game in this one last year he averaged 22 points nine rebounds in the two games against duke jeremy roach tried to dump it off for mark williams and its picked off by armando baycock have to make effective use of the dribble against this big north carolina team youre driving into a lot of size and jay thats three possessions three turnovers for duke matthew hurt having to guard garrison brooks they need to continue to go to him that is kerwin walton the best shooter on the carolina team a 65 freshman from hopkins minnesota probably the least heralded of the carolina freshman but hes become a very important guy yeah hes such a good shooter when he gets his feet set you cannot allow him to shoot the ball from the catch spot you have to make him put it on the deck where hes less effective dj stewart got half a step on walton cant get it to go tipped back out by williams wide open steward for three and duke is on the board tj stewart is the number one freshman scorer in the acc and is a good shooter hes starting to play much better because his shot selection has really improved over the last 10 games or so hes at 13 and a half points per game leaky black who does not shoot the three often that is his eighth on the season carolina by five well he made four of four from threepoint range against miami at 16 points but he was oh of seven since that game so thats a big shot for leaky black so eight made freeze on the season four in that one game as jay mentioned and the heels leading by five two and a half minutes in and we see a trio of subs getting ready to come into the game already for duke and there is the fourth blue devils turnover in transition and a block is the call on the drive by brooks right call it looked like garrison brooks almost shuffled his feet near a walk but carolina getting out in transition off the mistake but just theres no way that was going to be a Applause charge that was definitely a block the right call and north carolinas bench was asking for a goaltend a look at the carolina season so far they are among if not the best rebounding team in division one they dont shoot it well oh and five in quad one that is the ncaa net metric and now we are told they did count the basket j they have said that was a goal ten so one free throw here for brooks and its 11 to three heels lets be honest both of these teams are in need of quality wins right now carolina according to joe linardi is one of the last four bots hes got them in as an 11 seed duke is on the outside looking into both coaches will tell you hey were just trying to get better today but they both need quality wins the blue devils more than the tar heels at this point of the season yeah no question i mean they need any win both these teams need to just play well and establish a baseline to play well consistently what a pass by dj stewart jordan goldwire a lot of substitutions for duke they did not get off to a good start taking care of the ball and jalen johnson coming into the ball game after mike szczeczki turned his play at miami to be horrible he said he was soft and played horrible in that game in which he had four turnovers but 13 points and seven rebounds as a result not on the starting lineup tonight you saw the season summary for duke just one game over 500 of both overall and in conference play they have one quad one win and thats at notre dame which is a top 75 and thats the the metric for winning on the road but again to the point we made earlier both as jay said both of these teams just need to play well they need to win games try to get some momentum going both of these teams jay as is typically the case their schedules are kind of backloaded theyre going to get more difficult yeah its going to get much more difficult but thats okay thats what they need and what they want right now another three for walton and the lead grows for carolina boy waltons doing such a good job of changing pace so that his defender is off balance you know he goes slow to fast and he went really quickly into that shot but set his feet before he caught it that was impressive by kerwin walton armando bacon is going to be called for foul Applause carolina with a big size advantage on the inside youll generally see two of baycod brooks and now dayron sharp the mcdonalds allamerican 611 265 from greenville north carolina one of the few tar heels coming off a good game in their loss to clemson on tuesday nice drive by stewart to lay it in really well done on out of bounds underneath north carolina went to a little zone it was overloaded on the right side stuart took advantage of it really smart play looking inside for sharp but the pass too far off his fingertips out of bounds to take us to our first median timeout of this installment between carolina and duke look inside the rivalry between these two when we come back espns exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by h r block their experts can do your taxes virtually get your taxes done without leaving home and in part by the original and spicy extralong ultimate cheesesteaks only at soccer how would i describe oprah paint on a used car 151 carolina 49 and the total score separated by only 14 points both of course with legendary coaches on the sidelines and these programs it goes without saying are among college basketballs royalty when you look at national championships final fours acc tournament titles and the like this is the first of two scheduled regular season meetings between the two as always they will meet on the final saturday of the regular season this year of course with this one being here the last one assuming it takes place will be in chapel hill and yet another duke turnover and caleb love slams it down and draws a foul duke just running a high horn set and carolina came out and blitzed it that little rub screen off that horn set they just came out blitzed it almost trapped it and caleb love who has had his issues as a freshman this season with his shot selection shooting the ball hes big hes strong and hes athletic and that was a big time play by the freshman to start out his duke carolina career and look at those points off turnovers i mean mike chazewski was not happy with the way they handled the ball monday at miami and if anything its worse so far here in the first four and a half minutes of this one well north carolina has not only handled dukes pressure theyve applied their own and they have really established sort of the strength and the tempo of this game and dan just so everybody knows from cameron indoor stadium to the smith center its actually 11mile because coach k i know that because coach k made me walk home after we lost there in 1986 know exactly how far it was you know what i most of your stuff is is selfdeprecating humor i think i might believe you couldnt go either way you could have you could sell that to me heres johnson with a drive good defense by brooks and johnson comes up empty and thats just not a strong move by jalen johnson its just the stronger player won that battle that was brooks what a steal now by johnson and a chance for a run out for duke joey baker gets a good look for three and knocks it down baker a guy who shot the three at a 39 percent clip a year ago has not played as much and jay has not shot as well this year well one of the reasons hes not played as much as hes not hunting that shot i mean he needs to shoot more of those he made 28 of them last year and thats only his sixth made three this season and garrison brooks i think hes got to take this game over for north carolina hes going to be a tough matchup for anybody that mike czyzewski decides to put on him if they continue to play man yeah thats a vintage baseline turnaround classy garrison of brooks right there hes got seven and how about carolina seven of eight from the floor and a travel is called on jaime to breakfield yet another duke turnover well brakefield was trying to drive dayron sharp where hes got the advantage but this is a bigtime play here by garrison brooks just turning baseline shooting over brakefield a little turnaround jumper and he has not had the kind of scoring season i think everybody expected hes average in double figures over seven rebounds but hes capable of 25 in this game good back cut and playtech has it rejected good feed by brooks good cut by playtick but good recovery by duke williams on the feed from goldwire got caught under the bucket boy good job by sharp stand with her down on the perimeter williams with a jump hook too strong yeah right now matthew hurts had a hard time trying to establish anything on the perimeter even against carolinas big guys when he draws them away from the basket caroline has just been stronger in this game duke has won the last three in the rivalry freshman rj davis rattles it in and out on the three nine point lead tar heels baker you talked about him hunting his shot onto that one but he comes up empty well you got to go out and guard if hes looking to shoot youve got to go out and guard him and thats going to open up things for his teammates carolinas secondary break that little winged backpick and running that ever since dean smith set foot in chapel hill thats what everybody says about the heels its not that you dont know what theyre going to do they just do it so well its like uh you know its like usc back in the day running student body right or the power sweep of the green bay packers you knew it was coming you just couldnt stop it and north carolina has a bunch of its their secondary break and usually the threat of their primary break makes the secondary break even better but their their primary break hasnt been particularly good this year but but its still the same action and still difficult to guard walker kessler into the game for the first time for the heels and with a shot clock running down he misses a turnaround Applause kessler just a freshman a mcdonalds allamerican hes gonna be really good Applause seven footer each program with three mcdonalds allamericans two of the top recruiting classes in the country but it sure does feel like the younger teams have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic didnt really have a summer didnt get to know each other all that well didnt have a closed scrimmage or an exhibition game maybe the veteran teams riding this kind of thing out better than the younger teams when duke shoots a long ball that means its going to be a long rebound and that neutralizes a little bit of north carolinas rebounding advantage that balls still live and dukes got it you see where dukes running its offense really high trying to give them the ability to drive boy thats a strong drive and a reverse there by wendell moore he just went right into the chest of andrew playtech and knocked him backwards good fake by playtech short on the three Applause baker with a shot fake gets it off and misses the three from the wing that was more of a challenge three but the aggressiveness is good a good idea there by love had a good look at the floater couldnt get it to go when its out of bounds itll be carolina ball when we come back wendell moore with his watches the netflix series that came out thats a little disturbing yeah whos your funniest teammate funniest teammate hes definitely henry coleman by far your best basketball moment of your career at any level best basketball moment is definitely kill on a shot yeah you had last year at carolina yes what was it like what did it feel like to have that kind of moment i mean going to become honest just watching all day it was great i had my own moment in this robbery hes really second to none how about the difference between playing two games last year against north carolina at cameron at the smith center and then this year with no no fans what what will that be like itd definitely be different especially for guys who played in the game and that high account with that many fans going crazy its definitely a different game this year the job you covet going forward in life for me i think i was going to be around the game so i want to be like a sports agent or something like that well as long as its not a sports announcer thats a good thing 94 feet do i get any input if he becomes a sports announcer hes going to be played by play if he does hes moving you out not me and you know i dont want to understand the carolina shop and all but chocolate chip cookies every meal sounds like the greatest moment of ones career darn right especially for breakfast davis with a miss from the corner the bucket that happened during the wendell moore interview was another bucket for garrison brooks and you talked about jay hes got to get touch after touch hes got nine points already uh if i were roy williams i tell my team every time down garrison brooks touches it or your scholarship is pulled you dont have to mean it but he needs to touch the ball thats some tough love right there he touched the ball by going to get it right now comes up with a steal good pass wide open playtip boy what a great couple of trips for the heels as they get the lead back up to 10 harrison brooks is dominating this game you saw he put himself right in the middle of the lane during that 94 feed and wound up getting a dunk off the penetration and he is just locked in and having a great start to this game good extra pass there by steward but moore cant knock down the corner three theres brooks now looking highlow hes such a good passer hes got a great sense of where to be on the floor especially on the defensive end i think hes north carolinas best defensive player baycod has been very consistent this year other than the tuesday game against clemson when he was very quiet yeah unbelievably quiet that was probably his worst outing as a tar heel he only had one point three rebounds four fouls against clemson williams there to pick up the loose change and slam it in he started getting more minutes three games ago hes gotten consistent double figure minutes and again with the size of carolina they need all they can get from williams brooks inside and matthew hurt just picked up his second foul with the game hurts not going to be able to guard him down the low post garrison brooks is just too strong and hes playing angles really well on hurt it was a great job of reading the vision of the passer taking that away and then not charging into wendell moore just stopping and then finding the open man andrew playtech cross court really smart play by garrison brooks so joe you figured for duke to have its best chance to win this game matthew hurt would have to have a big game he is going to the bench now with a 9 15 left in the first half with two fouls and without a single point so far yeah matthew hurts got to be able to play out on the perimeter and hes got to be able to draw one of carolinas big guys away from the basket you know involve them in ball screens where he can play pick and pop shot fake get some fouls on them but get them out of the paint where theyre more effective and boy is dudes small right now really the biggest guys they have out there are johnson and great field this is a five out lineup right now for the blue devils guards have done a pretty good job of staying in front of ball handlers on drives but the ball has to move before you drive it you cant just drive on the first side Applause roach got baycod in the air baicot did a good job to not foul them and roach missed the three moore with a follow but really its been offensive rebounding for duke off long rebounds thats been a big part of their offense north carolinas guards and their wings are gonna have to chase the ball down a little more effectively big size mismatch here for bait cod the duke bench screaming that he stepped out of bounds waltons open again and you cant leave him open kerwin walton with his third three of the game already off any broken play all these teams now north carolina duke you name it theyre so effective at finding open threepoint shooters and jeremy roach knocking down that three he really needed that one he has not been shooting the ball well last five games two of 17 from three and 23 overall on the season from three but a big one to get duke back within seven and after the brooks miss theyll get a good look for brake field in the corner and he airballs it great feel the guy who since jalen johnson has come back from injury hasnt played a whole lot leaky black called for the offensive foul itll go back over to duke garrison brooks has played 11 minutes in this ball game hes got 10 points the turnaround jumper down in the low post hes played good defensively puts himself in front of the rim and gets rewarded one of the truly great people and shulman j bill is with you at cameron indoor stadium first meeting of the season between the 11 and six tar heels and the seven and six blue devils both trying to find their footing find out who they are get more consistent try to string some wins together which as we mentioned theyve both done at times this year but theyre both coming in into this one off a loss and theyre looking up at the likes of virginia virginia tech florida state louisville right now in the acc both coaches really thinking about the next possession thats how young their teams are theyre trying to build possession by possession henry coleman getting some run now for duke and he picks up an assist on the three by roach his second of the game duke spreading the floor but not going quite as fast as they were before theyre not in a rush good pass a play on coleman down with a rebound and back come the blue devils in transition well you got to go up stronger than that if youre going to go get fouled you got to go into the contact not try to avoid it that was a low percentage shot by rj davis and very little chance of getting a foul call that way brooks guarded by coleman lost it and theyre going to keep it at this end of the floor with the heels it looked like it might have gone off garrison brookes foot got a big monday double header coming for you youll see the tar heels again they will host miami jim jimilaranegas underman team i mean they give it everything theyve got every time they had a heartbreaking defeat in overtime to virginia tech today and then oklahoma state speaking of overtime they had a double overtime win over texas today they will take on kansas the jayhawks jay allowed 91 points in a loss in west virginia this afternoon by the way west virginia shot the ball theres a play run just to get an isolation inside for wendell moore against andrew playtech and playtech just took the ball away named down gave it away and roach the beneficiary of the easy two roach now with eight boy if that isnt a microcosm of north carolinas season i dont know what is i mean roy williams was beside himself andrew playtech makes a great play and then just gives the ball away for a bucket on the other end duke trying to steal some minutes without matthew hurt whos got two fouls without mark williams the freshman whos pulled down a bunch of rebounds but hes on the bench right now and caleb love with a very confident looking step back jumper caleb love has always been a scorer but this is his first year as a point guard having to make decisions at higher speed and to get others involved i think jalen johnson was expecting armando baicot to go up and try to block that that was not a strong move and it has been a quiet first half so far for johnson baycod did he shuffle the feet yeah he did Applause under control and went straight up for that shot it was still a challenge shot but much better than most of the shots hes taken on the season i mean coming into this game he had taken 194 shots and had missed 125 of them and hes a much better shooter than that hes a scorer matthew hurt checking back into the game with two fouls duke played well with the small lineup cut into the deficit baker looking for somebody and he finds stewart still plenty of time north carolina gets the ball at the half court that means they have to go at matthew hurt try to pick up that third foul nice play by jalen johnson because he caught the ball on the move so much better in the half court when hes on the move first bucket of the game for the freshman carolinas lead down to two brooks has johnson on him thats a mismatch good pass it wont go down for sharp but he will go to the line all right take a look at jalen johnson right here and with all the action all the vision on the ball garrison brooks had to look at the ball if johnson had stayed where he was it wouldnt have been an effective play but he was on the move and thats what as a cutter thats what got him that easy opportunity and garrison brookston had to turn his head and find him after he tried to stop the ball but if hes going to guard brooks on this other end on carolinas offensive end i think carolina needs to look at brooks every time let him go one on one against jalen johnson inside a couple of the misses of misses at the line by sharp and duke and tire take the lead but they turn it over again brooks to the deck coleman trying to get it from him and eventually itll be a taya he was calling timeout but the officials didnt see it teddy valentine was behind the play so probably couldnt see it but theres no question he was calling timeout no question yeah thats the reaction you could see that ted valentine just gave roy williams i couldnt see that he was behind him at the time i dont know where jordan goldwire was going here but thats not a good play but he was trying to call timeout and he had possession but it just wasnt seen by the official so the possession arrow gives it to duke Applause jordan goldwire the senior low turnover high steel good assist guy a stabilizer in the backcourt at times nice feed into coleman and duke has tied it a broken play but a good job by coleman after he got the ball back out to just cut to the basket it was a scramble situation love was out of the play brooks had to help up and just a nice cut by henry coleman who has not played much this year but hes an energy big that works the glass and battles when hes out there just hasnt had a lot of time the freshman from richmond to virginia to jays point coming into the game tonight with 23 minutes of court time the entire regular season walton on the drive this time and he gets called for the charge Applause it was coleman stepping in Applause so now duke with a chance to take the lead a good job by garrison brooks to push jalen johnson off of the lane wouldnt let him get the ball in the post and walton did a good job on joey baker coming off those baseline screens matthew hertz gone back to the bench mark williams on the bench and again this smaller lineup really with coleman and johnson as the the two biggest guys out there for duke its been a good group for the blue devils carolina just trapping off that ball screen action when they got both big guys 25 feet away from the bucket holmen doing some good work and he threw it out of bounds off of sharp so itll be duke ball in its high game when we come back espns exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by zaxbys hand breaded chicken and fresh ingredients made to order only at zaxboards incomparable design makes it beautiful hubert cameron tied at 30 neither team is ranked in this game you have to go back to 1960 the last time that they met when neither of them was ranked 153 consecutive games over 61 years where at least one and usually both of them were ranked as jaylen johnson gives duke j its first lead of the game yeah out of bounds underneath they went four across and jalen johnson just looped in behind henry coleman who just uh went right to the ball and took a defender with him and dukes pressure has really bothered north carolina over the last five six minutes of the ball game blue devils on a 142 run and now the floor is more spread and north carolinas big guys are having to come out on the floor more roach left it a bit short down with a rebound is low and thats really going to be a key for north carolina is getting the guards to rebound and love can try to take it coast to coast and he will to tie the game thats really his game is to put the ball in the deck and attack the basket because of his size and because of his strength and athleticism baker his second three of the games but he looks a lot better out there when hes looking to shoot the ball more of a threat all this year joey bakers been an energy player a guy whos hustled and put his body on the line but he needs to make buckets too two for four from threepoint range and now a foul i believe on henry coleman inside caleb love averages under three rebounds a game but when he gets that ball hes the one that can bring it up and does a good job of probing and then getting all the way to the basket absorbing some contact and using his strength to be able to finish through it off the glass one of the issues for caleb love has been he has has filled his tank mostly on the offensive end but he could be an outstanding defender youre seeing love davis and harris three freshman guards all in the game at the same time and its the sophomore baycod who lays it in to make it a onepoint game and it was all because of caleb love after the ball reversal he put the ball in the deck avoided that charge that joey baker was trying to make and dumped it off to armando bacon carolina great early led most of the way duke on a run to take the lead baycod almost traveled finds love in the corner and the heels are back on top boy when duke turns the ball over north carolina has capitalized and what should have been a dunk because of a mishandling of the ball wound up being a three and carolinas already in the first half exceeded their season average on made threes the two teams have combined to turn it over 16 times and those turnovers have led to 31 points between the two teams already in this game well you cannot defend the run out and you cant offensive rebound to turnover and this run out baycod just about had a dunk there and hurt could have put him in a position to pick up his third if he challenged it but the mishandling of the ball wound up working in north carolinas favor because bacon able to get it to love and love got his feet set in a hurry there to your point about the threes they averaged just over five a game theyve got six already tonight and incredibly efficiently as well so six is more than five sixes i was right okay im not great at math but im pretty sure i was right you can put your socks Laughter back i havent noticed roy williams shoes did he break out another another pair of shoes tonight hes been uh yep yeah those look new yeah hes worn a different pair of shoes every game i think i believe i shouldnt be that interested in another mans shoes but i am hes been very stylish now hes not wearing you know how roys got a couple of lucky jackets that he wears thats out of play everybodys dressing down this year so you got to do it in other ways johnson with a travel oh no step out of bounds boy jalen johnsons good is great we saw that in the pit game 24 points 15 rebounds seven assists no turnovers but as is the case with the many freshmen hes had his ups and downs and hes also had an injury this year hes a hes a fullcourt open court player and a transition player when he has to play in the half four hes still learning that part of the game and so he makes way more mistakes in the half court the follow by day ron sharp nobody got a body on the biggest guy on the court you got to get two bodies on that body those are the ones dan in film that your coach runs back over and over again and no matter how many times your coach runs it back you dont get them blocked out on any of them another duke turnover harris baycock carolina by four boy carolina with a sense of urgency to get the ball down court but duke without a sense of urgency to get back not making a stand and carolina gets it all the way to the rim Music north carolina and duke a lot of times it comes down to the play after the play the battle on the glass and right now north carolina winning it at the rim the world needs more iconic very young program in kentucky that like duke and carolina to varying degrees is still trying to figure it out kentucky just five and 11 on the season so far yeah its been a struggle in the bluegrass but john galipari is saying he needs some dagger throwers he just wants some of his players to make shots thats one of those things where somebody says hey you know do you need do you need more shooters and and calipari would say no we got plenty of shooters we dont have any makers we need more makers dan shulman jbl is cameron indoor stadium durham north carolina the visiting tar heels leading by four matthew hurt has not been touching the ball at all hes got armando bacon on him good fake steward will step in and bury it to make it a twopoint game anthony harris has not been playing much he admired the young man because he has come back from so many injuries but he needs to stay down on those fakes if youre just joining us one of the stories one of the reasons carolina is leading is they are shooting the heck out of the three ball so far yeah north carolinas gotten some wide open threes and anytime kerwin walton the freshman their best shooter by a fair mark and gets an open three leaky black knocks one down hes out of the game with three fouls but waltons been knocking him down caleb love andrew playtech on that relocation pass by garrison brooks walton hit three of them and then this one was it was a really big one caleb loved knocking it down not just for his confidence but that was what looked like a short two turned into three speaking of threes tune in to abc tonight it is nba primetime steph curry and the warriors taking on the mavericks for the second time in as many games thursday night the warriors beat them by 31 lets see what curry and golden state are up to tonight our coverage begins with nba countdown at eight oclock eastern time two guys who are appointment viewers steph curry and luka doncic steph curry we talked about roy williams shoes have you seen steph currys new shoes they are so weird final seconds of the first half and a close one between carolina and duke little box set the elevator play well defended thus far by duke but then carolina want to get that ball inside brooks does not get it to go and it will be a twopoint lead for the tar heels going to halftime here at cameron theyre playing hard and its close and thats all we can ask for lets send it back to the studio heres rhys davis all right dan give me a lot of great commercials in the super bowl halftime tomorrow its just an unrelated thought as we arrive better than the last one subtlety matthew hurt was not one of them i think for duke in the second half they have to spread north carolina out and theyve got to drive the ball try to force help get these north carolina bigs away from the basket and north carolinas got to take care of the ball and theyve got to pound that ball inside thats where their advantage is ready for the tip and underway in the second half of our sonic blockbuster as the tip back in is good for armando baycod and that is always your biggest fear playing carolina is keeping them off the offensive glass and keeping caleb love out of the lane thats what led to it a little double stack low for duke and garrison brooks guarding matthew hurt bj stewart and jeremy roach the freshman guards combined for 15 in the first half for the blue devils lindell moore played well as well mark williams again starting as he did at the beginning of the game shot clock running down steward cant get it to go duke got a switch where armando baicot was on roach and they just could not take advantage of it and carolina able to switch back leaky black starting the second half for carolina picked up his third foul midway through the first sat down for a while but a back out there to start here in the second half walton who hit three threes great pass brooks to baicot and he cant get it to go to be stronger than that if he didnt have it right away kick it back out wow nobody stops the ball for the heels and roach takes advantage amazing how often after you take a questionable shot even though hes right under the basket great pass off the double team just not a rotation over but garrison brooks saw the double team coming just an over the shoulder pass to bacot for an easy bucket thats a big time play by garrison brooks carolina one of the few programs that still almost all the time plays two traditional bigs and i dont know that theres any team in the country where the big share the ball as well as they do in chapel hill no they do a good job of running the court and again this team is not the kind of transition team as successful in transition as roy williams has had in the past but take a look when the ball goes inside to garrison brooks theres going to be a a double team and nobody picks up armando baicot you cant double team off baicot like that if you do you have to have somebody pick him up right away i dont know whether there was just a miscommunication when delmore thought he was switching and uh and then matthew hurt was gonna pick it up i mean youre just inviting a layup when you double team off the passer like that third assist of the night for garrison brooks carolina by four steward nice move but he left it short yeah kerwin walton cant give up middle that easily thats just too easy of a middle drive carolina got away with one there hurt tips it away balls loose the heels retain Applause and love fouled by roach caleb love is so much better when hes looking to drive the ball first because you can get duke to help then you can play off of it any time you drive you you know effective use of the dribble is where you can force help once you do that you can break down a defense gatorade player of the year in missouri last year as a high school senior mcdonalds allamerican scored 26 points per game he comes into college basketball with credentials but again being young being a young point guard and being a young point guard who really played off the ball more in high school all tough things that love is still adjusting to and he played high school basketball caleb glove did for jason tatums father so connection to the duke carolina rivalry even in st louis carolina ball they got to decide whos going to inbound it itll be love its all about love third year in a row roy williams has had a freshman starting at the point love finds black for the bucket they were looking they were looking to get a lob and duke trying to take the lob away and leaky black just able to oh beautiful backdoor cut against the pressure and roach with another easy bucket to get him back within four well you cant get higher than your man in the corner on fall side otherwise youre just inviting them to go back door this is one of loves better games this season dont you think and i think its because hes looking to attack off the dribble and hes doing so under control you know hes not hes not worrying about his shot you know you make yourself feel a heck of a lot better when you see the ball go in from short range too what was i dont know what that pass was it never got close and its a dunk at the other end for bacon north carolina having fun on these possessions they like to get two on ones three on twos but when you have somebody ahead of the pack playing completely ahead of the defense like armando baicot was thats when the game becomes really easy now 23 points off turnovers for the tar heels roach gets right by love and theres no help defense yeah thats a lot of freshmen the further the ball is away from your man the more you can help and nobody was in the middle of the lane kerwin walton hugging up on his man on the weak side one you cant give up that kind of drive but second youve got to have weak side help a little high low between brooks and baycod itll count and a foul the big guys really doing a great job here to open up the second half for carolina love the feed bacon the finish carolina up by eight here at cameron espns exclusive middle of the lane look how far his man is away from the ball the further your man is away from the ball the more you can help now let it go and as he drives kerwin waltons outside the lane he cant get there in time if hes in the middle of the lane he can get outside of the lane to take a charge or stop the ball an easy bucket for roach whos having a nice night but its carolina leading by eight baycod has been huge here in the second half hes already got eight second half points for the tar heels who have led most of the way and coming out of the timeout jay mike shishevsky has gone smaller again and the smaller lineup was the more successful lineup of the first half well anytime you have size against a smaller team its which of the advantages is going to dominate and you know duke should be quicker to the ball and theyre slower to the ball armando baycott winds up missing the free throw he gets the ball back and the whole point of a smaller lineup in is to be quicker to the ball be able to spread the floor mark williams and matthew hurt both on the bench right now out of the timeout henry coleman gave him a spark off the bench is out there johnson also playing in the front court right now as baker knocks down his third three of the game and hes turning into an x factor tonight well nice drive to start by jalen johnson he drew two defenders then kicked it opposite and it was the next pass that got joey baker that wide open shot love having himself a game isnt he he got so many easy things he developed a rhythm one by playing defense and playing hard but he wasnt trying to develop his rhythm by making his jump shot first goldwire leaves it short on the baseline caleb love with 15 points now hes the high scorer in the game take a look this little horn set rubs off the top and jordan goldwire goes underneath it and when you go underneath it caleb love has not been shooting the ball well on the season but hes still a pretty darn good shooter not this time for baker goldwire trying to slow down love look at the deposition but we had a whistle and a walk on caleb love he just didnt come to a twofooted jump stop because he he had brooks right there and roy williams knew it just one of those tiny little mistakes did almost everything right and it would have been a basket turnovers are 10 apiece but that means each team has only turned it over once so far here in the second half johnson tough shot good defense by garrison brooks Applause johnsons supposed to be the quicker player but brooks wouldnt let him get past wow what a catch sharp hung onto the ball roach went flying and its now carolinas largest lead of the night what a catch by tehran sharp and the defender went flying usually you might lose the ball there but not deron sharp great catch and jeremy roach on the deck while he scores big time play by the freshman the production has been excellent from caleb caleb love has been aggressive hes been under control his demeanor has been fantastic look hes had some really good games this season hes had some struggles too but as far as an allaround floor game to this point in the game this is the best i have seen him play in college caleb love has been terrific hes got 15 points 6 of 11 from the field four assists hes coughed it up a couple of times but they havent been run out turnovers you know theyve been yeah he had that last one where he walked trying to get it into bacon but at least he gets to play five on five on the other end with the turnover thats out of bounds baker getting some big minutes tonight for duke and he is producing joey baker into double figures now with 11 dare on sharp just too big and strong for henry coleman on that trip he is a stud man he had 16 and eight against clemson five offensive rebounds i think his best game he was really good against nc state but he had 25 points against notre dame he was a manchild against the irish great offensive rebounder very good passer as well baker has it knocked away by black carolina ball harris challenging johnson and its too strong and leaky black was first to the floor coleman comes down regathers scores and is going to the line as well henry colemans energy in this game has been a factor and hes come in his big body he has played hard hes run the floor good job of going up he couldnt complete the play off the lob but he went up with two hands and brought it down and then shot faked he and armando bacon played together in high school thats a pretty good front line coleman has played seven minutes tonight four points two rebounds and an assist johnson with a rebound on the miss and moore thought about it puts it on the deck good close out there by sharp johnson spins banks and hits one talented young player when jalen johnson puts it all together he can do it all he needs to improve that shot gets stronger and tougher and he has got a ton of talent sharp headed knocked away coleman involved in it and a foul is called on deyron sharp Applause jalen johnson on this last possession going head to head against garrison brooks and just backs him in a little bit and then turns away toward the basket just a quick move and able to kiss that off the glass that was really a nice play by jalen johnson he can do so many things but just hes still learning how to play in the half court Applause first time since february 27th 1960 that these two teams have met with neither of them ranked mike czeszewski was roy williams was nine the beatles werent even the beatles yet jay they were the silver beatles in 1960 ringo hadnt even met the other guys yet yeah deep best was the drummer back then and the single season home run record holder was still babe ruth it was still a season a year in change before roger mayers would break the record i mean 1960 is so long ago neither one of us was born yet first televised olympic olympics in north america i mean it really is remarkable 153 consecutive meetings between these two when at least one of them and usually both of them were ranked thats a big three by jalen johnson if he can knock shots like that down old wire almost forces the turnover and then johnson called for the reachin foul to take us to the under12 media timeout little run by duke sevenpoint lead for the heels whats up whats down in the acc well try to figure it out when we come back my family and i i dont think anybody could have predicted that wed be in this position virginia being at the top and florida state might have been predictable but not that we wouldnt the acc wouldnt have a team in the top 13 at this point in the season walker kessler cant get the follow to go but they keep working on the glass sharp will go to the line florida state and louisville are both on covet causes right now i think its the second pause for each program this year so thats why you can see theyve played fewer games the schedules will not be anywhere close to balanced for example duke and florida state their game was postponed if its not made up those two teams wont even play each other in the regular season really really odd but the whole years been odd more hoops coming your way send you down to the scc tennessee and kentucky from rupp john fulkerson terrific player one of what do they have they can throw five lefties out there fulkersons had a great year hes gotten better and better every year under rick barnes good job by leaky black oftentimes carolina will tip that back if they cant get it he just tipped it to himself and do fortunate to come away without having given up more matthew hurt who has not scored in this game until now as he lays it in and beating me to the punch i was just going to ask you what do they have to do or what does he have to do to get going maybe a shot fake and then andrew playtech trying to take a charge at the wrong angle or not not moving as hurt was moving good fake nikki black with a step in jumper theyre getting some offense out of him tonight black on the season averages six and a half hes got nine already tonight but whats amazing is leaky black is not known as a threepoint shooter i know he hit one earlier in the game but he lifts his eyebrows and duke defenders are leaving the floor off balance jalen johnson rebound sharp not the shot but a good good steal and bailed out by dk stewart and stewart the steal on the aaron pass there by sharp a little bit of a different lineup for north carolina you dont see this lineup in quite as much but when doubt go down to that guy brooks has had a good game but misses here yeah you think that garrison brooks would want to power that ball more toward the bucket rather than settle for a turnaround jumper fading away all of his ten coming early good catch in traffic by wendell moore but just a tough pass to be able to make and jalen johnson knocks it down from three again his second threepointer tonight came into the game having hitches four on the season he has he has been aggressive going against garrison brooks to take him out on the floor trying to make plays what a talented player he is you know again its a different kind of game nobodys in the building no fans neither team is ranked but both teams playing pretty well offensively its close its meaningful for both teams as sharp gets great position you know dont forget the bigger picture yeah theyre just trying to play better and and improve game by game but both of these teams need to put some wins together especially duke if theyre going to be thinking about the ncaa tournament just carolina getting the ball inside and garrison brooks looking opposite that allowed deron sharp to get right into the paint and duck in and really get a great seal Applause now when garrison breaks that watch garrison brooks has he has the ball here and then youre going to see sharp is going to go down into the post and get great position Applause bacon comes up with a steal Applause and brooks trying to get deep position got a mismatch with a roach on him but the pass is at his feet bacon picks it up and is fouled garrison brooks was trying to pick that ball up he knew if he could get he felt if he could get his mitts on it that was an easy bucket but the ball just rolled right over to armando bacon tough pass to make and a really nice job by jeremy roach of breaking contact to get around in front i mean that was a mismatch in size but roach fought and was able to deflect that just a little bit but still it turns into free throws for north carolina and jay just not much of a breather for the duke big guys whoever they are did he give it a moment bake hots got 12 sharps got 11 brooks has 10 they just keep coming at you theyre big theyre talented theyre big they are really big and hurt knocks down a three so after being scoreless for much of the night a two and then a three in the last couple of minutes for matthew hurt that can change the game because if he can stretch the floor a little bit that pulls those carolina big guys out away from the basket opens up passing lanes cutting lanes driving lanes off playtech itll be duke basketball doing a nice job of angling out andrew playtech so he couldnt turn that corner but just a really good pass by coleman and wide open for a step in three matthew hurt and now that hes seen the ball go through the basket a couple times hes got to be feeling a lot different about the game than he was earlier with that bagel that he had for a good part of it he is the second leading scorer in the acc behind only justin champagne of pittsburgh misses that three good look for love got it hes a different player in this game everythings completely under control for caleb love thats 18 now isnt it for him hes the high scorer in the game roach stumbling a little bit finds stewart you can see the the defensive potential that caleb love has when he gets down in the stands he can really move his feet and hes long brooks doing a nice job staying with hurt he finds goldwire and jordan goldwire knocks down a big three that was a huge shot by jordan goldwater and confidently pulled that trigger confidently pulled he is out there to defend and distribute 30 threepoint shooter on the season a big one there to make it a twopoint game again i thought the issue was neither one of these teams could could shoot from three brooks over the top baicot underneath the bucket good defense by coleman itll be carolina ball when we come back carolina duke going back and forth knocking down shot after shot in this game right now at cameron caleb love having maybe his best game of his freshman season with a gamehigh 18 jordan goldwire with a big answer for duke and its a twopoint game with less than seven minutes to go espns exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by h r block their experts can

midnight lets get it rivalry and college basketball and sometimes it doesnt even matter what the records are the cable shot of north carolina won that game the bloody nose for tyler hansbrough back in 2007 austin rivers at the dean dome with the gamewinner for duke the shoe game as its known a couple of years ago when zion williamson was injured in the opening moments of the game and then the overtime game last year in chapel hill trey jones brought him back wendell moore won it and as my partner jay billis says it always delivers its delivering pretty nicely tonight its a good game if youre just joining us stay with it if youve been with us you know its a good game already brooks off the inbounds too easy and carolina up by four with a chance to make it five well carolina just showing their interior strength its just hard to keep garrison brooks with the leverage that he gets just got a little back screen there wasnt a switch or anything he just overpowered matthew hurt and not only got the ball but able to get the foul and the bucket the carolinas missing a lot of free throws here and that foul on matthew hurd his fourth now hes made a couple of recent baskets he stays in the game they need his offense good cut by goldwire challenges brooks and somehow that ball rolls in its almost like he willed that thing and how did that climb into that bucket irwin walton hit three early threes thats his first one here in the second half boy that looks a little more like north carolina basketball that you expect duke scores on one end and carolina gets it up the floor quickly for a quick score on the other roach got the switch hard to believe this carolina team only put up 50 points on clemson 50 johnson with a fake and a kick more for three good look but he comes up empty boy really good help and recover defense by north carolina didnt quite get the scramble but they had a sense of urgency to make a stop on that possession little horn set two bigs up top bacon all over the glass cant finish cant save it itll be duke ball boy bake hats had so many opportunities inside that he hasnt been able to finish couple where he got caught underneath the basket wound up you know trying to take the really tough shot at that angle but that one just needed to be stronger to finish that that was a wide open opportunity jay how about duke 10 of 21 from three and how about carolina nine of 13 from threepoint range well for the most part theyre having the right guy shoot it and thats kerwin walton but leaky blacks hit a couple and youve seen caleb love hit a couple goldwire steps in the kick to johnson extra pass more and another three for the blue devils to get him back within two thats where the spread floor can be more difficult for north carolina those big guys have to move out on the perimeter just that dribble penetration you get a couple defenders and all of a sudden youre scrambling to try to get into the corner kerwin walton thats just too much distance to cover and it was all because of the penetration of jordan goldwire to get into the middle of the lane draw two that means somebodys open he found the open man being one delmar junior in the corner hey on tuesday theres some great acc action coming your way on the acc network first at 4 30 eastern time notre dame will be hebrew hammer the irish of the blue devils and then at 6 30 its syracuse they got shut down by clemson today held to 19 in the first half clemson to beating syracuse the orange will be in raleigh to take on nc state go to getaccncom for instant access it has not been a banner year for the acc we all know that right now joe linardis got six teams in including carolina as one of the last four buys did you see virginia the finish of virginia tech and miami today isaiah wong knocks down a three and then hunter couture i mean that was a big time finish to regulation virginia tech wound up winning that what a game yeah gutwrenching defeat for jim laranegas hurricanes playing without four players again so under man and juan hit the three with what 24 seconds left i think and then couture hit one of the buzzer to force overtime and mike youngs hokies get a nice win a tough win on the road and miami had two fouls to give when virginia tech had the ball but north carolina having yet another opportunity right near the rim anthony harris just couldnt hang on to the ball went out of bounds but carolines got to start finishing those easy easier opportunities nothings easy in this game but easier opportunities carolina led almost the entire way in the first half led by as many as 12 turn around by matthew hurt and this game is tied what a pretty shot by matthew hurt hes got such a great touch can knock it down from three and that turnaround jumper can be a real weapon because he doesnt have to go body to body against garrison brooks he can turn away from that and still put up that shot great defense by goldwire one of the best onball defenders youll see love maycon and a foul on the baseline Applause that foul is on matthew hurt jay and he has fouled out of the game with 4 15 to go yeah you can get a bucket back you just cant get a foul back and you really understand the sense of urgency but with four matthew hurt cant afford to foul out of this game but he has just didnt have the angle and when you dont have the angle youre going to have to try you know try to stay between him and the basket you cant pick up a basket there matthew hurt goes out of bounds and then comes back in here the referees miss that you cannot go out of bounds and be the first guy to touch it after you come back in thats a miss by the officiated crew so with hurt out joey baker comes in now baker can hit some shots he has been terrific off the bench tonight hes got three threes and 11 points but obviously when you lose the second leading scorer in the conference thats a loss so a really small lineup right now for duke especially with this much time 415 remaining in regulation tied 7777 you know its mindful of the game they had at louisville when matthew hurd fouled out you know it just takes away an offensive weapon and a threat that you have out on the floor Music as you mentioned caroline has been leaving some points on the line bacon does knock down the first and two of two even with those two makes the heels are still just six of 14 from the freethrow line dukes really going to have to spread the floor now spread and drive try to force help and then play drive and kick basketball hell have an open post because theres nobody in there to post Applause goldwire good cut and the slam by johnson to tie it again love wow a tough one he wanted the foul call he didnt get that but he gets the bucket and the heels are back on top isnt that his game dont you think dan just being more aggressive getting to the basket getting into the paint and then his jump shot will come a good defense by leaky black and a good strong rebound by brooks in traffic caleb love 20 points seven assists in this game now heres the horn set for north carolina and that time jordan goldwire did not go underneath baycod with a big advantage on baker inside and johnson had to come over and grab him and he did grab him by the arm you wonder if that is an intentional foul but got the match up on joey baker they went right at him and armando bacon able to get fouled 313 left in this one brandon boston junior and kentucky taking on tennessee next i love our adrenaline taste tom and jerry are coming to the beach if you wanted yeah jalen johnson grabs the arm right here he was not in position to make a play on the ball and didnt try to make a play on the ball just grabbed the arm of armando bacon and the officiating crew looked at it on replay and it appears that that theyre going to call it just incidental contact or just a regular foul on a shot not sure i understand sort of the reasoning behind that but now the focus is on armando baicot just knocking a free throw down and as you mentioned a little bit earlier i think dan north carolina struggled a bit from the line theyre six of 14 hes now made three in a row so seven for 15 but hes made three in a row 65 percent on the season of coming off a very quiet game against clemson is having a nice night tonight as it rattles home for his 16th point of the night well the game against clemson was an anomaly hes been very consistent and last year against duke he averaged 13 points 10 rebounds in the two ball games wide open baker and brooks just takes it away from moore what a rebound i mean talk about rebounding out of your area that was coming right to wendell moore and garrison brooks went after it with two hands and took it completely away from him thats a veteran rebound right there and what a respected player garrison brooks is not just in this league but anybody whos played against him in his four years second team all acc a year ago that ball is out of bounds and back to the blue devils well thats the kind of turnover just from over dribbling you know dribbling without going anywhere roy williams trying to get to his young team dont dont hang your head but what a great job by garrison brooks to go after that ball with both hands talk about snatching the ball that was big time got a carolina foul its on armando bake out it looked like trying to get through a screen that is just the third team foul this half on carolina so keep that in mind over the next couple of minutes it means that north carolina can be aggressive without concern for foul they dont want to give them away but good job by bait out there got the shot fake from baker and he didnt bite stay down again turn baker into a driver and its carolina ball pretty good job by armando baycod of moving his feet i think mike szyszewski thought that would be called a blocking foul but he continued to move his feet and kept his hands off of joey baker that was the the main thing was he played with his body not his hands and wound up getting the turnover baker out coleman back in for defense for duke and for carolinas they go on offense walton has taken the place of harris nice trap extra pass to love yes what a night for caleb love he has been outstanding and moore beats everybody down the floor for a quick two Applause like leaky black got lucky there you need to come back to the ball he was going toward his basket instead of back to the ball gotta cut that distance down look at him going away there and that almost gave an opportunity for jalen johnson to get that ball and take it the other way right now possession for north carolinas everything theyre up two possessions right now with a minute 30 to go Applause hes got to get rid of the ball hes going against goal wire thats a turnover waiting to happen and he does turn it over thats just not a good situation for north carolina to have caleb love trying to dribble against jordan goldwire goldwire the last three games hes averaged 35 minutes per game for duke and its not because hes going to score 20 a night hes going to distribute and hes going to defend like nobodys business yeah jordan goldwire is number one in the acc and steals and a great cut there by roach and its a one possession game north carolina this balls got to move just way too much dribbling by one guy and the timeout called by the heels jordan goldwire just a terrific job to deliver that little pocket pass on a corner back cut and again the weak side help just not there you got to be in the middle of the lane and playing the ball not playing your man goldwire with four assists and four steals in this game how about to keep duke in it still to come right after us tipping off in about eight minutes eve ponz another one of the endless number of lefties that rick barnes has at his disposal theyre not only lefthanded theyre really good theyre 11th in the nation and theyre at a rupp arena next here on espn was that like a lefthanded compliment well you had a chance really with leaky getting lucky to really go all alliteration that was a lot of alliteration from anxious analysts you know right now this is for north carolina they still got two big guys in there baycod and brooks this is about passing and catching set a good screen get open come to the ball and make sure you get possession of that thing black inbounds it to brooks and now they find love were all looking for love arent we well you know since we brought up the beatles before all you need is manager thats been the case tonight and a bump there by moore thatll be the 10th foul on duke so its two free throws the rest of the way for the heels caleb love a pretty good free throw shooter shoots about 77 from the line and with his athletic ability he should live there in his career you carolina obviously without the fans here but cameron this is not a typical duke carolina game but what a moment for caleb love to step up as a freshman and arguably play the best game of his season here his first time playing against no question we talked about being measured in your career by how you play in this matchup and he came to a fight in this one and right now carolina needs to be aggressive they cannot allow threes here if you have to give up a foul to keep from duke getting a three and they give up on roach wide open left it short moore runs it down takes it inside scores and hes fouled well you dont want to foul on a shot now that was a huge mistake by a very smart player leaky black now if you want to foul beforehand youve only got three team fouls thats fine but you do not want to foul on a shot give up free throws and a potential threepoint play allowed duke to set up full court pressure here now if youre going to foul dont let him complete it that was just not a not a smart play by a smart player wendell moore 83 on the season and it wont go down for him bacon almost had it stripped away by goldwire thats a big miss for a good freethrow shooter in moore duke can play this out and they can they need to be really aggressive here switching everything but whoever wins this game itll mean a lot given the ups and downs both programs have had this year lobbying to brooks brooks headed knocked away by johnson what great block by jalen johnson and stuart ahead of the pack to make it a onepoint game brooks needs to get it in and well call a timeout dan all of this has taken place in large measure because of that foul by leaky black north carolina had it right underneath the basket with an opportunity to get another bucket jalen johnson takes away that opportunity with a great block got that with the left hand and more importantly got control of the basketball and this is where hes so good is in the open floor and dj stewart running the floor and thats a terrific pass what a needle threaded and then stewart able to get that ball up and off the glass with armando bacon having a chance to block it what a great play by jalen johnson and stewart north carolina led most of the first half led by as many as 12 dukes last lead was in the first half the blue devils have not led for a single second here in the second half but they are back within one with 17 seconds to go now with an older team roy williams would probably look here to go long like he would not hesitate to throw this long with the younger team here im not sure he would take that risk but hes got his his best player inbounding it in garrison brooks into black surrounded and fouled duke trying to tie that up because theyve got the possession arrow did go long but that would not have been a smart pass Music and so the junior leaky black 68 free throw shooter on the season first time hes at the line tonight now with north carolina with only four fouls they got two fouls to give here so when the ball is inbounded i say when you get it near half court foul i dont know if roy williams wants to do that if he wants to allow duke opportunities to set up and without fouling coach williams just brought in harris and playtech on defense one of two in a twopoint game with 146 to go and roy williams will use his last timeout with carolina leading by two in the closing seconds remember the game in chapel hill last year trey jones leading an unbelievable comeback in the second half with duke he was incredible in this game missed the free throw got it back hit the shot forced overtime and then duke would win it in overtime in chapel hill a missed free throw again the balls run down again jones has it puts it up and wendell moore in the right place at the right time and until 94 feet with you today saying that was the biggest honor of his career you know usually you know in a career you might not see one play like that you see two of them in one game that was remarkable but right now dan that the two fouls that north carolina has to give theyve got four team fouls you shoot one and one on the seventh so they have two fouls to give thats the most important aspect of this game the key is i think theyre going to foul here but the key is how do you foul and where because you dont want to lunge and give duke an opportunity and get get yourself so sort of out of position but i say you put on some full court pressure here threequarter court dont let anybody get behind you but i think you have to give give those two fouls here so duke ball down by two remember matthew hurt has long since fouled out of the game so its moore roach steward goldwire and johnson for dude and theres the first of the two fouls to give see i would have let it go further you know you try to get you try to get something when theyre crossing half court before you foul because not that much time went off the clock there and then theyre going to put themselves in a position of of being near the one and one let him catch it and let him bring it up and then foul johnson driving on black gets by him and a travel is the call he came down with the ball and jaylen johnson called for a travel well really surprised that north carolina led wendell moore excuse me to the basket my mistake wendell moore on the drive and came down he did come down before he got rid of the basketball boy smart play there by caleb love went right into the restricted area and went to jump no timeouts for carolina they get it in to leaky black and again hell be going to the line carolina still has that one foul to give but if black is able to make both these free throws that makes it a two possession game and then i wouldnt give a foul lack of the line lets check in with kevin connors quickly and dad we want to let you know tennessee kentucky is underway on espn news crucial game for the cats one in five in their last six tennessee the number 11 team in the country will see it next year on espn right kevin thank you leaky black makes the first now comes the big one that would make it a twopossession game Applause leaky black has battled foul trouble made some really good plays in that this game and that one is huge fourpoint lead and the foul on goldwire before the shot you could see goldwire trying to get the shot attempt off so he would go to the line but before the shot so that is the sixth foul but thats the reason dan that that i wouldnt have wanted to foul there just because youre putting it into the officials hands now in the nba they see these things all the time you know if if goldwire is able to get into shooting motion or you dont get the foul off right away when you want to roach down with a rebound is love and north carolina comes into cameron and wins 9187 dropping the blue devils to the 500 mark of the season at seven and seven carolina goes to twelve and six with a hard fought high scoring game tonight here in durham for jay billis and our crew im dan shulman thanks for watching a lot more coming with dick vitale heres bob wishes and it run and welcome to rupp arena
