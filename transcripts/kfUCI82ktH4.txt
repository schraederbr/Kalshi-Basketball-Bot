against Duke down at Miami yeah they lost it a bit they did that against a great Duke team when Miami is really just trying to tread water at this point he lost on Tuesday 9760 to the Duke Blue Devils North Carolina 112 in the Smith Center and we are underway as Miami wins the opening tip and again just 2 and 15 in ACC play for Miami North Carolina at 11 and six up top here for Brandon Johnson letting fly and hell drill that he has started all 29 games thats not a bad start for Miami but this is the side of the floor thats been the biggest issue is is when they can defend they can compete a little bit more on the offensive end but defense has been a challenge OT Kad running the point although in recent games here like the 4 five you were talking about John RJ more of a floor General at times so got a downstairs for the stuff for lopin yeah and part of the reason being that they need to create better space on the floor not having a shooter out on the perimeter makes it challenge and among the starters from Miami number 99 Divine ugu chuku which is a fun name to say 63 freshman they will give it up for Johnson who just nailed that three Joe Bay the 67 sophomore from France with a shot clock winding down and that one tossed out of plane see its a fun name to say thats just cuz we have pronunciations in the the the notes yes otherwise were on our own and that could get very ugly the officials Roger SS Eric Lewis and Jamal Spearman here today and look at the Carolina starting five one guy who really makes a difference in there is Drake Pow with his tremendous athleticism man it can be freaky at time Davis launches the long one rebound tipped out High and a second chance for the T heers thats pal I mean its athleticism but its Just Energy he brings in energy where he creates second chance opportunities and Second Chance opportuni is going to give you an open floor and thats where Elliot Kau is at his best North Carolina to take on Virginia and blackburg next and then the second Clash with Duke on March 8 at 630 on ESPN a whistle and the foul ugu chuku little bit of an extension on ugu chuku but this is what Elliot kdo can do if he has an open floor there was a little extension you got to sell it a little bit Im just glad we didnt have an early stoppage in review dont kill Rhythm early let the game determine what how its going to be played I think thats something that has to be looked at when this season is over because should be reviewed two so please dont say that witherss launching and buries a triple I I agree with you because for coaches how you play is your best recruiter and a slow game will favor in my opinion the inferior team the inferior players are favored in a slow game so so dont have as many stoppages as we have lets keep things flowing and oh by way maybe well fit the twohour TV window they The Talented freshman with a long one coming that glances away second effort Jo B got to the rebound and heres Matthew Cleveland whos the star on the floor for Miami averaging 16 a game hes missed the last two games because of an ankle sprain nice touch there to drill the three Johnson he got it going early and now hes got confidence on the release and if youre going to have to dig down on Cleveland hes going to be open at the same time I think Carolina lives with that North Carolina getting 91 points a game during the winning streak heres Bea got a good look he couldnt bury that Withers with the rebound I think if theres anybody that its important he makes threes its Jaylen Withers cuz he could be a pick and pop guy at times he doesnt have to make a high percentage but he can move the defense particularly with the smaller lineup the Carolinas going to play with exactly right and he does shoot at a high percentage 46 Davis got it a threepointer for RJ the number three scorer in ACC history a lot of guys that can shoot 40 6 they shoot that because they allow it to come their way theyve got to develop more of an aggressiveness to seek it out the more you seek it out the more you get others open as Johnson lets another one go that aint going to work maybe feeling a little too good by the way the walk in the hallway for North Carolina out to the court is like the best there is I mean its like a top five hallway I would say I mean the Jukebox helps or boom box help Juke boox what am I in the 50s get some Elvis music going the the boom box is sweet its colorcoded the hallway is awesome look I grew up a Carolina fan unapologetically partially because my brother was a Duke fan and we argued about everything but I like my choice I just wasnt good enough to play here at high school greatest player of all time place here yeah heres Kad on the Baseline nice give there by Davis Cleveland got a hand on it its out off Miami so itll be North Carolina really easy for North Carolina today just dont slip up dont SLI dont slip up is it that easy yes its its that easy yes it is that easy because they figured it out and its been over the last four games thats we talked about a little in the open was ultimately the last four games theyve been able to score points theyve scored points theyre able to play faster the faster theyre able to play the more they maximize their smaller lineup I like the game you simplify it like that in their position right now you know on the bubble just got to take care of business Cleveland on the drive with the left hand no and a rebound comes right back to him its like what my mother said the first time I called a game on TV just dont screw up its that easy right North Carolina five baskets by the starters one each so Sharon the suger and now getting it down and into Jaylen Washington the 610 Jun for a bucket a good spacing allows you to get to that high low and I think Washington can play a significant role in this team I like when he and Withers are on the floor together but this again a smaller lengthy lineup Thea yes nice touch by The Freshman fivestar recruit out of Philadelphia hes got it its been hard to build anything with consistency given the challenges that Miamis faced all year but but hes got tremendous potential does this sizes it up and swishes it out a three he shot preparation if Im breaking down his his skill set its there shot preparation is something that he can improve and become a high level Pro if he can get his feet ready and really get a little Pace into that shot hell have better Rhythm and and get a higher percentage of shots off hes a cousin of Hubert Davis the head coach and a whistle and the active taking a shot and a foul here against North Carolina on top 1711 hey look you know we have the emms coming up but but here in Carolina they they do or they askcar excuse me they do the uh the ramies and there was an award just awarded for best pipes in the ACC the voting was close but it was further secured by your your eloquent one minute open this morning Dave OBrien the winner of of this award I was like where did you get that yeah I thought I was taking it home but is it solid goal yeah I think he took 12 car I dont know uh may see that on eBay later but thank you very much thats that is quite uh quite a phony honor Im really touched very deeply yeah there theres theres no name yet eded no name yet nothing yet again it was that that beautiful welcoming one minute open that you did that locked it down I had no idea Im not prepared Im not prepared but uh thanks Mom Davis trying to Dish right there at the foul line knocked around by Washington he hits the deck gets it three Jackson will drive it and score it and Jackson the quick freshman Caroline is actually really good with broken plays because broken plays tend to create a Scramble for the defense thats when theyre at their best the question is how as an offense can you create scrambles something theyve tried its really been a challenge for them to consistently do out of the corner Jo B theyre expecting a lot more from him kind of a step up in development this year Trimble on the drive airborne and hell be at the line to shoot twoo go look at this eyes at the back of your head you got to have sense you got to have a feel where everybodys at at all times its a really silly thing for me to say that that they may be at their best when theyre in a scramble but you got to continue to peel back the layers of that comment to understand theyre at their best when they can get a defense to chase them they have have four or five guys that can put the ball on the floor and make a play so create a scramble create a Chase play out of it less sets more play trembled to the line at 82 hes coming off 17 in Tallahassee on Monday in the win foued by Matthew Cleveland who picked up his first and North Carolina starting to feel comfortable here wish theyve done a lot in recent games and theyve already had eight players score at least one point thats what happens when you have Playmakers in Space the space affords you the opportunity to make a play The Playmakers see the opportunity and take it thats the part like you said you know just keep it going right sometimes the simplest way of viewing the game is the best way to view the game and when it gets tough and youre Carolina youre trying to play to make the inate tournament simplify it because your Playmakers will win the game Kyrie huy 69 a senior from Miami getting into the freay here Ill tell you what its weird to look across and and look at the Miami bench and not see coach L there Jim Lena one of the great coaches I thought in college basketball for a long time resigning one day after Christmas nice back move here by Cleveland well look its going to be really weird not seeing Leonard Hamilton its weird not seeing Tony Bennett Coach K Roy Williams oh yeah you know uh Mike Bray I mean you you Contin this Jim beim for crying out loud I mean you just go through the L in the ACC its almost time for a uh almost like a Rebrand if you were a company I mean all new coaches in this conference just a a historic conference too for college basketball got a good look he doesnt need a lot of room to get his shot off a tie up here will stay right here with 128 to go in the first half a disastrous season for Miami just two years removed from a cochampionship of the ACC and a magical run to the final four look at that Hall of Fame group of coaches its its hard to imagine when you think about that 5500 wins between that group tumbling nice Look Away held on to the basketball laid it in he has six you just think about what Miami could be if Nigel pack really hasnt played much at all this year Matthew Cleland tremendous credential that they lost North Shadow to the transfer portal or the free agency whatever you want to call it Im honest enough Im honest enough to call it what it is cant hit that on the run out chupu nice pass they kick it back outside to him Cleveland from threepoint land off the front iron May mentioned Nigel pack whos been out for now 17 consecutive games and youre not going to see him and thats one nice reminder from their final four team that they had at the top of the Season as you said only played a couple of games played well hurt last year too has been very very tough sleding for Miami no pain no gains coming up as we continue here in Chapel Hill our first game of the day on a Saturday youre worth something youre worth something because of the dedication of people like big house gates they helped grow this game to the point where it has the value that it has that that the game can actually pay you to play it you have to remember none of this exists without the people that came before us big house Gams was a big piece of that on the drive and the scoop and a strong move by Withers for two and he has five already I think of the Yankee Clipper s the barber when I think of great nicknames his big house hit you look Big Dogs another one that that kind of its just kind of humbly I dont have any good nicknames I think at one point they called me milk but I think it was derogatory uh it might have been glad youre not overthinking it though shorts out of the corner cant knock that one down rebound tapped and controlled by Carolina and they want to push the tempo with Jackson hes a onean fast break anyway but the layup wouldnt drop Cleveland no one picked him up and hell lay it in it looks like that ankles fine yeah he does seem okay hes able to get up and down the floor all right and I dont actually dont mind the game getting like this where its up and down but Carolina has to maintain polish cuz theyre playing for far more than just this win you have to continue to build upon what youve found over the last four games another turnover here gets Cleveland again another strong drive for two more and give him 10 points just wonder well yeah RJs coming back into the game youre going to bring RJ and Drake po back into the game good energy and stability last few possessions have been sloppy and defense has been a problem takes the hit made the shot and with 101 to go with Carolina adding to the lead 25 to 19 this is just they wide open a lot of pointing but no ones pointing at stopping the ball sometimes the simplest fundamentals are what allows you to to win at basketball right toughness is is a good thing I would say toughness is a fundamental of basketball but C man SE ball stop the basketball in transition theres never been a great team that hasnt done the simplest of things Joe Bay with a personal and Luben to the line hes coming off a solid 107 rebound effort at FSU on Monday and hes 67 foul shooter looking for a threepoint play and nails that for five points on the day I think if were going to add things rules like transfer portal and nil and all that stuff it should you should follow with the requirement that you have to take basketball history every single year you have to understand how much bigger this is than just you great Point Johnson who hit a three right out of the gate uuk move its a lot of iron he comes right back to the heels and they want to push it again RJ Davis who had 20 and five assists and zero turnovers on Monday night and hes really been more of a floor General in some of these Applause wins running the point right here fou on the attack lost the handle had it slapped away and hell draw the foul tell how hard Carolinas trying to work to to get space on the floor the problem is its taking him a little too long to find it huy with the foul the big Monday coming your way Wake Forest that is a gigantic game coming up a bad loss theyre at Duke and Kansas in Houston Monday night at 7 and n on ESPN so Carolina to put it in from the Baseline Elliot CAD Houston may play the best most unpleasant basketball in the history of college basketball Davis steps back almost launs to three on the dribble Drive using that window and it almost dropped but almost there but kicked out of play by the tar Hills ACC top nine du 16 and one then the Ville followed by Clem of course the only loss in conference play for Duke came at Clemson then SMU at 12 and five and for Carolina its its kind of a weird situation where you got to win but you also dont want to go into that fifth spot for the ACC tournament itd be nice to have an opportunity against Lille or Clemson stay in at six and Go Fifth and probably facing dke schs good shooter will knock that one home D averaging about Five Points a game they expected a little more from him this season because of his shooting range just saw Applause that heres Powell on the wing good knocked down a couple of Threes the other night and a good drive using that left hand you know he doesnt particularly want to shoot that but he is so good about just getting enough of an angle but crafty soft with the Finish Applause Johnson gives it up shot clock down to 10 Cleveland thought about a three a twopointer hell drill that he up to a great start today back in the line of 12 points hes got Shawn Livingston like release on his midrange game high release tough to contest and he makes a high percentage Boy tell you what when Withers gets going another triple give him eight 3124 what a difference that makes in this offense why doesnt he shoot more like he should be a focal point not because hes the best on the floor but his spacing will create so many opportunities for everybody else Johnson leading in gave it up Carolina locking him down RJ Davis with a difficult angle it almost Applause fell wuku got it no one picked him up and a threepointer and a timeout and Hubert Davis is upset this game pretty tight right now you were talking about the Staffing changes here saying the old model doesnt work not sustainable of amateur sports you have to adjust and adapt you have to do that with your own team but you also have to do that with your personnel and support staff this is where its going and itll likely lead to the NCA finding some sort of foundation for all these teams to function from if everybody starts the general manager role we have professionalized this sport The Next Step will be some sort of legislation or rules to allow everybody compete on the same playing field sort of shot clock to five Davis took a look steps back fires and Cleveland with the rebound so Miami hanging in there here in the first half because mainly Matthew Clevelands healthy enough to play Jo firing bring it up nobody home and they turn it over great possession and theres no rush there I mean thats where pivot foot drills still matter at this level you know youre youre in the middle of the paint here just pivot pivot oh youre wide open first off just pivot keep pivoting no dont throw it away youve got time thats a thats a key possession for a Miami team that thats fought to stay in this game five threes made by four different players good things are happening shot clock at four now for North Carolina kot to the paints that didnt touch anything its a shot clock violation back over to the hings for turnovers for North Carolina NBA Countdown coming up on Saturday Prime Time game ABC at ESPN plus step Jimmy Butler and the Warriors play the second game of a five game East Coast Swing in Philly coverage tipping off NBA Countdown at 800 Eastern 5 Pacific last possession Miami barely covered Todo and it flattened out the defense took all space out of the offense and also disrupts Rhythm they to pull a pop well Applause short P looking for a cutter Kad Kido on the dribble again on the Baseline a spinner there by Withers missed it but he draws the foul with Kau I think the idea for some guys is to create space I mean look at this amount of space Elliot CAU has theyre not really covering him and its a late clock situation where theyre basically saying go ahead take the shot if youre a smaller lineup you need space you need space to be able to keep your pace up if you dont have space you become a slow team if youre a slow small team good luck so Withers at the line making his sixth consecutive start today Withers and pow going into the lineup kind of tracks Carolinas winning ways as it lates I told you my lineup for Carolina is RJ Davis Withers Washington Ian Jackson and Drake po that is a high energy a fastpaced better defensive group and then you think of tremble and and kdo coming off the Applause bench everybody has their own little death squad lineup right the Warriors had it in their Heyday thats when Livingston would come in and just hit midrange igod doala was playing a big role in that I think Carolina has that its just hard because you have to use bodies if you do want to play with good Pace Tyson in the game now for Hubert Davis heres Beth McDonalds all americ gives it up for Jordan Johnson I should say hell miss fire there and Davis with the rebound North Carolina youre just kind of waiting for a run here to really take control of the game as Davis will back it out now back inside and a whistle as he goes tumbling into a cameraman its really hard what Carolinas facing though because the defense flattens theyre just not respecting the initial surge youve got to youve got to attack with an initial surge that gets the defense back to the Baseline and then retreating back out to the basketball then you can attack again its almost been like Carolina pushes it up almost like a fake transition then reverses the ball but that allows the defense to get set you want to avoid resets at all causes in any possible way avoid the reset continue to flow get a defense chasing keep them chasing and create opportunities Miami with the sixth foul as a team North Carolina with just one and you want RJ Davis at the line as many times as you can get 88 tied for first in the Applause ACC and exactly five minutes to go here in the first half 3427 thats so quiet in here its a great fan base some you you need the Blue Bloods to be be blue its good for college basketball p calot is also a special place Cleveland with 10 to get up a shot bodying up and Well Done against Trimble the high release is really tough to cover hes also got tremendous experience uses his body well hes had a big first half of 14 its the main reason that Miami is keeping Pace with Carol linon Davis came in eight points away from 2600 points in his Music career Trimble from the corner yes its a big shot you wonder if seeing that go down it it helps you seek it out with a little more confidence Cleveland again Trimble on the Move Davis has it knocked away in a clean steal by state McCrae hell kick it out heres Applause Johnson and Jaylen Washington ready to check in here for North Carolina Carolina lost a little momentum on that last possession and you got to feel the crowd and know how big the possession could be because of what it does in terms of bringing your crowd into the game yeah they want to explode clean block there by Schwarz heres tremble yes another trle thats my point right he makes that shot in the corner look at his shot preparation look at his footwork into that shot he actually sought out the shot with a little bit of sex ofver back at chapelo biggest lead of the day so far for North Carolina on top of Miami 40 to 29 tar Hills at 18 and 11 Miami at 6 and 22 now just hoping for a miracle today leveland has been the hot hand and theyre going to turn it over again sounds silly but this to me feels like an important position because if youre Carolina you want to be able to pull away and keep energy high in this contest and they havent really been able to build on some good possessions also like the line up on the floor as Tyson just stays as a spacer I dont care how many shots hes made or missed he will always bring defense his way dish downstairs looking for the dunk Washington defended well North Carolina thought they had an easy stop Applause 220 left in the first half Cleveland a 14point first half looking for more rebound plucked away up and in by Johnson so a couple of times in the first half it looked like North Carolina was ready to break fre only you see the canes come up with a couple of quick baskets they can do it again Cleveland on the the Run Tyson got back to Def F justs get out and go now Trimble he wants to push it every time Washington gave it up the swing for Davis Trimble again lost it Applause again Bea kicking out State McCrae the open shooter but no chasing down the high rebound Withers good hustle there on the drive no Tyson will take the hit hell draw the foul with 121 on the clock why have you just trying to create some opportunities on the offensive end I would play everything through Matthew Cleveland because everybodys eyeballs stay on him theres two guys on the ball now you elevate high point I think thats the term right High Point the basketball not an over the Applause back now be with the personal to put Tyson at the line the 67 Jr I had high hopes for Tyson there a guy shot 46 from three coming in here you think about the role Brady manic played once he really figured out how to maximize his role they became a final four team I me thats how good they were I mean thats how important this role is if you can put pick and pop guys out on the floor with an RJ Davis and an Elliot Kau youre going to open up the floor even more because any help has to take that second three Applause away tight with his second and that one rattles in so a 10point lead for the heels as they go for a fifth consecutive win you could call this Carolinas best stretch of basketball four of the eight best performances of the Season as far as offensive efficiency have come during this winning SC I think theres a sense of urgency tied to it as well I me early in the season you just say were going to figure it out right were going to figure it out it would take some time they had a tough schedule to start ton of quad One games they they didnt win a lot but but they they have this said well find it at some point the problem is the ACC hasnt given you a ton of opportunities for Quad one wins and yes while they found it now they have this extreme sense of urgency to make it to postseason North Carolina 1 and 10 in Quad ones on the boun that got to make a shot Drake P The Freshman he is gifted I just love his energy I I think sometimes we we get enamored with skill and potential and hype and all those other things but hey does he give you energy does he play hard does he communicate well he checks those boxes and thats why I love him yeah 13 assists one turnover in the last six games for him its incredible I dont think I made 13 passes in be way downt got an excellent look rebound comes to trimber Davis a threepointer coming got love it love it if you show a willingness to shoot quick hitters you put a pressure on the defense that makes you actually defend for a full 30 not this nonsense fake you know fake offense for 10 and then play for 20 good finish for Carolina the long one by Bea does not go with that shot with that make RJ Davis gets does he he does and that that high release on his midrange jump shot is so tough I I say like it was Shawn Livingston thats the guy I keep looking at him saying its like his game at the college level dont shy away from that twopoint shot formerly out of Florida State on the Baseline hu he tried to save it couldnt do it so back over to North Carolina he went to a scripted play they they actually got it just couldnt make the Applause pass again North Carolina during this winning streak of four straight is averaging ing about 91 points a game so theyre right on it and a quick strike underneath for Luben like that you know we we see your scripted play out of the halftime and well match well actually make the shot same thing from Caroline good execution you got the shot you wanted Cleveland averaging 16 points a game almost got that in the first half hell dump it downstairs for the strike and huy at 69 with the basket from my Miami Matthew Cleveland has to touch the ball in a threatening position every single time down floor probably my least favorite new favorite call in college basketball which is the moving screen anytime something gets bumed todays ACC Network mens basketball triple header NC State in Georgia Tech at 300 SMU squaring off against Stanford and we cap Theon night with Cooper flag and Duke hosting Florida State we were just in Tah cie on Monday and the last time well have a big Monday with Leonard Hamilton at the helm and one of the classiest head coaches youre going to find anywhere unquestionably unquestionably a lot of these guys really good for the game Leonard Hamilton one of them now theyre getting it down and into the basket courtesy alen early has nine I would also say Dont just look at Leonard Hamiltons success on on the outside like learn his story his story is is more fascinating than the outcomes raised here in North Carolina and a traveling violation so if the tournament got underway today our T price ACC mens basketball tournament heres the field you would have to think thats exactly what Carolina wants the problem is they need to continue winning if they do so they could slide up into that five spot at which point probably have to beat Duke I dont know man thats tough just you got to win games you got to play your best basketball and wherever you lie thats thats what you got to live with thats what NC State was thinking last year oh man how about that good with his stuff it opened up and he jammed it out that split that split just opened things wide up and and a little bird in my ear just told me in French Kad means gift that open Lane was quite the gift 5 233 the dish for Powell hell swing it good ball movement Withers didnt shoot it moving again and hes been the man early on they moved it really well that was good stuff and what happened they they got the defense to chase thats the issue Ive been saying you you you cant walk it up you cant allow reset you put the defense in a situation where they have to chase the play you get good Applause things by the way I hope it actually means G gift boy I hope so too kid belt producers not just messing with will take the hit and hell be off to the line hes been a oneman band here today for Miami heres the gift with the ball keep it look at the ball movement though look create a Chase look heres great Chase they converge two guys are on the ball keep it moving you get open looks keep the ball moving five passes what a smart decision by poell not to shoot it there but to find somebody more open Withers with the rebound 54 35 just feels like North Carolina in the process of putting the hammer down their biggest lead look at the flat defense this is something where youve got to find a way to get this defense to chase where theyre just playing flat in the zone theres an Airborne pass shot clock down to six he is having a second half Ben Allen Luben the 68 J I mean that thats going to be your best option if the defense is going to sit in that 32 Zone that way Matthew Cleveland wants to get a shot the air midrange well short Davis way ahead and a little too much for Applause Withers Clevelands open he cant drill it huy with the rebound up and Applause in Ling with eight points in the second half how with a misfire I love that shot though Dan apply pressure on the defense early by taking quick shots Johnson going strong to the paint it wont fall for him loose on the deck Johnson with really good hustle to free it huy with a onehander no rebound bouncing around and it comes to Davis North Carolina had one foul in the first half there are a number of reasons for that give me three they going to start with one they switch a lot and Miami doesnt do a ton offensively to create movement its a lot of one1 iso basketball man what a second half his 15 points I mean its its really simple I mean you kind of move it to get someone to play ISO ball theyre not really looking to get to the rim Matthew Cleveland whos your best playmaker shooting midrange jump shots not finishing at The Rim not going to get a lot at the free throw line North Carolina came through the hallway today and took to the floor looking very very comfortable and here in the second half even more so and underneath itll be Music johnon Luben getting it going well why is that here 32 Zone everybodys lifted hes in a true ISO situation no help no Dig Down Easy B schedule Johnson at the line for Miami knocks that down for threepoint play 5840 a goto guy for North Carolina here in the second half has been vanala Luben and 10 of the 12 scored by Carolina that come from him like to line up on the floor for Carolina tremble in the middle of this Zone playmaker create an ISO attack so strong ships out of that lane heres Jackson can hit the three to the tune of 40 shot clocked down to two got to get a shot in the air stumbled a bit and he drew the foul beyond that threepoint line all right this is going to sound like if he didnt stumble he would have gotten a clean elevation and he wouldnt have gotten fouled the stumble actually led to him getting fouled I just hope if we show it back Im not proven to be wrong but as a player I can tell you on defense youre playing this based on him yeah you want to see him Elevate now granted he jumped into him but youre elevating to contest the basketball Jackson didnt get off the floor uku with the foul and hell head to the bench 2025 NBA draft rankings and of course Cooper flag at the very top yeah hard to argue with that I think Dylan Harper and Ace Bailey are are tremendous talents but Cooper flag his ability to just move and manipulate the game has been remarkable I think Ian Jackson is actually pretty good value at 33 because hes merely scratching the surface in terms of his potential meanwhile the officials did go to the monitor very briefly which were thankful for just to make sure that was a three why are we thankful for that we like Pace thats right we like Pace Pace excitement fluidity yep flight Roger As made short we have that going today Jackson with four and trying to make it five and that one off the iron and a 20point lead here for the tar State McCrae with a pullup pop and knocks that down M Carolinas playing like the team we hoped they would be this year I I think reality set in at some point that okay theyre not a top 20 top maybe not even a top 25 team but they could be a really dangerous top 303 and that seems to be what theyve grown into finally Davis well short and Jackson almost picked it off but they McDonalds AllAmerican around it out very talented kid Pennsylvania Gatorade Player of the Year Miamis highest rated recruit ever and shredding the defense RJ Davis and where is that well why is he get that look at Ian Jackson in the corner theres theyre not going to help off of Ian Jackson he just denies the ball screen crosses over attacks open space and its an easy layup in transition need to see more of that at your Carolina be around the back Davis chasing him cant hit the shot tar Hills looking to add to their advantage under 13 minutes to go here at Chapel Hill and they throw it away schw will drive it and Jackson with the deflection State McCrae clean that up for two that was a pride block right you turn it over youve got to get back and just preserve your pride they made a bad mistake a careless one on the offensive side he gets the block you feel a little bit better Withers to get back in the game now for Hubert Davis that would help and it does help a lot Jackson get 40 out there at 23 against Alabama 27 at Notre Dame he can heat up if he cut as well with the urgency that Drake pal Cuts with hed be even better and some sometimes you got to look at what other players do really well and try to mimic that cuz that would help being and Jackson get more open looks Johnson off a nice fake will drive and Applause stuff biggest moment of the day for Miami as far as electricity 6546 and he has 13 Trimble going to that left hand draws the foul so strong talk about the pride block right you you make a bad mistake you got to come back and do something with it look this team is starting to find here it is theres a just a poor mistake line your steps up take it away Sav your pride Ian Jackson getting in the mix on the offensive end too theyre dangerous when hes hit that thats like we had we had the uh Stupid pet tricks at halftime they dont have to be stupid but I think Dave Letterman used to do the the stupid pet tricks the stupid human tricks Lov them now we just call it like xfactor uh Blues Brothers they dunked off each others back and that guy just nailed a pu from Full Court which that aint easy man Ill take today any day been a full day here in Chapel Hill schs going to pull up pop and knocks it down Carolina picks up pressure the first thing they do is give up transation three I always felt this Carolina team needed to be better picking up full pressure but its not just about getting a stop its about putting a pace on the game loose crosscourt Applause Jackson G looking in its just nothing there threw it away been a problem for the point guard hes up around 100 turnovers but but its talk about Rhythm and flow a lot basketball is jazz thing about jazz music is in a Long Jazz set the tempo never stops right the Rhythm never stops it it may transition from sacks to trumpet to piano back to the drums but it never stops theres been too much stop from Carolina at times and thats when the offense just thoughts you got to keep the music flowing Johnson with an open look maybe a little too open in transition Here Comes Jackson pushing the tempo no foul Miami got back well defensively and that ones going to be tipped by Luben out of play so itll be Miami ball some of the best plays youll see you could put them to music right you and its not about anything thats scripted its about what you feel how do you flow from one thing to the next how do you feel whos got the hot hand and how do you play to it all those things matter I mean the NBA has figured that out to a degree right those guys are such good players that they get a sense of who has the advantage on the floor and they find a way to get to it and they attack right in college its a little bit tougher but youve got to find ways to make enough music to get the scoring actions that allow you to expose vulnerabilities of the defense and then you get good looks do you make all those shots no its about about getting high percentage looks you make a great point about basketball setting it to music more than any other sport you can do that and playerss ability to improvise yes with the basketball without the ball go to a jazz lounge and youll know exactly what Im talking about where they play a 12minute set and it doesnt feel like any of them are playing scripted music right they just feel the strengths they feel the energy of the crowd and what the crowd wants you kind of play to that at times thats always the best basketball Jackson quick little fake hell drive it and score Jackson with Applause nine back out top for Johnson and an offensive foul by Brandon Johnson the 68 senior we dont see a lot of those and thank God for it right the block charge rule has been something that we properly fixed in this game used to drive me nuts where everybodys coming in for a layup or a dunk and somebody runs in and just stands there to quote take the charge is it a good play maybe but in the end we want more plays at The Rim thats good defense by being there early get o to the paint not short pass nothing there not there they dont have the space to make that play State McCrae wants a long one that barely glanced off the iron Applause big Monday coming your way Wake Forest against Duke and Cameron indor to start it then Kansas and number four Houston heres Jackson hell drive it again and lay it in hes really tough again I just think between he and Drake po youre seeing players that are merely scratching the surface the reason Reon why I say the college basketball I grew up with was better than the college basketball today is because wed see those two next year and and theyd be joined by other great talent think about Cooper flag K can nipple Isaiah Evans playing with the Boozer twins next year we were spoiled and we didnt know it it see next year and the year after that the year after that Jo B off the fake Thea lips and cant connect Miamis missed a lot of decent shots here in the second half you talk about the Miami program and what a disastrous year this is last year very tough too but 6 and 22 just two years after a final four appearance a foul here they lost their head coach they lost their best player and Nigel pack who hasnt played for you know 16 17 games because of a leg injury Bill Courtney taking over as the interim head coach going to hire a new guy to run the program but this was a great program yes not a good one they went to the Elite 8 they went to the final for in backto back years they its the fragility it points to the fragility of winning at a time when business can be done above players under review I mean we weve we have to adjust to the new world and the new world is still more like the wild west I mean look there are parts of the Oregon Trail where I thrived I took out of Buffalo then 2 seconds later you know your di area gets you like thats kind of what its become its this unstable playing field I think its hard to sustain success and this is what theyre taking a look at not that Im not wrong so to the monitor for an official review at 845 left and North Carolina with the sizeable lead K with that one H are they saying Kad grabb the shoulder he did a little bit the problem is the more we watch this in slow Modo the more you see it you just didnt see it in live time but lets see full speed whatw we got one right Carolina will be shooting two shots yeah thank you I mean look it its what happens in in real speed it just looks normal when you slow it down and go frame by frame it looks like he may have grabbed best call the thats Co day said you know you know shots and we got one right you should have said it would have been better if you just didnt review it yeah just trusted your conviction but I want to finish I want to finish that point though that you got to think of this the fragility of winning in todays game because we dont know what next year really looks like we dont know who were going to have we dont know whos going to come back we dont know what its going to take to get them to come back financially frankly thats where were at and I just think it is more like the wild less than anything else Johnson straight on drills it Johnson Brandon Johnson has 15 came in averaging eight so hes had a nice one here the 68 senior bit of a homecoming for him hes from Riley North Carolina withs pass never got there Joe Bay wants to keep on driving it Cleveland really quiet here in the second half Bea open look no jo B with the rebound Matthew Cleveland was huge in the first half give him two more and he has 18 you want to talk about smooth fluidity thats thats Matthew Cleveland times he probably needs to be more aggressive assertive and lets just call it selfish term I like to say calculated selfishness you got to understand how important you are and figure out how to be just selfish enough Trumble keeps on trucking almost made it but but hell be off to the line no easy assignment North Carolina to go to the line Seth tremble makes 82 Seth treble this is a guy that could really get rolling at 27 against Dayton 18 against Boston College then another valuable offensive weapon willll roll in number one and the fourth Carolina player in double fig today he has 10 hes the kind of guy when he recognizes he has a matchup he thats favorable to him he could be really dangerous cant make the second I didnt want to keep making my point cuz it got so quiet I get insecure when people can hear me Shy like that pick the right business Cleland 18point game chuku with a missfire re tapped around several times controlled by Johnson who started the game with a threepointer Schwarz is open and drills it hes a good shooter and hes an even better shooter when he takes good shots I think thats been the challenge with Miami on this little slide here this season like you kind of just shoot the shots that come your way as opposed to seeking out the shots you should look for Withers and ug Tru just dropped him theyre going to go take a look at this 651 to go itll be foul number four and they will examine this at the monitor he just dropped him to the deck previous players under review for a hostile act hostile act yeah were I mean can we is there another word beond hostile thats a little I mean thats a little extreme for college basketball hostile act can we just call not a play on the ball you know like no attempt whatsoever howd you get kicked out of the game I I committed a hostile what you do what you bring to the game nothing just I just grabbed the guy too hard very dramatic well in command of this one 7258 but its a flagrant should not take very long no its a flagrant yep I agree with the gentleman behind me it shouldnt be a long review lets lets not call it a hostile act B uuku the 63 freshman out of Sugarland Texas with the violation what was it hostility so this again it kind of goes to our earlier point at like i like to see everyone speed these up a little bit when you have the opportunity to do that when it is very painfully obvious heres my argument tell all the officials were going to give you 150 bucks less for this game and theyre going to give us the upgraded to a flager one heres my heres my recommendation give all these officials 150 bucks less give it to a fourth official whos reviewing everything over there it that way look you you can make your flights and get to the next game tomorrow cuz these officials work like every think day theyre really good ones here theyre really good ones they work every day hey lets simplify things the last thing we want to do is kill the Rhythm and flow of the game by reviewing everything we got a fourth official over there by the way if you blow a tire hes over there who can fill in here we go solved a lot of problems right there Obie Jaylen Washington and round it out or have the ball as well theres enough money to just pay the fourth official I like that idea so thats what hes going to be doing there yes now while were kind of waiting he can get to it very quickly quickly we got it no youre good lets go keep rhythm and flow up and youll see better Applause basketball Davis with a bounce for Powell North Carolinas moved the ball really well a lot of times today shot clock to three as Withers Falls away and misses like to see RS more involved thats the first shot in the entire second half for Applause Withers approaching six minutes to go in our first game of the day North Carolina cannot afford a slip up theres a long range shot by Schwarz itll clang away rebound tipped out reset of the shot clock he fired quickly he it to 20 cadal will race down the other end and the slam good followed by Withers a player down on the other end from Miami Paul I had a lengthy chat with the interim head coach Bill Courtney today before the game and your heart goes out to him because hes a very decent classy guy hes used to winning at Miami yeah alongside Jim Lena and those days just disappeared so quickly what a tough shot there by Cleveland who gets to 2 points I think Cleveland and Drake pal should just play oneonone for the whole offseason I think Drake pal would learn a ton and I think hell become a better Defender having to cover pullup jumpers Withers by the way 11 points 10 rebounds a double double for the Tar Heels and there goes Po and strong hell draw the foul I mean pal you look you got to you got to want the ball number one and then you got to be able to do something with it Matthew Cleveland understands look hes is going to take contact he going to get up and finish but I like on the other end Drake pal actually spaced out got low got a catch jab step hard got to the open spot of the floor and here hes earing the spot at the free throw line like it was a good good counter punch its an area he needs Improvement on that one looked pretty darn good but 59 for the year his dad played baseball in North Carolina his mom was a standout basketball player in high school who also attended North Carolina so Chapel Hill very much in the family they look really good on those its not an issue of mechanics its just finding Rhythm into your free throw shot like guys shoot a higher percentage from the floor if they have rhythm into the shot and theyre a metrics out there for it but ultimately just watching you know what Im talking about ni some turns and missed ugly with that Applause one North Carolina by 16 in the ball at the 5minute Mark Applause and K looking to make a Music move on the drive took a bump and laid it down when he has space like that hes really good when he doesnt have space like that thats where hes struggled thats where hes often turned the basketball over but a good Line open space attacked open space hard to defend that that is a highly intelligent fan base here in North Carolina they know the position that theyre in theyve got a win here today and they came out firing State McCrae with a basket theyve had the lead around 20 couple of times today you got to win but you also have to feel good about what youre building you know youre Youre Building towards the postseason here You got to feel good when you leave every Applause game can again a penetration got it off Luben will lay it in hes really been their number one guy in the second half he 17 points he gets a lot when someones able to get to the rim and bring a secondary Defender Luben just does a good job of kind of rooting his way in keeping Defenders that third Defender off his back Cleveland again yes a three and his big day continues 23 he missed the last two because of an ankle sprain and he has looked 100 Today telling somebody needs to sit him down and talk about what calculated selfishness is all about you almost had the responsibility to be calculatedly selfish pow he takes a shot before the basket chs had some tough fouls 66 North Carolina and there at the line GRE P The Freshman from Pittsburgh North Carolina who has started the last four including today for Hubert Davis and he will shoot again and becomes the sixth North Carolina player in double figures today as he gets to 10 I think the challenge for Carolina is is youve got to embody the team that youve eventually become right because the team weve seen over the last four now five games is a team that can compete at a pretty high level they finally figured out how to play with smaller lineups different rotations but youve got to embody that group and continue to build upon it with Davis and throws it away realize North Carolina has committed only five fouls all day that like hard to believe when you look at that I understand you got a lot of pick and pop bigs for Miami theyre really not pressing down low and youre switching a lot if your Carolina these turnovers are just too much Cleveland left it short Davis had a chance to save it but off his hands Carolina you look at those little things you go okay we can get away with that here but youre not going to get away with that against better competition and you need to be able to beat better competition if you want to play in March in the NCA tournament firmly on the bubble coming into play today Johnson way downtown and Davis gets to it North Carolina about 3 minutes away theyre improving to 122 here at the Smith Center this year and again they have Virginia Tech and blackburg next and then the second game against Duke on March 8 on ESPN at 630 heres Powell open in the corner yes sir thats pretty stuff I mean good ball movement the thing got into the paint back out east to west comes back to Drake pal again as as he continues to improve his shot preparation which is ultimately footwork hes going to get more looks and get more shots off 14 today Johnson again on the dribble up against Withers got low and lays it in at a foul two the sixth foul of the game for Carolina thats crazy now with two minutes to go in the game thatll put Johnson at the line he makes 70 17 points today its amazing to think that between both halves they still wouldnt be in the bonus thats wild now looking for threepoint play and does that 8569 they break that quickly for Withers having a guy like RJ Davis in that situation is its such a its such a treat because you can pass the ball in at the worst spot and trust him to make the right play but you wouldnt pass me the ball there I would turn it over Luben back for Davis Luben quite a presence in the second half tremble shot didnt get there but pow cleans it up quick jum too I do I like I wish I could watch the match up of Drake pal and Matthew Cleveland more thatd be fun its its just a good matchup you should hang out after the game Schwarz with a one hander short you dont have anywhere to go I have nowhere to be if thats what you want to do Ill be right next to you John chisen just got to convince them I think they have other things to do but Im a good salesman job one today for North Carolina was to take care of business and they did that against Miami Davis will launch one and swish in a triple 13 points today kind of a quiet offensive day but he did get to 2600 career points and I think hes doing a little more facilitating he hes managing the game a little bit more and I think thats important particularly when you have young Talent around you Matthew Cleveland what a dog man 26 for him but theyre tough shots man sha Livingston Jamal Crawford those guys they could just create off the bounce and get to the midrange hes got a little of that in him well North Carolina continues to roll this will be five consecutive wins theyre now 12 six in conference play with this W and 19 and 11 overall another clean up by V Allen Luben really a star in the second half give him 19 and now averaging about 91 points a game over the last five for Carolina and no basket there whistle before that was 73 to go 9271 North Carolina averaging about 91 points a game during this winning streak they get to 92 so far here today hes sending Hubert Davis home very happy along with the fans at Chapel Hill on this Saturday and itll be Johnson to the line senior from Raleigh and makes the first a 19point day for Brandon Johnson theres also the challenge of figuring out how you need to play on the defensive end to get the game played in terms of the tempo and Pace the way you need it to be played to be a 90o a game scoring team it doesnt mean youre perfect defensively if youre perfect defensively youre not going to be able to score 90 points game will be slow Carolina start to figure that out North Carolina sails to the win the final score here today 92 735 in a row so North Carolina next up Virginia Tech
