21 assists on 33 made baskets in that game and Fields had seven of those helpers officials tonight Roger SS Doug shs and Joe Lindsay and it will be Louisville controlling the opening tip Cardinals at four and five coming off a road loss to depal and possession number one results in a turnover starting lineups for Arkansas State Isaiah Nelson had a career high 7 last time out DeAndre Dominguez three double doubles in 10 games and the teams leading score Taran Todd will come off the bench right out of the gate a turnover for Louisville and went off that loss to the Paul on the road and they started off very sluggishly in that game Arkansas State opens the scoring it is Freddy Hicks starting lineups for louiso Mike James returning starter from last year had 18 last timeout JJ trainer still out with that shoulder and the Freshman Tyler Johnson making his first career start nice touch on the inside by the big man Brandon Huntley Hatfield got to get established some inside they have some a size Advantage at some spots up front they need to go low first Dominguez has his three batted out here comes Trey white he lost it another turnover by Louisville they do get it back Clark tries to save and throws it off Dominguez L on the season is minus 21 in assist to turnover ratio and that is a bad sign for a basketball team and its hard to develop that during the year youve got to find some sort of identity where you run things through your guards and the guards for Louisville have to be better at ball handing and Tim they play a red wolv team that only has eight turnovers in the last 60 minutes thats quite a thing because in now L their third turnover here in the first minute and a half their head coach Kenny Payne Al Louisville Alum he had some strong words for his team after the loss set to Paul he said it felt like we played for ourselves and not each other and thats a problem pays not going to mince any words you know he knows theres a lot of pressure on him to get this program back to where these fans want them to be and losing to depal on the road because this is a very poor dep team so far this season another turnover thats for the other way Freddy Hicks for the easy two and right now Louisville at home just sloppy in the opening two minutes and you saw Tyler Johnson look over at Kenny Payne do we need a timeout they do Applause not Johnson drops it off nice move by The Freshman to get it to Huntley Hatfield you dont need a timeout you were just in the locker room 5 minutes ago and you know come out ready to play and this is what Louisville has been problem as of late and they better be careful Arkansas state has a lot of energy theyre used to playing on the road and theyre playing with some confidence early they do not have an answer for Huntley Hatfield whos got all six for Louisville well thats just way too easy though hun he just post it up carved the space out on the box and no resistance from Louisville strong move Inside by Kaleb Fields fifth year senior and a 5year Applause starter Tyler Johnson The Freshman a top 100 player there is Talent on this roster theyve got a half dozen former ESPN 100 players a rebound to Dominguez har hot Fields got good post moves down low see if they can go through him but L does not run back on defense Isaiah Nelson makes them pay sky Clark 55 and black Louisvilles leading score at 17 a game theyll play through the post again theres the double Johnson has Clark in the corner against the trees Hunley Hatfield left it short and able to draw the foul and that is one thing Louisville does well get to the free throw line Brian Hodson the first tier head coach at Arkansas State he has followed Nate oats first at Buffalo then at Alabama known as one of the top Recruiters in the SEC while he was there played and coached in the JC ranks and looking to get this team to the NCAA tournament which has only happened once in program history back in 1999 hes still a good good job of getting this program more they need to go the Sun belts a very good conference as we know and James Madison ranked currently in the top 20 making their Mark but I think Arkansas States got a winner in Brian Hopson Here Comes Trey white the USC transfer batted around it comes to Dominguez 10 points 10 rebounds and the win against UAB over the Music weekend Music Arkansas state has hit four of its first seven lot of contct no foul Dominguez Catch and Release and the ball batted around it comes to Tyler Johnson Johnson from 15 and Tim those are the type of shots that Kenny Payne would rather not see he would rather see his offense get into the flow move the ball around didnt happen on that sequence 1532 to go first half Reds up to on the road Sofi is helping me get my money right to achieve my ambitions Karan Davis appears to have come to an end he was a junior college transfer who Louisville gave a scholarship to in the off season today the school first released a saying Davis intends to transfer now Davis was in attendance for the womens game earlier today and he refuted the schools assertion this was his statement said the fact an official statement was released giving false information is disheartening and sad and then about 90 minutes before the tip Louisville put out another statement saying that Davis was informed earlier that he had been dismissed from the mens basketball team the entire ordeal has been wrapped in multiple shrouds of mystery and it appears this is the end of the Kuran Davis Saga at Louisville well you dont want a cloud hanging over your program so when these things happen its best just to disconnect and move on and it seems like he was not with the program and it hurts as a coach because you know its a talented player but in in the long story of it it it can hurt your program if hes not on Music board Here Comes Trey white all Pack 12 freshman team a season ago at USC that was the team that made the NCAA tournament and again just more sloppiness from louison well its too much oneonone basketball too much dribbling one guy dribbling four guys watching and when that happens the defense just collaps on the dribbler and cuts off passing angles and then you have turnovers Kenny Payne telling us earlier today today this team has to buy into we not me as that time they left the back door open and Arkansas State makes them pay and Kenny pay is challenging his veterans the transfers with experience like Clark and white and then the holdovers guys like Mike James JJ trainer even though hes not in the lineup and is out with an Applause injury sometimes when you put new pieces together that fits and some sometimes like Oklahoma has done this year and sometimes it takes a while and Ken to be saying that here in mid December thats thats an issue the Mee over we Factor Mike James with the basket for Louisville Arkansas state does like to attack early in the shot clock now were below 10 Fields guarded by The Freshman Johnson picked up on the switch by okor for drives to the basket tipped up and the rebound by the big fella Emanuel okor for explosive First Step by Johnson and two free throws coming when youre overplayed youve got to take advantage and go back door and not enough ball pressure on the perimeter and perfect pass at The Music Applause Music Rim the foul is on Caleb fields Johnson and ESPN 100 recruit last time out against depal played 30 minutes 12 points five assists Kenny pay telling us this Freshman Class of Johnson Caleb Clen Curtis Williams maybe even Dennis Evans if he can get healthy he hopes they can become significant contributors once Louisville gets into conference play well Johnson is one guy that can come into the lineup and run the team and more efficiently than others hes got a decent assisted turnover ratio which pretty much every other player that gets significant minutes does not and there you see another issue for Lille just too easy 12 points in the paint for Arkansas state after the basket by Nelson Red Wolves 0 for five from threepoint land and again getting the basket the block by Applause white white pushing missed the layup the rebound to Avery bels you know its going to be fastpac Arkansas state is going to do that push it and watch it Caleb Fields the threepointer career 31 from three three seven of 14 on the young Music season Clark the Illinois transfer directing traffic a former top 30 recruit started 12 of Illinoiss first 13 games last year before leaving three doesnt go comes back to Clark New 20 field against a double team and he gets Two Shots well you know obviously thats thats their game theyre going to shoot it quick on that last Possession It was one pass and a shot they missed but Arkansas state has to be concerned because Louisville is a very good offensive rebounding team Caleb Fields just picked up his second foul another donation by the Cardinal charity strike partners and the game for the guards number 10 C Glen back in for Arkansas State thats him the one matchup Louisville seems to have early on in this game down low with Brandon Huntley Hatfield yeah he does a good job of moving without the ball they just sometimes they ignore him you know you come down and make one pass and take a contested shot I mean thats not getting your big man involved you got to put you have to put more pressure on the defense and make them work and take what the the defense gives you the one pass and a shot offense will not cut it theres Taran Todd six and red with the ball the leading score for Arkansas State open three front rim offensive rebound Nelson Felts is a sharpshooter Dominguez from the corner and he knocks down the triple Arkansas State started this game out in E by dribble driving to the rim getting pretty much whatever they wanted and then in transition they are going to push it and let it Music launch Sofi is helping me get my money right to acheve Arkansas State the heath subscribes to the analytics model which tells you a good shot is a three a shot in the paint or a free throw and one of the things that you have seen with aate this year Tim uh the vast increase in threepoint field goal attempts almost 45 of their shots or threes well this is Nate Os system and theres no doubt about it its been very very successful since he was at Buffalo and then went to Alabama so Brians going to stick with what he knows because thats been successful and this is what a lot of college coaches are doing these days I mean not only theyre trying to take that but theyre also taking that that away a lot of teams are gearing their defense of taking away the three taking away the shots at the rim and that giving you that contested midrange shot let me play devils advocate for a moment so defenses also know that they get Ken pal they get the advanced analytics as white will get the two on the goal is there something still to the midrange game well there is of course but uh we all know we learned this in first grade math in ISRO at least we did in Upstate New York where Brian grew up three beats to two every Music time here comes Todd the turnaround too much out of bounds it will stay with Arkansas State the NBA has has geared their game towards this as well I mean most NBA teams have average those somewhere between 30 and 43s attempted a game and I know the Celtics they dont mind taking 53s in a game so this is the way of the modern game but I still think you need a balance you got to defend the post right there Isaiah Nelson wide open just a lack of communication defensively for mov on that last possession just not matched up in the half Music Applause Music court Curtis Williams another freshman Music Applause misfires and that one goes off the foot of Freddy Hicks Aransas Arkansas States going to space the floor theyre going to move the ball quickly up the court but then theyre going to reverse it and you see see Louisville just not matching up on the backside at all lack of Music Applause Music communication this is Dono yovanovich the Miami transfer just his second Applause game Im sorry he played one game with Miami last year during the red shirt season a lefty Here Comes Freddy Hicks over to PHS and now aate throws it into the back court over and back Music Music Applause Aransas oh Music yovanovich swatted and Mike James is fouled itll be against Arkansas State this is a Louisville team that excels at getting to the free throw line they average 20 made free throws per game a forced issue here to the rim ands state does a good job of protecting but this is what Louisville does best hes hit the glass on the offensive end second foul on Music Music Nelson Williams puts it on the floor lot of dribbling now James got Dominguez in the air and hes able to draw the foul so Mike James former top 80 recruit a red shirt sophomore to shoot two free throws at the line for the car Mike James hell shoot two was the one thing Brian Hodson said he said got to keep him off the glass and off the free throw line Saturday get gear up its the start of full season weve got a college basketball quadruple header on acc Network couple of our featured matchups Vermont and Virginia Tech at 4 Eastern nor Eastern against 22nd ranked Virginia follows at 6 Applause Applause Eastern Fields playing with the two fouls over to Todd steps into a three and the rebound to Clark good possession defensively for Louisville that good pressure on the ball and a good contest Clark knocks down the 18footer theres the long start of the midrange game braws not happy his team kind of came back on their heels never got organized defensively Clark picking up fields near half court Ford driving into the paint and the rebound to Curtis Williams saw stay having some issues trying to finish in traic here comes James dips inside tipped Up Knocked Out of Bounds it stays with the Applause cards right now Arkansas States guards have to to try to get involved in the paint a little bit more on the glass because Louisvilles guards are doing a good job of keeping it Music alive Clark The Catch and shoot hes got four hes so hard to defend when hes coming off those screens cuz hes quick hes fast hes got that quick release 70 run for Louisville Hicks twisting inside for two grb transfer from Tarlton State KCK still trying to get up to speed with the speed of the Arkansas state offense but that was a nice move in the lane Williams looking for help nearly lost it Clark asking for the pick gets it from Huntley Hatfield now steps into a three too strong offensive rebound down to Applause Louisville now some good ball movement Williams from the wing Tim Kenny pay will take that just because that was probably the best movement weve seen all night from Louisville offensively they theyre trying to beat everybody off the dribble but that time it was with the pass they had the floor space they reversed it and got an open shot Clark this time trying to go solo loose ball and sky Clark right there on cleanup Duty sky Clark is everywhere on the offensive end for Louisville that time doing the dirty work on the floor Ford traveled will stpp aside Louisville has pulled even at 22 with 642 to go in the opening Music half Arkansas State comes into this this game looking for its first win against a power Conference Team since they beat Mississippi State back in 2014 almost 9 years ago to the date Louisville 30 all time against Arkansas State and thats him small victories if the Cardinals win today thats five wins on the season one more than they had last year during that forgettable 4 and 28 campaign well theyve had some close misses this year so to speak so they they have taken a step and I know the Louisville fans are not excited about that because thats the program is such high stature but when youre trying to build a program and take over sometimes you have to take small steps before you can take big ones and played well against Texas and Indiana early in the season decent Road game in Virginia Tech very disappointing though the game at the poll and you know this as a former coach coaching stability means so much and for essentially what seemed like forever this program had two coaches it went Denny Crum it went Rick patino since then there has been considerable turnover at the head coaching spot well Kenny Payne was highly regarded as assistant not only with John caliper but in the NBA and hes learned under some great ones he was a great player hes a winning player a winning person so uh I believe hes going to figure it out Im not sure its with this team though this team right now is theyre kind of scattered they dont really fit well maybe he can overcome that but when you need to overcome something like that when you dont fit well offensively youve got to get gritty on defense and right now theyre not very gritty on defense you look at what they lost eight players from last year they did bring back three starters and then brought in a talented freshman class and some impact transfers when you think of guys like Trey White and sky Clark those were two of the most coveted players in the portal sometimes though when you bring back starters three starters from a team that won four games thats not always a good so theres a reason you only won four games those guys are a big part of it unless you can change their attitude on trying to teach them how to be winning players they passed up on the three drop it off down low out of bounds Leo Lou shot was blocked one of those players who is a newcomer Curtis Williams out the basket at the other end for Music Louisville Fels takes almost all his shots from behind the ark Hicks pretzels inside over the trees offensive rebound its Lou oh good job by L and Hicks got all the way to the rim Lille did a good job of converging but then on the backside did not rotate down on the rebound yovanovich hands off to James from 15 back to Louisville the other piece of this Anish is because of the doldrums of the program theyve lost the homec court advantage that they had which was so great in this building and when you dont have that these sleepy December Nights against in a guarantee game against a team that is three and seven sometimes you need the fans to lift you up a little bit but thats not the case and Kenny Payne is been asked about that and his response has essentially been hey we got to win these fans back its been some tough times when this place rocks and you and I have both been there its as good an environment in college basketball as youll find absolutely and for years not only this building going back to Freedom Hall its its tremendous fan base one of the best in the country Music Applause Music Trey Whites got four Williams puts it on the deck off the window too strong offensive rebound and a foul and thats Huntley Hatfield hes had a nice first half with eight points and six rebounds hes active and I like that he moves and hes up on the glass when hes still hes they dont look to him enough he should get a few more touches just to you know get him in involved in the offense and present a threat maybe even go inside and then back outside for the open shot ACC PM with Mark Packer and Taylor tanom weekdays from Marks Charlotte Studio which is in his basement its at 4 Eastern theyll keep talking college football bowl season gets underway this Saturday well have the latest from around the ACC hoop season were getting close to the end of nonconference and League Play about to getting about to get started in Earnest here as we get toward the end of the month thats Packs basement next time Im in Charlotte I might have to go over and visit thats a pretty nice basement that hes got a nice setup hes got a good show too and keeps us all informed throughout the season ACC network has has a ton of great shows enjoyed it during the football season for sure and now into the hoop stuff and Arkansas State continues to play a lot of players they run in and out they wont try to run you up and down the floor and L Lille seems to have picked up the pace a little bit in the last five or six minutes and checking into the game for Arkansas laquil hardnet hes a stretch four cleared to play Buffalo transfer they feel he can bring another dimension to this offense its an Arkansas State team theyve dealt with some injuries this year guys like Obadiah Curtis and Malcolm farington both out for the year Caleb Fields missed a couple of games after suffering a concussion Terrence Ford was supposed to be a starting guard hes out theyre not sure when hell be back Bri Hudson absolutely likes Harman a lot this is this is how we play we need a good stretch four on the floor at all times Felts wanted the three its not there and they get the other three off the wing in Arkansas state with a twopoint lead in the final four minutes of the first half good offense that time and move a little late on to close out on the Music perimeter Caleb Fields now with 10 points Huntley Hatfield with 11 to lead all scores for Louisville James ran into a double team Clark Catch and Release not there Louisville over from threepoint range theyve missed all six Felts that three rims out Clark has the rebound good driving kick by Arkansas State for the open threepoint shooter cards cough it up right away white the block from behind and well get a foul on the floor before the shot AR Arkansas State wants to push the pace theyre going to get to the rim in transition if not they will take the Deep three with the early lead oh first half Arkansas State on the road leading Louisville the red wolves only have one win in 10 tries against current members of the ACC and that came back in 1953 when Florida state whos a current member was then an independent threepoint shooting in the spotlight today Tim Welsh Arkansas State came in making almost 10 per game Louisville pretty good defending the three neither team shot it well from three tonight no the defense has been pretty good especially by Arkansas State on the perimeter sometimes Louisville is a little impatient tries to take the quick three when they move the ball theyve had had open looks and Arkansas state has been trying to dribble drive to the rim quite a bit tonight against Louisville set set defense and theyve had some success its an Arkansas State team that has played a heavyweight schedule so far Wisconsin Iowa Music Alabama Clark has six contested jumper yovanovich the offensive Applause Music rebound is quick to the ball off the Music glass plus five on the boards Clark nearly turned it over hoists a three and the rebound loose underneath Arkansas State on the Baseline falling out of bounds Harden it his first game of the year now thats a frustration possession for Brian Hopson because his team has been playing very good defense on the first shot the problem has been on the glass Clark through the double team tried to split it and Arkansas state right now just cant hang on to the basketball again though that was a forced Opportunity by Clark just kind of put his head down with nowhere to go and just threw it up on the rim Kenny pays challenged to sky Clark hey we know youre a natural scorer for this team to take the next step we need you to facilitate we need you to lead and we need you to be more vocal theyll go to the monitor here they want to see if the ball hit the Music rim Louisville has missed its last seven shots and nine of the last 11 ball did not hit the rim so no shot clock reset heres Trey white off the inbounds and finally hardnet able to Corral the rebound another quick contested shot they had plenty of time to work the ball but again impatient Todd with an off balance shot at the other end Clark out of control yanovich down low got tied up and theyll call a foul youre seeing some of the rust to Tim with liqu Harden at making his first appearance of the Season yeah they need to get him some minutes so it was debated whether Brian hotson was going to play him tonight at all but I think he just wants to get him out there get him in some sort of Rhythm and get that rust off that you just spoke about yovanovich seeing some extended minutes so far in this first Music half that was the eighth team foul in Arkansas State Todd 0 for five he is Arkansas States leading score and still without a field Applause Music goal white with a nice bounce pass and Huntley Hatfield getting two more shots hes been the bright spot offensively and defensively for Louisville nice job running the ri running to the rim and that extra pass Louisville just makes that effort to make the extra pass they certainly have enough guys that can score Music a dozen points now for Huntley Hatfield in his second season with Louisville former five star who began his career at Tennessee one time Music in gets him both Applause Music one Music Applause minute pretty active on the set defensively doing a good job of pressuring the basketball rotating and communicating Felts catching shoot rebound to James White little hesitation Clark the Baseline Drive good ball movement comes back to James drive into the basket and one right there Anish thats the best backto back possessions from one end of the floor to the other that Louisville has had all night long on the off on the defensive end they were they played connected as one and then they pushed the ball up the court they didnt force the issue they reversed the ball twice drove it to the rim on opportunity Applause one Applause Music Applause Applause Music time a fields to try to dribble Drive in the Gap off the high screen Final 5 Seconds Fields with 10 lost it out of bounds it will stay with Arkansas State so these are your specialty plays now Baseline inbounds 14 seconds left Brian Hudson will take the use it or lose it timeout and so will we Sofi is helping me get my money right to achieve my ambitions want to see like saving for the ultimate tailgate setup soofi checking and savings I pay no account fees and earn a competitive apy Sofi can help you fund all your Ambitions no matter how big or small like investing in the athletes of Music tomorrow Anish R Tim wellsh coach these are the situations you practice Bas line inbounds not a lot of time left either on the game clock or the shot clock uh catch and shoot situation try to run some diversion weak side quick step out and then maybe a back screen to the rim Felts shot blocked it is Huntley Hatfield and Louisville goes into halftime with a twopoint lead thanks to Big 17 against UAB Tyler Johnson making his first start of his career top 100 freshman kicks to James battle for the rebound a won by Arkansas State they like to attack in the early offense if its Applause there Dominguez Nifty move too Music much hes got to make look to make that extra pass when he does dribble Drive in the paint and Louisville collapses there should be someone open on the perimeter Baseline Drive Johnson too strong Nelson cleans good move by Johnson just took his eye off the rim and again just right to the rim for Arkansas state with no resistance Daren Ford he was an Arkansas transfer twotime Arkansas Gatorade Player of the Year and a former top 100 recruit this is what Arkansas state to begin the game in nich they they just spread the floor and off the bounce went right by Louisville and then the extra pass pass for the throw down Nelson just picked up his third Music foul lot of standing around hutley Hatfield from the Baseline the rebound comes to fields and his man fell down heres white the other way numbers for Louisville white all away and lays it in were tied at 33 good job by white just the presence of mind to see that Arkansas state was kind of jogging back after that quick Music turnover Nelson comes out to set the high screen Fields doesnt want it instead the drive and hes fouled by Johnson and thats three on the Freshman Johnson is pressuring the ball probably a little bit too tightly on the outside Fields is the veteran senior Johnsons the freshman and kind overplayed right at the midcourt line it Fields just got an angle and got all the way to the r Fields a 59 free throw shooter this season 71 for his career Aransas State one Curtis Willams back in for the Music Cs Brian Hudson told us how valuable Caleb Fields is his team and you see it tonight he is runs the show gets everyone involved but when he needs to go get a bucket he finds a way to get to the ring and when we asked him about the way his offense played against UAB he said that was our offense with a point guard and that point guard guard is Fields as we get another foul on Arkansas State its Lou and thats his third at the line for the Cs Hunley Hatfield hell shoot two that was a good road wi for Arkansas State over UAB and they feel like they can compete in their conference you know once they get everybody on board and healthy so the Sun Belt is some quality teams of James Madison and apple State yeah and the reality for Brian Hudson is its likely a one bid league so why not beef up your nonconference schedule find out what your team is made of play against the best so you are better equipped for league play because again in all likelihood its going to come down to the conference tournament it is but theres got to be a balance there as well because of the fact that you you dont want to play too many of them and then you get that kind of that that feeling that we cant compete and that kind of can trickle into the conference play if youre not careful so theres got to be some sort of balance where you find some games that you can be competitive in and then of course you go on the road and play Power five schools like Louisville got to sprinkle in a few directional states dont you absolutely because the bottom line too is at the end of the day youre fans your supporters your Administration theyre look at your record and theyre not going to remember who you who you beat youre going to look at how many you wanton looking at the monitor to see if there was a shot clock issue Dominguez green lights it tap back it comes to fields on the low block thats Freddy Hicks going to work and he gets rewarded with two shots Freddy Hicks is an Energizer for Arkansas state that rebound forced his way to the rim and hes able to get the free throw last year in a game against Belmont he set the single game D1 record with 28 free throw attempts Music hard hat work if you were coaching against him you would have been double technical and been out of there by the 12minute mark of the second half its uh Brian Aon says hes disputing a couple fouls himself two one Harden it you ever coached in a game where the opposing player got every call No but coaching a game where the other opposing team got every call or or so I felt well you spent some time on the bench with beheim so we weve all seen his expression anytime a foul is called on his team well we did go to Ruckers one night when we were at Providence and the second half free throw attempts were 272 and uh kind of felt like that wasnt fair but you know it didnt it didnt matter what I felt well have you seen Tommy DeVitos agent ruter is in New Jersey Im just Im just saying Tim there might have been more there yeah you know you never know Tommy deito what a story youre a jersey guy Im a jersey guy I just go down I want to go down to a Giants game just to go to the tailgate his family puts on that looked pretty pretty tasty but well talk about that another time little pressure Now by Applause Louisville Hicks thought about the three instead finds the open Man Down Low its Hardman open wide open there was no one within 5T of him and hes standing right next to the rim and Moville just again the lack of communication and rotation on the pick and roll who is that on its on all the players because obviously theyve been taught how to defend the pick and roll I mean if youre going to double the pick and roll somebody has to rotate down and doubling the middle pick and roll is very difficult especially if Arkansas state is spread out like they are terrific move by white swooping to the rim Music again in the paint again the two for the red wolves getting inside at will well theyre doing what Brian Hudson wants mov taking away the three but theyre not guarding the ball at all theyre just not in a stance and Arkansas States getting all the way to the rim and then a tough contested shot for white who wanted a foul Arkansas States largest lead of the game was Seven Fields the basket the foul and a chance to extend to seven with the free throw well Arkansas state has found something and theyre going to keep going the well until Louisville State the veteran point guard making plays for himself off the bounce defending the ball at the top making open shots running the team hes been one of the main reasons that Arkansas state has this lead playing with a lot of confidence for Brian Applause Hudson thats your Savvy floor General a fiveyear starter a fifth year senior guy who can score and Dish and hes done a little bit of both tonight 14 points five assists and out of bounds this last touch Lou so Arkansas state with a field goal here would take its largest lead of the Music game Hicks they are taking the ball to the basket with no regard right now well Louisvilles not forcing it to one side or another theyre playing everybody straight straight up no ones in Good Help position and theyre not moving their feet off the bounce largest lead of the game for the redwolves white contested it comes to Music Hicks theres the three and Arkansas state with a double digigit lead Freddy Hicks from the outside its 49 38 Red Wolves looking for their first Power five win in some state where he played for Billy Gillespie his dad the late Freddy Hicks senior played on the 1999 Arkansas State team that went to the NCAA tournament only redwolves team in program history to do so and dad still holds the school record for blocked shots and Hicks tonight 14 points six of 11 from the field Arkansas state with an 11point lead on the road against Louisville Music well hes adjusted well Brian hoton said hes you still trying to get comfortable in this system because its obviously a different system than they played at tarlington State morille you know set offense and pull it out run plays and you can see Arkansas State they dont pull it out much they attack and tonight he is playing at that high level of speed and Pace Ty Lord Johnson in there with the three fouls Dr to the rib gets the two and that snaps a 90 run by the redwolves I think Kenny Paynes trying to get him more minutes if he can just adjust defensively but his defense hasnt been that horrible hes just fouling a little bit too much but he does do a good job of running the team Fields guarded by The Freshman veteran and Applause greenhorn down the lane Hicks again a game high 16 for the junior nice job by Hicks just sliding into the lane and Arkansas State making that extra pass if Ral overh helps theres Johnson off balance with a nice balance hes very good off the dribble and natural point guard what which Louisville desperately needs Ford using the shot fake they are attacking the paint they do it again again Dominguez denied good rotation on that possession by white and white gets tripped by Ford number three Dar is first Music 16b thats him for Louisville a path back into this game is the free throw line it is its the free throw line and the offensive glass but theyve got to play a lot better defense in the half court one more foul Arkansas state would pick up at seventh and put Louisville in the bonus Clark rejected three on two for Arkansas State ahead of the pack the tip is there on by Dominguez on the second try the tip the rtip and AR saw State running at one speed Louisville running at half speed coming back on defense Here Comes Johnson trying to be a spark plug white its off the hands of Huntley Hatfield eighth turnover for Louisville well you talked about Louisville getting back in this game but youve got to play with some desperation youre down 11 points on your home court to a team thats three and seven and and that last possession give them three shots at the basket before you saw any black jerseys get back into the picture to help out three not there neither team has shot it well from Deep Arkansas State four of 18 Louisville 0 for nine not even looking for a three James looking down low its knocked out of bounds Clark using the shot fake passes out of the double team 15 to shoot white the dribble drive he gets that one but Tim thats kind of been the story for Louisville it seems one guy trying to be the hero instead of moving the ball and making the extra pass well that will never work against ACC defenses thats for sure Whites very talented that was a very good move but but everyones got to get involved and you see it in their assisted turnover ratio its just not good enough meanwhile everything falling for Arkansas State a chance for a threepoint play the red wolves they track Blue Collar points theyve got a hard hat more on that when we come Music back the like wow four blue collar points in the first half he had 15 in the second half thats big time Arkansas State hands out the hard hat award and it goes to the player who racks up the most Blue Collar points in a game what are blue collar points well different point values for deflections steals blocks rebounds loose balls if you draw a charge that counts as four points I like it I like it a lot you know you know back in the day we used to give out a few uh I dont know MMs or something if if you had the most charges or di on the floor but its a good system you know anything to motivate your players I like what Brian hodsons doing a lot I mean hes going to hes going to get this program back up towards the top of the sunbell in no time I I like this team too if they can get healthy this team can compete in the top part of the sunb yeah for a while they were playing with only eight scholar players starting to get some reinforcements Caleb Fields obviously the big one laquil hardnet has made his debut tonight as Johnson misses the jumper and right now Louisville you look at what theyve done offensively in this case stats tell the story 16 made baskets only three assists Fields the drive and kick this is ball movement Felts back iron tipped into the the air Another Second Chance for the red wolves well the red wolves have started cleaned up their glass too and thats been important because thats how Louisville stayed in the game in the first half they got up on the offensive glast but right now the defense has been an issue Hicks three rims out Arkansas State plus 12 in points in the paint they have been driving at The Rim almost at will in this second half and Huntley Hatfield thats two or three times now in this half hes had trouble securing the basketball yeah it was a little tight in there the pass was a little behind him its tough for that big guy to catch that ball in traffic off the bouns but at least theyre trying to get him involved Hicks Dominguez doubled and theyll call a jump Applause ball Applause possession arrow to Louisville Kenny pay just lot of subbing just trying to find that right combination that can get them back in this game and its kind of what he faced when they were at the Paul just came out with no real intensity on defense and tried to find that right unit down the stretch but they got back in the game but it was too late but just the fourth assist of the night for Louisville its Huntley Hatfield whos got 16 Tyler Johnson with the Applause helper Arkansas State up 10 on the road against Louisville and the ball handler Taran Todd the teams leading scorer without a point tonight 0 for six from the Music field Fels working on the taller Clark gives it up to Dominguez shot clock down to Applause five tough shot in traffic offensive rebound Nelson put back is there 13 for Isaiah Nelson Isaiah Nelson is a bouncy forward hes very active in the paint and on the glass and right now Arkansas States pretty much doing anything they want Trey white the pull Music up Louisville has only attempted one threepointer in the second half they have not hit one tonight 0 for nine Dominguez sweeps in Applause uncontested Arkansas state with its largest lead of the game Sofi is helping me get my money right to achieve my ambitions with Sofi checking and savings I pay no account fees and earn a competitive Music apy Im Sarah estrich and the Life Enrichment director at Independence Village our goal with Tik Tok was to enrich the lives of our residents I mean were the ones that are being entertained time goes fast when youre having fun Tim maybe the most shocking stat tonight point points in the paint Arkansas State a team from the Sun Belt that was 3 and seven entering play theyre plus 16 in that department well its pretty obvious what whats happening is that they spaced the court theyre reversing the ball and then theyre going and theyre going oneonone its just basically Ive got the ball try to guard me and theyre not guarding theyre not guarding the basketball and then theres no rotation or sense of urgency on the backside to even put somebody on the plow line just layup after layup against a set fivan half court defense Johnson blocked by Nelson meanwhile Louisville trying to go ISO trying to go one on Arkansas State the difference is is that Arkansas States going oneonone too after some ball movement and player movement but then theres no rotation you watching the ball rotation here Dominguez defended by James shot clock at four long three front rim battle for the board it comes to Huntley Hatfield his 10th rebound Clark kicks it out to James no pass on the three and James will have a chance at the three The oldfashioned Way Louisville trims the deficit to 12 James with a chance to get it C and it is number 14 Notre Dame winners of seven straight going up against Purdue at the joy Center and Hannah Hidalgo setting college basketball on fire in the early part of the Season just a freshman averaging 24 points per game six steals per game she scored 20 or more in all but one game so far at 31 in her first Collegiate game which oh by the way Tim was against National Power South Carolina well Id have the fever too watching her play theres no doubt about it you love that defense that on ball off the ball and uh dont see that in any level six steals per game in one game against NJIT 12 steals in one game meanwhile Mike James now has cut it to 11 with the free throw now in into a two3 Zone see how they react to that how the shifts are nice pass Dominguez out to PHS Tim you saw how Arkansas State attack that it was textbook you get the ball into the painted area kick it out make a decision quickly Clark out of control turns it over here come the redwolves lets see if they shoot before that zone sets up no theyll pull it back Dominguez the drive the Music Applause kick in the painted area no the flush by Nelson the back side of that zone just collapsed and got in got into the middle into the teeth put it up on the rim and then nobody rotated down on the on the rebound 15 points for Nelson too shy of a career high he set in his last game Huntley Hatfield against the double team and he gets fouled its on Dominguez his third you see the Zone here its kind of spread out but nobody rotates down you see Clark is late on the backside to put any pressure on the Music offense thats actually the fourth foul on Dominguez seven points 10 rebounds to the Junior from Providence Rhode Island a UMass transfer and Huntley Hatfield has been busy his 11th free throw of the night is good hes made nine 16 points to go along with 11 rebounds Applause Music Applause tonight four guard lineup in there for Arkansas State they lead by Music Applause 11 back in the manto man trying to put a little pressure on the perimeter and all the way to the rim again the points in the paint tilted heavily toward Arkansas State plus Music 16 and Tim the lack of a threepoint shot the lack of even a read of a threepoint attempt youve got Arkansas State sagging their defense in so when Louisville tries to drive theres a lot of congestion on the other end the red wolves hit from the outside and the lead is 16 with less than six to Music Applause play well again this has been the story the entire second half I thought Louisville had kind of cured what was ailing them at the beginning of the game they just werent they didnt come out with any defensive intensity to start this game Arkansas state was comfortable and then the second half they just totally have not played any defense in the half court Louisville led by two at halftime Arkansas state has its largest lead of the game theyre shooting 53 from the field in the second half and Caleb Fields has done it hes scored and hes handed out eight assists well hes played hard hes played the right way he can run the team he can make shots on the outside he rarely forces the issue hes a good on ball Defender and in the last seven or eight minutes he is been very very aggressive to the rim because Louisville is just letting him dribble drive from the top of the key all the way to the rack if youre Kenny Payne whats the message after this game where again a team that does not have the same level of talent that you do a team that was again three and seven they play in the Sun Belt with all due respect and theyre essentially driving right at you at will getting to the rim and a lot of these baskets have been uncontested what do you say if youre Kenny pay its its lack of characters theyre not theyre not playing hard thats all playing and simple I mean you can have off shooting nights you can have a night where you dont make a three uh maybe they not that skilled offensively as a passing team you see that they dont have really great Shooters so theyre going to they have to find a way to get the ball to the rim but they need more player movement more ball movement you see even on this possession poor spacing on the weak side luckily theyve tried to go into Huntley half field and hes delivered for them but theyve ignored they ignore him on too many possessions but the issue is down on the other end you cannot let just a guard from 25 ft away against a set defense drive from the outside the threepoint line and get right to the rim with zero resistance and thats been the issue and it hasnt just happened one time or a few times its happened numerous times 20 Points 11 rebounds for Brandon Huntley Hatfield Louisville picks up full Music court needs to try anything trap gamble get the foul on the sidelines Johnson his Tyler Johnson picks up foul number four he fouled out last time out against depal Curtis Williams guarding Fields another Blow by and another chance at a threepoint Applause play Caleb Fields has been a man we remember this night he wont have a lot of nights like this where he just can go from 20 F feet away and get all the way to the rim with zero Applause Music resistance again not even trying the three Johnson throws it up the rebounded by Nelson well Louisville to your point Anish has become very predictable on the offensive end pretty much whoever gets it on the first or second pass can put their head down and go to the rim theyre not trying to drive and kick at all and arusa state smartly has adjusted their defense and they send the second and third Defender to to the paint on the drive to pres prevent any open looks shot clock down to one and thats a shot clock violation and thats been the difference with Arkansas State even when they are driving to the basket you brought up the point earlier they do it after moving the ball and getting guys moving defensively so those lanes open up absolutely its its basketball oneone move the ball move the players then attack Williams three not there Louisville 0 for 10 from three they have made at least one three in 271 consecutive games Todd completely uncontested again well this is embarrassing for Louisville I mean this is really you theyre not even trying on defense right now its just theyre not organized Arkansas State just runs the ball down the court whoever gets it after the second or third pass puts their head down and gets all the way to the rim Louisville does not have a field goal in almost 4 minutes for the game only four assists coupled with nine turnovers last year was forgettable 4 and 28 one of the worst seasons by any ACC team ever and it was the fewest wins for Louisville since they went 2 and 14 back in the 1940 1941 season year two brought some more hope you brought in some talented freshman top 100 players impact transfers like sky Clark and Trey white yes JJ trainer is out today and they do miss him he was a game time decision with a shoulder injury but theres no way around being down 18 to a team from the Sun Belt whos 3 and seven with 341 Music left Sofi is helping me get my 71 53 and that is not a typo with 341 to go bourbon consumption might be high in Louisville tonight Cardinals also without a threepoint field goal the last time that happened you got to go back to 2015 and whats shocking Tim Welsh is when you look at Louisville through the first nine games yeah theyre four and five and theres a loss to Chattanooga in there but they almost beat Texas should have won that game they were right there with Indiana they played well on the road Virginia Tech came up a little short in blackburg last time out the depal game that was not as close as the final score leads you to believe and then today you mentioned it just a lack of effort on the defensive side poor shot selection on the offensive side they were taking the ball to the basket without really getting other players involved and then the last few possessions desperation time just hoisting up that threepoint shots well just getting beat as they are and again right there on that possession just one oneonone basketball not moving their feet not playing angles uh basically ignoring the defensive end of Music Applause Music floor Taran Todd is out at the free throw line he was scoreless in the first half hes Arkansas States leading score one for eight but he gets both free throws on his fourth School in Five Seasons having the best year of his career started at TCU then New Mexico Junior College before ending up in Jonesboro amazing thing anus Louisville had a twopoint lead at halftime in they came out of the locker room just with no enthusiasm and no real game plan defensively and they keep the threepoint streak alive as Tyler Johnson gets Louisvilles first triple Now 1 for 13 from downtown I know for Louisville fans this is a bitter pill to swallow there have been a lot of low points the last couple couple of Seasons but in year two of the Kenny Payne regime to lose at home again to a 3 and 17 from the Sun Belt it just feels like a gut punch to where you thought this team might be headed at year two after some of those competitive losses that we talked about right and obviously you come off of an ACC loss on the road thats nothing to be embarrassed about you go to depal and lose to a really poor depal team though that then you youve got some issues and obviously trainers not not here but is he really the Difference Maker is he going to get out there and be the gritty guy on the defensive end of the floor Im not sure and thats where their issue is the shot selection number one and the ability just to care about defense Tyler Johnson fouls out finishes with eight points and listen theyre going to have to do some soul searching here you got pepper and then you got the game against Kentucky which is going to be nationally televised on ESPN well thats the those are the issues its its not that simple because if youve got a group of guys that arent committed to play the right way then you then youve got to do more than soul searching youve got to find a way to find that fire find that special group maybe tighten it up maybe not play as many players uh but give Arkansas straight State Credit you know they came in here theyre very confident coming off that win over UAB theyre starting to get healthy theyve got a very good young upand cominging coach who has a different style a style thats hard to play against and they came in and stuck to their game plan and now theyre being rewarded because they just took it to Louisville from the getg go they were not afraid to come into this building tonight and attack Clark turned away by Nelson OK cor four Nelson had it it went out of bounds off Fields 1ov number 23 Zan Payne comes in he is the son of head coach Kenny Payne tenant black MAV number seven Music both teams emptying their bench a little Music bit yanovich throws it up Cor for drops it in well I like the young guard Johnson looks like he can be a keeper for Kenny Payne obviously Hunter Huntley Hatfield has the ability but you know sky Clark and Mike James veteran players Trey white been around a little bit theyve got to be the guys that step step up and be voal leaders and and be upset about you know the coaches are upset about it but do the players are they upset are they willing to grind it out and do the extra to get you over the top but this is a disappointing night the looking at one of the Freshman there Caleb Glenn the inbounder final 30 seconds Arkansas State about to knock off Louisville by double digits as hery Miller hits the Jay and again the final score even if Louisville gets this know right around 12 or 10 whatever it ends up being doesnt really tell the story of how Arkansas State just landed Haymaker after Haymaker on this Cardinals team in the second half Louisville led by two at the break Arkansas State shot 51 from the field after halftime the red wolves score 4
