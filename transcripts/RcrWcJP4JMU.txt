Music yeah pat driscoll built covington ted valentine with the ones conferring and it looks like itll just be carolina ball on the baseline with four on the shot clock live into the paint its a turnover and here comes barnes on the breakaway and thats a pretty good first shot attempt for the knolls and scottie barnes making an impact early in the game and you see the level of energy and effort that he brings to this florida state team and coach hames talked about the fact that bringing him off the bench you get instant energy when he checks in the game normally a couple minutes in and scottie barnes making a difference on his first possession in the game already and here comes the six eight 260 pound point forward gray blocked by bacon at the other end love tried to throw it down yeah got to check on caleb love of course i love the attack but he took a hard fall on that possession got to keep an eye on him theyre checking to see if that should have been reset to a 30 second as opposed to a 20 second because the rebound carried all the way to the back court but watch the fall as caleb love comes down and you see his head go to the ground that was my concern but caleb has great hair so of course a lot of cushion right there to protect himself and he stays in the game but i like his aggressiveness i like the way he attacked and of course you know he and scottie barnes good friends of course both these guys playing in the nike eyeball against each other caleb for the brad bill elite scotty for the night riders so they have a lot of familiarity between the two of them and we talked about scotty playing against north carolina for the first time in his career he missed the game in tallahassee earlier this season so im sure this is one that hes gotten himself hyped up to be able to participate in and its another turnover caleb loves just not recognizing where he was on the floor catching the basketball and taking a retreat step away from the trap right into the backcourt gives it back to florida state who although they havent gotten many shot attempts in this game within one possession early an opportunity to tie it up or take a lead on this possession yeah the only bucket so far for the knolls a dunk by that man now give barnes four points and were tied at five and you see the energy already scottie barnes picking up full court and one thing for certain and again doug ive been fortunate to get to know all these young men pretty well scotty barnes as well as caleb love two of the top three in voting for the acc rookie of the year which im assuming will happen in my opinion scotty barnes at the top of the list right now but caleb loved recognizing hey this opportunity for me to go up against the guy everybodys talking about being rookie of the year scottie barnes also recognizing going up against caleb love who was one of the top projected point guards in this years upcoming nba draft these both these guys having a battle here early and corey theres the florida state resume that is really really good first place in the acc looking at a potential backtoback regular season titling conference bpi good net good strength of schedule solid and the bottom line is they just keep moving and trending in the right direction corey well these are the new bloods w fresh you know all about a coin by our guy wise talking young florida state they are the new bloods not the blue blood so when you consider what theyre doing they feel like they have an opportunity not only to win but to be able to dominate acc competition over the next few years when you look at this we got a chance to see coach young and now we look at north carolinas bench and right now as a 10 seed a projected tennessee by our guy joe linardi with the bpi of 32 strength at 38 but you look at the quad 12 records for north carolina 77 over the year but north carolina with some tough losses especially when you consider the loss to marquette early this week that could hurt them down the road yeah the marquette game has been a big topic of conversation along tobacco road because they lost in coach williams as you would expect him to do after the game fields all the questions and and uh just you know tried to explain as best he could hey i didnt know we were going to lose that game and uh if i did we wouldnt have taken it but thats behind them now theyve got to refocus on this opponent and an opportunity to take down the 11th ranked team in the country but if they lose joe linardi says they would drop onto the bubble but not out of the field of 68 lets take a look at who was made of moore brought to you by guinness coach williams sitting on 900 career wins corey well he would be the bestest if hes able to get a win today he would get to 900 right now sitting at 899 an opportunity for him to get to 900 becoming only the fourth coach in mens basketball history to reach that 900 number and it would also put him two behind bobby knight so right now roy williams tracking in a great direction as far as his personal pursuit of the best in college basketball however right now he wants his team playing better down the stretch 15 years at kansas ever since at his alma mater theres the top five coach k bayheim calhoun coach knight and roy williams would win his 900th with a win here today Applause there is the 2007 nate smith hall of famer 70 years old from asheville north carolina this carolina team was ranked in the ap top 25 the first five weeks of this season but they have been fighting to get back there all year long big opportunity here today and really the issue for north carolina has been inconsistency you know we had north carolina a week ago beat louisville by 45 points here on this court and we felt as though you know they had turned the corner they were playing very good basketball so the surprise loss to marquette earlier in the week Applause jason thank you we are at the dd smith center in chapel hill north carolina 11th ranked florida state and north carolina offense has been a bit of a struggle so far both ways more turnovers than field goals you havent missed much as coach williams looks for his 900th career victory here today florida state who shoots 50 percent in acc play from the field struggling thus far both these teams dealing with turnover issues but florida state turned it over their first three possessions of the game they sit with three turnovers since then north carolina with four turnovers already part of the reason why we see two teams that love to put points on the board sitting at five at five to five after five minutes of play which is a low scoring affair to both these teams like kerwin walton now one of four from beyond the arc caleb love has carolinas other two points raequan gray into the lane for two and a nice play there nice patience by raquan grey hes really the guy that steadies this team when you think about what florida state does and what they do so well its rayquan gray whos been the quick consistent guy that comes out and gives leonard hamiltons team that performance on a nightly basis theyve had to play without mj walker at times and had to play without scottie barnes but raquan gray has been the guy started every game thus far for leonard hamilton this year and you see the nice move on the interior to give the knowles the lead for the first time in this game and rayquan gray is really filling the valuable leadership role that we saw last year in trent forest who by the way is in the nba with the utah jazz now and coach hamilton in our visit last night talked about how valuable that is and the way his game has grown rayquan gray went from a red shirt to not getting a ton of mints to now in his fourth year in the program one of the real leaders for fsu one of the things weve talked about a lot today though you know off camera was the vision for this program for leonard hamilton and thats one of the things that hes seen and hes shown it in select players he was telling me during raqquan grays redshirt year watch out this young man can do it all hes going to be really really good for us and now you see three years later he is a point forward making beautiful finds across court too polite whos able to knock down the three but that just shows you the level of versatility that rayquan gray has the ability to be able to play any position one through five for the knowles last six games raequan gray averaging 16 points and nearly 10 rebounds a night rj davis off the bench misfires as you saw carolina made its first two shots of this ball game and has not made one since you see raquan gray rejecting the screen and roll but look at the vision to be able to find polite in the opposite corner and more importantly delivering the pass right into the shooters pocket much to the delight of the seminoles bench and mr polite is just part of a tremendous perimeter shooting florida state team he is at 48 percent on the year Applause plenty of room on that left wing misfiring and once again this is a staple of florida state whoever gets it can push it oftentimes its not the five man but one through four they rebounded they initiate offenses not waiting around looking for a point guard everyone can push the basketball but leonard hamilton expects also for those guys to be play makers not only looking for themselves but trying to help them teammates be successful yeah coach hamilton says i only have one position i have a center and then four interchangeable parts around them its a great philosophy and its a philosophy thats been very successful especially when you consider the last six plus years in the acc you know leonard hamiltons team went through a tremendous change as far as their identity and how they were going to play when he got dwayne bacon and malik beasley in the same recruiting class as xavier vertan maze as his point guard they started playing differently and again this is not the same style of play that he used to win the 2012 acc tournament you know this is a we now use 13 possible guys in any particular game and everyone comes in with the responsibility of producing and hes already won acc coach of the year three times in his career and he could be heading for a fourth this year after having lost three players three starters all now in the nba including a couple of lottery picks and yet still this program has not skipped a beat north carolina has a score in the last 5 20 of this game and still another opportunity that doesnt go down as they got out to a 50 lead but since then its been all florida state as theyve gotten settled and a lot of that had to do with scottie barnes checking into the game calhoun gives it to gray locked by walker kessler andrew playtek and anthony harris off the carolina bench they go high low into deron sharp over the double team note kessler crashes the glass and kessler making a difference on both ends of the floor the blocked shot on one end the offensive rebound put back on the other end of the four walker kessler has continued to improve on a daily basis for north carolina getting more significant minutes and becoming more of a factor for the heels pass stolen away by the seminoles and thatll take us to break when we come back why some consider seminoles head coach leonard hamilton the jackie robinson of college basketball Music Music a beautiful afternoon here in orlando florida that is all about speed some of the fastest dogs in the country ready to go headtohead over the next couple of hours in the akcs fastest dogs usa presented by tractor supply and were glad youre with us carolyn mano and bill ellis with you from the akc if youre new to this welcome this is something thats a little bit new for us hopefully some new viewers at home we can explain how much fun were about to have but think of this essentially as a 100 yard dash and weve got some of the best pro athletes in the country here ready to show us their stuff more than 100 breeds represented thats right carolyn its the 100 yard dash for dogs its all about speed athleticism weve got the top dogs in the country well see some real athletes so this is broken down into two divisions and ill have you explain just a little bit more bill of what were essentially looking at and well begin with our first division here which is the speed of the breed thats right so speed of the breed is an opportunity for all dogs no matter their shape or size to compete on a level playing field and then well have our pure speed division which is an opportunity for the fastest dogs in the country to battle it out so well look at the top five from the speed of the breed and also the fastest dog as we head to our first break here gonna be a mental and physical grind for the competitors here today were gonna see who ends up in the pictures the christmas cards the pictures of the families et cetera to where he knows that he has been a blessing to the young man hes had an opportunity to coach because he feels as though he has been so very blessed in his own life and again leonard hamiltons legacy will not be about wins and losses will be about the fruit that has been more from his program there you see what hes done developing nba players there are now eight former seminoles currently on nba rosters thats the most in programmed history including the three off of last years team he has built this program to the point where not only does it contend in one of the best conferences in college basketball every single year but theyve produced nba players and he does it not just with one and dunns corey he has guys in this program for three and four and five years and largely helps to develop them yeah we look at that list of the draft picks but the two guys not on the list of draft picks would you consider terence mann and trent forbes those are the guys that really exemplify what florida state has been about the most guys who have developed in the program but also come in fit in and been a part of the culture that has been a winning culture especially when you consider the last you know nine ten years at florida state and there is plenty of nba potential on this team as well the current seminoles with a 147 lead they have defensively clamped down on the tar heels today of course scottie barnes is first and foremost on that list a projected lottery pick this year and we will have nba draft expert mike schmidt uh espn join us in the second half to talk about where he stands but uh hes not the only nba prospect on the seminoles roster man hes not the only nba prospect on this floor north carolina has a number in itself but right now they cant get any of them going when you consider north carolinas three for 15 from the floor with seven turnovers already and im sure thats a much needed bucket from rj davis who scored 16 points in the first matchup between these two teams and right now trying to figure out a way to get them going to scottie barnes who missed that game against north carolina because of a turned ankle is walking off the floor once again favoring what seems to be his ankle after him getting off to a very good start we have to keep an eye on that as this game moves forward because hes a very important piece to what the seminoles do walker the alley coach ravitza with the dunk but doug once you what you mentioned earlier florida state does not have one guy in any of the top statistical categories in the acc but everyone gets it done so if scottie barnes going down they have a number of guys that can make plays like mj walker finding coke visa on the break for the alleyoop to build the lead to six once again for the seminoles and right now you look at boston corporabisa you mentioned you know scotty barnes is not the only nba prospect on this florida state roster cobra visa could be a very good nba player when you look at what nba biggs have to do in todays game he does it right now hes outguarding whoever comes his direction whether its a switch whether its guarding the pick and roll whatever it may be he can step up and defend and thats what nba bigs have to be able to do in todays game hes a guy out of mombert academy who was clearly not the first or second or even third or fourth option on his team but thats the kind of talent they have at mont bird and he seems to understand that hes going to come to florida state work on his game and progress hes not going to play 35 minutes a game and i find it remarkable that coach hamilton and his staff are able to identify players who come to tallahassee and seem to understand that right from the start and thats thats how coach ham recruits thats one of the things that he understands its not about how many stars are beside your name he made it clear to us he hasnt looked at what the scouts send out in the rankings for probably six to seven years its solely about do you fit what we are trying to do at florida state can you switch pick and rolls can you step out there as a seven footer and challenge that point guard trying to beat you to the basket and more importantly are you willing to play selfless and not sell fish and help this team win with that being the priority goprovita kicks to the wing for polite davis back the other way for the tar heels who trailed by four despite having gone at one point nearly six minutes without a point and just a heads up play by mj walker recognizing that rj davis never even knew he was behind him but florida state returns the favor turns the basketball back over leaky black trying to go end to end and i believe he was fouled by raquan evans cory ive noticed something about leaky black you cant say his name without saying both first and last names its so much fun to say leaky black right no one ever just calls him black you love saying leaky black but if when i talk to him i call him leaky i dont say hey leaky black i just say leaky its such a fun name again his middle name is malik and his grandmother called him leaky right from the start so thats why its leaky i think its one of the most fun names of all time to say but you think its only fun if you say both no no no im just saying you never hear him you say barnes you say evans you say gray but you never just say black its it seems like doing it a disservice if you dont say leaky every time i will agree with you on that one i i have never heard you refer to him as black youve only said leaky black but when you say black and the north carolina uniform then you got to go back and think about it you see im saying so of course you can put leaky in that category right now hes had a good career but he definitely has not been timmy black he is the one and only leaky black theres the touch outside for raquan gray the one and only rayquan gray and when you think about florida state and its versatility they only have one guy that can do what dequan grey does it is simply bought him and of course you know they have two requirements so well just call him turk from here on out offensive foul against bacon the senior mj walker mcdonalds allamerican stepping over making the play recognizing that has the opportunity to take the charge but i can tell you right now when you look at that play it seems as though his right heel was on that restricted arc and you do have fans in the stands right now to allow the officials to know that they may have missed that cause armando baycott now with two fouls has to sit with eight minutes in but that replay we saw im not sure that mj got completely outside of the arc and i find it soothing to hear real live booze coming out of the stands ive got to be honest by the way its good to see scotty barnes back on the floor for florida state after going out with some sort of what appeared to be an ankle injury meanwhile armando baycot sits with two personal fouls at the free throw line rayquan gray acc player of the week named on february 15th after his careerhigh 24 points 12 rebounds in the overtime win against wake forest and when you see you look at the right foot and that right foot looks clearly on the restricted arm and if youre not 100 outside of that that is supposed to be a blocking call and its a big call simply because armando baicot now will most likely sit the remaining eight minutes of this first half on the bench as knocked out of bounds carolina will keep Applause you know and the reason why thats such a big foul for bacon armando bacon averages 134 points in north carolinas 14 wins in their eight losses he averages eight points per game he has been a big difference maker in their wins in comparison to their losses and right now zero points for him and most likely gonna have to sit the remainder of this first half thats a challenge for north carolina especially when you think about the strength of their team is what they do up front with the four big guys bucket by scottie barnes makes it a 97 lead 7 35 remaining first half at the d e smith center dougie fresh im sure you saw the graphic that our great producers and directors just flashed on the screen right now that florida state has 14 points already off of 11 north carolina turnovers and when you consider that thats the reason why they hold a ninepoint lead when we come back more history on the line for the great roy williams espns exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by five hour energy shots the official sponsor of getting it done liam carolina fans theyre not that dumb if they are i got no answers for them with corey alexander im doug sherman and we just love as so many folks do listening to roy williams even if hes filling up the swear jar with the money dropping a couple of god almightys in one sentence he is just a joy and a pleasure to listen to well let me ask you this doug has anyone ever told you that theres no such thing as a stupid question oh yeah yeah they lied to you because that was a stupid question so when you when you consider the fact that okay any time that you play a game right theres a chance that you can lose all right so to ask someone if you knew you were going to lose would you have scheduled this game how i mean again that one right there i i am not shocked nor surprised that that roy had to get up and leave the press conference at that point but again you really dont have an answer for that question and you know no disrespect to whomever asked in that but again that was uh thats one of those questions that you probably could have left at home i got a question for you as carolina gets to miss and caleb love tries to get the carolina offense going heres walton for three left it short brooks with the rebound so carolina in this crazy season two weeks ago on short notice played northeastern and beat the huskies last week they scheduled marquette on short notice loss to the golden eagles they have a few days in the middle of next week where they could schedule another nonconference and corey do you think they might do that again im going to go with the no i believe that they have gone they have scheduled all they need to schedule at this point now is going to be about working on their individual team one of the things about roy just told hey guys would rather play games than practice but i believe that carolina has a lot to work on which i think they can use the week to be able to get over the hump on a lot of those issues Applause coming up next on espn in the app duke faces off with louisville at cameron indoor and its a big 12 battle at the fog as number two baylor takes on 17th ranked kansas fascinating acc double header here with us followed by is duke going to continue to surge in the right direction and we really dont know corey coming off of their second long covid pause what louisville team were going to see tonight well yeah i had the opportunity to call the last two louisville games you and i had them in you know in chapel hill a week ago and then seeing them earlier in the week on tuesday night and you know it was a different louisville team but the way duke is playing right now with mark williams as their defensive anchor at the center position jeremy roach dj stewart doing a much better job of handling the basketball and now matthew hurt going back to playing acc player of the year caliber basketball this is a different duke basketball team that weve seen you know so its going to be interesting to see how louisville handles that test because theyre eight miles away from where they went through the you know saturday massacre a week ago where they got beat by 45 points on this court Applause i do think there are parallels between duke and carolina in that theyre highly touted freshman guards have continued to play better as the seasons gone on and therefore not surprisingly both teams are playing better and in the mix for an ncaa tournament fit Applause and so much has been made not just about duke and carolina but for all of the teams that rely so heavily on young players because of the strange offseason and the shortened preseason and then the stopandstart nature of it teams like carolina and duke have certainly taken longer to get their freshmen going Applause and here is the latest by the way joe linardi said he woke up in the middle of the night last night kind of in a cold sweat to update some of this to get michigan state into the field and also to move doof to his first four out it is a new look its a nonstop process cory from moment to moment it changes it really is but when you look at that i also like seeing georgia tech there i believe that josh bashas done a great job this season with his team and now they are also on that bubble and a big matchup coming later this week for them against the blue devils in atlanta and an opportunity for georgia tech or duke to do a have an opportunity to solidify themselves on that board yeah the yellow jackets improved to 138 with their win over syracuse earlier this afternoon and the yellow jackets have a long list of good teams theyve beaten this year doug when these two teams got together in january it was a much closer game and we mentioned that scotty barnes did not play mj walker also was injured in that game missed about a four minute stretch came back and made a number of big threes but that was a close game right now florida state is looking like theyre coming in here and trying to put carolina away and put them away early now north carolina has helped them with that effort 13 turnovers already for north carolina consider that theyre only shooting 211 percent from the field so its not as though north carolina has played well to help themselves in that cause but give florida state credit for coming in and getting it done on the road because this is where theyve really struggled in acc play over the last two seasons has been on the road theyve got losses at clemson and at georgia tech on this season alone but they seem to be a much more focused group coming into chapel hill today yeah its been 11 years since florida state won a game in chapel hill trying to change that trend here today the lead is back to 12 open look from the left wing a little strong for davis 4 30 remaining in the first half we are just 15 days away from selection sunday traveling violation against calhoun Applause and we just saw this stat earlier today for carolina which i found surprising and it is quite telling 10 straight losses against top 25 teams for the tar heels including owen 3 this year well would you consider that that was this year and last year where north carolina struggled against everyone so in the acc you played against so many you know top 25 opponents throughout a year so thats pretty pretty much concerned the last two seasons because if you go back three seasons ago north carolina was a number one seed in the ncaa tournament with kobe white you know cam johnson i mean this was a program that had the opportunity to win a national championship theres been a struggle for north carolina over the past two seasons against the best competition but armando baicot now picking up his third foul and having to exit the game and that hurts north carolina not only now in this first half but takes away his aggressiveness in the second half wyde wilkes gets the roll on the corner three its a 15point knowles lead Applause dont forget florida state leads the acc in four different categories theyre not just an offensive team they also lead the league in field goal percentage defense they get it done at both ends so part of carolina shooting so poorly today and turning headed if they dont get their act together absolutely when you play against florida stage you got to take care of the basketball 14 turnovers in this game have led to 19 florida state points cant do that against the seminoles rather uninspiring performance against marquette and not much better but the seminoles deserve a lot of credit for that guys no doubt reese coach hamiltons club is a number three seed at the moment according to joe linardi and as you just referenced carolina if it loses this today goes squarely onto the bubble and when you look at whats happening with north carolina right now and you consider what their strength is their strength is rebounding the basketball right now north carolina is out rebounding florida state 21 to 12 early in this game but as fons mentioned as weve talked about its a broken record the turnovers 14 turnovers in the first half for the tar heels you cant beat anyone turning the basketball over that much and you have to think that this has to be somewhat you know of a hangover in comparison to the 19 turnovers that they had against marquette on wednesday and right now north carolina just struggling to do anything on the offensive end of the floor give florida state defense a lot of credit but you know you also have to give the offense of north carolina some of the credit too for just not showing up for this game walker kessler continues to look better as his freshman season has gone on he draws the heels back to within 12 Applause and he lays it in and great play by mj walker recognizing that he was going he was being denied out on the wing and there was no one there to cover the basket another backdoor opportunity here rj davis unable to finish but you see devon sharp getting in the offensive rebound but another opportunity missed for north carolina and it turns into a big bucket on the end of the end of the floor for the seminoles and mr walker has joined the 1 000 club with that last jump shot that we have been told was not a three at the two so right on 1 000 career points and i learned something this morning corey i figured well his nickname is mjs names mj he must wear number 23 to salute michael jordan but thats not the case its of course then for lebron james who mj says he has always patterned his game fair after but lebron james wears it because of michael jordan so i guess he still does wear it because of the real nj so kind of like a handmedown ancestor type of thing both mjs parents of course proud graduates of hbcus representing hampton and norfolk state respectively the mj big time football player out of high school as well and theres the mj theres the real mj right there baby and thats the real 23 lebron is great however theres only one goat yeah theres the the football player mj walker who had big time division one football scholarship offers given to him but he chose instead to go to a football school and carve out a terrific basketball career and hes one of those guys who came in highly touted and yet has been in tallahassee for five years but to me corey that does not diminish at all in fact it has enhanced his ability to play at the next level next year and beyond i agree with that wholeheartedly i believe that he has developed in the florida state program is a much better allaround basketball player and has truly shown his ability to defend which a guy thats six foot five in the nba right now has to be up to guard and thats what he can do and you look at what hes been able to do throughout his seat throughout his career the improvement and we mentioned earlier cayman is a mcdonalds allamerican with a tremendous amount of hype behind him but also has seen guys come in one and done move on and he has stayed and continued in this program has the opportunity to be one of the winningest players all time in florida state history well i told you about six weeks ago i thought he was already a lock to be first team all acc and im sticking by do you think hes going to wind up first team all acc i do i think because he is you know when you look at it probably the best player on the best team and when you think about that thats normally going to get you there but the problem for me with florida state and this is not a problem with mj walker or with rayquan gray im not sure which one of those two guys is more valuable to this team and thats what a lot of coaches say when they have to play against florida state brookwon gray may be just as important as is mj walker not a bad problem to have if youre learning hamilton and of course thats also not mentioning the lottery pick scotty ball Applause copravitza with the basketball final minute of the first half at the dean dunn calhoun has the basketball has it ripped away by leaky black and the whistle comes later tonight on abc in the espn app luca and the bands are in brooklyn to take on james and the nets our coverage gets underway with nba countdown eight eastern five pacific okay so you just read a promo and you just said james in the net so are you one naming james harden does he get the name james well as long as were talking about james we got to go to james worthy were looking at a man from gastonia north carolina and between the carolina game so no its not a onename game or hardened that was a great way to get off of the question i actually asked you but but i can only respect it when you go big game james in the north carolina game i can only respect it i gotta let you ride with that all right i appreciate that well we learned that uh kyries not gonna play and of course kds not playing uh until after the allstar break for this hamstring injury so we were going just with luca so i went just with james as the one of the big three quote unquote playing tonight for brooke okay well fair enough theres the explanation at halftime where you and i can go over all these things well have some time by the way that explanation made it worse you got away with going big name jake big game james now the explanation made it much worse but you were you were off the hook already all right walker hes got the right spot for north carolina here in this first half getting involved in the game now six points for him sorry five points for kessler but which is tied for their scoring lead and thats really the struggle that has been for north carolina in this first half 25 from the field seven for 28 theyve calmed down the turnovers a little bit the last couple of minutes still sitting on 14 turnovers but still way too many to try to win an acc game especially against this type of competition and outside of that man who just came back in kerwin walton carolina has struggled as a team shooting the basketball so between their inability to knock down threepoint shots and theyre inability to hold onto the basketball recurring problems all season have certainly propped up against the 11th ranked seminoles so far today shot clock off polite with a basketball guarded by andrew playtown he rejects the screen down the lane hangs in the air kisses it off the window and gets it to go time out north carolina if roy williams wanted that time out before the ball came in bounds and it ended up costing north carolina about a second but the story of this game thus far has been points off turnovers for florida state the difference of plus 14 195 in the first basket of the game for the nose is scottie barnes taking advantage of a turnover and then once again taking the basketball away getting out in transition scottie barnes finding his way to the rim and going through his old teammate davon sharp to be able to finish siddhar calhoun getting out on the break the finish once again and this has been like the story whether when you look at the 14 force turnovers for 19 points in comparison to five and five for north carolina that 14 point difference has really been the difference in this game for these two teams Music so can carolina get off a good shot roy williams bench has produced better than the starters so far 16 points for the reserves only 13 for the starting five they trail by 12 with 19 remaining on the clock Music kenora gom has come off the florida state bench to defend the inbound the heave from love and the 11th ranked florida state seminoles head to the locker room on top 4129 rayquan gray mj walker in the knolls getting closer to another acc regular season title we head back to the studio to reach davis and as we crank up the jeep half time report carolina might be headed toward the bubble georgia tech hoping to play its way off reece davis lafonzo ellis here syracuse georgia tech linardi has jackets first four out jordan usher house of usher with the dunk hey moses wright just sensational fines hes been ridiculous even in his last game against virginia tech at 26 31 in this game he was absolutely dominant syracuse didnt help themselves turning it over 14 times for 28 georgia tech points i mean weve seen a lot of dunks thats how you shoot 63 in the second half 8477 georgia tech has duke coming up on tuesday night glad to have you with us fonz at home im sitting here in the studio so lets show you some highlights starting with the team that we set on college game day this morning we think of probably the best team in the country at the moment michigan taking on indiana franz wagner was outstanding again and one second straight game with 21 trace jackson davis he held the 10 indiana stayed with him again livers and the wolverines took control fonts yeah just way too off too much offense for the wolverines four guys in double figure storm scoring at least 12 points in this game this team is terrific on both the engine floor shut trace jackson davis down the fourth leading scorer in the big ten held in the 10 points in this game race ive always saw everything from leverage we saw an assist to dickinson we saw a follow rebound on a slammy with 16 and 10 indiana sitting around on that bubble cut line yukon is in the mix as well taking on a marquette team theres beat north carolina how about andre jackson the con by 17 at the break rj cole the pullup fund yeah he was terrific reece 21 points in this game and i thought uconn was really up for it defensively forced marquette in the 15 turnovers early got 13 points off of those theyre gonna uconns gonna need a third score to step up for them to try to advance to a sweet 16 in the ncaa tournament book night jam lay up more layup i think he had 24 anyway uconn wins it easily just over an hour away duke is sitting right on the edge of bernardis last four first four matthew hurt with 18 points per game louisville and duke coming up in a bit and thats where they stand now indiana with the loss to michigan not that thats a bad loss its just the hoosiers fall to 500 duke right there first four out theyve already beaten georgia tech they have them again and they have louisville coming up tonight as well just as soon as we finish with the north carolina game kofi coburn thought that illinois had things in control where do you see what dimitri coburn had to carry the load funds yeah he was terrific reese i thought he was very patient when he caught the basketball with two feet in the paint the same way when he caught it out of the court this wisconsin team was ice cold in the first half race three or fourteen for three and then to demetric trice happened in the second half well illinois saved themselves dont you listen what trice did he had 29 he had 19 in the final two minutes in 12 seconds he got this thing to one possession illinois made just enough free throws 7469 the illini theyve got michigan coming up bedlam oklahoma oklahoma state rhondella walker pokes up by a half dozen heres kate cunningham funds Applause hes been terrific reece and this is what ive been waiting for mike boynton to do is to put him down on the post to take advantage of his 68 height hes been knocking down threes getting in lane finish with both hands around the rim hes been the truth for oklahoma state this afternoon big giant graphic shows you four of oklahomas six losses have been close sooners came roaring back reeves lays it in 7372 under a minute to go theres cunningham again oklahoma state surges back on top twopoint lead for the popes reeves manic lays it in to tie it now in the final seconds cunningham perhaps with a chance but he loses the ball now the sooners can they get it off save themselves no and we go to overtime where oklahoma state is undefeated theyre 30 in overtime this year heres reeves funds oh what a hes so good off the dribble 65 one of the best guards in the country that most folks dont know about all right under a minute to go to keep you up to date its on abc oklahoma states up by three texas and texas tech this afternoon and the red raiders whove lost three in a row found themselves alfonzo yeah five guys in double figures scoring this afternoon marcus santos silva had 10 points nine rebounds in this game if he can do that consistently this is a team that has an opportunity to advance to a sweet 16 texas tech wins it 6859 sweet texas this season i believe okay a couple sec scores arkansas trying to keep the heat on alabama they beat lsu by eight still a couple games back and tennessee loses again this time on the road against auburn welcome back to saturday showcase presented by five hour energy part of the road to champ week presented by wendys and heres a look at our first half stats brought to you by ally before the start of the second half and if the tar heels dont start shooting the basketball better than they did in the first 20 minutes its going to be lights out against the 11th ranked seminoles with corey alexander im doug sherman and corey just another day at the office for fsu 11 different players score played in that first half and eight of those 11 got into the scoring column and florida state started off struggling doug they had three turnovers in their first three possessions of the game didnt have a field goal attempt for the first five minutes and when then you think about scottie barnes coming into the game getting them going defensively and they were able to get it going off the points off turnovers and they did that rayquan gray whos been the consistent leader all year for florida state as well as mj walker these guys getting out knocking down shots but it was the points off turnover scottie barnes coming in getting the first basket of the game for florida state and then getting out in transition also copavisa getting out and not with only the dunk but also more points off turnovers 19 points off turnovers for the seminoles in the first half of this game allowing their offense to flow much better roy williams im sure talking to his team about not assisting for the state theyre good enough on the offensive end of four for you to help them good enough at the defensive end scotty barnes has matched his career high already with four steals turning over the heels theres coach hamilton who some consider to be the face of the university can you believe that its a football school but the football team obviously is not what its been and he has been so good in the type of man that he is for hes the face of florida state university you must not have got my memo dougie fresh i told you two three years ago that florida states no longer a football school its a basketball school you think about florida state in the elite eight florida state winning the acc championship and possibly now for a second year in a row florida states a basketball school stop saying florida states football school i know there are people that wont like that but hey thats the reality but i dont think just because youre a basketball school now that your coach was going to be not just the face of the athletic department but the face of the university thats how revered he is in tallahassee well remember now this is year 19 for leonard and what hes done in tallahassee is build a program and so when you consider the success that theyve had but has been built from the ground up thats why hes so revered in the tallahassee community but not just because of that but also hes producing great citizens coming in and staying at their university representing florida state university very well getting out of transition once again north carolina which should be an easy opportunity rayquan gray not just the offensive player getting it done defensively as well and he actually had one of the top blocks of the week yeah this was game day earlier yeah just like that as walker kessler gets to start in the second half armando baycock with three fouls in the first half and kessler who played very well roy williams going to the freshman to start the half carolina has only eight points in the paint today before this bucket they come into the the game 10th in the nation at nearly 36 paint points per game so kessler they have turned to here in the second half to try and produce inside nice design played there by roy williams and more importantly a defensive breakdown by raquan evans over pursuing the pass allows kessler to have an easy bucket as florida state calls a timeout right for chicken and salad today at participating us wendys back inside the smith center a building that has more banners than any other arena in the country i think am i right about that corey uh meaning when you say banners does that mean championships no they just for all of their hall of famers and allstars and i could not comment on that one because i dont know thats probably my best way to describe that there are a lot but i havent seen all the arenas to be able to determine whether im not sure what kansas has what kentucky has duke certainly has a lot as well yes but i just find that part of the building where we sit normally its up to the left its just amazing to see all the names that have come through the program another turnover for florida state as the turnover bug has bitten the seminoles the same way that it did to start the first half of the game Applause is rayquan evans steps out with three turnovers and hes yet to score as scottie barnes checks into the game now trying to pick up the defensive intensity once again well see if scotty barns impact is similar as it was when he came into the game to start the first half yeah this has been a carbon copy of the start of the game carolina took a fivenothing lead off of florida state turnovers they scored the first four points here in the second half now the first six points of the second half and weve got ourselves a ball game in another state turnover and you can hear the crowd at north carolina now getting involved in the game the first time theyve had fans in chapel hill this season and theyre starting to make a difference here to start the second half in favor of the home team the state of north carolina is allowing 15 capacity so about 3 000 fans in the smith center today and about 75 of those 3 000 are students making some noise as their tar heels are back to within six Applause walton feeds kesley draws a crowd steps around and throws it down walker kessler has been a difference maker now into double figures four for five from the field leading scorer for north carolina im sorry 12 points now for kepler as hes been a difference maker north carolina off to an 80 run to start the second half the lead which was once 16 points for florida state can now be cut to a one possession game Applause caleb love leaky black walker kessler garrison brooks and kerwin walton the five on the floor for unc Applause this is love tough runner a lot of contact and a foul north carolina having success when theyre not giving the basketball away caleb love attacking the basket putting pressure on the florida state defense to defend him keep him away from the rim and now an opportunity as you mentioned to make this a one possession game at the freethrow line corey i know you know this calebs father dennis always a huge carolina fan bought great tickets to the 05 final four in their hometown of st louis and took a three and a half year old caleb love who of course doesnt remember being there to watch the tar heels not only played but cut down the nets pretty cool very cool and i thought you were going to talk about how strong dennis was when you thought i talked about it that man will break your hand you shake his hand the wrong way you got to go in when you said cory you know this thats what i thought you were talking about no no no no his son just picked up a foul on the penetration by mj walker caleb a mcdonalds allamerican comes into this game averaging 10 points per game freshman out of christian brothers college high school there in st louis right now i would have caleb third in my voting for acc rookie of the year but of course hes going to have a couple of opportunities to change that right now scotty barnes at number one jalen withers from louisville at number two for me on my rookie of the year tracking but still with two two weeks remaining a lot of basketball left to be played in acc walton nothing but net speaking of rookies that rookie has been a difference maker as well kerber walton shooting 45 from three on the season and that was a question mark from north carolina coming into this year would they be able to shoot the basketball better than they did a season ago love and rj davis have been inconsistent from outside but kerber walton has been spectacular Applause carolina trailed at the half 410 a 133 start to the second half has this carolina team right back in it as it tries to get a signature win in a bid to get an adlarge bid into the ncaa tournament well the tough part is done for north carolina theyve gotten themselves back into this game here coaches always talk about the first five minutes of the second half and in these first five minutes of the second half north carolina has not only found themselves in a great position but now an opportunity to tie or take the lead on this possession and walker kessler with another big play at the defensive end Applause love lost it off of the seminoles carolina will have it when we come back and when we return we will be joined by nba draft things about the draft prospects between florida state and north carolina of course from our game this afternoon and we start at the top of your draft board or at least as it relates to this game scottie barnes for the seminoles you have him as a lottery pick and how high do you think he could go mike i think scotty barnes could go as high as six or seven where we have him now is probably on the low end but teams love his versatility what he gives you on the defensive end of the floor i mean having a guy thats six foot eight six nine with a 73 wingspan whos defending point guards switching ball screens bringing the ball up offensively he can facilitate makes everyone around him better so hes the epitome of the modern nba to me and i love what he brings from a toughness standpoint as well and mike of corscotti and davon sharp both played together at mont bird a year ago where do you see deron sharp is he a guy that should stay in school or is he on your draft board coming up this summer yeah we have deron as a projected first round pick right now i think if he does go back to school you know he could potentially hear his name in the lottery next year just because clearly it doesnt have the cleanest pathway to playing time right now with some veterans ahead of him but teams love his motor his physicality i mean averaging three and a half offensive rebounds in just 20 minutes so far this year speaks for itself so again love his energy reminds me a little bit of isaiah stewart the former washington dignity the walker kessler slam gives the tar heels the lead and then another block shot at the other end and mike before we let you go who else in this game are you keeping your eye on Applause caleb love for sure hes a guy who came in with a lot of accolades you know has had a little bit of an up and down season but he still has size and length that you look for at the point guard spot just continuing to improve his efficiency and then raequan gray you know one of the most unique players in the entire country i mean six eight 260 pounds you can play almost every position on both ends of the floor so those are two names that im gonna have my own well thank you so much mike we always enjoy having you come on and tell us what youre thinking about these guys at the next level thank you fellas interesting right now doug see whats going on it seems as though there may have been some conversation going on on the floor possibly between rayquan gray and leaky black right now the officials looking at the shot clock Applause but i did see ted valentine go over and say something to raquan gray at one point gray didnt seem to be very welcoming as to what was said Applause right now well have eight seconds left on the shot clock and get an opportunity to look at both of these coaches of course both hailing from the state of north carolina roy williams from asheville is leonard hamilton come from gastonia and right now two of the top five coaches according to acc victories as well as overall victories in acc history ray dribbles it off his foot tar heels with it love attacks hangs in the air misses the shot barnes clears the rebound for fsu Applause nola underneath and the layup tied at 46 and just a great find by scotty barnes you mentioned six foot eight six foot nine the ability to see over top of the defense but a willing passer and scottie barnes says a very good rebounder but does not look to give the ball to anyone else playing the point guard position for leonard hamilton has the freedom to push the basketball and make plays for his teammates walton got a clean look but misfired Applause scottie barnes being guarded by garrison brooks drives and dishes nicely read by walton whos on the sideline great anticipation by walton right there and you see scotty barnes on the possession earlier the beautiful no look theres an article written about him and he talked about watching magic johnson and again im im going to be very careful to mention magic johnson and scotty barnes in the same sentence saying that scotty was watching magic johnson highlights hes watched him on instagram hes studied his game etc and would love to be like magic johnson im not going to say scotty is like magic in any way whatsoever but that is a guy that he has modeled his game after and enjoys watching and trying to see how he can make his team better with that infectious energy that magic johnson had when he played back in the 70s 80s and early 90s iran sharp and armando baycott back in as coach williams continues to work all four bigs walker kessler has been the catalyst for this comeback here today for carolina calhoun misfires here comes leaky black numbers for the tar heels they get it to walton in the corner off the mark again ball batted to the corner out of bounds and the tar heels will keep rj davis back in as well as anthony Music harris goes out and we should mention its good to see malik osborne back and playing today he was a game time decision because of an ankle injury mj walker same thing he got a start got back in the starting lineup today florida state likes to trap on the side opportunities right here unable armando bakar does a good job getting the ball out of the trap but you see florida state going to try to pick up his energy on the defensive end of the floor they were they had success forcing turnovers against north carolina in the first half but here in the second half north carolina has done a great job handling the basketball and the reason why theyve been able to square this game away Applause tomorrow the undefeated presents a room of our own a onehour special that explores the connection that black athletes have with music and the impact that association has empowering social movements it premieres at noon eastern on espn with an encore presentation at 4 eastern on abc speaking of that of course well publicized leonard hamilton who is the ceo of his own gospel recording label saw coach hamm singing on packer and durham a week or so ago yeah he wanted to try to let it rip no not at all if i could sing i wouldnt be either id be singing on air its all glad they cant sing doug its all part of the gospel of leonard hamilton off the bounce carolina just keeps coming retakes the lead 4847 and rj davis with 16 points in the first matchup between these two and when you have a game like that you have confidence playing against that team before weve seen him aggressive on the offensive end of the floor able to knock down the bucket there for the heels sedar calhoun the junior puts florida state back in front and thats the way hes been playing lately he has been on fire tory last three games coming in five of nine from new york 11 of 15 from the floor overall the cigar calhoun has been a great addition to this florida state team of course hailing from the great state of virginia so you know thats what we do in va w fresh we can shoot the ball rj davis of course a native new yorker he can shoot it as well going off the bounce how do you say it Applause tap the hammock same place where uh where uh c breezy aka chris brown aka the greatest entertainers from you know tappahannock hard to argue with that Applause and im not kidding and if were giving shout outs for towns weve got to say white plains new york rj davis out of archbishops steppen at ties the ball game at 50 a piece eight minutes into the second half florida state led in the first half by as many as 16 points and another takeaway on the run to the bucket lay up missed bacon hustling and fighting for two more and give armando bacon tremendous amount of credit hes been sitting the majority of the first half sat at the beginning of the second half but didnt boat coming in and making a contribution to try to help his team get a big win here on their home court good scouting there on the defensive side by harris and no polites going to try and drive left playtech takes it away from calhoun skip pass cross court rj davis in and out and a foul on the floor theyre going to get deron sharp underneath discarding the defender going after offensive rebound and they run for matthew alexander montreal great job of getting to the weak side glass and the spirit the energy and the competitive spirit of this oklahoma state team impressive now dont dont miss what i said there kate cunningham had 40 and 11 rebounds virginia tech taking it out on wake forest and west virginia with a 17 point lead on kansas state kade cunningham doing it again for the cowboys in this game the fans who are allowed in the smith center for the first time this season have seen their heels rally from 16 points down to take a twopoint lead with just over 11 minutes remaining with corey alexander im doug sherman what do the seminoles need to do now corey to get back onto their game well they need to have the ball in requiem grays hands would they have on that possession and unable to get anything going on the offense in the floor but really its about what they do defensively they were great defensively against the tar heels forcing those 14 turnovers in the first half and turning them into 19 points they have had very little success on the defensive end and right now north carolina operating in rhythm on their offensive end of the floor brooks and they caught the bigs on the floor for the tar heels you threw me off because rd set us up great coming in from studio and then you took me off topic okay kate cunningham 40 points tonight right yeah kay cunningham has two teammates on the floor right now that played together last year scottie barnes deron sharp to go along with moses moody who is having a spectacular year at arkansas when its all said and done will last years 20192020 montberg team be considered the greatest high school team of all time yes yes youre just youre just automatically going yes so youre going to tell me why youre going over baltimore dunbar dunbar yes remember remember the muzzy bugs reggie williams david wingate so remember that team you forget how this guy of course i remember okay all right so youre saying were gonna have to pick that up later because right now rj davis is picking it up on the offensive end of the floor we talked about how much success he had in tallahassee first the knowles and he has been big here in the second half this game now 12 points for davis as he and walker kessler have been the offensive spark for north carolina in this game and now have them sitting with a fivepoint lead over the top team in the acc whoa the dunk by raquan gray we said earlier the ball needs to be in rayquan grays hands allowing him to make plays and he makes a big one right there to make it a one possession game but gray does have five turnovers in this game and thats been part of the issue for florida state especially here in the second half walker kessler going to the bucket and laying it in having a career game and hes got the heels back up by 5 then all the great players that north carolina has had wearing this uniform with the argyle up and down the side im not sure theyve ever had a seven further that can go off the dribble to the rim and then come back on the next possession outrun everyone seal and dunk walker kessler putting on a show here in front of the fans for the first time at the dean dawn time out florida state it has been a tale of two halves carolina couldnt hold on to the basketball in the first half and couldnt shoot straight and since the intermission its all turned around corey leakey black with the beautiful find to walker kessler who runs the floor beautifully and has the finish but this is what im talking about seven foot going off the bounce around the entire florida state defense for the easy bucket and not on this one but there you go theres the mean mug eight of nine from the floor 18 points couple of free throws five offensive rebounds out of his seven and four block shots getting it done and remember armando bacon got three fouls in the first half did not start the second half and walked walker kessler in the second half six for six from the field has been spectacular up to 18 points for him eight to nine shooting seven rebounds as youve mentioned but four blocked shots has been a difference maker on the defensive end as well as on the offensive end of the floor baycock did not start the second half after picking up three fouls in the first half and you got to figure with the four carolina bigs on any given day in any given half if you get good production out of two or three of them youre going to be in good shape scottie barnes throws it toward the rim denied by kessler he is everywhere great hustle by copra copravisa to come up with that one and then the putback as he sees walker kesslers effort in his work and is trying to match that im sure hes been challenged by his coaching staff especially the great stan jones over there letting him know hey we got to put a slow down on kessler because hes having his way with us right now irwin walton an air ball kessler of course with the save but it goes out of bounds and florida state will have the basketball when we come back theres the great coach jones espn in the ab duke faces off with louisville at cameron indoor stadium and then its a big 12 battle at the fog number two baylor takes on 17th ranked kansas and lets take a look at todays wendys wooden watch from that game thats coming up next youve got to go with car league jones the best grad transfer in the country corey well carly jones of course having a great season for louisville but right now going up against a very hot team in the blue devils going to be interesting to see who gets the call on defending him today will it be wendell moore jr you know or will you put dj stewart on car league jones and thats where duke has really been proved as a team recently is on the defensive end of the floor theyre going to have their hands full dealing with carly jones at 6 pm and david johnson as well going to be back in the lineup for louisville should be a good one following us here on espn david johnson had a huge game at duke a year ago and one of the reasons why louisville was able to walk out of cameron indoor with a win so im sure hes looking to have a big performance here in his first game back this week 5954 north carolina leads 11th ranked florida state 725 remaining doug sherman corey alexander with you florida state led in the first half by as many as 16 points led 4129 at the break but led by that man walker kessler it has been all heels in the second half and walker is feeling it right now and again thats not uncharacteristic for him he has the ability to step out and shoot the basketball from the perimeter but right now hes feeling himself 910 from the floor and getting it done on the defensive end as well rebound comes to davis here comes carolina caleb love back into the game finds the trailing brooks who couldnt handle the pass polite dribbles the other way for the seminoles good hustle by mj walker to clean it up and pull the knolls back to within five inching to see if well see florida state start to pick up the full court pressure after scores now north carolina with 14 first half turnover the floor especially when walker kesslers got his hands on the basketball rj davis no Applause polite on the pullup draws the knolls back to within three and time out by florida state now after a score im sure thats something that we could see some full court pressure coming out of this timeout from florida state and that made the only way they can slow down walker kessel who has had a great second half starting the second half and getting going early the dunk going around scotty barnes and then the nice feed from caleb love to kessler for the pick going off the dribble the big fella the sevenfooter with handles and then running the floor like all great north carolina big man do we need work on the mean mug walker but other than that you have been perfect here this evening 20 points 910 from the field seven rebounds and four blocks a season high in every category which means its a career high because hes a freshman walker kessler putting on his show here today tuesday over on the acc network its a doubleheader of conference hoops starting with wake forest and pitt at six eastern followed by duke and georgia tech dont have acc network go get uh go to getaccncom so dukes got to take care of business tonight then turn around and face a very good georgia tech team as it tries to get over the hump and over that bubble into the field of 68 safely i believe that is going to be the biggest key for the acc this year and thats going to be the best matchup to see who will get into the tournament or will both those teams be able to make it in there and right now roy williams with a threepoint lead trying to get into the 900 win club where only four other mens division one coaches have been three behind bob knight right now but looking to try to get a win here in front of the fans for the first time in the dean dome all season long cory we should mention roy last year passed his mentor on that list dean smith who by the way would have turned 90 tomorrow it would have been dean smiths birthday thats one that we can remember going through last year with roy williams and of course you want to continue winning but he they wouldnt count any win after that he never wanted to surpass he never was concerned about surpassing dean smith but anthony polite that should have been called out of bounds he came right in from out of town i dont even know if he was in bounds when he touched that basketball but regardless i dont think he can be the first person to touch it coming back in as you see it goes off sharp but hes still out of bounds well out of bounds when he went back to the basketball thats unbelievable but hey florida state turns it over anyway so they have now 11 second half turnover so they have played the same role north carolina played in the first half which has allowed north carolina to take a threepoint lead in this game rayquan gray called for the holding foul on that entry pass to armando bacon you know we talked about the first matchup between these two teams and how it was a turnover fest when they played earlier 14 for north carolina 17 for florida state in a game that florida state was able to win and right now they both are coming close to surpassing those numbers as the each team sits at 17 for north carolina 16 respectively for florida state long shot for love with the shot clock down polite back the other way gray the point forward bulls his way to the bucket and draws the foul yeah good luck trying to stop that coming at you full steam but when youre that size and you have that level of ball handling ability Applause and can make plays youre dangerous in transition and again part of the reason why lebron james has been so dangerous for now 18 years in the nba because hes huge and hes also fast with the skill and the ability to be able to finish over top of you or go around you you see the man who has reworked his body over his four years in tallahassee to where now as we heard from mike schmitz joining us earlier on our broadcast he is absolutely on the radar of nba scouts hes a red shirt junior and of course everyone can come back next year with the exception thats made by the ncaa this year but he has another year to be able to come back and help leonard hamiltons team continue to build on their win total and try to win a national championship and as you mentioned mike smith saying that he may be on that radar to go this year as rj im sorry colonel walton knocks down the three to extend the lead for north carolina big shot to make it once again a fivepoint game scottie barnes trying to answer he does with two scottie barnes has made huge shots all year long for florida state especially when you consider two two buckets that sent the game to overtime or won the game within the last second so hes no stranger to making big shots trying to throw it down had it knocked away by caleb love big defensive play by the freshman point guard it was but im not sure if caleb got any basketball on that one to get him interesting to see that oh wait a minute mondo doesnt want us to see that he wants us to see him we dont want to see that again we want to see mondo throwing it down on people on the inside nobody was going to block that shot raequan gray fouled on his drive to the bucket tar heels up five with just under four minutes remaining in regulation Music espns exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by five hour energy shots the official sponsor of getting it done the first four out chance for quality win finds against creighton how about this beautiful pass inside from paul scruggs and zach fremantle a great onetwo combination combined for 20 points two point lead for x back in chapel hill heres whats at stake between the seminoles and the tar heels florida state getting much closer to a second straight acc regular season championship for coach leonard hamilton and on the other side roy williams is three minutes and 50 seconds away from potentially picking up his 900th career win in north carolina able to shake off that hangover from the early week loss to marquette where they turned the basketball over 19 times in that game and played poorly and we saw the same effort from them in the first half but this second half has been spectacular for north carolina and they found themselves with a fivepoint lead and trying to get a win over the top team in the acc rayquan gray top five in the acc and free throw percentage gets one out of two and draws the knolls back to within four florida state out of timeouts north carolina with three remaining the answering as good as kessler has been in this game you see roy williams going with his veterans down the stretch armando baycott and garrison brooks on the floor these guys have been there before as scottie barnes comes over and makes the big defensive play denying kate with love at the rim he is so long cory i mean six nine and he can go from point a to point b without breaking a sweat its amazing but his its a its more so about when you see guys his size his length but its his basketball iq and understanding of how to play the game and use that size and link on both ends of the floor not only offensively but defensively as well we mentioned four steals in the first half for scottie barnes and now five steals on the game with the one block shot and again that doesnt even throw in what he does on the offensive end of the floor helping his teammates be successful walker kessler returns for roy williams walker left his feet pass finds its way to polite now seven on the shot clock he calls for a screen step back three halfway down and back out and a foul on the floor lets send it back to the studio and reese davis Applause all right well let you know if youre looking for louisville and duke were going to start it over on espn news because this is taking a while in chapel hill cardinals and blue devils tied at two in the opening seconds sounds good rhys well youve got fans in the stands at the dean dome for the first time this season and theyre looking to put on a good show for the 3000 or so and thats been the area of concern for scotty barnes its the one thing he has not done well this year as no one up to call out the screen and garrison brooks gets a great screen on scotty in the backcourt scottie barnes shaking off that right shoulder he felt that one a bit Applause ball gets back to love with eight on the shot clock here comes the kessler screen Applause love with two to shoot the scoop and theres a foul on the shop and this is where you got to start yelling at your big man someone has to be up letting scotty know theres a screen because you see garrison brooks thats a man thats a senior for as great as scottie barnes is hes a freshman and theres a difference between the two of them physically garrison brooks winning that battle thats one scottie barnes will feel definitely throughout the remainder this weekend do you have one that you took that you remember or dont remember well i have a couple that i took but fortunately unfortunately i dont remember many of them because two of them ended in a concussion so i dont remember i dont remember two of those carolina 19 for 22 as a team from the line and it was florida state that was great 26 out of 27 from the freethrow line in the first matchup between the two barnes no and it goes up and over the backboard back to the tar heels Applause and we talked about the turnover story being the difference maker in the first half well the first game in tallahassee florida state was great from the freethrow line 26 out of 27 for the game and this one has been north carolina 1922 from the freethrow line and they have been thats been the difference for them and part of the reason why they hold this sixpoint lead right now with two minutes remaining theyre going to have to be steady as we see kessler showing off that ball handling skill once again carolina was down 12 at the half and now under two minutes away from getting roy williams his 900th career win Applause here goes caleb lyle Applause tough shot and he cant get the roll its 10 back up and in its an eightpoint carolina lead gray gets the foul call against kessler and smart play by laquan gray attacking the big but on the other end of the floor and caleb love with the soft touch gets to sit on the back of the rim but garrison brooks first off the floor to tap it in second chance points for north carolina where they have dominated the glass in this game 42 total rebounds 20 offensive rebounds for the tar heels and they have a plus 11 advantage over florida state in this game another rare miss at the line for gray and its good to be a unc student today i will say doug that we have to consider the fact that this crowd has been a difference maker for north carolina in this game theyve been in it from the beginning they watched the team struggle in the first half but theyve been a great source of energy for north carolina here in the second half as soon as we get done here well send you to the duke louisville game florida state though still alive off the turnover Applause politeno crashing is gray its a sixpoint game and this game far from over 597 seconds remaining a six point lead thats a two possession game so nothing cemented yet for north carolina and florida state with an opportunity to pick up their pressure to see if they can force another north carolina turnover reaching foul against polite thats the seventh on florida state and so a oneandone upcoming for kerwin walton who on the year is 10 of 11 at the line Applause the freshman from hopkins minnesota waits for substitutions to be made Applause we have a couple of tremendous coaches going headtohead in this game roy williams already a naismith hall of famer could win his 900th today oh by the way leonard hamilton is nominated hell be on the ballot this year for the nae smith hall of fame he told us last night id consider it gravy on the home fries if he is able to join roy williams in springfield which he also said was his favorite thing to eat i would hope anthony harris back in on an offense defense switch walton goes out after making a couple of huge free throws barnes up the sideline stepping into the three is gray no long rebound loose ball comes to the seminoles gray again no barnes able to put it in 7266 and leaky black needs some assistance he went down and is limping back on his feet Applause if youre a north carolina fan thats concerning leaky black has dealt with ankle issues for the past two seasons and so good to see him trying to walk this one off but where north carolina sits right now weve shown that a number of times they still remain in the field as a 10 seed injuries at this point this season can be detrimental you need leaky black healthy and playing on this roster as bacon steps up and knocks down the first free throw you see leaky black just no contact there just slipped on a wet spot Applause north carolina has made its last 14 free throws its back to an eightpoint lead spray banks it in and the takeaway seminoles a chance to cut it back to four no i believe the officials are going to review that when its called north carolina ball but theyre going to review that one patricia already signaling that we will go check that out but north carolina armando baicot taking the basketball out of bounds panicked a bit trying to get it in quickly ends up being a turnover you see now as they go after the basketball both guys getting a hand on it but this is where it comes down and the problem there is you have to have conclusive evidence and right there its so difficult to see who has a hand on the basketball last it was called north carolina basketball on the floor and that looks a lot like scotty barnes taking that out of bed Music well nobody had a better view than pat driscoll he was in position yeah this this is the best angle you see its all scottie barnes on that possession it doesnt touch bangkok going out of bounds pat driscoll as you mentioned right on top of it and immediately with the call that it goes back to north carolina and he was right on point Music well a win here would enhance north carolinas resume exponentially you can take down the 11th ranked team in the country at this time of the year now just a couple of weeks from selection sunday the tar heels could breathe a little bit easier i would think coming out of this one if they can hang on and it would also make up for a tough week the midweek loss to marquette weve talked about it quite a bit this would erase that again you know you dont ever want to lose especially in a nonconference game on your home court however a big win like this from roy williams and his group would wash that away and also help them on the ncaa tournament resume corey i agree with you the tar heels have definitely benefited from having fans in the stands for the first time this year only about 3 000 about 15 capacity but they have been with them from the start garrison brooks gets it in and walton as they wanted to got the ball in his hands and hes fouled so he will go back to the line where he just made a pair before the state not thinking they fouled that possession they were actually trying to trap and see if they could get a turnover an aggressive trap Applause but the bench you could tell not happy for the knolls they didnt feel as though there was contact on that one here we go Applause and just on that stat carolina 23 of 26 today including its last 14 now make it 15 free throws in a row see coach williams summoning andrew playtech to come back into the game Applause and he would come in for the shooter it looks like as davis has been replaced by harris Applause walton does his job and now playtech returns shot clock off florida state cannot waste any time here at this point you want to continue to see if you can get quick shots at the rim wide open three if you get it but the last thing you want to do is turn the basketball over Applause 15 seconds polite pulls up no and a foul on the rebound barnes and platek came together and its going to go against carolina Applause see the number scottie barnes 55 free throws thats the one area where he has struggled this season hasnt shot the three very well but considering his reputation of not being able to shoot coming into college basketball hes actually shot the three much better than i think many people would have expected calmly knocks down that free throw Applause preseason acc oh go ahead corey excuse me just say if he makes this one now its still a two possession game but you have to foul and force north carolina to miss free throws and expect them to miss free throws if you want to have an opportunity to be able to try to tie this game up and send it into overtime Applause back to a sixpoint game no foul call and a head ball carolina has possession but thats what what florida state was trying to do on the last possession when their foul was called quickly and that was the conversation that leonard hamilton was having with bill covington about the fact that we were not trying to foul we were trying to get our hands on the basketball when the whistle was wrong timeout called by carolina tar heels holding on to a sixpoint lead so whats the strategy here for florida state and for carolina cory well with that possession you lose four seconds trying to get the basketball back you have to immediately foul because the thing is down six youve got to at least get the basketball twice and expect for north carolina i hope north carolina misses a couple free throws so right now its going to have to be an immediate foul hope for a missed free throw come down knock down the three and do the same thing all over again which is going to be difficult for florida state to be able to pull off however with 67 seconds crazier things have happened at this point games not won yet cory but what have we learned about carolina with this second half that weve seen today well weve learned that north carolina is jekyll and hot im not sure which ones the good one which ones the bad one but one is good ones bad and they can be both we saw a terrible first half of north carolina we saw a great second half against great competition and you look at their remaining schedule at syracuse on monday of course they have duke at home to finish the season these are two possible quality wins for north carolina to bolster their ncaa tournament resume and then of course going into the ac acc tournament trying to continue to find better seating going into the tournament they have a possibility of being able to even get into the top four and receive that double bye going to the ac tournament theyre able to come away with wins for the reign of the season brooks tosses it in love has it and hes fouled by scottie barnes what a turnaround here in the second half shot 25 in the first half theyve doubled it here in the second corey and they you know had half the turnovers that was the thing they got great shots they made shots but they had half the turnovers only seven second half turnovers and only you can only say only simply because they had 14 in the first half way too many to try to win a game but florida state turned the basketball over at a high flip as well 17 turnovers with him that allowed north carolina to get back into this game early in the second half and eventually go on to most likely get a win its not often a team can turn the ball over 21 times in a game and get the win coach williams and his tar heels are on the verge of doing just that Applause and again carolinas taking care of its business at the free throw line now making their last 18 to make sure they keep the seminoles at bay final five seconds mj walker and thatll do it a signature victory for coach williams number 900 in his hall of fame career and as hell say more importantly for what it does for this years team in its quest to get into the ncaa tournament and congratulations to roy williams joining the 900 club fastest to reach that milestone in division one mens basketball history walker kessler a career high 20 points
