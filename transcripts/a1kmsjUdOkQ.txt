started the last four games to Cardinal 3 and one with him in the starting lineup Watkins Relentless going to the board boy what a score right just a little up fake get the defender to raise his Center gravity then you steps by and then does a nice nice job finding the glass softening the shot nothing but the bottom of the basket back door cut young tried to slam it bu bow and tried to meet

year yeah hes because he gets to play with amazing talent saw the same thing with Scotty Pippen when I was with the Chicago Bulls in 92 get opportunity to go play with the Dream Team he went from kind of a good player solid back up to Michael Jordan to an all NBA Hall of Famer and look at this group hes playing with you want to talk about good group wiama gobear in the crew thats how you get better playing against good talent now you get to see what they do it gives you confidence and his confidence is at an alltime high right now thats why he has been going to work and feasting on defenses in the ACC Maxims parents Love by the way this 400 pm local start 1 am in Paris so uh you know they they had to stay up late but not as late as a 300 am start early its early game for them what 100 what do you think they eat or drink at 100 Paris Friday night good wine wine wine yeah you no good quick turn around yeah coming out of that timeout Stanford had a chance to lock in their defense get that stop raino on that glass two points two boards Benny Giller the Junior from palis veres in number five and he finds Blakes in the corner gilers first shot off everything yeah and I like giler hes a hustler he had four assists uh he can shoot the ball but hes got to gain that confidence I like to see him work at his midrange shot get to the basket he always comes out fire in these threes Watkins trapped underneath hes a strapper though shortest guy on the on the court and giler will put his nose right to scum loed in no good r no with a rebound you see the way r no went from the left side of the key the right side of the key to snatch that board you cant teach that thats desire thats hustle thats want to agar wall in the corner young tried to tip it out of bounds off Stanford semal basketball I want to go back and show you what I mean when a guy just wants it more the other I played in the NBA against a dude named Dennis Rodman right like just you got to want to go after that glass you start on the left side of the floor which generally okay I got anything on the left but when you want to help your team you go get anything outside your position that comes off of that Rim I guess that helps you average almost 12 rebounds a game right amazing what he has done at this level leading ACC leading the nation and rebounding averaging a double double Watkins in and out gets his own rebound and the slam thats the wheels Im talking about with jir Watkins he had the big fella come out of him he said theres no way if I put this ball on the floor raino can stay with me went right by him and flushed it with a hard right hand he dunked it so hard that net didnt come down theyre going to have to fix that net before they come back down oah sers for three see thats what Im talking about G hes a setup guy little penetration to the middle defense sucks out of the corner you hit your guy on the team and you get a threepoint shot Scott look at the net I cant believe they didnt fix that really how did they not fix that I dont know how they missed it ball boys got to get that absolutely coach Hamiltons not happy about it no its its distracting well you know lets see if this threepoint shot from the the corner goes in yeah its its hard to visually find the ri find the front of the rim you always want to shoot the ball over the front that shot actually fixed it N I think Young actually jumped up and grabbed it to fix it too oh did he lets see yeah I think Young might have done Music that look at this one here Second Chance points are a killer this is what Florida State lives in Fon opportunity to get on the offensive glass Second Chance quite you see right now off his feet too long not in the defensive stance jir Watkins with the blow down a Blow by right hand finish Christian NE number 11 big fella almost 7 ft from Canada freshman comes in as Yan misses and hard hitting the floor was Jerry D yeah I think they got Blakes underneath there wrestling with with that alligator dang down there trying to get him off that offensive glass cuz you know coach Smith gave him an ear two things he Prides him his teams on taking care of the ball offensively and rebounding your own defensive blast so they didnt like the fact J M Watkins got that dunk previous trip down the floor off of that offensive board I like Blakes hes a tough kid talk about improvements let show some numbers that he had in his improvements from his days at Duke and one of the guys Leonard Hamilton really likes has just checked in number nine hes from Greece Anastasio roas well see how much action he gets young clears the the Applause board 1210 Music Stanford Cardinal coming off that 37point win right here Scott you did that game against Applause Miami Youngs open for three Aiden camon battling ball goes out of bounds will stay with Stanford yeah thats why coach Smith loves camon he will go down there he got two Florida State guys on his back and hes still found a way you just enough of that basketball to have to have that ball be pushed out by Florida State and remain with Stanford hardworking young man had a chance to watch him a couple times in practice really puts in the work good catch Chisum AAR number 10 in for Kyle Smith hes the Harvard transfer Blake splits all the Defenders the dipy do wont go well he had one of those on Wednesday with the right hand couldnt get that one to go with the left hand but I like Blakes when hes at tack mode going into that interior Florida State just one of their last seven geler all up in the business of Jerry D this is Boston Holt number three Dens threepointer off Neu kept it alive sellers above everybody and slams it home wo the sellers have some bunnies he was determined once he got that ball about the half courter mark that he was going to dunk with a finish I didnt think he had enough Runway to take that one off Scot and a foul on Florida State thats a Lear Malo called for well it has when you D dont you need a lot of Runway yeah well it hasnt been pretty basket so if they can hit an outside shot take it to the hole and send it home nice play by Music Young 11th thank you for sharing your and enjoy the rest of the gike Music ande they been stand for a long long time and now theyre excited to be here Music Applause and miles Music Music Music Stanford leading Florida State 1410 1126 left in the first half Florida State when youre out west check out the Golden Gate check out a Warriors game at Chase Center they were playing the Bulls where Florida State Alum Patrick Williams was there so to Steph Curry kind of a nice thing to do when you come 3000 mil away from home yeah I I I I got the car rode up there as well I wanted to check out the state uh Chase Center my old team the Chicago Bulls Stacy King got me some tickets thanks to Chuck Walsh the deputy director of sports information Chuck is a good man he gives you so much research on Florida State you are never wanting for anything does a tremendous job and it makes our job a lot easier guys like Chuck Walsh and Zack Reynolds over at Stanford just very very informative and helpful sports information directors those two guys are the best matter of fact Chuck told me he was going to take me for a steak dinner here in the Bay Area and he uh he I couldnt find him maybe he found out how much you eat sellers off and gets it steals it and then lays it in heads up play by oiah S yeah but I get so upset at this level these college kids know as youre jumping out of bounds with the ball you dont save the ball underneath your own basket bad things happen that time Florida State gives up an easy basket its a seven nothing run for Stanford a six nothing run for oiah sers Watkins midrange jumper no sers and O Oort kind of both tried to get it and then knock it out of bounds yeah you know thats one of those things its somewhat frustrating that you should have had that rebound but as a coach you see two guys crashing the glass you can let that go pretty quickly what do you do Scott if youre Florida State theyve gone three minutes and change without a hoop you try to drive and get something to the H yeah you got to get to the free throw line ear a chip to the free throw line get some contact to get some free throws or get into that interior with a bucket cant keep bombing away in midrange and long range jump Applause shots Yan was fouled down low well you can see right there okay lets punch it inside to our big man and try to try to post him up down on that low block down this is where Florida state is really good lard Hamiltons coach basketball teams these Baseline out of bounds Id be shocked if they dont get a high percentage shot on this B Watkins now back up top they tried to get it to you and it got tipped away yeah Agarwal down there on that block got a fingertip on it and poked it away oara inside no good ball comes back out okara gets it back Blakes in and out Stanford another opportunity wow a B and chis down there battling getting the ball back for the guys in the white jerseys and a block foul called on toir Watkins well chiz oara is really taking a fight to the Noles inside the paint Watkins first foul against Cal the other night he had four fouls at the end of the game and that was a problem offensive rebounds something Florida state is very sensitive about Cal had 23 of them the Applause day so Stanford underneath their own hoop haer wall drives Baseline no good and Watkins with the rebound well you know its chilly its only 52 degrees outside some of that cold must be coming in on on these shooters neither teams shooting over 40 in this Applause game back court but how about the sevenfooter just diving on the floor The Hustle by your best player yeah and that becomes contagious they do that in practice as well four turnovers now in the last 4 and 12 minutes for the noes all right well take a timeout its 1610 Stanford on top if youre seven F feet youre taller than everybody but Ryo can get horizontal too Music 1610 Kyle Smith Stanford Cardinal leading Florida State Kyle Smith in his first season he was the Pack 12 Coach of the Year at Washington State hes got a winning record wherever he has gone and Maxine Reno said I love playing with this guy because he is just very transparent about what were going to do what he expects and a shout out to his son Rocco whos the captain of the Palo Alto High JV team whos having a good season so way to go Rocco and way to go Maxim Reno inside coming out of that timeout they dial up the Mig man struggling to get a field goal shooting under 40 till that bucket right there puts him at 42 but raino using his length around the basket with the off hand nothing but the backboard in and then he goes and chws some glass impressive impress a young Applause Music man now they like to get back into REO hes fronted by the much smaller decoin Davis mpar cut off now 10 on the clock for Blakes aars got to make something happen Blakes has to shoot it he does and off the mark did not hit the rim a shot clock violation can we give the Florida state simal some credit for the defense on that possession I mean they did a great job cutting off raino and uh on the initial 10 seconds of that position possession and then never let the ball get back close to that painted area kept the Cardinal out on that perimeter where they could do nothing with Music it walk gets helped and then leaves it off for Yan pass kicked off sers ahead of people sers misses oh I think they foul on Reno yes they got Reno coming over the back yeah sellers try to get maybe a little too cute using the left hand he was getting challenged with the right hand but I would have liked him see him going right through that contact with the right hand attempted Jam see tries to get a little too close float with that left hand go right through the body of that Defender slashing by you and just if you cant get the dunk be satisfied with two free throws Renos first foul Yan fouled on the other end easy layup Miss but hell go to the free throw line for two well the nolles have been stuck uh right now on 10 points for what seems like an eternity with all the turnovers and and blanks that theyve been shooting so what do you do you go inside to your big man and try to attack right at the rim and if he hadnt been fouled Yan was about to flush that Applause hey folks a reminder looking ahead at next Saturday afternoons triple header Florida State and BC start us off at two Eastern followed by the Commonwealth class between Virginia T Virginia and SMU hosting Stanford to cap the night Yan makes one of two he has scored in double figures in 16 straight games that stopped a N9 nothing run that free throw by Malik Yuan yeah I I like I like y this guy shoots 59 from the field unfortunately hilly shoots 59 from the free throw line as well I know all about that I know all about free throw shooting problems Thomas with the steal ahead to Davis and Davis pushed another foul on Stanford now Scott seems like its getting a little choppier yeah Stanford now I believe that is their 16 foul so no shooting one

down here got a little nonchalant got jumped from the back lets see does it go off his leg ah kind of hard to tell if it was poed away and did I dont think it did yeah well one of those officials got to get together and figure that one out meanwhile seals have not made a field goal in over six minutes theyre one for their last 10 dayquon Davis The Freshman ends the drought well theres the extra pass and leads to a higher percentage shot right we talked to Coach Hamilton he wants his team to make 225 passes a game he says when they do that theyre nearly unbeatable that extra pass go a long way to helping them get back into the uh a rhythm off defensively fourpoint lead for Stanford Ager wall deep three no good young tried to tip it raino tried to tip it gets it back to sers Blake spots up Reno tried to tip it no good well we have seen the Cardinal now three times get those little push offensive rebounds oh wat its got travel yeah he did yeah this was called it too he got in the air like he was going past to one of his buddies came down with it so the turnovers in this first half have really discombobulated the dolls offensive attack only missing shots they only two for their last 11 but the turnovers are the worst things they not allowing them to get on uh Rhythm offensively plus you know they havent been in the LA theyve been out here on the West Coast for since what Monday yeah Applause shot clock down to six geler inside the left no good youan rebounds up ahead Davis and the little man goes up and dunks it yeah and Coach Smith not happy that he had no defensive

the ark I told you I like this kid best when hes attacking a Bas he said Ill show you I can stroke the three Williams coming out of that timeout delivers a big bucket for his team s first field goal in the last three games had been in a drought but he can shoot Watkins gets the defender in the air Davis the freshman in traffic draws the foul and dayquon Davis from Baltimore will go to the free throw line and shoot two well I was very impressed the way Florida State just moved the ball offensively on that position it never stuck in anybodys dont have anything moving on to the next guy and it leads to uh getting the Cardinal defense off balance and all of a sudden now you got yourself a driveing lane to the basket Leonard would have liked that one that possession had about eight different passes yeah right that goes that goes a long way to cut into that that 225 number right theres a manager sitting on the bench or somewhere there and he is clicking for every pass keeping tabs how about that what if that was your job the way they moved it on that one you better be on top of it you could miss one you better have a quick thumb yeah you could definitely miss one you know I love that because you know I I wasnt a score in college or the NBA but I could move the ball I could set a pick I could go get a rebound I could have played for Coach Hamilton yeah you told me one of your jobs Scott was when someone came in the lane to say hello to them if you know what I mean yeah yeah coach Johnny Bach my first day the Chicago Bulls told me you hit everybody that comes to the Lane that doesnt have the same Jersey color Jersey on that you have thats pretty easy job coach I got you shot clock down to seven raino wants it geler cant give it to him sers shoots it oiah sers well how about sers he had a Monster Jam on on his transition bucket after a steel and then he comes back and gives the Cardinal their second three in the last two minutes Applause Hulk defended well by Geller good defensive possession shot clock at four Watkins has to throw up a tough one young did a nice job of boxing out but Florida State tipped it off of it yeah you know if Im if Im young I got boxing the guy out hes longer than me coming over my back normally the officials will give you that one only mistake young didnt make he never elevated he never got off the ground to try to emphasize like hey I got this tree coming over my back so a fresh 20 here for the Applause seminal Holt against Blakes and an offensive foul on Boston H yeah not very often I would say that the defender at at disadvantage of Le its Blakes kid is so good at moving those Nikes defensively gets into a great stance you know that wont go down for as a Ste for him one of his two a game but definitely its a turnover and he gets the ball back for his teammates what a great story Blakes is after being a Reserve at Duke you know comes here and hes flourishing in Palo Alta yeah in three years at Duke 160 shots already this season 177 shots here in a cardinal uniform thatll be a foul on Donovan Young when we come back and well shoot some free throws Stanford up 2418 348 left first Music half a silver B in the map with it lights on LIC plate 9 G Applause e last Saturday Jaylen Blakes and Stanford trailing North Carolina final seconds by one and the game winner at the dean Dome you talk about a signature win at North Carolina for a first year team in ACC and hes got some company his sister Michaela Blakes made the gamewinning field goal versus Tennessee and that was within 24 hours dad Monroe was there how great is that and then the mom mcka here watching today so you talk about an athletic supportive family and a great job by the Blakes family and what a week they had back East with game winners by brother and sister I hit against North Carolina his sister goes hey I got you I can do it the same thing thats right in State rivals just Tennessee top 15 team in the nation taking them down Ill tell you what the smile on Dads face Im sure Mom was smiling at home some place but its just beautiful right like that thats what thats what basketballs so great what its all about man and and not only great athletes right by the way Scott theyre at Stanford and Vanderbilt two of the greatest schools I mean these are these are right people thats tremendous yeah look at that he couldnt be a more proud papa uh right in in in the United States right now than the way hes feeling right there in that photo so great job guys thats wonderful and then on the kid on the other side jir Watkins he going to be the first in his family to graduate so how good is that he said Im setting an example for all my younger brothers and sisters thats so cool following in the role Love College of his of his coach Leonard first in his family to graduate college thats what college athletics is all about right Blakes slicing in and Blakes we talked about him his moms watching all good things happening to Jaylen Blakes right now big smile on Mamas face over there watching her son do his darn thing here in this first half Stanford by seven this their biggest lead of the game game if I if Im correct up seven with the momentum trying to keep it going to the locker in his final three minutes a travel on jir Watkin who just ran into Too Many Bodies well you know the officials arent blowing too many missiles down there when theres that contact and lets go back to this one here by Jaylen Blakes this is his Improvement right look at the points per game in 0 in 24 18 points per game this year 147 points per game you cant tell me thats not the coach Smith effect giving these guys confidence Blakes going against D defended well giler runs it back but the shot clock now they get the free clock sellers for four yes oh they got sellers number four with three should they have gotten the reset I dont think so I dont think Florida state had clear possession of that basketball at any point so a little break from the clock operator the little home cooking as they say here uh in Stanford smells good outside you got smell a good inside here too Watkins knocks it down a two and he gets fouled and hell go to the free throw line but back to that shot clock Scott take a look at this well you tell me if Florida State ever has control of this ball here and then they 5 seconds on the shot clock reset it to 30 just enough time to knock it down there from the left side for Sellers and then Watkins just so good right shows the ball one dribble right something hes done a 100 if not a thousand times and then the concentration to finish after the contact going for the line the oldfashioned threepoint play Watkins has eight mentioned 16 straight games in double figures such a good free throw shooter 76 from the charity strike commentator way to go I dont believe in that you had no effect on that look at this Florida State Defense they can switch one through five thats what makes them so aggressive thats how they get all those steals Ray nos three is no good we offensive rebound by Blakes and hes fouled you know r ray knows so good at shooting the three he can get that anytime he want what Florida state has done frustrated right now here in this first half theyre not double teaming him but theyre fronting him and and his teammates cant figure out a way to get him the ball so he settled for that triple on that trip if you ask me you surprised he only has four points on two of six shooting well he was so hard so hot against Miami yes but talking to little Hamilton he says hey I dont normally double big guys on the Block AAR threw it away here comes Boston Holk H one on two no good but he draws the foul and the seals go back to the free throw line yeah seminal right now they cant score unless they get to the foul line theyve already shot 10 free throws here in this first Music half never seen a team as good as Florida State struggled so mightily in the first half of a basketball game they only get 21 points now I dont know if its all Stanford defense you can give them credit for that orense like I say they just havent had been in their own practice facility in so long they havent had an opportunity to get into a rhythm offensively tomorrow we have three womens games for you number 13 North Carolina hosts Florida State at noon Eastern then BC takes on Wake Forest and after the gymnastics meet between Stanford and pit we wrap up the day with number 20nc State hosting Virginia Tech and Raleigh that is at 6 Eastern 138 left first half Stanford with a sixpoint lead 2923 yeah it was at nine right and then it seemed like it was all Stanford add the momentum all the sudden even though its only its at six you will Florida State be able to take the momentum to the locker room this final 90 seconds Reno Applause inside sellers tells akar to get out of there akar hanging in split Defenders falling but drawing a foul and alar will go to the free throw line yeah officials blowing the whistle there as oakar you know big wide body hes got good balce and he just decided Im putting my head down and taking this thing inside youre either going to give me the dunk or youre going to have to foul me he gets to the foul line a lot hes a 69 free throw shooter these his first free throw attempts of the day stand out at Harvard before he came out to the Harvard of the West maybe yeah some would say that yeah I I was recruited out of Southern California at Stanford and I said you know uh I think I got more Ds on my report card than they got are in Stanford so Im going to have to pass final minute first half Watkins going at Reno Fade Away turn over over him no and sers with a rebound and a foul on Stanford and the foul is on Chism Oar well they were wrestling like two Gators going after a hand bone in Music unfortunately its its tough when the officials have been letting them battle underneath look at banging throwing bodies around and then aara he just kind of gets in and starts boxing out and all of a sudden now its a foul the officials must be consistent how they call the game all the way through a half or even through an entire game they were letting a play a lot of contact early now all of a sudden it seems like every time theres some whistles uh some bodies banging down low theyre calling the foul so maybe theyre trying to clean it up a little bit so things dont get out of hand in the second half Florida state in the double bonus so Yan is shooting two with a stop clock best case scenario for them in the final 473 yeah looking at these these field goal percentages 38 for the Cardinal 33 for the null free throws 50 for the Cardinal 66 for the null so yeah this this is not the prettiest game weve weve had here in the ACC as far as team shooting the basketball see if it picks up in the second half now that theyre starting to get warmed up the lead is five look at this full court trap here in the final 47 now they fall back into a man 40 on the game clock 20 on the shot clock Reno really wants it been Qui in this first half ball was tipped and now giler off the dribble AAR for three and chis marar well thats how you get your outside shot to go you go to the inside you earn a trip to the free throw line you visualize that ball going through the basket your next outside shot goes Music Applause in you and jump hook no good and Stanford will take a 3325 score Advantage into the halftime break great job I like our chances or does Stanford say were winning and the big fella hasnt erupted yet yeah and the Big Fellas going to come out and in erupt he did the same thing on Wednesday versus the hurricane where he came out blistered the hurricane for 14 quick points they shot 68 through the for the meid part of that game in the second half against uh Miami on their way to 51 second half points I dont know if they can do that against the K or the nolles but were about to find out Watkins guarding Reno sers back door lays it in he picks up where he left off sellers constant motion right without the basketball when you got a big like Ray no that is so good at dropping the ball between Defenders to his teammates the lead is 10 Music Applause nice pass inside and Watkins with an easy one they lost Watkins down along that Baseline how do you lose the best player in a in a bright blue jersey that wont make coach Smith real happy Watkins now in double figures with 10 yeah and they do not want to let him get going I mean he can really light it up quickly when he gets out of rhythm hes a streaky player streaky shooter streaky scorer thats all he needs to see that ball go through that basket a couple times look at this look at these big guys out here 14t of fun yeah 14 ft of fun out here doing the Hokey pokei I dont know what the heck they were doing not a brother you cant do that this is not football neither one of them wanted to give an inch thats what I love about the college game right they just out here like hey you know two young men flexing their muscles banging against each other thats good clean hard basketball officials on top of that r no trying to work out again here sers ran it down sers with 15 Blakes hanging the runner got it to go while falling down thats going becoming a signature shot for Blakes now sign from the left side of the floor to the right hand spin all the way around the rim and then put some English off the backboard and have it find the ball of the hole Thomas laid it off for Yuan and Yuan has a great touch around the B he really did he challenged a 71 250 pounder right to the rack I understand R know not want to pick up that foul Blakes lost the handle he was going in to slam that down yes he was with some evil intentions behind it as well because he put that thing up against his right wrist like he was going to it down and throw it down hard but thats the one I like from Blakes he had a couple of those against Miami has becoming a signature move for him spin it hard out by the American flag and let it just spin right back into the basket Malik Yan just picked up a technical foul oh thats no good okay thats going to give a couple more freebies for Stanford when theyre trying to get that momentum I dont understand what youan is so upset he just made a great play on the offensive end so oah sers to shoot two and wow Ill tell you what I thats thats thats tough right there you get sellers on the line here to shoot a couple freebies the kids a 85 free throw shooter and thats like giving them a free a free two points I dont know coach Hamiltons got to be fuming inside lead now at its biggest of the heres what happened keep an eye on Malik Yan well he comes over to try to block that shot and hes thinking you thats some incidental contact we had more than that in the first half but like I said the last two to three minutes of that first half they start trying to clean up some of those cont that contact underneath and theyre continuing that theme here in the second half now the players just have to adjust Blakes had lost the ball I think you was saying look I didnt affect anything he lost the ball they called the foul anyway hes going to sit for a little bit for Leonard Hamilton Davis says okay lets calm down I got three back quickly yeah dcoin Davis seven points in that first half he got he was one for one from behind the arc before he shot that one so that was a big shot that they they desperately needed now they switch off and Thomas is on bles now Yan against oellers cers kicks it out Young from the corner Donan young good basketball still on the page had a Florida States book with the extra pass nice job by Renault he hadnt done much in this half he gets double team he doesnt get frustrated try to force something up he finds one of his teammates that finds another one of their teammates for a corner pocket three Stanford has their biggest lead at 12 oh that was a tough one right there Watkins goes right at Rayo and draws the foul on the big man well Tyler bow had blown a bunny but they fought hard and since the team is number one in the ACC and Steels they get the ball back love at this one right here though look at R know so good at finding the cutter they he gets double team wasnt the best pass to the corner but he got it over in plenty of the time and he just picked it up off the floor and caned was that young knocking down a triple yep look at a bench this is a tight group all cheering for their mates right everybody wants to be on that Court everybody wants to show out in front of their friends family faculty and fans but when youre in a game thats when you got to be supportive right you you work hard and you compete in practice but when it comes game time youre all one family working for one common goal and thats to get a victory Reno picks up his second foul hes going to sit down Kyle Smith and Reno discussing the matter yeah theyre trying to post up r no on that block and hes getting fronted they might be better served running some side pick and roll or some high pick and roll try to get Rayo the ball in in other spots on the floor what are we so without raino out there look for Sellers and Blakes to step up their game and Ryan agal to be aggressive in this situation Blakes trying to get it to camon now they swing it to sers B Bowen with great defense on Blakes right in front of him and the turnover by Davis who is fouled after he stolen yeah Blakes wanted the ball cuz he thought well I got B Bing on me Im going to take this this longer body off the dribble drive but Florida State so good they switch one through five these guys are used to guarding smaller uh offensive players they get to a good stance use their length and he shut blankes down forced the turnover got the ball back not the first possession coach Smith ju to see without his his uh allamerican on the floor Davis beautiful move inside on camt hey Davis is having a game knocks down a triple comes back inside with a little Up and Under move hes in double figures with 12 six time hes been in double figures this season yeah oh the head young back door no one saw him sers instead pulls up and he hits the two how about sellers though right just a little dri get into the body of the defender create some space get steep back on balance and knock down a little Baseline Jay seven of 10 from the field for 19 points for osiah C ball out of bounds and it goes to Florida State I I Im not sure if the official didnt point the wrong way well take a timeout its a 10point lead for the Cardinal 1539 left in the second half Music now Applause up ch good Applause exactly I think thats how they Music advertise 4636 Stanford on top of Florida State this uh stat pack on the win versus loss is doesnt bod well right now for Florida State you see what they do in wins versus losses the assists the threepoint field goals made um all things that are concern for Leonard Hamilton right now at Maples Pavilion down by 10 with 1539 left in this game yeah getting out shot by the the threepoint line you getting out assisted obviously if you cant make a shot you cant cant get an assist but his concern at Cal was his team got outworked right now theyre getting outworked here in the second half Benny geler I like me some Benny gerer this kid is a scrapper man you watch his kid in practice you need a guy like geler on your team opportunistic score knocking down a triple from the short uh Corner hes got two field goals he had none in the last three games Watkins tough three contested he wanted a foul how good is jir Watkins right a guy in his face slapping him on the wrist and he still had the concentration to finish the shot now hes now got in double figures for 17 straight Music Applause Music games that is a foul on Benny giler they didnt like the screen Scott yeah I couldnt really see what happened we kind of got blocked out by some fans sitting down here Courtside but hey giler look bleeding out of his mouth hes out here fighting took an elbow on the defensive play down there his lips are all red he remind me of my old teammate whos coaching up the road Steve CER went and saw last night had chance to visit with him before the game his team came back and beat my Bulls in the second half beat him up badly in the second half by the way I gave him a copy of my book I said I wrote about you Steve I want you to have a copy what that did you sign it for him of course coach of the mens United States national team gold medals in the Paris Olympics proud of what Steve has done B Bowen right as the shot clock was expired well you know you know it cant just be all Watkins all the time they got to got some guys thatll step up and B bolans one of those dudes that can play off the dribble and create his own shot got great length gets on balance and knocks down the midrange jump shot its his first hoop he did have a season High 20 against Georgia Tech and sers continues on his T Pace you know you you would think right now Cardinal would be getting crushed because Rau hadnt really been able to get off that loung Pad but sellers right now is it doesnt matter where hes at where hes going to the basket or hes at midrange or threepoint line hes got extreme confidence in his game hes knocking down everything he shoots fourth time scoring 20 points or more for sellers this season Thomas tried a tough pass stolen by Stanford yeah D Thomas was trying to work hard in there but he got shut down by the Cardinal Defenders oh we got a we got a timeout here looks like official stoppage of play Music Hurt hes holding the back of his head sometimes you take an elbow and it just it break it it doesnt cut you but it it feels like its going to cut you oh oh they this a b bow in there with the left arm trying to get the ball nothing malicious about it but yeah he got brained is going to have to come out this game for a moment hes got 22 his career high is 24 you would think with all that here it would absorb the contact what a block by B Bowen on the sevenfooter r now R now couldnt believe it he Im not used to guys getting up that high and blocking my right hand jump Applause hook that was incredible defense by B Bowman B bow had four blocks four against C Reno nice job boxing out Ros eight rebounds now Reno tried to dunk it home and missed it Hey wheres the contact youve been whistling me for fouls I went here hard to the hole and I cant get a Applause whistle B Bowen the three is good what a sequence for B Bowen and REO is still upset here and hes got to be careful official because hes been complaining the whole time Up and Down official did a nice job sh restraint said pointed to the Stanford bench and said go to your bench Ray no could not get the uh right hand hook to go got blocked Bill Bowen comes back again and he comes again inside and you got a couple n saying you shall not

second half action and Ne who had just had the miraculous tip that Scott described well go to the free throw line for two its kind of amazing right like how quickly a guy can get get hot its once you see that ball going one time yeah for is tip and the next thing you know they run a baseline out of bounds flame I I always love watching Leonard Hamilton coach teams operate those boobs those Baseline out of bounds plays get such high percentage shots neatos an interesting story from Canada didnt play as a senior in high school was injured but Leonard Hamilton thinks hell be a pro hes pretty talented and this was a crazy tip he grabbed the net all of it I think he was just as shocked as we are that that ball went in eightpoint game Florida State just about over 10 minutes to play if theyre going to win this game they got to do it with the D they got to pick up getting into a stance and stop this Cardinal second half attack they have been on fire oakar lost the handle and I think they call Watkins for the foul so Watkins picks up his second yeah you you know we talked about chiz Oar always trying to be aggressive putting the pressure on the defense that time he got that switch with Watkins and he was determined to put that beef that he had advantage on Watkins Watkins just said no no no Ill grab you Im not letting you back me down into that paint you want to wrestle that Gator down there and that down on that low block sellers trouble getting the ball in Downs they finally do to arar oh good job using his body to get the foul need he got those big wide shoulders right he got them tree trunk legs he puts it right into the the taller but skinnier Nito and then just gets to where he needs to be now at that point to force a high percentage shot or a foul so again aara get an opportunity to go to that free throw line hey folks heres a next gymnastics reminder our next gymnastics meet right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app tomorrow afternoon number 15 Stanford squares off against number 25 pit at Fitzgerald Fieldhouse our coverage will begin at 4 Eastern on the ACC Network now Neato feeling it trying to call for the ball I love it got Ryan Ryan aall back out there he must have did a shoot change at halftime he said the first pair he was wearing wasnt working Watkins no good Neato is a bark Off the Bench yes and exactly what the nolles needed they needed somebody to come up with a little fire that lead now that was 13 down to seven need to with some quick moments off the seal Music bench they got Watkins down on right now they got to figure a way to throw that ball down to him on the on the left block giler got separation over Neato and delivers its been the bench Bunch on both sides big bucket there by giler we had another one on the other end by ne2 I love watch I was a bench guy so Im always happy when the guys off the pine are ready to play and can deliver for their team Benny gerer has been a spark Scott four of seven four of six from Beyond The Arc yeah watch this kid in practice hes the you know outside of rain know who I think is the hardest working the best players the hardest working and the most supportive vocally on the squad geler is probably in second in in for possible fler foul okay theyre going to review this for a possible flagrant foul in the lane so I guess theyre theyre checking the inside the painted air right here lets see if theres not a little extra something something to the back of no neck oh is that Watkins it is Watkins look like Watkins comes up high with the forearm SL wrist and delivers a little blow to the back of Renos neck there see his head snap forward and hes quick to hes a snitch he quick to point out to the official like hey go take a look at that one he just popped me in the back of my Dome Renee has Rene Reno has not been short on conversations with the officials tonight Scott for no he has not but it didnt look uh flagrant but it was up by the neck it well it was definitely intentional and anytime you hit somebody at the shoulders or above the shoulders with a blow that is not considered a a a basketball play theyre going to whistle you for a flag and foul so Id be surprised if they do not give him a flagrant foul in this situation had it been in the chest and the hip no problem play on right once you start hitting somebody in the head uh and in the neck theyre going to call that every time yeah you can see right there and circle in yellow just that right that white shove it wasnt hard he shoved him though hard it was an intentional blow right so I I agree with you I think they probably will call that wasnt a it was sit out of the game you know what it was Scott it was obvious right in front of the official thats what it was right it wasnt even in the strum like if you going to get somebody back cuz you got a shot that you didnt think you were supposed to take you got to wait till you get into a scrum heres comes the officials it to us its a flagrant got it oh thats brutal dead ball contact yeah so Stanford two free throws in the ball is that how he explained it so wow thats thats tough for for Florida State they had cut it down to seven and then now all of a sudden theyre going to get two free throws in the ball back this could be a potentially four or five Point play after review blue number ones been assessed a dead ball contact technical foul will shoot two and Stanford will get the ball back well theyre sending sellers to the line we talked about how good he is from the line at 85 so thats almost automatic to should they get the ball back and give the ball to gers he might hit a three did he just miss that did I did I do that again yeah and and had he made both he would have tied his career high still one shot hes got 23 Florida state has shot themselves in the foot a little bit the technical there on Watkins technical earlier on Malik Yuan yeah we havent seen a lot of Yuan since he got that technical foul though coach Hamilton well not real happy hes got both Watkins uh and you and on that Pine sending them a message thats not Florida State basketball the double team leaves agar wall open Boston Holt up ahead of everybody well thats what you get you get a rebound you get your horses out there running wide and free and you get all of a sudden to what could have been a fivepoint trip they only got one point out of it right back the other way come State now we got ourselves an eightpoint game with eight and a half to play absolutely Scot closer than it should be with all the free stuff Florida state has given Stanford yeah unfortunately now they just pick up another foul deer hes going to earn a trip to the line thats the seventh team foul I let me correct that thats the sixth team foul let me correct myself again its a 17 foul as the uh scoreboard operators a little slow here so 17 foul sends giler to the line to shoot a couple freebies and I tell you what he doesnt get to the line very often lets see how he does in the Press situation first free throws of the night look pretty good hes three of five from distance yeah if they move that free throw line to 22 ft I like his chances yeah ice water in his veins this is a 90 free throw Applause shoot little walk on gers having himself a night now thats a foul on aara okay so H will go to the three throw yeah so what were seeing here the officials said okay its enough is enough we let you guys bang hard in that first half now when we start getting that contact and players go to the hall were going to clean all this up so you can see a lot of teams going to the free throw line now thats the 15 foul on Stanford for a couple more States going to be in the bonus situation dealer is a great story won who got the scholarship after his freshman season they were like youve earned it it certainly has got here strapping diving on the floor got a bloody bloody mouth and knocking down shots getting his teammates involved playing that good hardnosed defense Im telling you every team I dont care what level it is high school college of pro they need a player like Benny Music geler Boston Al trying to make it single figure deficit he does the lead is nine a lot of time left in this one for uh for State they can continue with this pressure and get a little mini spurt six 62 8 84 run see if they can put that pressure and they just C coughed him enough giler had his pocket picked by Holt ker comes down with it now hell slow it down the Cardinal doesnt have numbers REO wanted it they didnt find it yeah thats the only problem with giler sometimes they put that length on him he cant get the ball over his Defender to get it into raino and now another foul away from the ball and well take a TV timeout 6152 Stanford on top 745 left here at Music Maples the score stord 61 Florida State 52 Music Applause Music Applause right e e e what do you do when Maxim right now is two for eight you get help Off the Bench yeah you call up the 61 180 lb Heywood Californias finest Benny gerer was absolutely going bananas tonight hes three of five from the field from threepoint range rather hes got 13 points and then you look on the other side osiah sers moving without the basketball the corner triples hes got it all working tonight the kid is eight of 12 for 23 points and has he knocked down four triples of his own so seven triples from those two guys seven another 10 sellers needs one to match his career high of 24 points breakes perfect for Milan like so good he guys got ice water in his veins you know game started to tighten up a little bit they got that lead under under 10 to single digits and you put Blakes on the line 85 shooter knocked in a game winner at North Carolina which broke my heart and then he comes out here and just Strokes two two uh free throws to give him that double dig cushion love to see that youre still affectionate about him after what he did to your Tar Hill I had a chance to talk to that young man after practice the other day well spoken told me hes the best NBA 2K player in the country in the country I think my 23yearold son might have something to say about Applause that need to Applause and a foul underneath on Donovan young as he was trying to box out Boston Holt thats his third W he was trying to box out and he was he given it all that he got but I think he got a little too much too handsy down there along that Baseline and and ran ran the guy all the way from one side of floor to the other so they stay with but sometimes hey thats better up than giving the offense a rebound for an easy P putb if you know its just the Baseline out of bounds foul Davis hanging knee to couldnt decide whether to tip it or dunk it and he missed it yeah hes impressive he uses his length real well around that basket yeah I talk about not every fouls a b look at G operating again he got those four assists almost got his fifth giler stole the pass from his teammate almost had a layup Blakes got it well Sellers and Blakes its these guys have uh really stepped up when Maxim Reno has not been able to get to double figures in scoring which is a odity cuz hes always in double figures in scoring 14point lead for the Cardinal KN to from three Brees clears it well I tell you what we got under six under seven minutes to go here and the lead has ballooned to 14 the largest of the game Florida States got to do something to get some stops and some transition baskets cuz they cant score against this Cardinal D theres a steel raino double team threw it away here comes Davis he keeps it freshman misses it bolt tips it in so Boston Hol in the right place at the right time and its 6654 well theres that stopping that score before the card had a chance to set their D and they cant even inbound the ball they got to burn a timeout so Stanford takes a time out well keep it here up by 12 so if youre Florida State right now what do you thinking its a 12point game Scott its 549 what is Leonard Hamilton saying well hes got Watkins and you and his two best players on that bench hes rolling with the guys that are out here trying to work the hardest for him he says just keep up that intensity defensively lets try to get some more steals or deflections to disrupt that Cardinal attack offensively and if youre in that Cardinal huddle you right now lets take care of the ball value of The Possession we cannot afford live ball turnovers that lead to easy run outs and buckets the other direction see what they diagram for getting the ball in here that was the impetus for calling the timeout Stanford couldnt get the ball in bounds against Leonard Hamiltons press well theyre going to press theyre going to switch one through five theyre going to throw everything but the kitchen sink at Stanford here in his final five minutes and 49 seconds maybe even the kitchen sink too I know Leonard ham Blakes to inbound Renault comes and helps him Blake successfully gets it across half court oh my god do it again do it again look at B Bing out here hounding Blakes yeah hes long Applause REO back door caught sers has a new career high theyve been setting that one up all game all game long sers has been coming up over the top this time he breaks off his route goes back door and Maxine r no so good at slipping those bounce passes to his teammates sellers 25 points on nine of 13 shooting a new career high as Malik Yan back in the game and now back to the free throw line yeah theyre going to send you into the line every time he catches it down there cuz like I said he only shoots 59 from the free throw line but I love this right here this guys only got four points in the game he could have jacked something up from behind the arc but he realizes this is the play We called up and that timeout we act like were going to do dribble handoff and then at the last minute he breaks off his route Cuts back door they had cleared the key thats the key to that play empty the key both players on the on the weak side well out of that threepoint line no helps side defense can get there in time easy Jam did you say sers had a new career high yep the kids having a heck of a game 25 points now giler will bring it up against Watkins with the pressure Reno helped him with a screen geler lost it turnover Stanford wow you dont see geler with very little pressure very often turn that ball over and even coach Smith with his palms out like what are we doing out here we we got to take care of that basketball Anything Can Happen five minutes to go when youre playing against a coach Hamilton team they can get hot you got Watkins in you and back in that game now all kinds of contact between Reno and Yuan yeah Watkins down there as well so whatever happened with that dead ball foul is still continuing here in the final stages of this game or maybe r no just wanted a little payback foul was on Maxim Reno heres Applause third go back to this one more time look at these two good guys is down here B battling looked like Ry no got the worst of it and he got the foul called on him hes like that sometimes hey I was the alltime ACC fouls leader for I dont know several decades I might still even hold the record I know what its like to go out there sometimes sometimes you just got to you got to take one for the team is that why when you got to the pros John Bach told you to hit everyone down the lane he knew you were good at it might be why they got me out a free agency they need somebody to bang with the Pistons Blakes was slow to get across half court he does he seems okay now we talk about Rena with a slow game but he does have 11 rebounds and now a lefthanded tip that was pretty allinone motion jumped up to meet the pass and then flipped it in with the left flipper Watkins answers in the corner Watkins has 18 pretty bad basketball on both ends that time youan finds his buddy Watkins with that little Hammer pass where youre like going out of the Baseline you sling it around the back of the backboard to your shooter in the corner agarwall didnt see the defender behind him almost lost it and somehow Watkins reached in and fouled him Watkins now with another foul this is the one that almost had me halfway out of my chair and Im not supposed to cheer a ray no struggling offensively with a fantastic play showing his length around the Music basket Syracuse wednes January 29th 8 more information and Pur tiets visitcom Music Music Music e e Music lets look at tonights Dynamic play of the game brought to you by tro price our Dynamic play of the game and it is Maxim wayo back door to oziah sers what a game oah sers has Happ nine of 13 from the field hes got four triples hes almost perfect from the free throw line to go along with those scw High 25 points you talked about and raino yes only six points but he does have 11 rebounds he does have two assists he only has two turnovers hes played very well right before we went to break Watkins did pick up the foul he now has four theres only 354 left he had foul trouble against Cal malikan fouled out against Cal fouls have been an issue for their two best players lead still 10 got to make your free fre throws Davis The Freshman misses everything oh Davis has been so good from behind that Arc but that one just got away from him camon having trouble getting the ball over half court he almost fell down on his own agar wall cut off Florida States defense is kind of swarming they dont stop when they focus and locked in and committed defensively they are a hard team just to get the ball over half court let alone to get anything inside uh and and in those moments has given Stanford problems problem is they havent had much of that in the second half Florida State shooting 65 from the field here in the second half sers no good raino yes big fell flexed his muscles down there in that paint on that place and enough of this let me show you guys why I should be the ACC Player of the Year offensive foul on Florida State yeah I believe thats going to be on Ewing he thats going to be his fourth personal foul a frustration foul you give up an offensive rebound and a jam and then you want to do something positive on the other end so you get a little too aggressive with the post up and just throw the defender to the floor cant have that Cayman leaves it off sellers missed the easiest look hes had all night gets bit everything hes like N9 of 12 or 9 of 13 and then a layup just kind of rolled off the rim but thats okay I love the aggression you could have burned a little clock but you know you got a chance to get a lay if you take it Davis draws the foul The Freshman daquin Davis draws the free throw so hell go to the free throw light this is the guy by the way Scott that Leonard Hamilton says reminds him the most of himself just tough gritty gets the most of his talent yeah I like Davis this because Davis was aggressive early offensively in this one he knocked in a couple triples and he got a steal or two hey coming up next its the nothing but net crew will break down the day and the night in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every game and look ah at at the best matchups on the schedule for next week weve got you covered all season right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app theyll talk to oiah sers why not he deserves it after the career high tonight 7262 242 left yeah look at this full court pressure they know that game clock is their enemy so they got to make this game as as long as possible try to get some steals if not they got to commit some fouls here in the in the front Court dealer trapped got rid of it thought about it wisely said Ill use some clock coach Smith would have yanked his chain had he shot that ball with 16 seconds on the on the shot Applause clock out of bounds Stanford keeps it only four on the shot Applause clock well the culture that coach Smith has established list here in Stanford you can see is taking roots and producing fruit they are really good at home when in a 10 will move to 10 and one they go to 11 and one excuse me 11 and one here uh at Maples Pavilion and this is a good win of over a feisty full strength Florida State team its going to give this squad a lot of confidence what hes teaching is working Reno press 20 for Stanford you tell me Maxine r no doesnt know he needs one more bucket for a 17th double double they going to try to get him one more one more shot now six on the clock ker no good bodies flying everywhere Watkins left in the back court theres somebody on the floor on every trip down the floor Applause youan inside draws the foul and they call it on cam yeah we just havent had enough of that from you in toight right like getting down on that right block and then being able to oppose your size and your strength your advantage with your length we havent seen enough of that young man this evening hes going to get get back to Tallahassee get in that lab put in some work and get ready for his next game out Applause Yan hits the free throw and Watkins takes a seat Watkins leaves with 18 points love watching the Stanford coaching staff over there coach Smith barking orders hes off his feet coach Shaws yelling stuff out to his his team as well giler they had giler he like hes played the entire second half yeah it does y theyve really gone to this kid and he has delivered in some big moments now Florida stayed pressuring but they took out their two leading scores thats a sloppy pass turnover ball tipped out of bounds they say off Florida State Im not sure one officials poting Cardinal ball the other one is saying its Florida States ball dayquon Davis flying in and does it hit the shoulder right there of was that sers underneath there BL looks like it hits Blakes shoulder and goes out of bounds Applause but are they going to the theyre going to review it going to the table Yeah Clarence Armstrongs going to go to the table and take a quick look at this one and theyre going to bring Watkins and Yan back in the game for Florida State so if youre the Stanford Cardinal if you win tonight Scott you match your win total from the previous two years we talk about wow Kyle Smith and and what theyre doing and then after here you will host Syracuse on Wednesday then you travel to SMU and then Wake Forest whos one of the better teams in the ACC and NC State come to Maples Pavilion basketall so the ball will go to the seminal I love love when the officials go to the replay to make sure they get it right but they do it in a timely fashion and sometimes they can get over there and seems like its three four five minutes and it just kills the flow of a college game which the beauty of the college game is that it has so much flow that was nice go over there get it right 30 45 seconds lets get back to the action here got a minute and a half left to play in a good basketball game single digits right now Florida State trying to get a uh a bucket Music here so here comes Florida state with the inbounds Y and Watkins back in theres Yan spinning no Reno with a rebound oh he had a good look Stanfords going to use some clock Florida State fouls Davis reachin and grabs blat well Davis has the foul right stop the clock you got to extend the extend the game unfortunately for Florida State they got the ball into the hands of one of their best Stanford got the ball in the hand one of their best free throws should we mentioned Blakes at nearly 86 from the free throw line so between uh Blakes and geler they can salt this thing away we got a 86 percenter and a 90er and theyre shooting shooting two in the double bonus Blakes is four for four from the free throw line today still perfect well hey and Theo Blakes uh Blakes mom there real all smiles and like any good mom she says make your free throws or no dinner yeah well 10point lead now under a minute to a half it might be too little for Florida too much rather for stor state to come and they turn the ball over there look at giler he dont want to give it up he knows Im a 90 shooter Ill go to the line of stroke a couple sers dunks it home adding to that career high total sers says nobodys going to pick me up after that trap Im just going to attack the wreck what a game this young man has had high Music 27 Yan got fouled Music go back to this one more time because after you get by the initial pressure of the defense the defense is at a disadvantage cuz they dont have as many men in the scoring areas that you do so sell says theyre not going to stop the ball well Im just going to be smart about it and take it right to the rack for the high percentage shot I like when players do that like there sometimes in a pro game theyll just sit there and hold it and just turn the ball over and give it to the other team but I always say in college you got the basketball and theres still a possession or two or it could be a shot clock violation you go in there and just jam Applause it happy for y he comes out of this game didnt have the the game he wanted obviously and theyre not going to get this Victory but its just enough opportunities for him to get to the free throw line to gain some conf confidence so even in a loss even in a loss theres something that can be Music learned Stanfords going to get their 14th win theres the foul that will send cam to the free throw line interesting I thought Ray no got that ball and he was going to attack the rock to make sure that he got his double double on the night but again a team first big guy only cares about the victory not about the statistics very impressed with that young man tell hes a mathematics major you got to be bright to go to Stanford like I was taking geology classes at North Carolina this guy hes out here taking math mathematics and chemistry and playing playing chess in the park with wiimin Yama they got the right guy leading him you know Kyle Smith was a great division three player at columb so hes a very bright guy trying to get the culture back here at Applause Stanford Watkins inside and gets fouled jir Watkins already has 18 now 20 and well go to the free throw line yeah I I for last I just cant figure out why Stanford cardal keep fouling like you got the game one give him the basket keep the clock ticking um stranger things have happened in college basketball games here I say that theyre going to come back and win the chances are extremely low with 25 seconds to play but almost you would think Watkins almost might want to miss this one on purpose and try to get the ball back he he look at the coach like hey coach what do you want me to do after the game the nothing but net crew will talk to oah sers who Im sure will be happy to share his experience of the career high 27 Applause points out of bounds Stanford basketball Im not 100 sure but I I I would think Watkins tried to back iron that ball so it would come out hard and almost gave his chance team a chance to to get that ball back but Le love this right here these guys going to play a full 40 minutes fighting for that ball slam slammed it right off of what was that b bowling and now theyre going to review on whose ball it is now so even though theres only 225 seconds left they want to get this right theyre very physical here yeah you mik was pushing caming and they went all the way down into the the front Road over here by the Gatorade bucket oh boy wiped out about seven chairs in that front row those big bodies uh it was mollik was it Watkins down there maybe it was Watkins in in game and battling for the ball they reviewed it quickly Stanford basketball I like this crew this officiating crew they get it done they get it they get it right and they move on heres a chance now Florida State set that that trap and see if they cant get a a turnover here remember its its only a threepossession ball game time out timeout Stanford their final timeout sellers had some issues inbounding the basketball yeah because the way the ball went out of bounds hes not allowed to to run that Baseline he put all that length guarding the inbounder he cant get that ball anywhere that wingspan of these simol players is just too hard to get that ball in Scott I wouldnt mind your perspective on the these new teams in the ACC so now Florida State travels 3000 Mi Stanford went back to North Carolina much to do about nothing or you think thats a big deal when these teams are now flying so far in playing these games oh 100 its going to add up over the course of what they got 20 ACC games that they play and everyones got to do it but at the same point in time I think what youre seeing the effect of is not tired legs for the Florida state seminal its the lack of the time in the practice gym right right like youre out on the road for one of the longer extended periods of time Pro the pros are used to it theyre used to going out and playing four or five games you go east west whatever but these college kids theyre not used to that this is the first time theyve ever had to do that to come all the way from the east coast and Tallahassee to come all the way out here to north northern California and theyve been out here since what what you say Monday so its just they just werent crisp tonight right they turned the ball over um they couldnt make shots thats the effect I think that youre going to see from these teams that either have to go east or they have to go west yeah yeah its certainly a different landscape than when you were playing yeah we had we had eight teams in the ACC I think the furthest we had to travel was up to Maryland although you did go 3000 mil away for school California guy went to North Carolina and there Justin Thomas grabs agar wall yeah I was Dean Smiths first recruit west of the Mississippi thats old I am back in 1986 he came out to my high school Wilson High School and Southern California fact we won the state championship right up the road uh in the old stadium where the Warriors used to play the Oakland alamic colene we beat a team from apose and for the state championship in 86 on my birthday that was a pretty May was a day after my birthday I think yeah close enough it was a Grace birthday present regardless we should have won it an 85 I had a couple seniors my junior year some Pro Scout some college Scouts there they they they froze me out we would have W it but uh yeah good group and one of my old teammates Neil weart put his state championship ring on social media today and got to have a little trip down memory lane here in Northern Cal you you went to paloalto high school how did you not come here right across well a couple reasons uh if I was better athletically and a student this is where I would have gone besides that everything was perfect yeah well I know about that I had the skills I didnt have the grades I told G Washington that was Rec who was recruiting me here at the time was working for Dr Tom Davis Dr Tom Davis who doesnt want to play for Dr Tom Davis right but I said I I cant spend every moment in the library I want to go out and get pizza and beers sometimes coach I cant do it Kermit Washington was on that staff Bruce Pearl Gary close is the Stanford upcoming schedule Syracuse on Wednesday at SMU in Dallas then wake comes here andc stay here and then a trip all the way back to Atlanta to take on Georgia Tech February 12th yeah thats quite the schedule theyre going to have to make some hay there that SMU playing some good ball you mentioned Wake Forest they were in a battle with Duke today Im not quite sure how that one ended up for him but the ACC at top of that ACC is is rough Clemson and theyre playing some good basketball too Stanford finally gets it in and the ball on the floor and a turnover well this is not been Stanfords finest Hour these final 30 seconds now the execution down the stretch here got coach Smith off that bench kind of looking looking bewildered as why cant we handle what we execute every day in situational closing out of games time and score and they keep coughing the ball up all problem for Florida state is that game clocks a little too short for them to be able to get the victory but theyre fighting in that type of teaching situation or learning situation may help them down the road Florida State Wednesday they got Virginia Tech thatll be at home in Tallahassee then to Boston College Notre Dame at wake and then Clemson theyll fly home tomorrow they wont fly home tonight uh the snow has left the ground it is still very cold in Tallahassee they have been gone since Monday and it will have been a tough trip here with a loss at Cal and if this holds true here a tough loss at Stanford 93 seconds left an eightpoint game the 93 seconds the longest of Kyle Smiths life its like how how can this 93 take this long yeah it it does seem like this last minute in thir 30 seconds has been an eternity but regardless of how long it takes he will be happy if his team walks off this court Victorious and yeah they theyll tighten some things up in practice before the next time they they have to step on the floor but all in all this little stretch here going back to the buzzer beater at North Carolina taking care of the two Florida teams Miami and Florida State hes going to be feeling real good about the situation that hes got himself in here for the second half of the season Yan will inbound opposite his bench Davis long shot M camon runs it down and Stamford ball now they want to review this too well see if they thats the second time Cams just taking a ball and thrown it off of someones backside and theyre going to look at this lets lets hope that they keep the expediency with Scott you have praised on how quickly theyve made these out of bound rulings for real because I got dinner reservations at Flemings after this and now were start I didnt mind it earlier but now he might start messing with my dinner reservation Im looking forward to a nice RI ey later Dave dont mess with the big mans meal theyre going to hold it for I dont want you to eat any more red vines before your dinner oh youre calling me out with my redes enough stop before the dinner man Im supposed to tell people Im on the pro prot diet now you are outing me here with my Red Vines and my Cracker Jacks I didnt mention the Cracker Jacks Cracker Jacks theyre theyre my favorite I cant go to a baseball game a major league baseball game without having a hot dog and some Cracker Jacks makes me feel like Im seven years old again all right lets see if theyre keeping your streak of a quick ruling on this yeah and they these guys have been great State basketball okay so oh wow okay again another another opportunity for Florida State work on their final you know play of a game with should they need this uh in a game where they might find themselves trailing by one or two points little curl action then back over the top thats good b b had a good look no and thats how it will end woo partner
