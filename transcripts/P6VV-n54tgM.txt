stars for the Catamounts that coach Tim Craft was praising He said they they think Kell is the epitome of this Western Carolina team and the mindset that they have coming in against Duke So Duke wins the tip and right away a turnover quick as they cant handle it and Western Carolina will be on offense actually trying a post up with Gunga in there in the low box And this team you I watched him play in Charlotte A lot of five out a lot of threepoint shooting a lot of action cutting to the basket Caleb Foster I believe got called for a foul there early One of the things that were going to see out of Western Carolina is just outside that threepoint line Theyre going to try to throw it up there a number of times just because of the size difference between these two teams As quickly as I say that Stanbury drives in and tries to make the layup It doesnt go Sar over to Evans Evans the hot hand not there yet Thats a good rush up the floor Uh Sar has been a nice pickup for this team Hes going to really develop as the year goes along But the elite defender gives them a lot of the little things out on the floor And Highland driving in It looks like thats going to be on Cameron Boozer first foul 43 consecutive home openers that they have been able to claim as a win And I know John Shy when you brought up the fact that the last time they didnt win the home opener it was Mike Shasheskis first game here Yeah its its been a minute since that has happened in this building But cheering um I tell you for Western Carolina this a big start is going to be critical Theyve done some nice things here early Getting to the free throw line you get a couple guys in foul trouble Like if they can get Boozer with the second foul that would certainly help their cause But this this is a Duke team record They can switch defensively virtually at all five positions Allen gets the second one to go Hes a 78 free throw shooter And that is the lead for Western Carolina cheering Boozer from three And that ones off the right side of the rim Didnt shoot He was 04 against uh against move against um Texas but you know in practice and preseason hes been a terrific threepoint shooter He does have that range Cabba looking to pass We wont see him shoot outside the paint very often No And theyre just playing center field off him defensively Keel shooting over the top there Hes got two and he was the guy I mean double figures against Cincinnati but I I think hes capable of a big game and theres a nice finish Yeah Cameron Boozer using the body all the way to the glass and gets fouled when he does it Cabbas first personal foul You know it was interesting Rick against Texas I thought he really had trouble finishing around the rim Um but so this a nice nice to see this early in the game But that was a very physical game down low And I think it looked to me like Boozer was expecting more contact when he was taking it to the glass against Nexus and it didnt come as much and he missed a couple layups just by a little too much force Yeah Make Well and plus just feeling Im sure the nerves national TV Dick Vital sitting over there you know all the expectations but uh he uh he rebounded nicely in the second half Yeah His dad was sitting in the stands too Yeah Yeah Oh hes going to Im sure hes going to be there a lot of games for the boys Yeah Highland shot blocked and Duke will bring it back up quickly And thats going to be called for the block on the Catamounts Evans driving to the hole There we go Theres Carlos You know there have been four fatherson national championship duos and Im guessing that the Boozer family would love to make that five The last time it was done was Scott and Shawn May How about the uh the brothers won four state titles down in Florida Yeah theyve played for USA basketball Uh thats the great thing about both Cameron and Kaden Theyve grown up playing ball their entire lives together on some of the best teams in this country Theyve played against team world as that three falls for Boozer See I think for him what he needs to do maybe hit a couple early inside like he did and then build out on his jump shot And uh now you know now you see the full arsenal Evans going to be called for the foul here Take a look Just a double screen on the left side He gets a wideopen look And that I tell you what too Ray hes pretty good putting the ball on the floor He can face up from 18 or so and put it on the deck Duke playing an aggressive defense and already a few fouls for them Three each as that ones off the mark Now thats a shot hes got to hit Those those are two relatively good looks right there And Western Carolinas got to knock those down We were here when they came in for shoot around last night as this one goes up and off for Caleb Foster but when the Catamounts walked in last night every single one of their players had their phone in their hand and they were wideeyed walking into Cameron It it was like the scene from Hooers when the kids go into the big gymnasium and theyre just theyre starruck I saw you taking some pictures too I wouldnt I wouldnt jump all over Western Carolina Im not going to say I wasnt starruck too This is a special place One of the first things I saw when I came into this place was your banner So it was pretty cool to be in here with you Well and you know even all the years I mean its still very special to to come back to this place and uh like you know the guys going back home to Carolina or guys going back to Kentucky you never lose that feeling Yeah So Western Carolina trying to attack the basket this time Kicks it out for three and its good Oh theyre going to call that one Well theyre going to look at it Yeah theyre going to look to see And um but you know what Thats actually a great possession if this counts Well the red light was on when the ball was in his hands So theyre going to say shot clock had expired Yeah And thats um unfortunately thats the type of possession thats really perfect for the Catamounts to use a lot of clock and then hit a three Well it doesnt count So at the first break its Duke 6 Western Carolina 4J DJ Reick Yeah he had a letter ready the night before at that game and I was broadcasting it and so all three of us were lined up when JJ hit the three right in front of the Duke bench It was a It was a cosmic moment Now both Boozer brothers are on the floor this time Payton with the assist Malik Brown throws it down I tell you he was a big loss for Duke at the end of last year with his injury Uh hes such an important player for this team Doesnt light up the stat line a whole lot but does so much out on the floor Im impressed with Western Carolina now attacking the basket as much as they have been Definitely outsized And this fall away for Kell is good Yeah they hes the guy I thought that they needed to have a big game didnt have a great shooting game against Cincinnati Kinya for three How about the bench coming in with five quick points here Yeah an 110 run They were on an 8 run until Kell knocked in that shot for the Catamounts And Stanbury tries the runner and its no good Dominion with the board I thought he was going to uh Sansbury was going to be the guy that Duke would really try to lock in on based on his performances early Boozer to Boozer That ones no good for Kaden And now Justin Johnson brings it up the court off to Kell Kell will take it 23 ft away and it doesnt go again with the rebound Crosscourt pass Kaden all the way to the basket and good and the foul Watch what happens The close out is too fast right here Hes out of control And great job by Boozer putting it on the floor You know Pway was just he you cant you have to be under control when you come out to the guy on the perimeter Boozer looking for the and one Both Kaden and Cameron Well right You see the size there 64 Yeah Hes the shortest guy on the team On the team Right Thats why I said when Western Carolina matches up they dont Its this is this is one of the taller teams that I can remember And which allows them a lot of flexibility switching you know when they when they are pressuring outside Johnsons three no good Kaden gets it over to Gumba and the Alioop attempt No good Kmena for three Thats off the mark and the Cavanaots come up with it Thats the thing to remember with you know all the threepoint shots in the game today The perimeter guys have to be good rebounders They have to hang in there John was telling us before the game hes hes wants his guards to have five or six rebounds a game That one stays with the Catamounts as it goes out of bounds Well coming up next CW football Saturday is coast to coast First off its to Chapel Hill which is just down the road from where we are as Stanford faces North Carolina Then after Dart Sam Houston visits Oregon State You dont want to miss a second of that action starting with CW Football Saturday Countdown partner other partner Tom Brenamman to be on the call for that game He was actually born in Chapel Hill Hospital cheering Little Nugget for back home Back home 136 as Duke cheering trying to increase that lead That one was tipped right there by Justin Johnson Coach Shier I asked him before the shootound today do you ever get nervous He said Of course I get nervous I mean this is this is a big setting uh obviously a big program but that nervous energy is great And he rises to the occasion and has risen to the occasion You know I think as a competitor as a player or coach if you dont feel that way it may be time to think about where you are in your career Kaden Boozer with a little runner That goes Western Carolina one of 10 on their last 10 shots Now thats one of 11 Kaden with the rebound Hell bring it up court Kamina fakes a three all the way to the basket and hes fouled on his way there I think with Kmenu thats the best way you know if youre an opposing team to play him try to drive him off the threepoint line make him go inside He does have great size a 68 freshman another one of the fivestar recruits Tim Craft coming in here he said the biggest thing they want from Western Carolina is they want to give them the experience of playing against a Duke They came off of playing against Cincinnati on Monday So two big games for them to start their season Its going to help them there They go home and they have their longest home streak of the year They played three games back in Kowi And now fullcourt pressure for the Blue Devils And what happened All right And they got lucky on that Now they can bring everybody from the front court But three of Western Carolina guys had their back turned going down the floor They were caught off guard Able to break the crash and theyll get over the timeline One of the things we heard from coach Shy was it doesnt matter how offensively youre doing if youre not on if your shots arent going as long as youre playing defense aggressively And that time with the moving screen Yep Turnover You have you have to let the player use you as a screen You got to be stationary and then play from there But that was you know and that was what kept Isaiah Evans off the floor last year as a freshman was the defensive end You know everybody knew about his offense Gunga throwing it down Yeah hes uh you know with Malik plays more Brown plays more on the perimeter Gunga not bad finishing around the rim Theyll throw lobs as well And Kell sneaks in gets the rebound there Massie for three and that ones off the mark Just a little hard Duna comes up with a rebound Good ball movement and that one falls short stands ready the rebound and hell up court That ones tipped Kell goes for it and it goes out of bounds Well see who the officials say its on Well the Cameron crazies are enjoying what theyre seeing Program thats going to get very competitive in this league very quickly Well in a formidable league obviously we talk about you know possible player of the year contenders as Stanbury looks like he got hit fairly hard Dominia going to get called for that one his first personal And here we are uh over eight minutes into the game Stanbury has not scored yet This is a guy that had 23 in their first game out cheering And that was one of my questions uh coming into this game is is this place and this team too big for Western Carolina to rise to the occasion Well I I think along with that maybe you know you start to get game film and you start to get scouting reports on a guy and Im sure that that game against Cincinnati got their attention and Stanford is a guy they were going to lock in on Good hustle there for Duke as they keep it alive and bring it down court And Cameron Boozer for three again That ones off Rebound that time by Dame Sar and it gets knocked out of bounds but it will stay with Duke I you know I think if youre an opposing coach youd really want them to settle for that And youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All States youre in good hands Speaking of good hands that was uh pretty good hands there by Western Carolina Yeah Im talking about Boozer shooting threes Um I I think as a coach Id rather have him settling for that shot as opposed to maybe put on the floor getting to the rim threepoint opportunities there that wide open shot for him being one for two right now Cameron with his make earlier on threepoint basket and that one a beautiful assist inside and Gungbo finishes Highland losing the handle there for a moment to Stanbury but Boozers first three as he gets the rebound that puts the streak of games with a threepointer to 1266 Think about that How many years that has gone on and big hit as Drews are on his way to the basket Just you remember a couple years ago Derek Lively for Duke played this kind of game They just would you know they do a little screening action some penetration roll to the rim and throw it up and let him do his thing Foster to Gungbo Im sure were going to see that all year long as Boozer at the line to shoot two And this is going to be a big part of an important part of Boozers game because he is going to be at the free throw line a lot this year His career stats from the free throw line Now remember that includes only includes Texas Right laughter Right Hes 75 from that game But I mean that that probably has a floor and you know like if somewhere between 75 and 80 would be fabulous Yeah It makes those two and now the gap is 17 Duke 23 Western Carolina six and a 15 to nothing run for the Blue Devils Catamounts just trying to get an open shot and this time Stanbury in cant get it to go and they made him go to his weak hand too you know trying to finish with his left Good scouting report there David Foxy to Boozer Boozers going to try to back down the smaller Tamari And it looks as though Donna Sar came down maybe on the defenders foot He went down immediately after he shot Well the great thing about that play is Boozer got double He had a he had a guard on him trying to take advantage Western Carolina had to send a double team and rather than force the issue nice crosscourt pass to Sar Yeah he just tweaked it a little bit Not too bad but bad enough Just came down on anothers foot Highland foot underneath him And so Sar goes to the line Sar another freshman who 50 from the free throw line And again thats career because its only counting against Texas from Tuesday Well first game I he was second on the team in rebounding uh let him in steals Uh you know all those things are going to be there Hell probably get the best offensive perimeter player on the other team Misses the second of three And now Malik Brown back into the lineup Sar out of Italy played for FC Barcelona Well this is certainly the most experienced lineup that Duke can put out on the floor at one time Most of their upper classmen are out on the floor Add to that Sar and Cameron Boozer Stanbury pass tipped to Kell Kell a little bit too hard Sar comes up with the rebound He takes it down court tries to go all the way and is fouled on his way up You know its amazing how on a rush on the offensive end of the floor those injuries get a little bit better Sorry not showing any ill effects from that tweak of the ankle but hammered on his way up So hell have two more So this will be five consecutive free throws for Sar Yeah First words out of uh John Shs mouth when we talked to him about SAR elite defender Yes Its the front end of the two shots there and Malik Brown grabs it and it is a jump ball Possession arrow goes to Western Carolina And Kamina is going to come into the game now for Sar And those are his hands are so active Rick Deflection I dont know how many deflections he gets during the course of the season but just incredible instinct for the ball Kells going to inbound this one And no pressure this time from the Blue Devils Highland brings it up Still trying to get their offense going Their last basket was at the 1549 mark until that one And Samari drains the three and they get up to nine So its 259 Western Carolina trailing Quick pass trying to get it into Cameron Boozer but its tipped Itll stay with Duke One of the other things Coach Sh had mentioned was trying to get the chemistry and thats one of the big reasons for the exhibition games that they played cheering the the Texas game this game with Western Carolina get these kids playing together and get that chemistry started And thats you know thats not something that you can just manufacture I mean it takes time and if and if it it doesnt exist it wont show up Boozer driving in two on him and he still is able to get to the rim and put it down Thats the thing I noticed about Cameron Boozer Hes as comfortable going left as he is going right May actually prefer going that way Thats going to be Fosters second foul Kaden Boozer comes back into the lineup for Foster again with two fouls Nine fouls already for the Catamounts Five for Duke Kaden trying to make sure Samari doesnt get anywhere got in and out for Kell you know and and Tim Crafts going to look at this game film and hes going to be okay with the looks that hes gotten from three They just havent knocked down shots Saw Evans throw up the three quickly Had a great game to start the season against Texas four for eight And a great hustle play there out of Seminia Didnt hit the rim shot clock Kaden puts it up It does hit the rim that time His brother rebounds it and back in You know thats when the shot clock is running down you try just try to get it up on the rim and leave that available And a drive to the basket is good for Western Carolina And a break That was a break for Western Carolina getting Boozer with that second foul Probably wont see him for the rest of this first half cheering Marcus Kell at the free throw line That was good A 736 free throw shooter You know Im always interested to see how coaches play guys with two personal fouls in the first half You know for some its just an automatic out and turnover Good defensive play there cheering Kaden Boozer a little unawares Little pressure there by the Catamounts and theyll get the ball back 17point deficit right now You know its funny when when you start when the ball starts going through the hoop your defense picks up a lot of times for teams And weve seen a little spark here from the Catamounts That three is good Same spot on the floor where he hit the last one And hes the one guy for this team thats played in this building Yeah Tomorrow uh he told me yesterday at their shoot around he said Yeah I remember being able to take my shot and made it He goes So I felt pretty good about coming back to camera Marorrow from the Bronx too So hes not intimidated by many K He was not He is not Sabaro great pass underneath and Cabba not able to finish Commen bringing the ball up Theyre uh their their five position are guys who are very much uh projects and uh maybe a little raw offensively Talk about at the top Isaiah Evans has not scored in this game yet for Duke Not for lack of trying though Well with and with Cameron Boozer out hes going to need to step up Shot clock down to five cheering and got it off in time Tomorrow to the ground going for that one cheering Fisher Brown back to Samaro 3 seconds on the shot clock fade away and its no good Isaiah Evans bringing that rebound down And theres going to be the reach CJ Highland with the reach there His second Take a look here at Samaro Instead you good step back Creates some space for himself Gets a decent look And these were some of the long rebounds that Texas was coming up with in that game on Tuesday Good hustle play there Evans at the line Good way here for Evans to get worked into the offense get to the free throw line knock down a couple start to build up a little rhythm there Break the lid off basket So again we talked about him coming off a 23point game against Texas and he makes both those free throws and hell step off the floor Sar back in for him cheering applause G man you were talking about you want to know what a coach does with a kid with two fouls and you just pointed to Cameron Boozer getting ready to come back in as Pway throws that one up and it doesnt go from the threepoint line Kaden Boozer for three out the right side Brown looked like he wanted to take the three Dada is going to distribute The two leading scorers for these teams have a combined two points so far and whistled before the shot Theyre going to call Kamina his second personal foul Heres a look And again if youre struggling its a nice job by Stanbury to just you know try to manufacture something Dont rely on your jump shot Get into the lane Stands very still cant get on the board Misses the first cheering Well and you know the the puck process maybe with John Shire and and Cameron Boozer Lets see if we can let him learn how to play with two fouls in the first half in this game Stan Barrys first points of the game He was the one who looked the most comfortable in the game against Cincinnati on Monday Cameron to Kate So Kaden working this ball to his brother and a foul right away as the ball came into it Well this Tuesday on NXT is the match that everyone has been waiting for A last man standing matchup between Trick Williams and Ricky Saints for the next NXT mens championship Winner takes all Dont miss NXT Tuesday at 87 central right here on the CW Boozer will go to the line the double bonus And we talk about what you know all that Cooper Flag did but one of the one of the main things that he did was he brought the ball up the floor a lot of times for this ball club last year So were going to have to replace that part of it And right now thats Caleb Foster that has that duty Kaden Boozer also be bringing the ball up the court Smith trying to take off before he had the ball Great defense right now by the Blue Devil cheering Shot clock down to one and that one goes long and a fight for the ball and multiple bodies on the ground Its a jump ball and Duke will have possession And with that were under four minutes Well take another break 17 points still the gap between Duke and Western Carolina game but uh they just not theyve not been able to hit open shots Dukes last field goal came at 732 on the clock You know theres a big discrepancy at the free throw line is where Duke is manufacturing a third of their offense Kaden drives in gets to his brother Cam Back out to Kaden for the three and thats good Yeah they had that whole left side of the floor cleared out for those two Good innout game Twoman basketball there for the Boozers Johnson trying to get it inside Gets it to Kell And it seems like Western Carolina just continues to look for a pass Johnson takes the jumper Its no good A long rebound for Donnie Sar and Sars going to drive it all the way to the basket Cant get it to go So the drought continues for Duke Well we talked about replacing flag and Sar has got the ability to carry the ball up the floor See just too many of those opportunities missed Great pass inside there crowd still enjoying what theyre seeing as a great hustle for Cameron Bruiser And that one goes up and no good So Darren Harris fouled on the shot Hell go to the free throw line And this is a great hustle from Cameron Boozer Yeah I tell you the white jerseys have been on the floor a lot going after loose ball showing good hustle getting those 5050 balls Those of you that are into that footwear uh youre the same as Darren Harris Its become a point of interest for him You never know what style hes going to bring to the floor had almost like a transparent shoe uh earlier this year Thats good Newest show in the iconic TV series Law and Order Toronto Criminal Intent is on the CW from the same team that brought you the original series This time in a new city and on a new network Law and Order Toronto Criminal Intent episode Wednesday at 87 central right here on the CW Tell you if I wore shoes like that when I played Id turn my ankles every single game It is crazy But the speed is so much faster too I mean I think these kids feel like they have got to be able to run and sprint up and down the floor cheering Anything other than high tops I was done there Just locked in on great move there to get some distance between him and his defender And thats his third point of the game Well and you know if he can have a good last couple of minutes here in the first half maybe find a little bit of rhythm carry some momentum into the second half Nice pass to Gumba and hell finish And Western Carolina is going to call the timeout Youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented for so long Three gold medals for him and shell carry on that tradition and maybe someday down the road that John Sh may be think about that Yeah In line for the USA basketball position Well the Boozer brothers combined right now 21 points four assists 10 rebounds you know and its I think so much attention is on Cameron that Kaden may be able to just grow at his own pace and and and blossom and and not have the the spotlight on him quite as much cheering We talked about bringing the ball up court Cadence taking the line share of that duty and he gets it to his brother once again And as you mentioned that whole left side just the two of them This time Cam shot falls short and at least they were able to take make him take a tough fadeaway jump shot instead of drawing contact D with the ball up top Tomorrow is going to drive in Do gets it tipped but Kell grabs it Kell the spin move loses the handle Cameron comes up with it and a sprint race down Caleb Foster hell lay it in Yeah one on three You know thats in my favor Why not I tell you what down the other end too with pretty good mantoman defense How about tomorrow Yeah hes come alive Julian Samaro throws it up there But in the prior possession Cameron Boozer with those two fouls defended off the dribble pretty good without picking up that third cheering And now theyre trying to call the timeout And so Duke will talk it over with 256 seconds remaining on the clock Normally as a point guard you look around If you dont have a lot of friends youd pull out and wait up laughter Not Caleb Foster Not Caleb Foster Its just Im going to take it right to the rack Fast break points You see six for the Blue Devils We mentioned with Tim Craft he looks to schedule games like this to get his kids experience playing at the highest level And obviously when you start off with Cincinnati as your first game and Duke your second youre going to play some stiff competition And you know Mike what do you learn from that What What are these kids going to take from this other than this is a tough road to hoe Yeah I just anytime you get in this environment and play it against an elite level you see where you would aspire to get to and uh this is going to help them when they get into the Southern Conference for sure and and Tim Craft thinks hes got some guys who are banged up right now and as he gets healthy he think he likes hes very positive about what they can do this year in his league and Tim also said you just dont know anymore in this in this environment of college sports because of the portal and because of kids transferring all the time you never know what a team that may have been great a year ago is going to be like this year as we see Boozer shot just a little bit off you talk about a tough schedule for Western Carolina How about Duke and their nonconference schedule Well I you know thing I love this with with all the best teams are playing each other intraconference games Kansas the lost to Carolina last night Arkansas U Florida Gator national champion you know Tom Isizo and then John always likes to play a nonconference game later in the conference schedule They have Michigan later on in the year Harris and Malik Brown are coming back on the floor Thatll put Cameron Boozer on the bench for the final 13 and a half seconds which is smart with two fouls Yeah you dont want the You dont want the third coming that in this instance Isaiah Evans making that second free throw Hes not made a bucket from the field He missed all three of his three attempts cheering but his defense is great And right now hes putting the pressure on Stanberry Stanberry off the mark there and Ken Booer actually hits the rim throwing that one up Impressive Want to try to climb back in this game for Duke I would look for Isaiah Evans to be a little aggressive here early in the second half He only had three field goal attempts in that first half Cabba hands to Kell Kell drives right side and well guarded as Highland stumbles heading to the basket Turnaround jumper and its not going to go You know with Kell he had a good start but uh nice ingame adjustment They really locked in on him defensively Dungbo with a turnaround and he knocks down the first two of the second half Hes just getting good possession deep I really has been lopsided in the paint for Duke and offensive foul there And so Stanberrys shot that did go doesnt count 22 to four And maybe John Sh said you know lets maybe calm down on the threes a little bit in the second half and go inside and take advantage of where weve really been successful Foster over to Boozer Boozer Great pass there as Foster catches and puts down the two You got five guys out on the perimeter Youve got plenty of passing lanes and cutting lanes Kell drive to the basket and gets it underneath defenders for the bucket Foster driving in Itll kick it back out Junga trying to figure out who to get it to Cameron driving in and double pumps Cant get that one to go up and under Not bad by Cobb Just keeping his feet not going for those pump fakes Between drives in and I think he might have been brought up Yeah he was halfway between pass and shot Yeah he thought Cabba was going to go up for it Cruiser misses that one from three with a foul on the rebound Well this Veterans Day News Nations Leland Vidder takes you inside Americas most historic military academy West Point and sits down with bestselling author Bill OReilly to explore the

talked about you know Shasheesky and setting the tone John Sh has picked the ball up right there and kept going with it with team bonding You know I spoke spoke to assistant uh coach Tyler Thornton um who made a great point and you know we talk about the depth of Duke Their practices are really good and really competitive and if you want to get better as a team thats really critical and not a lot of college uh programs have that where they go that deep and you can have a great five on five workout Stanbury thought that Justin Johnson was going to expect that pass the old Princeton back door pass but uh Johnston wasnt expecting it off of his shins And now theyre going to take a look see who it actually went out on and what John waved it off Um but um yeah and well and the other thing too I mean he talked about his you know evaluating his team and we talked about those tough uh exhibition games followed by Sar there he said you know until the games count you really dont know right and and he started to really learn about his team in the Texas game Yeah the two exhibition games very important obviously to the team cheering Yeah they are what they are But until the lights go on for real Yeah until it counts Until the record starts to be kept a little jumper at free throw line No good So misses from 15 Caleb Foster sets up all the way in and that ones blocked Pretty nice play by Dada Given some room gives it to Johnson Johnson drives in Cameron Boozer on him defensively and that one doesnt grab iron Dada with the rebound cheering Stanberry underneath the reverse layup Doesnt go uh just trying everything and just cant take anything to drop today Evans kicks it out to Boozer Boozer over to Foster Good ball movement Sar for three No good Stanbury is going to pull it down Hands off to Johnson Johnson up and under as well And that ones good And one applause Pretty nice take by Justin Johnson I I thought it didnt look like he had his steps right and he might have even might even gotten away with the travel But that euro makes it look presentable Guys in the chief seats up here saying watch his feet Yeah Well its only a travel if its called Thats right cheering Johnson for the and one Johnson a 684 free throw shooter transfer from Arkansas State and that one wont go Brown to Evans Evans to Gunga And that one a foul on the way up Second foul there for Johnson You know just a really unselfish play Heres a guy who the you know the afternoon hes not scoring like he would normally like to but uh get the pick in the lob Youre going to see that a lot from the big guys at Duke this year Edison Gunga line 722 from the free throw line Youngs mom and dad both played at George Washington Actually his mom She was the alltime leading scorer for George Washington with 2134 points They just they need him to stay healthy He was hampered by some injuries last year plus had tough time getting on the court and he was the third best center on the team Finya comes in for Gungba And thats you know Gungba again a guy maybe not happy with his minutes his freshman year Maybe jumping in the portal See if theres something else somewhere You know be decided to hang in there and say Hey Ive got an opportunity this year Stanberry for three No good And that one Stanbury tips out of bounds as we go into the 16minute mark Well take a quick break Duke leading 542 29 point difference Uh Hubert Davis wanted to do was get bigger with his squad Massie in the lineup and Cabba gets it back cheering to Johnson drive in Nowhere to go Dell with the runner into the paint and thats good Just its a lot of guys just trying to do things off the dribble and you know get get their team back in it but its a tough thing to do against this defense That one gets tipped out of bounds Darren Harris driving to the basket Harris the pass inside Evans all the way to the basket and one holding his forehead Well see where the contact was but theyre saying foul to the head First foul for Damasi Yeah definitely got him across the forehead Yep And uh that was that was excellent concentration to finish with his off hand too Going in with the left getting hit Pretty strong play And that was the thing John Sh talked to us about He got a lot stronger over the course of the summer finishing the threepoint play cheering Evans with seven points now as Western Carolina goes back to work on the offensive side See blocked Kaden Boozer Euro step that one blocked and thrown out but a little bit of contact there So foul called on Samaro again What Malik Brown can do for this team defensively You think hes beaten off the dribble and he makes a terrific play from behind on that block Thats fourth foul by the way for Simaro Watch this You think he he thinks hes got an easy layup and uh thats just great pursuit now down at the other end makes the first of two Evans will come out and back in And that one off the front of the rim for Kaden cheering Massie drives to the basket That one blocked as well Theyre going to call this one goalending though Possibly did hit the glass first Yep Yeah he did a nice job And there basically what Western Carolina has been doing is giving guys clear outs And he had the whole right side that time Brown just a little bit late That was a good call Hit the glass first Cant touch it They did And two points Western Carolina cheering Cameron brings the ball down court Kaden for three off the left side I tell you thats a weapon that has not been there for Duke this afternoon Great pass inside and Cabba finishes Nice job running the floor Beautiful pass on the other side and Malik Brown puts it in Those are just the quiet points I think that hes going to get He never really you know seeks out his offense If its there hell take it cheering Dominion all over Johnson but Johnson shoots right over the top of him That fade away for two And Western Carolina looking a lot more comfortable in the last five minutes offensively Ken Doo driving in Thinks better of it Tried to get the pass inside It gets tipped but out to Cameron Bruiser Kaden trying to finish on the inside and hes fouled We take a look at the passing in this game and Western Carolina trying to get around these long bodies Yeah if youre a big man run the floor and you can catch the ball youre going to get some easy chances And there you see on back on transition defense Catamount asleep Brown just very opportunistic Kaden gets that one to go Young B and Foster coming back into the lineup Harris and Malik Brown will both take a breather Smooth for Kaden Boozer 10 points already for Kaden now Under 13 minutes to play and Stanbury gets it off inside and now clocked down to 4 seconds cheering Doesnt hit iron again This time Cameron Boozer goes up to grab it Gunga tries to drive to the basket Loses the handle Yeah he probably shouldnt be putting the ball down that far from the basket Fisher Brown a little bit too strong off the glass Cameron again with 14 points in the first half Foster kicks it out Cameron for three Good And thatll say Tim Craft 34 points is the difference between the two The last outing between these two teams They played three times before The last outing ended 10454 And actually associate head coach Chris Carowwell played for Duke in that game when they took on Western Carolina That was back in the 90s Stansbury pass a little bit too high The young lady in the stands was open She caught it Ready to shoot Samaro wasnt ready for it to go that high Dominion for three Good Hes al hes also a guy Rick the guy I dont know if people are talking a whole lot about him but uh he could be a big asset for this group with another assist for Cameron Boozer and falling to the floor that was Dada he gives it up and a great drive to the basket by Caleb Foster in transition their guards are pretty aggressive and wanting to take the ball all the way to the rim You got to get turned around and stop people Stanberry still cant find it from outside the arc Foster starts the offense over to Cam Cam drives in and tries to get Gungba Dungba tips it Cam Boozer grabs it and slams it down 19 now for Cam Just too much size And Gunga tried with the one hand to finish the play but it ends up in their favor McKe trying to get rid of it Samaro now back to the basket Dada and Diamasi doesnt know what to do with it 1 second on the clock and I dont know if it was out of his hands in time And if this were the Carolina game they maybe challenged one but they didnt there No of the rebound and the put back Carolina gets it An attempt for Gunga there and he felt like there was too much contact as he was going to the basket Samaro lays that one in Hes pretty quick with the ball off the floor Now its 37 points between the two Kamin tries to force it underneath but that one was tipped by Chase McGee Tomorrow too long cheering Kaden back to Cameron Cameron for three Good And I think thats where a lot of his shots are going to come from this year too as a trailer in that play as everything gets compressed right at the top of the threepoint line 30 second timeout called and Duke now 7737 You saw I saw a lot of the plays in Texas like he was taking the ball inbounds and he would be the trailer last man up the floor in that break and thats a great look Nobody on him Clean three Yep And right now you see the Boozer brothers 32 points 14 rebounds nine assists between those two Weve talked about player of the year We come off of a Cooper flag season that he won every award And now youve got front runners like Cameron Boozer Muel Brown were going to see him next week for Louisville Burton Williams two transfers in and uh some new head coaches there Will Wade is I think going to doing a great job over at NC State And uh I tell you what from the perimeter Louisville and Pat Kelsey they have got some firepower from the outside Stansbury looked jumps to the corner of the line and drops it So a nice little jumper there out of Port Stanberry And thats his fifth point of the game Dominia for three That ones off the front of the rim and Stanbury will hustle it up the floor tomorrow Great pass inside to Cabba and hell finish I think this is going to be a decent film really for Tim Craft to look at Um theyve done some nice things offensively in the second half They felt a lot more confident I think Malik Brown to Evans Evans cant get it to go Second time hes tried to finish with his left hand Stanbury beautiful pass underneath but that was Cabba once again not being able to keep the hands on it And Duke will take over Yeah And and Stanbury wasnt very happy with the quality of his pass I think if it was a little softer he might have been able to catch that Easy three for Brown Good that open look when youre undized Brown able to just shoot right over the top of defenders Well Duke much better Five of 10 in this half Nice play Tomorrow jumps in front of that pass Highland driving in and Kell now working with it This time Kamina sticks a hand in there and gets it free It was sorry He should have passed but he didnt He would have been better giving that one up You know other side Abai Cababa throws it down off to the assist And now Sar drives in loses the handle cheering Stanbury all the way to the basket and it doesnt go Youre going to find especially in this second half Western Carolina down 37 cheering And that lob pass not very long Well and what Duke has always done they put the big guy on the inbounder out of bounds and its really disrupted K FOR THREE NOT GOOD BUT A HUGE FINISH for Stansberry The rebound and the slam Little late but hes announced his presence here He sure did there Gungba to Boozer Boozer for three and its good Yeah theyre theyre not too concerned with you know theyre like I said I think theyre going to be happy with him shooting threes but hes risen to the occasion Yeah Tries to force that one in And two bodies go to the ground Finish here in an un otherwise unmemorable afternoon That was a great play Boozer fires right back from three And hes gotten some really good looks where hes been able to get his feet set squared up and take a nice in rhythm shot And that may be the afternoon for number 12 Well Harris came off the floor as well CJ Highland up against Kaden He kicks it over to Samaro and he drops the three Malik Brown the shoulder and thats going to do it for the offensive foul Seen Caleb Foster come off the floor That might be the last we see of him Yep Terrific afternoon for the brothers The dad should be very happy Stanberry looks like hes got his second wind and then loses it You know and we talked about it for Stanberry All hes seen all afternoon are 66 67 guys guarding him Not going to see that in the Southern Conference So youre probably not going to see a lot of Gunga throwing up the three either but he did there Kell cheering up in the air Had nowhere to go with it And now Evans for three That one wont go after a big night against Texas from threepoint line Four for eight Evans struggling And the block there by Gunga And looks like flat foul on the floor For Evans things really took off in that game when he hit it When he hit made his the first three then he hit like ripped off four or five in a row but uh has never found the range in this game Oh of five from three One of seven for the game Yeah just hasnt fallen for him Cabba will come back into the lineup for the Catamounts and Natada back to the bench And the Catamounts just over five minutes still to play Trying to put some more points on the board Highland turnaround jumper Its not going to be good Commina back on the wing Booker Evans Evans Kamina Commin for three off the front of the rim Evans with the rebound The layin wont go cheering but the follow by Malik Brown Beautiful Yeah Evans just kind of hung his head after that Thats is hes you know thats converted 99 out of 100 times The big slam for Cabba Maliks not going to shoot the three Kmena tries to drive in but fouled on his way in I tell you what I mean Cabba fouled out against Cincinnati had uh one one point in that game Did have four rebounds but hes putting together a pretty nice line in this game Three four shooting six points six rebounds Good afternoons work Definitely hustling Everybodys standing around Yeah On the front end of the one and one They werent sure what was happening there So cheering Dominion knew that when it came off the front of the rim he had to get the rebound And a foul there for Kaden Boozer A lot of McDonalds AllAmericans on the Duke side Kaden brother Cam Kamina cheering Yeah I you know I Im Im not a huge fan I dont put a lot of stock in All right Number one recruited class number two number you know and thats fine Theres got to be a metrics I guess for everything But you know I I just wait till I see how does it translate up on this level Great fake cant finish but Sar does So a foul on the play Thats done it Todays player of the game sponsored by Progressive Get covered 25 points eight boards five assists and four of nine from three And actually he didnt really didnt struggle I dont think he missed from three in the second half Ifuku comes in iffy cheering from Nigeria out of Benon City came from Rice Transfer there See Cameron Sheffield coming over from Rice Pass underneath and Highland up in the air kicks it back out but a foul And I think its worth noting too that for Duke they they didnt lose anybody in the portal You know they they kept guys They added a great freshman class and they added some guys but um you know its all uh you know they theyve been able to retain some of their talent They just you know you lose five guys in the NBA draft I mean that says a lot about your team last year Line change for Western Carolina Here comes Sheffield and Jack Scott will come in the lineup for Duke Jack Scott at Princeton transfer So he had a he came as an upgrade in his education cheering Is that laughter Is that where youre going with their Duke graduate Thats what Im going with Highland at the line I dont have to hate start laughter It wont take long Dont worry cheering And knocks down the first one Actually if you have been on campus the we matter of fact when I was with the Nets we used to have training camp down at Princeton and the architecture the stone everything is very its its a this is a carbon copy of that school and its its eerily similar to walk around up there I will agree with you as my son went to Princeton so Ive been able to experience both and I appreciate by the way the tour that you gave me the last couple days Well they theyve done you know they the basic footprint of in here has been the same Theyve done a lot of you know little small things here and there but the concourse and the surrounding areas really just a fabulous job of building out Kaden Boozer with a nice little touch there from 8 ft Duke putting in the less experienced lineup for the final three minutes Another foul there You know I I made a comment earlier Rick about you know the rankings of high school recruiting classes And you know really for you go to Carolina you go to Duke or you go to Kentucky or you know you might have been the best player in the country in high school but theres when you put that jersey on and step out on the floor as a freshman its a different deal Yeah You know its its more than just a one year progression up and you have to learn how to play with that uniform on One of the other things with that is these kids now in the AU programs and the high schools cheering that theyre playing at and a lot of guys as we see the second miss there the three no good but a lot of these guys are playing for national teams USA basketball and theyre getting theyre getting that experience as well in the U7 U8 ranks and the other thing too and for all all of them I mean with the you know with cell phones and and social media and everything these guys all the cheering the upper echelon know each other right You know like I I didnt I knew nobody you know I didnt know anybody at the other schools here And you know it was a different era as far as that was concerned Yeah Everybody changes numbers when you go to a camp or a tournament Yep Next thing you know you might be your teammate Sheffield drives in contact Cant make it go And I know the the crowd here always loves these minutes for these guys You know they dont get a lot of court time Scott he cant get it to fall Hard pass and he contains it Three on the WAY AND ITS GOOD JACK SCOTT THROWS IT DOWN And you mentioned the Cameron Crazy going crazy That may have been the loudest cheer weve had so far today game D three no good Cabbas going to come back in like but they do such a great job spacing and looking for one another and getting clean looks Jack Scott started four games for Mitch Henderson at Princeton before coming here to Duke Great pass inside to Cabba and he lays it in Great to get these minutes against somebody other than your own teammates too Yeah And you know you you get you get sick of practice and as good as and and competitive as they are Under a minute and a half to play Cruiser kicks it out to Sheffield He drives in this time More contact Still not called and it wont go Pway Brown No good Jeffrey pulls that one down and Boozer Gives off to Harris Harris drives in and a cheering great finish there Puts it down and will shoot from the free throw line Well I tell you no matter which of their bigs are in there they do a nice job keeping their hands ready on any kind of penetration either you know for the pass or for the lob You in the game today I got to give the coaches a lot of credit because the season is so long I mean were were in the early part of November right And you think about Dukes nonconference schedule that theyve got to play Then they start conference play and its 4 months before they even get to March So its its a long hall to keep your guys focused and healthy and healthy and you know and all the things in between Right Fu 611 out of Nigeria Three countries represented in the Blue Devils lineup cheering and mishandled there It goes out of bounds and it looks like itll stay with the Catamounts now Nope Looks like Dukes going to get it Claire Aubrey official has to cheering go in and chat with Pway and Boozer Highland coming in Boozer throws it up Looks like he was hoping that was going to go up for it I think the crowd right now is looking for something spectacular Theyre hoping for greatness here from this lineup are just stealing the ball Well and I you know and I look about you know the score and his production and despite the score that uh you know John Sher having Kaden Boozer out there still running things getting that valuable time at the point guard 14 points now for Kaden Boozer And under 30 seconds to go cheering through Hollyfield with a great pass there Couldnt be controlled 3 seconds on the shot clock Hollyfield for three No good Cabba looks like he was a little bit higher than Cameron Sheffield there but he knocks it out of bounds 68 to play And thats going to do it for the home opener from Duke here at Cameron Indoor Stadium Big win 955
