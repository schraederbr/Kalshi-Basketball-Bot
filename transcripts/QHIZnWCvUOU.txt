well a rebound at a real high rate and Syracuse is not a good rebounding team so the size Factor can be really big in this game and advantage in that way and hes talking about Duke I cant wait to see the convince and Gerard theyve been playing great basketball in that backcourt for Syracuse well Duke lately has been dominating the series but theyve been a lot of great games played between teams coached by Jim Boeheim and of course previously by the great Coach K and now John Shire at the helm hes 35 years old Jim Boeheim is not 78 we got one of the Ole Miss coaches in the game who won any Humvees coaches in the game garage really played well Applause in traffic and gonna turn that one over scooped up by Proctor as that zone psychological it keeps worrying so much about the zone is the rebound and again getting a second opportunity already right out of the gate thats their strength Jeremy roach the 62 Jr very much the leader for this Duke team and hell pop it up couple of quick chart overs here let me give you a look at the starting lineups presented by Kay Jewelers mints Gerard Bell Brown and Edwards Jesse Edwards right in the middle at 611 for Jim behind is coming off an outstanding game against NC State Here Comes Proctor shot hell switch it in 83pointer nice little twoman play right there Queen clocked him a roach whos wide open on a wing and knocks it down he could be a key to this game against the proof result of Jimmy behind and for Duke K Jewelers starting five Roots Proctor Mitchell Lively and philipowski whos averaging 15 points nine rebounds a game thats quickly done to Edwards Jay Edwards has played exceptional basketball recently keep the image though Dave hes going to stay out of foul trouble hes fouled out of five games Jim says thats really not been a problem with the Flying Dutchman when hes in there he can wreak havoc Lively on the Baseline one dribble down Mitchell heavy traffic down it goes Claire Mitchell made a big big three in the last game to beat Notre Dame came back strong Duke was up 14 in a game its like turning them all over now the Freshman can hit those threes Duke is not a good threepoint shooting team traffic is brown and gives that one away Duke on Top early 52 heres proxer from the corner Mitchell thats a mansized rebound phillipovski with one dribble to the deck backs it down theres the exact example we were talking about a couple of show the rebounding power of Doom that is wanted a great stretch a rebound and a defend well we do those two things youre going to be in basketball games the way Duke can play defense Syracuse cannot afford to get buried early great tough to come back against Duke theres Edwards and draws the foul Lively with the personal talk about to cut the diaper Dandy Moon speaks the driver spit moves and get freed down low theres that Witcher from Amsterdam gets the second opportunity lays into his left hand in and out for Edwards he makes 74 or four percent got the line just getting started theyre expecting a giant student section today maybe a record Setter from what were told inside the Dome is Edwards makes the second I think one of the keys you over the student body here coming out theyre all fired up today and put the brunch and were all over that place going wild speeding Lively on the Baseline boy that was tough defended well by su on the Baseline Gerard trying to get started back for Edwards Gerard will lift a long one and hit in the act of shooting a three is hes hit by Mark Mitchell so three shots coming for Joe Gerard so one of the keys too is if youre Syracuse now you want to get this crowd really loud and do it big time so its really important that you dont fall behind big early in the game well Joe Gerard the senior from Glens Falls New York Applause state of New York people like 58 game up in high school its unbelievable well have three shots hes 85 percent as Ryan young enters The Fray Lively coming out for Duke you know Gerard this year is playing off the ball Dave and its really helped him last year he was really playing the point guard slot we had buddy bayheim as a score how hes playing off the ball but hes more comfortable being a scorer and hes a leader up front lets go 23 real active good hands well like the way to a plane now two three theyre gonna cover those wings theyre trying to penetrate Gerard good D got in front of him some other problems youll get great block on Saturday nights home and the huge size they can get some second opportunity shot clock is down to two roach straight on and cant bury the triple defense right there they rotated as a team five people and every movement of the basketball they move together getting Justin Taylor a freshman of the game heres mince thats what he really has to work on what do you think I mean should he come back for another year oh absolutely I think theres no damage I know hes being right now some of the uh mock draft some second round of Iowa minutes I will be back here Id worked every day 500 shots every day working on my farm Jerry McNamara to teach me how to shoot really because he adds that he goes and becomes a the mid first round draft choice the following year Mitchell knocking down the midrange averaging about nine points per game Applause just under 16 as we get started inside the Dome 962 Edwards working on young some contract taken away by philipowski he puts it to the floor Vince will commit the foul as he poked at it from behind well a special guest in the house when we come back to the Dome great to see that young man looking so well when you automate Hamlin who collapsed on the field a Monday night football against the Cincinnati Bengals CPR saving his life after cardiac arrest and boy he looks great he is recovering dick and the whole country continues to cheer him on yeah what a great story inspiring so many the love he received the prayers the whole nation United at that moment it was just amazing to show what our country could do with that one magical word love love one another if we love one another and they should be so much better than what it is with old I think yeah he is touched on many of those themes himself in his recovery Proctor as the pass tipped out by Syracuse up to handle it brown to try to make the spectacular passer Edition throwing a little bounce pass Deuce doing a good job trying to get into gaps it seems in that zone you can see that prepared for this homework on it slows you down a little bit offensive he could be able to attack that ball and patience thats not patience right there baby thats one of my passes I would throw that you dont expect that from a scholarship player John scheided through those kind of passes lets say one thing did he shoot the Rock some pension I can play too can you look at the guys on that bridge coaching his assistant AllAmerican in his own right youre right but 35 years old going up against the Hall of Famer at 78 Jim Boeheim so thats a fascinating match up the whistle here with 1502 to go his first season as head coach and the youngest coach in the ACC quite a gap in experience Proctor will pick up the foul recently hes been on fire attacking defenses yeah Mark Mitchell given the foul there Music so its your ride to get it in Gerard with a triple no filipowski got shot took a shot right on the bridge of the nose there you got to make your shots with a good seconds and third rebound was too strong but a few governors I thought about about a 23footer lost the dribble heres mince great on the penetration Banks it in with a pretty shot two thats a big time move right there great first step and tag very aggressive see if he can add as part of his whole weapon he can add the jump shot Applause a young hell kick it Whitehead cant hit it thank you very much in a crowd of about 30 000 expected inside the Dome at Syracuse certainly the Duke Factor very much at work here today Dave OBrien alongside of the Hall of Famer the great dick by towel and Chris button with us as well On The Run young cannot connect Duke will get a second crack at his bill theyre on top by one a lot of turnovers early and mints with the stuff showed his speed and athleticism oh baby if you get on the average this stock would go up and up like yours is going Dave your stock is on such a rise new contracts ESPN Red Sox wow its great to have Vicki v as your personal agent I can tell you that in the paint philipowski lost the dribble snooked up five minutes heres Joe Gerardo comes in averaging 17 and way downtown he drills the three thats like a layup there he really gets the open jump shot hell knock that down he loves his new role these new roll leads I am going to be here last year he was the point guard setting people up like the Mayhem Brothers oh the place is electric down the lane goes Whitehead Tariq Whitehead to freshman for two talking about a guy us all kinds of talent and ability we saw him shooting those jumpers to the rougher bench hey two big threes against Virginia top angle on that one by the Syracuse Orange Malik Brown Duke by the way with four turnovers and about the last three and a half minutes wow grandison from the corner no and Edwards there for the rebound Jesse Edwards one of the more underrated players in this league which are great I absolutely agree especially the way hes been playing this year getting better and better he looks amazing this whole team could come back I think a lot of thats going to be determined whether or not Jim behind comes back then I really do I think that Jim made a big mistake theres no doubt about it but he went off about the fact that I wont make the call nobody else but me I think I really got people a little upset they were in a hierarchy but I think that Jim being such a good guy when you know him was an emotional an emotional rant damn DG knows its going to be two people the university and him sitting in the sightings about the future shot clock down to 10 for Syracuse bottled up on the Baseline but somehow got that pass to Taylor Taylor got a good luck but couldnt connect tell us no tensions score that you make for three threes got a whistle a foul on the deck with 11 53 to go here in the first half thatll go against Torrance well What a Feeling here Damar Hamlin is in the house just got a giant Ovation Dave Bing is here as well and another very special guest as well arent you glad he is here Music Applause Music Applause John wild hack the athletic director here at Syracuse delighted to have Dicky V here Dave Bing is here Syracuse Garden star now the mayor of Detroit in the house so he was the mayor of Detroit no doubt about it but hes certainly a hero in Detroit hes done wonders of that City and we know what a great player he was he teamed up the senior year with bayheim in the backcourt what a backward they were they probably average like 35 between them being an average 34 and Jim one it might have been pretty close actually Dave was such a superstar but theyre so delighted to have you back here its been a long time wow it just really was great John wellhack with the tribute they gave me I really thankful to see these fans and John was my former boss at ESPN Mitchell with a misfiring close so first game back for you here inside at home since 2017 you got a giant Ovation from about 30 000 here youve seen a lot of great games here that was one of the most Commando and John Dillon is that desperation three dude that was a good team with Jason Tatum who I loved I think Tatum and brown as good as the tandem youll find in the NBA whos the best Syracuse player you ever saw oh I love with the Pearl he was just because of Flappy you have to actually Derrick Como was a Windex man hes the clean that glass oh my goodness perfect Lively great execution against the Zone Slide the guy to the high post area beside a guy behind the zone and throw the lob to a guy that can finish it off cant answer Whitehead with a rebound tied at 13 Music thats one of his options hes actually defensively hes an excellent ball handler hes an excellent penetrator hes just like really worked on that shot I mean Jerry McNamara fine assistant with six threes when they won the National Championship 2003 hes gonna Im sure hes working with him he got to come back to school next year Whitehead drains that one he can flat shoot it hes a big time player we have not seen this kid yet as his potential where it is hes had so many injuries hes lost time but you can just see all the potential watching him under 10 here in the first half and a festive atmosphere today up top its mints getting it Edwards on a spin still working and working the defense too tight and a roll three and a great save there as Syracuse will get it back Torrance and theyre going to wave this one and send it the other way with 9 41 to go hey look at this diaper damn he strips him right there and he goes in with the little high rise even a great Elevate shoot up up and away and I missed the white hatches you know you could do that but I could do this and then its the Lively inside Shows way he was preseason came in as the number one player in high school because all the unbelievable attributes he possesses great size jumping ability 71 hit a great game against North Carolina he has it feels like one out of every two Duke block shots this year the Lebowski turns and cant drain it you and I saw him a week ago he had a terrible game for him against Virginia he did not score in a controversial defeat bounce back against Notre Dame at 22 22 he was really sharp against Notre Dame had a little ankle problems well theres no doubt hes one of the five best type of dandies as far as an impact player of all year Williams will knock that one down the twopointer by Penny Williams as we bring in Chris button OB Shire told us that he took that loss really hard putting up zero points with a possibility for winning at the line he was incredibly Downing stars that I had to be positive I didnt tell him you just gotta flush that down it happens with these parts when youve seen him made a wall he actually told Sarah earlier in the season he didnt realize how hard it would be to play on the road in these kind of environments Whitehead from way downtown we were talking all three of us to John in a locker room before the game and you can tell that intensity really Burns there and that was a really tough loss to take because there wasnt much of an explanation for him at the end of the Virginia game you should have been on the freethrow line there was no doubt about it Edwards brought a lot of attention downstairs like that got to bring it back to that so he wasnt he was tenacious he stayed right with him up at the loose ball and scored hes been really a factor in the post today you have 16 to 10 and theyve lost some heartbreaking Lawsons they lost the entire Carolina Miami Virginia all highly rated clones beat him right in single pigeons Williams so short rebound taken away by Proctor another freshman for a young Duke team Applause the Lebowski seven times has been rookie of the week in the ACC and a chilly start for the big man Im here Torrance will set it up now for Jim behind Applause Torrance with a onehander off the iron we talk about the crowd here today and Su traditionally is among College basketballs top attendance leaders but tenants has been down this year a 20year low coming into this game still getting about 18 000 a game Mike Waters wrote about to enter this paper 17 000 watch you stay with the ball 17 000 of the average a lot of schools wish they could average 17 000 its unbelievable Sonic cheeseburgers are made with 100 beef and melty American cheese it has been a wild February lets focus first on the last two weeks for the Blue Devils starting at home they bring their rivals in for John shires first time as the head coach coaching in that rivalry they get the emotional win but then the Trap game they got to go on the road against Miami and it was everything that it was kind of caught up to be against the canes and then they go to Virginia a chance in this one on a wild ending they thought they got the foul that could have won it but the end loses one in overtime on the road and then there is Coach K coming back to Cameron Indoor for the first time since retiring they get the win over Notre Dame and then that brings you into this game a huge Road game for the Blue Devils John Shire said you have to be able to go on the road and pick up these kind of games not just for your resume guys but because of the confidence Builder that this would be for these freshmen thats what that Virginia game could have been thats what this game could be too on the road brought to you by Conrad you know hes 130 at home and he can become only third coach in their first year as a head coach blemished at home the other two Jim Boeheim right here at 76 didnt it and John Calipari did it in 2008 is a factor down to two Granderson way downtown thats where the gun Brandon said to shoot the three did that really well in Illinois although it must have tough one to go to Indiana Tracy Jackson Davis was phenomenal a really good basketball game drop a whistle foul here against circus theyll go against Hima became crashing its 6 42 to go here in the first half hey what you go 160 at home in the first year coaching thats pretty impressive and right now they got three more home games they could certainly play up to play an NC State probably the toughest to hear Louisville but youre doing the game and they also have a Virginia Tech Duke today bidding for win number 19 kolopowski lots of attention trying to rip it free tied up on the play possessionary will keep it on his end for the Duke Blue Devils hey we have a really good Sunday afternoon double header on ESPN coming your way a couple of rivalry games sir quavion Smith the number 23 NC State taking on North Carolina thats it one then number two Houston hosting Kendrick Davis in Memphis theyre on the bubble according to Joe Leonardi big games all around with about two weeks to go in a regular season and traffic and thats going to be in and out by roach and hell draw a foul on a play hit by Hima whos picked up a couple of quick ones you know Obi you mentioned I came North Carolina North Carolina state right now youre looking at North Carolina they are in situation between 16 and 10 many people have projected as number one or two in the Country Three Seasons since the four starters two players came back right now they need that win they need that win they need a quality win you take a look at their unbelievable wins they dont have those big time wins so that game becomes a must for them I believe tomorrow Kentucky answered the call to that they played Tennessee they were sitting on that bubble today they knocked out the committee I beat Tennessee for the second time and sweep it up caliberi can eat some lasagna tonight he can celebrate relax John youve got to be dancing and more did you have the lasagna last night here in Syracuse oh swatter away Lively got up there is Proctor wide open yes sir a triple until you get a free after the block shot and some space right now good timeout they need it right there she refused Syracuse takes the timeout with 5 55 left in the half and Duke has opened it up 2719 inside the Dome crunchy they go today you make those donations for Ava Grace and her memory to help other kids paddling a disease and I can tell you this already today I started it off Vinnie Lobdell Syracuse booster heard about what Im doing he came over he gave me 25 000 wow so Vinnie his sons Noah and

donation what a beautiful little girl yeah I believe him Ill tell you one thing thats the worst news a parent can get is when their child has cancer and then ultimately to lose your child no parent should have to go through that rude standing off for a minute shot clocks to nine coming up on five minutes to go and a half a little leader sticks it and you you want to see more shots like that more offense from him like that yeah I want to be able to square his body and shoot the jump shot that was really like a drive 12 foot shot and converted hes in his athletes and we get right in the Radisson tries another one and youd also like to see him do it right here at Syracuse next year roach will fill that one up from downtown a threepointer cant give him a little second and third opportunities and right there he scores a big three on a missed shot offensive rebound throws it right back out man thats with a quick step and is he quick Applause L that didnt touch anything this sailed on out not a good shot right there you know I took them upstairs and some games he also lost their Heartbreaker and its right here I dont have it on my notes but Ill tell you this I lost my heartbreaker as well to North Carolina got beat by North Carolina and a real warrant murder at the end of the game so theyve lost some tough tough pants well Duke with an opportunity to drop a hammer here in the first half especially if they get this guy going for Lebowski produces doing a good job on him on every touch yes Whitehead with the threepointer Applause tell you what hitting that kid back in the lineup with his ability in such a big plus especially if he keeps staying healthy hes a try March Madness comes theyll be a fact dude trying to take this big crap totally out of it Gerard boy that was a difficult place for him to be much of a window there on the run phillipowski will lay it in an excellent excellent play him getting away from Syracuse right now and its quite new to the ground down Duke really played excellent basketball really executing him offensively against the Zone making the open threes well Whitehead The 67 Freshman from New Jersey makes all the difference when he is ready to rock and roll he missed about four and a half games they are so happy to have him back the pepperoni on Paneras new toasted baguette in Miami picked up huge wins plus wait till you see how Kansas flipped the script on Baylor Sean whats behind the 162 Duke run ball movement I mean ball movement within the offense 11 assists on 13 made field goals so far thats been what stood out to me at 713 from threepoint line and then 11 points for Drake White had a guy that can operate inside of that zone Duke Catching Fire and grabbing a lead as we head back to the Dome OB and Dicky V Kip thank you very much 3521 to Duke Blue Devils opening up a bit theyre on a 162 run dick in the last three and a half minutes well you got a credit certainly theyre shooting the three and they dont really shoot the three well at all 32 as a team and it has not been a great ass it should be but today theyve made Seven threes against that zone and theyve blown this open right now to a 14point lead its a Duke team it looks like its beginning to turn it into another gear they played at Virginia so tough probably should have won that basketball game then they played great against Notre Dame for long stretches maybe a little closer than they wanted but they hit big shots when they had to and now theyre coming on the road and taking care of business so far a lot of time left put another big game from thats a big plus Whitehead is the key too getting a player in that quality into a lineup and having to Be an Effective and healthy is such a possible Edwards encountering a wall and every time he turns to go into the paint dude breaks up hey well and help one another Ben strong you get that kind of shot up all the time I mean the bottom line is that was a bad bad shot phillipowski trains it from three he shot that from Walden are you kidding me Kyle Phillips Im going to smile on he finally loves to hit it thats a little tweet nothing but nylon baby Applause Taylor Applause into the lane strong and Lively deflection great block by Lively boats heading over he really played terrific as you said earlier against Carolina I want you to turn and drive for two more and now Duke is doing anything they want Duke totally in command dominating the action why did his crowd down 30 000 came out strong today wow 40 to 21 look at that run 212 this might be the best Ive seen them play well here I really do Ive watched it quite a bit but the best Staples cant show us that theyre playing defense Edwards with the Quick Step lost it in another turnover Applause you could play that great defensive wallet here thats more under their strength 25 some points second only to Virginia to Lunge for that pass on the Run Lively back out roach fakes a three away and scooped up by Malik Brown and hell draw the foul I dont know if theres a better sound in sports than the jump shot from way downtown it goes right through the perfect switch listen to this Applause no sir no sir no sir honest I broadcast a few from right here thank goodness one of the great games I saw as a young announcer still in college right here at Syracuse of the new house schools is Patrick Ewing and pearl Washington I thought he was here doing again is your ride kind of squeezed by Proctor coming up on a minute to go Syracuse just getting nothing Williams does get an easy duck here and a timeout Duke theyll take one John Shire with a minute 10 to go in the half and Duke has to open things up here 4023 inside the Dome at Syracuse Scott you know the rules no shrinking and drinking obviously and do not give alcohol to the ants even if they ask not a problem Hank alcohol free guys come on its my last one youre never gonna finish that your eyes are bigger than your thorax good luck notable Syracuse stars there have been many many a lot of them of course played for Jim behind the news Dave Bing Pearl Washington have talked about Sherman Douglas was phenomenal I love Billy Owens its my favorite alltime player Coleman wouldnt expand sure he was something else final four 87 lost to Indiana unfortunately as a freshman in this thing keep free throwing and Keith smart and Carmelo got here and they won the whole thing frantic inside the lane circus will break out mitz will slam it through commits thats Pro ability there aint no doubt about him this Pro teller but he needs another year of college hes got the developer shot hell bounce around and then certainly gleague situation to play in front of 30 000 here youll be better off the kids get that opportunity ever again I L can have to make some good knowledge see to me the nios to play we talked about it last time routine kids nothing about recruiting giving up the money Proctor did not get it off in town thats a shot clock violation so 16 seconds before the breakdick yeah you know the nil should be about retention John wow like we talked about it last night where people get together and make it exciting for him to want to come out Applause a 15point Advantage for Duke Applause a couple of Sensational moments here the first half of his team hasnt had enough he went for the window its going to be tipped up and hit by Edwards would have been a little one here anyway got it down to 13 I should say we did get to halftime though so that is no timeout we had half 40 to 27 by IHOP so a 212 run after the game was tied at 19 you talked about the rebounding advantage and Duke is number one in the ACC rebounding and rebound advantage so we are set for the second 20 minutes see some quality guys on that bench she could use Mr Audrey was a heck of a player here at Syracuse back to para talking about those six big threes he was part of that great team with carmelo one of the best type in town hes you can ever see in college basketball champion that went off the fingertips of Edwards so right back to Duke their first crack at it here in the second 20 doctor will dish for rochier theyve shown a lot of patience attacking that zone getting ready to open gaps like right there must be too strong an unsung hero for Duke in the first half was Mark Mitchell he had four assists ties his career high and that was in just half a game hes a solid player he wouldnt call a blender a guy didnt really Blends in makes big plays made a big three to beat another name Applause and its with a kick out for Williams too strong Edward snares the rebound gets about 10 a game and a whistle at 1903 left in this contest thatll be on lively lets go to Chris Dave Johnson came out of the locker room looked and he said I only have five words take care of the ball so we so we can play with some boys I said you went on a really nice run there in the first half are you pleased with anything he goes our defense other than that no Im pissed we need to be able to come in here and listen we have 40 points but think of what we would have if we would be able to take care of the basketball she wanted a problem so when youre turning the ball over and win two games I think Virginia and Miami had over 40 turnovers in those two games but thats a young team I mean people forget it man they have four first rounds last year four not one four and we also had a second round here in Keels manufacturing guys like mcgarro and Williams and youre throwing grip in to win no more thats out we get all these young kids were one real veteran and Broach so it really takes a while I see progress being made by this team I really do flipped up there and it wont drop in for philipowski who comes in averaging 159 and seven times has been the ACC rookie of the week way downtown and its mints with a three Jay one but hes just making that shot his bank account will go like yours with the new contracts Going Up Up and Away might stay stuck if they look this is 83 he doesnt need anymore I kind of like I kind of like how stagnant yours is Lively gets it into the corner swung out for roach Vince on him his Proctor Applause to dribble down strong for two because the rebound he chose him out hes one of the keys early in the game we said Duke three Mountain big sprint youre right for the second time is fouled on the act of attempting a threepointer when it happened in the first half he nailed all three at the line he can get it right down to single digits right here because they were really in trouble heard that left foot theyve done 19 at one time roach with the foul and itll be Joe Gerard to the line 85 percent Rose picking up number two by the way Frontier Syracuse is one of those teams if if if we have a little luck we lost by one point the Bryant he got beat by Pittsburgh by two by Amy by four Virginia twice single digits St Johns in overtime I mean in fact it owes the winch thats the difference between a average year and a good year you win those games or when you share of those games instead of being 1610 youre coming in here like 19 and 7 playing pretty well as you come into this game Syracuse is one three straight games North Carolina State team very good A ranked team right now the crowd is trying to get in the worst way but you know crowd gets in it if the players help him again in the lane plenty of contact but he made it oh definitely Mitchell got really deep he understands other pleasure cerebral he spotted an opening and a lane there caught the ball and converted wants to get that shot in the air a lot of foul here with 1715 to go and Duke up 4433 theyll go on Malik Brown of the orange Applause so thatll be number one Duke with a sizable rebound advantage Applause story here so far and this one Proctor getting a little bit closer Mitchell kicks it whiteheads open yes sir three tell you one thing and watch him going up and down the floor right because I dont want anybody to say that Im saying that he is a Michael Jordan this is what he want Michael Jordan but he has that wave and he walks and strides but I saw the young kid when he played him in his debut at North Carolina the way he walked up and down the flooding Im not saying please see a headline think hed be trying to put this one off his mind Ive said his bike for 20 theres only one Michael Jordan scooped up and laid in Syracuse able to get a quick two there on the basket by Brown of course what I heard was hes every bit as good as Michael Jordan thats exactly like okay I like the way he walks up and down the floor confidence another time from the corner no Syracuse wants to push it a bit he cant get layups in transition Deuce does a great job defensive serious you see that play that was acrobatic with the left hand he does things you just absolutely imagined about doing it that was a great shot if you played to get him a horse Lively with the foul take another look watch this right here you do spin as the spin goes to the left hand I mean tries to keep away Lively with his crate shot blocking ability I hope the right people reach this young guy because really if theres a player that needs college for another year its him because there is such a future in this kids hands just one little Arc and he could learn it he could learn look at that pretty good stroke there current Heaven should Square your body get balance and see him shooting a little bit hes both balanced lets put another one coming Ill tell you what you know you talk about McNamara and some other guys who could certainly help him with the jump shot hes got a head coach who has a pretty good jump shot certainly did his plane days the Suns did okay Jimmy Hamilton was a good player man I joke you dont let Jimmy behind what I love about him I said before and again I mean Im buying stuff to him but I love people that have a passion for what they do he loves the school he loves the school 62 years hes been here since the day in Rome in 1962 served as a player assistant coach for 47 years a head coach come on thats bleeding Syracuse a nice play with the inside action finally open guy Technic happens zombie get back to Jimmy he just he sleeps and drink Syracuse no question about that and cant hear his entire career as the head coach at his alma mater its going to be batted out by Duke came here as a walkoff came in 62 was a walk now ultimately was the captain in 66 he and Dave being were the captains well how about this shot I mean thats exactly thats perfect for him yeah keep it in keep that elbow in you guys get this will you come on man shooting skills oh we gotta see that when we go back come on man I said man if you your players to play with that kind of stuff you got a shorter score you get a shot and score oh wow he plays Black shot hes very proud of that hes very proud tells everybody all the time every time he sees me he says you know man youre talking about we at that time I used to bust them about playing cupcakes and hed say to me you know cupcakes you would have been this cupcake I ever played against a little far away by immense wont drop to Lebowski with a rebound all for charity all for a great cause both of you guys with very big hearts well I just hope that people respond to my request earlier for money young lady passed away 10 years old no parents have to go through that but their family went to Ava Grace Jones slash pediatrics vorg pediatrics make a donation in memory of her name trying to raise two hundred thousand dollars wheres he searched tried to make a move there and its going to be scooped up by Mitchell right down the lane for tow no one stop to so what hes so underrated as a player hes been starting most of the whole year hes a kid that doesnt get the fan fear of some of the other guys but hes just such a steady you cant win without those kind of players well he hit a big three with 11 seconds to go to seal that win against Notre Dame this week so he can do that too dry dumping it downstairs and young with a clean block theres another guy role player whos Off the Bench hes in size experience so Lebowski back out for Roach theres a long one from the seventh footer Avon picked up by roach Little Fall away for two cant let Luke marks step in here and get a rebound and second shot you cant allow that get all out to happen because you got a really rebounder Edwards a company how many times they have scored off the second shot now weve got a timeout Duke once again taking command of the game on top 5337

Johns amazing hes a 20th head coach at Duke the guys served on Coach K staff in 201314 hes 35 now so thats like 10 years ago 25 years old as an assistant what a way to learn what a way to learn whos a great player we love the two ACC championships take a look at the conference right now right now sitting on top number one Virginia think about their last three games they struggled with Louisville one by like two or three struggled today with the Irish and Notre Dame one by two and they got a little bit of break Santa Claus came early and the game which we did would do where philipowski was denied going to the free throw line a pit fell today they got knocked off by Virginia Tech Okies this time of the year they start to get very very dangerous well I thought it wasnt Tony Bennett and his kids are set in a nice little gift down there to Virginia on the top live growth of Mr Lively against live those legs are live oh man hes like thats small thing youre supposed to play with that big ball that ball used to bounce like he crazy and thats the way he does what are you laughing at me over youre left Gerard will draw the foul and held up and fouled by Proctor take a look right here aint nowhere to throw the ball throw the lob up on top well if he can add a little bit more than this game in terms of drop steps and moves around the basket because right now hes really exclusive with the chance oh sweet little spin shot there by the senior Gerard put all kinds of recordbreaking numbers up Applause well can Syracuse make a move here to make it a game down the stretch with nine minutes to go problem is their defense is not enough turnover and transition Dukes getting the shots they want you rebound so its tough to come from behind rocker back to pilipowski three coming yes sir catches production to really good execution getting it Gap getting a seat youll take the Zone attacking the aggressive toward the seat on the gaps is 12 and the answer by judaments hes impressed he really has impressed me he does things you cant teach going strong over Edwards and lays it in boy he went right at him dick what an unbelievable Talent he is just hes a babe he should be in High School playing he reclassified hes getting all his minutes in playing time at an elite level hes only going to get better and better and better Gerard on Proctor leaning in through it away picked up by philipowski hes got a roach with him slapped Away by mints no no no no no right there Kyle Kyle youre gonna drop the bounce pass you better drop the bounce pass drop the dime drop the dime Kyle come on man you better than that you got roach theres plastic fix the ball you could pick the ball exceptionally well I came here hoping and praying to see I dont care who wins but a real real unbelievable Martin unfortunately duty state totally demand 6448 under eight it was incredible head to the game on Chrome average when it hits that desperation three to meet Duke and then the great team of Jason 10 off the window cant hit it a great job saving that by Brown as he deflects it off phillipowski so circus will keep it Chris playback around very athletic children Dukes bench has been outstanding whenever theyve needed a big run theyve gotten it Syracuse will have it when we come back Music we check in with the Wendys wooden watch philipowski this season 15 and 912 double doubles seven times dick the ACC rookie of the week hes one of the real impact diaper dandies of the country who lived up certainly to the building coming out of high school hes had a couple of bad games but that would suit everybody hes a solid allaround player very first time hes one of the impact that for Dan he says Conference record by the way for ACC rookie of the week is 10 Roy Parker the last to accomplish that 2014 on the Move heres minutes with a leaner no slightly high up for the rebound Ted Livelys got to get a gym just like when you look at certainly the ability of mint working on a shot Mileys gonna give up a little bit more of a repertoire in terms of offensive skills around the basket rather than just the law Dukes been lights out from 3 10 for 22 shot clock to seven they werent the lob behind the zone They want to get that LOB down to 14 as he takes the hit back to those diaper dandies that you were talking about from lekovsky very much on that list how about Brandon Miller there for Alabama super chiante George how to build it just told by Haiti kind of with Saint Marys then the skin walker coming out strong created very high some drafts havent been a top five he might have used to those kids have been instant in that plays Applause Edwards the senior back on for Jim Boeheim olukowski 77 at the line its one of the reasons they thought even though he did not score in the Virginia game had he got foul shots at the end of that game he would have made him 6 43 to go Applause right Joe with a shot on the way and upband over the top of that backboard so go back over to the Duke Blue Devils leading in 6648 and looking very comfortable really smooth theyre really attacking with confidence against the zone and how letting its own beat up sharing a ball well playing with Freddie McCord good space he approaching three yes sir good space here wide open so that made like 23s now 11 yeah theyve got 11 threes it came in averaging six shooting at least 50 out there you make 11 threes you got a chance 48 beyond the three mints took a shot he goes down hit in the face Applause played AAU basketball played together with Whitehead that must have been tied up my ticket almost too young how did they ever lose a game if hes okay Roach with the personal take a look right here and hands are being waved certainly accidental a really good Sunday afternoon college basketball doubleheader company way on ESPN and the app a couple of rivalry games we start with number 23 NC State their Dynamic backcourt taking on Armando baycott North Carolina one oclock Eastern then its number two Houston hosting Kendrick Davis in Memphis Joe linardi has won the bubble big games all around so one thing Kentucky they applied The Knockout Punch they really did today with Tennessee so thats a blue blood that stepped up I did a little commentary today about the Blue Bloods and how Carolina and Kentucky going to win well Kentucky did their job Carolina now I firmly believe because really when you look at quad one wins they dont I dont believe I have any I think they might be on a or one and eight maybe one so the bottom line is they got a chance and they got to go down there take advantage they beat him on airport theyre gonna beat them in Raleigh or else they may be heading nit well the crew getting together to see if there was something extra here maybe a flagrant we saw mints going down the tunnel he is bleeding Ron Gruber Brian OConnell and Tommy Morrissey giving it a look I would say it wasnt flagging it wasnt with intent it wasnt intent Rons coming over here to explain this common foul runs as a common foul good call good solid call hey look hes here dude hes here dude I mean hes like me does he give a guy a tip I dont have to give a dip my wife cuts my Dome she gets no tip I noticed youre very fond of hats when you when you enter every Arena you will find every hat you can possibly put on your head you gotta cover that protect the vbdi I might tell balls its like a rape these teams downstairs Edwards about pound his way in Taylors open from threepoint land but too strong Lawrence went in high for Rebound all right there it is yes he Nails another trip Applause there you go the dome in the dome theres only one JMA the JMA Wireless home roach wont wait as well short Lively got hit on the deck here with 525 to play see Juke release made sure hes paid big time through offensive rematch a new offensive Remax they have converted goes into made threes and the opportunities that really just change the complexion of the game theres no death to spinning command come watch Proctor the Lebowski with a shot clock to two needs to get a shot in the air didnt quite get to the iron there by Mitchell shooting Joe ready to get Joe some shots come on Soldier run to double up on Smart play get the ball out of his hands Torrance is open theyve got a second effort Taylor blocks and Lively is so good timing those block shots thats great timing too really great time and itll be Applause and Duke will mishandled that lose it here with 433 on the clock thats an area that really bothers Shire as he told our Chris button turning the ball over oh right there man good defensive Mitchell there theres Mitchell and Richard left it is Torrance over the top that would have been a very tough catch but a misfire enclosed by Torrance tell you another thing John Shai has been a recruiting magnet doing a great job they got a tremendous class coming in next year second only the Kentucky who has the number one class but theyre right up there calling Paul B and cardi does a great job great evaluating fouls stops the clock and Duke in complete Command Chris Bell with the foul and good to see Mintz coming back to the bench for Jim Boeheim after he took a shot in the face Josh Shire is going to be starring coaching I really see it I really I believe he will be a star hes got a great program that he can sell and get great players and he understands the game hes going up to a little bit period right now just how to handle the game manage a game now comes with experience and games but really if youre a young guy you want to play for a guy on that kid you know they win today and thats 19 victories theyre 106 in the ACC is a lot to be proud of there with an extremely young team as roach delivers a triple its 12 unbelievable they have shut that zone apart heavily attacked it John Shire and his staff have done a great job you know I like about his staff too lets say about search as well a lot of a former Duke players so they understand what that Jersey represents they also got a great one in that staff they got Lucas John Lucass son Bell looking to make a move that ones swatted Away by Lively its going to stay on this end with 38 on the shot clock talking about Syracuse Trailblazers when we come back here to the Dome Cav game yeah look into today first four out certainly not a game you can lose gonna be able to move a basketball but still close one one point Tigers lead meantime Kirk creasa in Arizona on Deck Sean yeah their guard plays so key we know what their front Court can do if their guards are efficient it can knock down the perimeter shot Arizona is as tough to beat as anybody in the country youll see it over on ESPN2 in just about 10 minutes OB what you may not realize about Syracuse its a city that was willing to embrace change early in its history in 1936 Wilma Sadat Singh became the first black athlete at Syracuse went down to play football basketball joined the army his jerseys in the rafters here and then Syracuse native Manny Braylon was the first black player to earn a scholarship here part of the 57 team and then on the right Earl Lloyd was the first black player to play in an NBA game helping lead the Syracuse Nationals to a 1955 NBA championship and if you take a drive around this great City they honored him with a street named Earl Lloyd way tell you what Chris if you ever met a role hes one of the nicest people you could ever ever meet just class personifies and some may not remember Syracuse had an NBA team right here in town the gnats youre talking about and thats pretty and Dolph Shays remember that name yep 7253 you know what Id like to share with you now so the game looks its all over Jimmy bayheim had a very controversial interview that he did with one of our best reports I mean hes terrific Peter thousand and Jimmy made some statements that he ended up regretting saying where he said schools were not buying players like schools and he named schools and he got people really upset because they werent buying Schools theyre using the nil and the nil is legal and he realized that because he got a lot of heat he came back and he apologized but let me say this a lot of the themes that he was talking to Peter amount so true the college basketballs in total chaos going on with and then I uh transported most of these are so valid that statement they are certainly statements of validity he was trying to really explain that but then he went too far and said hey were not like this school buying players that school by employees name in schools and he realized he used the wrong term there they happened to be using the nil well dick 78 years old a phenomenal career Hall of Famer its all been right here at Syracuse as is alma mater and just spectacular here for this University think about all of those years 2530 win year after year after year getting kids to come from all over the country all over the world what a building yeah to play here for him to play that zone all the time that jumper will swish in she knocks that one down like that so they like that zone wow step right in the Gap he can shoot the three the young mad man he can shoot that green and I think by this point you know obviously everywhere that Jim Boeheim goes hes getting that question you know Jim are you thinking about is this the end of the line yeah frustrated Im frustrated come and come to TV come join us so youre making that off of this Slam by the Lively Lively oh hes had a couple of dandies this one thats what he does thats well they know that they take advantage by flipping that ball up down is a good man and he loves this school loves it 62 years so if its six decades are you serious but the bottom line is sometimes hell look in the mirror and say I mean Ill be honest with you I thought he was going to step aside last year with his two sons are leaving apparently that our next ACC Big 12 Monday doubleheader seven Eastern philipowsky and Duke hosting L Ellis and Louisville inside Cameron Indoor thatll be Kansas and number 22 TCU tell you one thing I really believe and I dont know what youre feeling Dave youre a Syracuse glad youre wondering if rates came out of a new house broadcasting so many he goes on with our bike to recall and I call him our heart will never be not power because I worked with him early in his career and Sean McDonough Bob Bob Bob Costas right so anyway the point I want to make is that I look at Jimmy I I see a guy that really is hurting a little bit hes hurting a little bit I really feel that I feel hes really troubled with the fact that maybe some people have a wrong impression and he just loves this place but he has earned I dont know European hes earned the right to have something to say about that decision along with the Lord not just his decision the school as well but theyre going to get together are they going to come up to an agreement whats going to happen for the future been an amazing career amazing Sensational now you think of the time he spent with Coach K you know with the United States you know Olympic National teams and great success those two becoming such great friends 2015 wins that tells the story think about it he en coach Daniel he was over a thousand marks all right its late Speedy Catchings and thats going to be knocked away Syracuse buckling down defensively but too a little too late for the orange theyre about to drop to 16 and 11 and 97 in the conference could have a much better year had they been in a situation where they won some of those close games used to the bright by Juan St Johns in overtime Pittsburgh by two Carolina by four that changes your whole season changes your whole season game and drops in the first one monarchema the 611 sophomore 2003 I look at Mexico sitting over there and I think about those six three threes 2003 when that title is Jerry and then think about the fact that keep work blocking his shot out of that zone late in that game to beat them in Carmelo and a great diaper Dandy oh man I saw Carmelo play his first game Dead Schumer tonight Matt Stewart Barnett made his college debut against Memphis see if I got a good memory here yeah you do 83 years old trailer against Memphis they got beat they got beat but I remember poking them after the game and said my God how good is advertising Syracuse cant connect down to slam oh baby theyre going to be celebrating doing it right home whos John Shire now gets his third Road win in the conference number two and six coming in here they win at home at 130 and he can become the number one coach in his first year to win as many as 16 James went undefeated his first year 76 Calipari in 2008 and he has a chance hes 130 at home but three more to play so Duke with his 700th ACC win all time and they continue to play so well inside the Dome theyve now won four consecutive games here and they lead the alltime Series against Syracuse 156 now in a row eight in a row
