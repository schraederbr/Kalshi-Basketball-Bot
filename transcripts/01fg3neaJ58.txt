and Fon Reed has a lot to do with anchoring the inside Demon Deacons 9 and0 here at Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum Virginia has lost its two Road games in the ACC and theyve been blown out in both the Demon Deacons start with the ball at 11 and four 3 and one in the league Virginia 11 and four and two and2 in the league and is Wake farest which will Riot its starting five hard getting the ball to epon Reed on an early touch Reed to the left hand no the def rebound and Andrew CL stick back will not go and its Jordan Miner making his first start as a Cavalier who cleans up the ball for Virginia welcome to Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum Kevin Brown Debbie antelli Virginia and Wake Forest in a critical early ACC game Miss Jumper by Isaac mcne gives the ball to the Demon Deacons were looking for their first NCAA tournament since 2017 and theyve got one of the best starting fives in the ACC Carr and Reed The Bigs Miller hildr and salz three Ys at all score between 17 and 18 points per game this is Cameron H 17 point per game score missed a three a rebound tipped down to Ryan Dunn for UVA youre going against a low possession defense ball control offense in Virginia and a highflying offensive attack of Wake Forest with those three players in the back for that you mentioned Kevin unlike any team in the country right now better than 17 points a game Rees beakman not a great threepoint shooter rattles it out in the rebound tip to Eon Reed for w first the tendency of a Tony Bennett coach team is no offensive rebounds get back in force Wake Forest to play against their quarter Court defense kept the pivot foot down heres Reed firste demon deacon at his third School LSU Gonzaga Wake Forest and some good early defense by Jordan Miner the gr transfer for maram making his first Virginia start leads to a leak out for dun who miss the contested layup and a foul against Virginia will send it the other way its a brand new starting five you see there for uba no Andrew Ro Off the Bench for the first time this year Jake groes returns to the starting lineup at the four and Jordan who played well really in in garbage time against NC State last week had a good week of practice according to Tony Bennett so he makes his first start for Virginia as Tony Bennett trying to find the right combination I mean heres the adjustment right away Virginia always doubles the block with Miner on the floor after a week of practice based on what you said in the NC State game theyre playing straight up inside Fon Reed is 0 for two going against minor on the interior 68 242 is the defensive player of the year the Northeast conference last year Hunter Sal with a three it took near two Andes but this finally a bucket and it comes from the best scorer on the floor at nearly 18 a game its a different offensive discipline than coming off the Florida State game where they play up the line they overplay every pass they switch everything you got to have a different mentality offensively against the Virginia de a SP Moy Miller who took it away from Min and finished and W got the first five transfer Guard from Central Michigan Kevin boy Miller wearing zero in black and gold inside me he ised by both of Reed hands back out for GR a good shooter who missed a two Sal flies in for the rebound and Virginias for five Gaga transfer Hunter Salis car can step out and shoot take it into the body of groves and the foul goes against Jake Groves his first poopy Miller on an uphill pass over playing anticipates and then look at this move Hes listed at six feet I dont think so but I tell you what hes got incredible quickness and here are the players that we were talking about nobody in the country has three players on the floor that can do what Wake Forest can do and right now Cameron hildr his numbers and boopy Millers numbers are both up in ACC play through four games only division one school with three players at 169 points per game or higher youba will counter read with Blake Buchan and the Freshman wearing zero and white here is Salis well marked by dun got it to hild at the end of the shot clock the rebound off the hands of Buchanan into the hands of Jake crov guard your yard as what Tony Bennett would tell you from his Wisconsin days and a derivative directly from his dad Dick Bennett who was the master of the packline defense two for beakman at Virginias on the board after nearly four minutes its ree beakman there leading score at nearly 13 per game and then beatman whos one of the best defenders in the country almost took it away from Miller and commits a foul the First on beatman will send us to our first break couple of baskets early for Wake Forest at home sometimes the story lines is Right themselves Virginia the second best scoring defense in the country now they play at a slow pace but 14th in the country in field goal percentage defense too Wake Forest tied for third overall in the ACC in scoring offense in ACC games theyve scored at least 82 points every time Steve forbs team and is fourth season awake far is looking to get back to the tournament for the first time since 2017 and they lost their last game Deb but a three and 0 start first time since 2009 they done that in ACC play they lost three of their first five games then they win went on and won nine in a row until they lost to Florida state in the last one thats a good 0 by coach Forbes coming off the timeout in those first five games they didnt have that guy Fon Reed who was waiting for his two time trans for waiver to be applied the feed from hildr and Reeds on the board for the first time so theyve gone seven and one with Fon Reed in the lineup I think he changes a lot of things about the way they space the floor hes a rim protector which gives him a threelevel defense you got ball pressure you got rotation then you got the ability to block shots freshman Canon just grazes the rim and here is Hunter Sal really become transfer you wake far so many impact players for their five starters our transfers and from some big programs a couple of former Gonzaga Bulldogs heres one of them in Sal is fronted by beakman poopy Miller back for Salis in the lane the contested shot Will Roll home and an early five for Hunter Sal thats just passing the ball back and forth in the middle third and then when youre late on a close out or you take the wrong angle the quickness ofy Miller can get in the Gap pman trying to break down Miller get it back from Blake Buchanan Andrew Rs on the for for the first time for UVA the St Thomas transfer D stepping outed and a a fou as Reed spiked that ball out of the air but JY Lus got a foul thats an incredible play by Virginia its roll and replace and dun catches it at the top gets past Carr but theres that third level Kevin thats what Im talking about youve got the Eraser at The Rim now hes going to pick up a foul but hes letting D know that hes going to be there all game talk to Steve fors before the game he said Fon Reed is such a highle communicator and you could tell it Sho around that there are a few highle communicators on this team I think everyone in the starting five at some point had instruction for their teammates Reed will take a seat right now with that first foul but for a wake bar team that only plays about seven or eight there are a lot of vocal leaders on his team and Cameron HTH is one of them and when Fon Reed goes to the bench Andrew Carr goes to the Five Spot this would be considered maybe their smaller lineup even though Zack Keller comes off the bench at 610 Keller with the ball right now fumbled a low pass and dun takes it away Virginias so good at forcing turnovers one of the best teams in the country and that leads to a Miss three by the redot MC according to kenpom theyre number 24 in the country and 22 of your theyre going to turn you over thats a high number car dribbles out of the quick double fast deflected by beatman out of bounds it will go to Applause Music Virginia welcome to the Joel Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Winston Salem North Carolina where Wake Forest is looking to remain unbeaten at home Kevin Brown Debbie anelli our ESPN 2 crew the Demon Deacons at this early juncture in conference play the first team out of Joel ARs projected bracket Virginia is a little below them two teams that look like they may straddle the bubble line and it is a big game early in conference play Ryan Virginia will not get the bounce and UA is one for n to start Dem deons four out of nine theyre n and0 in this building this year 40 and five at the Joel the last last three seasons Cameron hildr finds an open Miller a good shooter who rattles it out you got to move the ball side to side you got to get a piece of the paint you got to look to attack in the gaps against this packline Virginia Defense one of the best in the country at shortening the game shortening possessions second best scoring defense in the country of Virginia but they cannot get anything going right now Buchanans Miss makes it a one for 10 Wahoo start yet their defense keeps them in it because Wake Forest has not been able to separate with their offense Don deflects it from Carr Ros all over Carr and Carr is the last to touch it another wake fars turnover thats the Demon Deacons third year 15 for Tony bennon who is very happy with the week of practice his team had they havent played in a week since losing to North Carolina State on Saturday like makes to use the analogy of a door knocker just keep knocking at the door chipping away hoping good things will happen he made a lineup adjustment if youre just joining is Virginia started Jordan Miner for the first time this year but took him out of the game after a few minutes with a freshman Blake Buchanan back on the floor look Tony Bennett has won the national coach of the year three times the ACC coach of the year four times and a national championship hes the master at tinkering and tweaking and I think the way their defense is designed is to play the Angles and make it tough on the opponent they canest everything Wake Forest did to Virginia what Virginia does to so many others right there Leon bond to the mens basketball program this week provided the lead investment earlier for that 12 million sha basketball complex a huge supporter of the Demon Deacons a part owner of the Atlanta Hawks a wake farest to love class of 91 this is an athletic department which has had a a great couple of years the baseball team ranked number one college World Series last year basketball team on the rise as Salis hits his third shot three attempts coach Forbes two for two on attos they have scored both once Fon Reed this time a three by sales meanwhile Virginias not hit a field goal since the 16004 mark closing in on five minutes with that one uba shooting at 1 for 10 heres Groves the Oklahoma transfer to strong good wall up at The Rim by Zack Keller Keller and Parker Frederickson the first two Off the Bench for Wake Forest and here is Frederickson who is absolutely deadly from three number 20 in black and gold hildr tries to wrap it inside to car and another turnover thats the fourth for Wake farest and then Carr commits a foul on the Freshman Leon Bond thei third wake farest had some big turnover issues Tuesday at Florida State with 20 and four early here yeah four in the last four minutes Steve forb said at times in the game on Tuesday I dont know what team that was and that is what Virginia does they turn teams over at such a high rate pakmans got the only made field goal for Virginia hes got the much bigger car on him spinning trying to create space pman shot is flat rebounded by Keller Salis with an early eight penetrating Salis keeps the dribble alive and he stepped out of bouns beakman doing a great job of moving his feet remember number two in white the ACC defensive player of the year last year for Virginia hes taken over the point guard responsibilities after ke Clark had been there for about 15 years so there requires a different mentality when you move off the ball to playing on the ball and you take a look at the highlights for ree beakman he has been outstanding defensively he has gotten better and his assist turnover and his decision making has gotten better I tell I surprised I thought it was only 14 years for K Clark in Charlottesville it is still unusual to not see him in a Cavaliers uniform they really like what theyve gotten out of beatman hes the only returning starter though from last years 25 eight coac regular season Champion that shots missed by Bond heres boy Miller after a spell roie holds his ground well MCs got another steal Virginia is 1 for3 Four Points in 10 minutes and yet their defense is letting them hang around that does not help Speakman throws it right to the arms of Frederickson well again Wake Forest hasnt been able to separate you look at the numbers just a three possession game for Virginia thats the way they look at it they dont look at it as eight points they count possessions six turnovers in the last five and a half minutes that shot missed by Salis and grabbed by the red shirt freshman Bond what does Virginia need to do better on this side I mean they got to keep moving the ball because they have been able to get to the rim they got to finish like right there got to make a good play good decision and has a good roll to the bucket Miner in from Ro the goal in nearly seven minutes for Virginia Ro comes off that screen he snakes it a little bit and he holds his ground and allows Miner to shape up its a nice patient look and delivery e Reed wants it inside against Miner back on the floor after an early foul right now wake Force has got to get a piece of the paint you got to get in the Gap you got to attack inside out against this defense at the way beatman hounds Miller and wake fars will turn it over again called for an offensive foul with the ward off against Reese beakman they want you to play off the bounce youre trying to take beakman undiz down to the block you got to make a better decision than that at a couple times bopy Millers playing a little too fast if youre a young basketball player watching this game isnt there so much you can learn from watching Reese beatman defend first of all hes going to get in a stance he understands personnel and its a as Tony would say its a we and US versus the ball constantly guarding the ball theyre in held position they protect inside out theyre really connected on that end Virginias got tane Murray on the floor the Junior from Auckland New Zealand UVA bench had just eight points in the loss to NC State a week ago they got a couple of points here red sh freshman Bond who had not scored over his last three games andg continues down within four losing in on a fourminute scoring drought now for Wake Forest Reed looking for a touch against Miner and a foul off the ball against Jordan Miner this his first see thats where Cameron hildr makes a smart Play Because Fon Reed is trying to shape up and when you make that next pass to the wing you give Fon Reed an opportunity to show his number and his hands to the ball and draw that foul HTH off the inbound you know the situational offense for Steve Forbes is the difference in the game theyre at tos their Baseline out of bounds half their baskets have come on those plays snaps a scoring drought of about four minutes for Wake farst off a hard screen mcney gets free and Virginias best shooter Strokes a two Isaac mcney you want to talk about a clinic and working off pin Downs he does a nice job of getting his feet under him went into the rhythm of his shot like nearly at 12 points a game their second leading scorer Miller Chucks it on the rim and Bonds got the rebound good early minutes for the Freshman Im sorry Kevin I dont understand what bopy Millers doing there I mean thats twice hes tried to invert to the block against ree beakman roie around Frederickson and Reed takes it out of the air on the way down a goal 10 on the illegal way down the shot from Andrew Ro and it sure was yeah no point about that and you know for UVA theyve got six different guys that have made a basket so far to give them 12 points one for 13 to start the game most teams you go one for 13 to start the game and your head coach is probably called a timeout youre down 12 points Virginia for seven turnovers and theyve hung in there defensively as they so often do as as cam hildr bricks a three hes only hit one basket for Wake Forest thats part of the the problem for Wake Forest is seven turnovers Virginias taking more shots and when youre struggling and youve made four of your youve made your last four baskets so now youre on a hot streak right can wake Force defense get a stop right here pman back out for Miner ground transfer from marac spins into Reed got to the right hand left it short off rebound kept Alive by Bond and then Miner will float it around and out two misses for him Lake Forest right now led by Hunter Salis with eight Salis is out of the game hes the only player who scored in the game that has more than two points ESPN today three more games highlight our schedule the next one on ESPN Arkansas and Florida two teams that are surprisingly 0 and2 in the SEC despite some high hopes that game streaming live on the ESPN app Houston TCU Cincinnati Baylor to follow kind of surprised to see that Razer backs and Gator two proud programs who have gotten off difficult starts in conference play Tony Bennett has to take ree beakman out because he picked up that second foul trying to guard Cameron hildr in transition Isaac mcney will handle the ball a little bit more so will done for Virginia two fouls at the 618 Mark well see how long Tony B rolls with without beatman but without him hes tied the game Andrew Ros the first Cavalier with two made field goals I this is all Virginia Pace they how Wake Forest the highest scoring team in ACC play Walking the ball up the court it was a foul on roie who chucked to cutting hildr first foul on the St Thomas transfer you know when you get to conference play Kevin its two you play when and where and for Steve Forbes theyre coming off that Florida State loss Florida States and up the line switch everything tilt the floor play Fast force you to make decisions at every turn and Virginia is the opposite theyre playing in the gaps theyre slowing you down theyre shortening the possessions theyre really making you execute in a quarter Court Reed seven to shoot for car another long possession for Wake Forest Millers got done whos an excellent Defender gets the hand up as Miller fires the three in his face and sticks it late clock big triple to give bopy a little confidence right here because I dont think his decision making has been very good to this point little misc communication there between Dunn and Groves leads to a Virginia turnover the Cavaliers fourth Ryan Dunn at 68 caught on a switch bopy uses the bounce to create some separation 48 points the last two games for boopy Miller the firste deak from Central Michigan hes got Isaac mcney on him now hildr spinning around on roie hild dri off the iron but a tough start for him just one for five coming off of 25 points a game high in the loss to Florida State coming into today he leads the ACC and scoring at 20 points a game in conference play Miner from Ro couple of Demon Deacons were there to contest it we see who the foul is on its going to be charged to hildr his first I tell you what Jordan Miner must have had a heck of a week of practice because Virginia hasnt played since the NC State loss and when you go to practice at Virginia theres a great purpose and great intent so you earn your minutes in practice with Tony Bennett well hes already played more minutes in this first half than he averages on the season his season averag 71 there are the numbers had a great season last year at marac 17 12 points n and a half rebounds 26 blocks per game he was the co Northeast conference Player of the Year folks dont remember the Way marac season ended because even though they won the NEC tournament they were not eligible they hav yet been in division one for not time to make the transition to become postseason eligible which is a ridiculous rule ridiculous and of course that meant the second place team got the NCAA tournament spot that team was fairly Dickinson who would go on to upset pretty the 116 game inside Miller throws it for Reed extra F Salis good luck for three what was that three sides four sides reverse the ball against the pack line get the ball to the paint then spray it to a threepoint shooter excellent possession by wake after a twopoint first half against Florida State Salis has 11 hes on the ball against McNeely spinning around on sales mcney created space but couldnt finish Miner goes over the back and knocks it out of bounds Hunter Salis outscoring the rest of his teammates combined early you reverse you skip you dump it inside and you turn down a good shot for a great one Salis buries a Sean makes a great point I mean Sal played 17 minutes a game last year for the Zach so he has definitely been a really improved guy and has certainly thrived in Steve corbes system three for four so far and got 11 points hes one of those three guys in the back court for Wake Forest averaging better than 17 points a game no nobody in D1 has that and this time Salis is the distributor setting up his former Gonzaga teammate Reed once again Forbes dialing it up after a timeout getting the shot he wants not the shot that he wants bopy to think about theres a bad Miss by mcney and heres hild for Wake Forest which has assisted seven of its nine baskets theyre only 313th in the country in assist rate they typically get a lot of in isolation but hild has the assist for car here and Wake Forest has quickly stretched the lead to 10 keeping an eye on Fon Reed he was limping a little bit going back down the floor they run a nice clear out for Carr who is a capable threepoint shooter and Reed hangs back as mcney has space for his second basket snaps an 80 W farest Music run hildr inside for Reed its space on Groves Reeds lost his dribble somebody needs to bail him out quickly and he couldnt quite get it to Carr beatman back on the floor and hes undercut Andrew Carrs second foul in W farest fifth tomorrow its a terrific womens college basketball triple header starting in one easn on ESPN great game of the ACC Virginia Tech and Florida State two ranked teams defending national champion LS you and Angel re head to Auburn and then Tennessee Texas AM it all begins at 1 Eastern on ESPN and the ESPN app Florida State coming off a huge win against North Carolina and M Mania in LSU the road show in Auburn its like a circus but its a fun one its got three tops too thats it only three I dont know there might be a few more thats a second foul against Reed so a minute 50 to go in the half both Carr and Reed have two fouls and Steve Forbes shows you what he thinks of that with a headshake Jordan Miner split a pair of free throws earlier I mean Jordan Miner has been terrific here in the first half they started out the game as we know Virginia loves to double the block well Tony Bennett let minor play Fon Reed straight up we havent seen the come to the block I mean they ran the double team against NC State and DJ Burns all the way out to the threepoint line we not seeing that today Miner splits a pair again hell take a seat dont want to get him in extra foul trouble in the final minute 50 Leon bond is on so its a pretty small Virginia lineup right now done at 68 is the biggest man on the floor for Virginia Bond at 65 guards the 610 Keller Miller beatman just hounding gets back into position hildr across the way Beans there for the rebound with 90 seconds to go so solid Virginia BR bond from D charging into Keller a lot of folks on the Wake far bench think Keller went straight up the officiating crew of AJ decide Jam Spearman and Jamie lucky does not free throws coming for Bond Keller has had a couple of plays where hes walled up on the inside lets watch right here is that offense initiated contact because thats what Steve Forbes is saying well Virginia not a good free throw shooting team 330th in the country in free throw percentage and a couple of Misses for Leon Bon there theyre four for D heres Carr good defense by dun back out for Miller closing in on a minute in the first half and a foul out High against B thats the sixth against Virginia Bs first you know Virginias going to hedge on all ball screen action and you got to go right at that outside hip and thats exactly what bopy Miller does a score line in a pace thats been played at Virginias level for the Demon Deacons leading by seven in the final minute of the half hildr well defended by mcne lot of great oneonone defending for Virginia today and a takeway there Ryan Dunn flies in for the steel second steal of the game for dun who is averaging two per game on the the year fifth most in the ACC n first half turnovers Kevin for Wake eatman got a screen from d and drains the three and a timeout taken with 313 to go in the half a 30 second timeout with Virginia I got the Eagles picking it back up you do yes I have the Bucks because the Bucks despite a mediocre season cant be worse than the Cardinals of the Giants who just beat the Eagles the last two weeks can they I dont know I just think theyre going to put it back together again you have faith I do you think hempty Dumpty is going to you know have the pieces be reglued well see Monday night two games on Monday by the way the bill Steelers game was just postponed to Monday because of the awful weather in Buffalo so last possession of the half for Wake Forest Salis flips it into Carr the catch and the finish for Andrew Carr score three times on that set off the timeout heres done thats good if it goes and it does not so a little six by virgin gets last assist slow scoring half of the season and yet the Demon Deacons lead by six at home 2721 over the Virginia Cavaliers Kevin Brown Debbie Antonelli our ESPN crew as we begin the second half from Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum that was the first half that was played at Virginias Pace typically Tony Bennett and his packline defense have been terrific but Wake Forest which wins a lot of games with its offense has been up to the task defensively well Wake Forest turned to ball over nine times they didnt shoot any free throws they shot 45 from the floor and this is Virginias Pace its a Ben dont break defense and they survived a poor shooting start one for 13 to start the game and here they are in a twopossession game Cavaliers according to Joe lard right now the 10th team out of the field wake farest the first and yes its early but every game is measured equally in terms of what and happen in the committees eyes so this is going to be a quad one win for Virginia or a quad 2 home win for Wake farest wake farest LED in the first half by Hunter Salis 11 of the Demon Deacons 27 hes got three threes one off a season high this is bopy Miller who got to the left hand on Reese beatman creating some contact scoring thats a tough two right there and beakman with those two fouls has to be careful he did play 15 minutes in the first half Virginia in the first half led by beakman with five one of six different scores between two and five points and he brecks a jumper there couple of Misses for bman to start the second oopy Millers got seven for Wake Forest all 29 Points from the starting five for the deakes Cameron hildr for Wake Forest 1 seven in the first half Im looking for him to get going here in the second theyre going to get to the free throw line hes going to be the guy yeah theres the third foul on beakman a minute 17 into the half you say get to the free throw line wake farest has not done that Virginias committed eight fouls none shooting and Bs going to get a little breather here after that third foul Tony Bennett with a quick hook to start the half I think you have to because Steve Forbes right here with the offens in front of him you know hes going to pick on beakman hed run something right at him T Murrays in the game and theres Carr stuffing it right through d one of the things that Fon Reed does is gets Andrew Carr to his natural position which is the four he is a face up player hes a good decision maker hes not just a stretch floor hes a hybrid guy who can make decisions thats an offensive foul Andrew roie with a lefthanded wardo picks up his second I mean another base line out of bounds play and perfect execution by the deakes and now Ryan duns going to come out of the game for Leon Bond so no Dunn and no Bean not even two minutes into the first half for UVA Cavaliers arguably two best players this year Salis cant convert on the layup I mean its a good take its a hard roll to the rim by Reed and then you followed with a penetration right behind the roll had a great look Jordan Miner inside Reed was there to alter the shot Reed with a couple of fouls walled up defensively first four in the half belong to Wake Forest Dem and deacons trying to get to 10 and0 at home for the third straight year Miller fouled by mcne thats three in 2 minutes and 19 seconds against UVA mcne first I dont know what Steve Forbes said to jam Lucky had a long conversation before heading to the locker room but whatever he said appears to have sprinkled some magic pixie dust on this game even against the packline Kevin if you reverse the ball and you move it you will have a late close out that you can attack and thats what Wake Forest has done here in the F second half Miller theres another foul and hell get the continuation thats what Im talking about and boy Millers first step is electric I mean he can go off the bounce he can get to the Gap and he plays underneath guys right here watch he draws the foul keeps his eyes on the rim even plays through that help off the strong side because Cameron hrth was open in the corner if he decided to kick Music it Kevin Miller is named bopy for his uncle passed away when he was young he inherited the name a threepoint play there and this is the largest lead for Wake fars which has all seven points in the second half first time extended pressure because the first time wake force is at the free throw line theyre 100 in the game roie off the glass and good Andrew Ros three for three Ros good on that snake behind the screen hes very good with the size at using the glass 17 point per game score at St Thomas Minnesota a year ago hes got six car somehow kept the right foot down clanked it rebound to tame Music Murray Virginia two Road losses and two Road games in the ACC 22 at Notre Dame 16 in NC State and they keep this game from unraveling M Neely this is two for seven tonight for the red hot shooter Isaac Music mcne Salis a step back got it time the season high is 43 I mean great patience well a few weeks ago wake fars did not look like an NCAA tournament team but in part because of the addition of epon Reed they have charged up the list Dr lonard as of January 13th has them the first team out of the projected field and even though were so far away from selection Sunday this just gives you an idea where things stand right now Virginias in the considered line thats not next four out thats not first four out theyre the 10th team out UVA needs some wins Tony Bennett team is in danger of falling to 0 and three on the road in conference play Lake farest starting off this second half on a 102 run and Reese bman back on the floor for Virginia you know Kevin you really cant minimize the Fon Reid effect his ability to block shots at The Rim he moves car to the four makes the perimeter extend a little bit more and hes a great communicator on the back side of their defense and a block shot and a rebound on that position a Miss three by roie he changes the space on the floor offensively because he post so hard heres Reed finding Salis Reed tips it out for Miller hes impacting the game everywhere Miller missed a long one and this is chased down by McNeely mcne does have the green light for a quick trigger if hes open in transition heres beatman playing with the three fouls couldnt finish but he draws the foul on car its a good coaching decision uh Tony Bennett has to get Reese beakman back on the court right now and watch Fon Reed get off the contact block it into their trans has turn wake farest this Elite academic institution into transer you alandis Williams the ACC player of the year two years ago Tyree applebe the Associated Press ACC player of the year last year Hunter Salis booy Miller certainly look like all ACC players maybe first teamers depending on the way this season goes yeah Eon Reed to the mix whos playing in his ninth game after a twotime transfer waiver what is it about Steve Forbes what is it about this program that makes it such a Haven for transfers well I think Steve Forbes on understands how to put a team together I mean hes done it his whole career from his days at Southwestern Community College to bin Community College to Northwest Florida State to East Tennessee State I mean those are the places that he was before Wake Forest so he understood how to build when you had a lot of turnover back then when youre coaching Community College in Joo jie I think thats part of his success its a great formula for him and and obviously he loves some good guards cuz hes had some great ones I mean we were told ales Williams dropped 55 the other night in a gleague game I mean come on 55 points in any League thats ridiculous his team up by 12 looking to get to 4 and one in ACC play Salis one of those transfers leading with 14 heres hildr and its not been his night shooting wise but Salis is there for the offensive Music rebound Miller Reed stepping out and stroking a three just his second the year two for 11 on the season he looked pretty good shooting he sure did he didnt look like a two for elim that ball deflected by Salis who throws it ahead Miller somehow snatches it from beatman and a three wont go from car that would have been a real lid lifter beakman switched up with Carr Reed over to H beakman loses it Bon gets Applause it starting to feel a little like that NC State game a week ago where Virginia lost control and lost quickly in the second half jumper from bond is good one of the things NC State did in the second half as they were able to get out in transition they rebounded well they hit shots quickly and then they played through DJ Burns and Virginia was double teaming DJ Burns they have not done that this afternoon re here comes a double to read that time hild sets his feet and finally hits from three wake for spent a lot of time this morning at shter Round working on that very set play through the double skip it over the top Groves answers right in front of his bench Jake Groves with his first basket this the second made threepointer you see for Virginia Wake Forest eight for 17 this the uba team thats got the fourth best threepoint D in the ACC at 299 Salis leans in and rolls at home hes got 16 I mean all you need is two hard dribbles in the quarter Court excellent play by Salis 27 points in the first 20 minutes for weake 18 in the first 7 Minutes of the second half Salis doing a really good job of closing the space on mcney bond space to operate again hildr has the rebound wake is plus seven on the Music boards pushing transition dont have anything boy Millers got to run something here HRI same spot different result bman broes leaked out hildr trying to chase him down he does a stop by hildr a little English Applause elevation Cameron HTH Elite conditioning motor will and flat out joy how can you not enjoy watching Cameron hildr that is a great chase down and a big time play they got everybody off their feet on their feet wow 6495 out of Worthing England he could do a little bit of everything Cameron hrth he is the only nontransfer in the starting lineup for Steve Forbes he is an all League type player in his third year a little overzealous there though and Steve forp says come on cam cam gets he gets excited right Im telling you its an elite level motor that kid wants to win Steve Corb is going to take him Applause out Parker Frederickson will replace Music eldri Lake fars doesnt have a point off the bench and still lose by 15 I had done quiet offensive dayve for him Bond Reed spikes it out of bounds with eight to shoot W Forest is blocking shots WG Forest is hitting threes W Forest is threatening to run away with this thing games last night the Virginia Cavaliers 7258 Victory overweight Forest thats Christian Jaden Isaac Isaiah Marcus and Joe my two guys that were over 20 points and then for Wake Forest its John Nate Kai Tyler Zack Sam Noah and Josh with a big game scoring his first career points in a manager game with a couple of triples guys have a lot of fun doing that they play late night in here and all coaches will tell you they cant survive without their managers they provide so much support and stability to programs around the country we were told Virginias managers did have a little packline defense thrown in there as well by the way theyre well schooled mimic their uh head coachs philosophies respectfully and wake for us shot a lot of Threes its great to see uh the guys having fun because uh they spend a lot of time helping the players become better if somebodys getting up a thousand shots a day hear these stories of players get to the gym at 5 in the morning theyre not by themselves theyre working out with the manager and those are the unsung heroes the glue that makes a college basketball program really tick lead is 15 for Wake here the foul was Jake gr up second a moment ago for UVA poopy Miller in the lane and thats Tracked Down by Zack Keller fresh 20 for the Demon Deacons whove been very good on the glass throw it into Reed working on Groves Reed has a big weight advantage on him and Reed gets to his right hand hes score for six for nine points hes had a couple of dunks so thats a big time post move right there playing against single coverage Steve Forbes thinks hes got a chance to play in the NBA Aton Reed ninth game here Bond Way Off the Mark leaned up by Grove shot clock didnt reset and pman hits his second three I think Reese beakman is one of the best right side of the box score players in the ACC hes going to get you steals assists he understands Personnel that hes got to be a threat more offensively calls number a little bit more right now 10 points four assists on a quieter day for him Salis inside done somehow someway this with a swim move in the off pants beautiful footwork 18 for Sal six shy of a career high Bon has been unafraid to shoot in this half just two for seven rebound cleared by Reed you know Wake Forest has had a size Advantage all game but really hadnt taken advantage of it until this second half and as Demon Deacons turn it over second time this half one week from today in ACC Network triple header struggling Clemson team trying to get right this week they got BC today theyll go to Miami next Saturday Cavaliers are on the road in Atlanta against Georgia teeken then pit Duke at Cameron indor ACC network streaming on the ESPN app as well big game tonight 700 Miami Virginia Tech two more bubble teams as these two are theres Dunn who gets to the left hand its his first field goal John padulla the point guard for Virginia Tech coming off a career high Tyler a career high off the bench Joe Lard has only got three ACC teams in the field right now Duke Carolina Clemson theyre about five more that you figure a couple of wins away these two Virginia Tech has a pretty good net ranking now Miami which the final four team a year ago certainly in the mix put NC State in that mix right now theyre four one in the league heres the ACC in the net rankings North Carolina destroyed Syracuse today theyre the only undefeated team in conferences play and these two teams are again its early but theyre right around the bubble Virginia a little bit harder nonconference schedule but their average margin of defeat UVA in around 20 points thats not going to help your efficiency rankings when you lose by that much Miner on the drop off from beatman out of traffic in there its poked away from car Ks on the deck bres gets it to done out to beat and that would have been a big one could have cut the lead to 11 instead its 14 and Keller is fou Jord miners second white cor starting to pull away on the glass right now plus n and rebounding margin it is not a great rebounding team W far as are 11 in the ACC and rebound margin but Virginia is the worst rebounding team in the ACC we far is a much bigger team Carr bumping and banging with Groves thats a third on Groves and now a one and one coming up for Andrew Applause KR the refs are pretty much been instructed one bump good second bump if its displacement you got a put a whistle on it thats coming straight from the NCAA Groves is going to take a seat for Music mcney and Andrew Carr to the line a nice bounce back afternoon for him with seven points and eight rebounds Andrew Music Carr misses the front end of the one and one this the second free throw attempt for WG Forest today and they by the way are the third best free throw shooting team in the country nearly 80 know tremendous acceleration off that stagger and he gets a great look hes just got to knock that down its two for nine today thats a shot he can make and he was making them the last couple of games been really good in conference play Frederickson the first bet points of the afternoon for Wake Forest from their threepoint Marksman largest lead for Wake Forest and a Parker Frederickson 3 and everythings coming up Demon Deacons on this Saturday afternoon all right gentlemen so Big 12 basketball coming up after this ACC game which has been dominated by wake farest the threeheaded monster of Salis Miller and Reed outscoring the nineheaded monster thats been Virginia today and that field goal number was before that last shot make it 13 for 46 UVA shooting at 28 and Wake Forest has stretched a sixpoint halftime lead to 17 just a reminder the ACC is nine and three against the Big 12 this year heres Miner score it plus a foul for Jord Miner season High 18 minutes for him hes up to a season High tying Applause points Miner doing a great job through contact finishing getting to the free throw line this is what Virginia needs easy buckets clock stopped get to the line two four there today sorry Kevin its all about the quarter qut D for for Virginia they dont like to extend so season High seven Jordan Miner somebody who earned himself his first start today he probably earning himself more and more minutes for Tony Bennett with this performance I would think so I mean hes hes got a physical frame and a presence on the front line that they need theres Carr little shimmy little Shake little score overdone it was anything but for Andrew Carter Im a little surprised that Ryan Dunn hasnt inserted himself a little bit more in this game hes only taken three shots I think hes going to be a guy thats got tremendous upside hes going to have to be more aggressive in their offense had a season High 16 their last time out he had 15 the game before that Ryan done thats the third foul on bopy Miller M far is six Ryan dun would be considered one of the most improved guys in the ACC we saw a couple the other night three points three rebounds last year for Ryan 13 minutes but everythings doubled now because his production is doubled due to his doubled his minutes as well Tony Bennett takes his third timeout again the wins and losses this season you know anytime you put statistics in wins or statistics and losses together its going to be dramatic its usually not this dramatic when Virginia wins its not close when they lose its not close either their losses 24 to Wisconsin on a neutral Court 23 at Memphis 22 at Notre a 16 in North Carolina State and Tony Bennetts team has always been a team that is at their best when they get ahead and kind of strangle you defensively and they have a tougher Time coming back back because of the pace of play right but this has been one of statistically one of his worst offensive teams at Virginia as be mccan CT theyre shooting under 30 today I wouldnt call it their shot selection either I think they have had some good looks but maybe were understating the Wake Forest defense and their length you know their size on the front line and Eon Reeds development inside even turns it over right here again its miner playing him straight up which is exactly the way Tony Bennett started the game in the post and this is not a traditional Tony benett team they were 25 and8 a year ago but nine newcomers they lost their whole front Court to the transfer portably Kaden shedric to Texas they only returned three players that had semiregular playing time and the guys they got in the transfer portal have not made the impact they hoped so far between roie and Miner and Groves heres one of those players Ro Salis blocks his shot Hunter Salis with major elevation beakman gets a piece of the paint roie got a pump fake maybe get Salis to fly by and then step by on that threepoint line six block shots for Wig farest today its a good shop blocking team McNeely fouled by hildr near the end to the shot Applause Music clock third foul cam hildr M will shoot Music two this has been an unusual afternoon for Isaac mcney who has lit up the ACC this year four for seven threes each of the last two games six against Syracuse today he is 0 for two from three he comes into the game fourth in the nation 494 from De but W Forest has done a terrific job making his life uncomfortable well I think you can give that credit to Cameron hildr I me hes the guy that lock and Trail off all that screening action and every change of pace every acceleration by Isaac mcy cam HTH is on his hip double to free throws the Le back down to 14 Virginias going to need some quick baskets which they typically dont get in the next few minutes to make this thing at all interesting down the Music stretch Miller almost had it taken away by beatman deep into the shot clock bopy Miller out to Carr inside done miners there to defend Carr steps back missed it a long possession it ends with a rebound for McNeely under five to play bakman into Miner Reed straight up Miner straight around him a season High nine for him and its down to a dozy yeah no quitting the Cavaliers thats for sure if they can get a stop right here in a bucket three stops in a row three baskets theyre right in it Miller again Beakmans been draped on his hip all afternoon hildr tough shot H when they need a bucket thats when Hill R wants the ball back to 14 420 to play beakman weaving his way good find by Roy and a threepointer missed dun spikes it off the Florida car Miller Millers going to take it himself little turbo boost and two at The Rim 30 second timeout taken by Steve for orbs with a big lead laid in Music Applause Music Home Arkansas Florida looking forward to that on ESPN guys here on ESPN two another big game for Hunter Salas who had just 10 points four turnovers in the loss of Florida State Tuesday this has been much more cican Ryan D only his fourth shot of the game and Wake Forest has been awesome defensively Virginia shooting in at 29 from the field theyve hit just three threes and the Demon Deacons are plus 11 on the glass after only being up six points at the break Steve Forbes team came out and they put a punch on Virginia their front line especially Andrew Carr with 11 rebounds and Fon Reed protecting the rim car with a second in the shot clock and Ryan Dunn with a rejection Applause Music Steve Forbes said after the loss on Tuesday against Florida State look usually the most aggressive team wins the game he thought Florida State didnt necessarily play harder but they were more aggressive so how do you measure Wake Forest in terms of aggression today I thought the second half there was definitely a sense of urgency about the way they played especially on their back row you know Fon Reeds ability to alter block shots around the rim and then in transition right here boys out a couple of times where hes been able to get out on a break after I thought some poor decision making by bopy Miller in the first half turned around here in the second I like a point guard who can answer what I call the three WS who to get the ball to when and where and I think bopy Miller did a much better job in the second half through the foul against McNeely Miller an 82 free throw shooter Music Lake far is the best free throw shooting team of the country outside of Stetson and Villanova theyre third at 799 and looks like theyre going to win this game without very many attempts at all this will be their fourth you have to have closers that can finish off a game especially in the back court last year break Forest lost 10 games in League Play Nine of the 10 were by single digits five of those were by one possession games you have to be able to understand situational offense you got to be able to take care of the basketball you got to be smart and finish games off and making free throws is a part of that cam hild with his fourth foul grabbing mcney Tony Bennetts team is a tough turnaround they get Virginia Tech on Wednesday dont forget Arkansas Florida coming up in just 8 minutes and Gainesville two teams 0 and two in SEC play a surprisingly slow start for Eric melans Razer backs a lot of college troops to come on ESPN after that Houston TCU the Cougars the last undefeated team in the nation lost to Iowa State on Tuesday tough road game for them and then Cincinnati another big 12 newcomer at Baylor following that at 800 had a lot of upsets during college basketball this week one two and three have all gone down Purdue losing to Nebraska Kansas lost at UCF another new team in the Big 12 andri Carr is going to shoot three free throws here with 226 to go Leon Bond committed the foul three shots one point for a double double for Carr and there it is all right so Wick Forest ACC so far wins over Virginia Tech and Miami here Boston College on the road heres whats coming up its not easy three of the next four on the road North Carolina State always off to a really good start in conference play also with one loss and then that UNC team which beat the stuffing out of Syracuse today and they are the only unbeaten team confence play RJ Davis the headliner in the conversation for ACC player of the year right now hes been fantastic and only getting better I know were only a couple of weeks in where do you think Wake Forest sits right now come on and where will they sit in the ACC hierarch you youve heard me before Ive talked about wake a lot already this season about how I know theyre going to impact the outcome of the race and theyre going to be right in the mix and they dont have deari Monsanto yet a great point he can come back sometime in January we watched some practice today hes starting to look pretty good I mean theyre expecting him at the end of January and thats another threepoint threat the best threepoint shooter in terms of makes last season in the ACC I think the upside for Wake is fantastic I like their team a lot and a lot of it had to do with Fon Reed being able to be eligible like all the other twotime transfers across the country theres Mar mon Santo Toren patella attendant at the end of last year not cleared for Full Court contact yet still getting the lower body back to strain Steve Forbes told us he he thinks hell have Jiao atuka back soon as well as a 15o per game score had Maris a couple of years ago so a team thats not very deep might get quite a bit deeper by the end of the month heres the Freshman Elijah gertrud getting his first run for Virginia today and that shot stroke from Deep by tan Murray by the way for Andrew Carr after the three free throws third double double of his season after three games in a row where he was in single Applause digits final 99 seconds Salis great crowd here at w Forest today too MC neia again theres Reed his been blocked ties a career high hes just a monster inside like you Canon gets up that time epon Reed with five block shots its averaging 18 per game on the year coming in that number is going to spike he just does a terrific job of reading that penetration 7 foot tall 240 and does a great job of holding his ground on the inside thats that threelevel defense Im talking about great ball pressure the ability to rotate on the second level and then having that Rim protection at the third level which is what Fon Reed provides for Steve Forbes wake farest up 16 in the final minute only one team is shot 50 or better against Virginia this year that was Notre Dame and Wake Forest is just under 50 with that last minut 24 for 49 so they can get back to 50 with a make here but either way a really good second half offensively some good possessions some long possessions they find some basket its late in the shot clock which you have to do against UVA and way far is going to get to 4 and one in ACC Play heres Salis theres your icing why not a fifth threepointer a new season high for Hunter Salis its been an impressive second half by wake your canid misses rebounded by who else but Salis got to get the ball across half quarter its a back cour violation wake farest figures that out they figured a lot out in this second half winning 6647 as the Demon Deacons blast the Cavaliers and get to 4 and one in ACC play for the fourth consecutive Year Steve Forbes team is
