Notre Dame is with leading the way tal who uh hes a monster down there Theyre going to have to put a body on him He was the leading rebounder in all of the nation a season ago in a transfer into the program for the Irish Theyre in the traveling blue Syracuse in the white First possession belongs to Notre Dame As John mentioned theyre coming off the loss Tuesday at home against number 17 Virginia 197 That was a double overtime Dive for the loose ball Its tied up and the hell ball and the arrow will favor the orange Already a little more defensive intensity right there Coach Ar told us before the game he said look our defense has slipped and that is why theyre on this losing streak Theyve given up almost 20 points more than their average for the season the last four games which they have all lost Notre Dames 11 and 10 on the season two and conference play The Orange 12 and N 3 and five in the ACC George with the miss from long distance Kept alive into the corner of Starling This is Kings through the double They go inside Kyle trying to muscle his way on the block Too strong off the glass You might hear me say this a lot tonight Carson Dout had the rebound for Notre Dame He is a monster down there helping his team get extra possessions on the offensive side of the ball as well as some good rebound defensively Kaylor into the paint off the glass and in Kaylor has been showing a little something lately The freshman showed some deep range in the Virginia game taking that drive right inside on Syracuse A double double The orange at the other end rocking the rim for Kyle His athleticism just pops when you watch the game William Kyle he he is a monster down there Theyre going to have to put a bite on him early Not let him get going He is the leading rebounder for the Orange this season 7 and 1 half per game and nine and a half points per from Kyle the senior He goes 69 230 taking up some space from the inside for the Orange That was knocked away and a whistle and a foul called Thatll be on George his first Kyle right here Nice pick roll getting out of there fast Hesitates pump fake slam right there Thats how you do it as a big man Patience Good timing on the roll Nice finish Five points eight rebounds in the loss for the Orange on Tuesday at NC State 8868 trying to get to the rim Harlson he was fouled in the act of shooting Stling picked up the foul Adrien Autry former player here at Syracuse in his third season 46 and 40 Last year they went seven and 13 in conference play In his first year back in 2024 the Orange were 142 on their home court with Harlson at the free throw line for the Irish Harlsons really good player Coach Shrewberry cheering third season at Notre Dame Look the record is not indicative of how good this team has been Theyre so close Injuries and just some unfortunate bounces havent went their way this year This is a good team a well coached team at that Theyve lost six of their last seven games Their last win was last Saturday at home Not Notre Dame Indiana 6864 against Boston College which was defeated earlier today on the CW by visiting Virginia number 17 in the nation Sterling straight away for Syracuse I love how the balls popping for Syracuse Theyre moving it around and usually good things happen when you move the ball around and you get a shot within rhythm of your offense Nice three by Stling right there to start the game off Stling who started his collegiate career in an Irish uniform has his 127th career threepointer at the other end Defense collapses Tout had to come back out to Shrewsbury who is wide open for three And thats like a layup for number 11 That shooter in the conference cannot give him a wide open layup Syracuse cannot lose track of him out there on that perimeter We go inside White is at the rim to finish off the play Kind of shaking his hand right there as he threw that pass like I dont know if they can guard me out here Well see if he keeps attacking Sadique White the freshman from Charlotte North Carolina who started all of the games when Donnie Freeman was unavailable Taylor tried to go baseline Cut off by the defending of White all the way almost into the back court Shoes received it The shot clocks at five Harlson got the shot away and calculates the angle for the Irish Beautiful kind of hesitation and patience by Harelson to get the ball in the lane Averaging 15 points a game and were not even talking about him because of the stellar freshman class in ACC and the he is the fifth leading freshman scorer in the ACC this season The foul goes against the Orange Bill Cington Jr Were all over the call Hes joined by Greg Evans and Anthony Es picked up the foul To go back on Harelson I mean 15 points a game and were not even really discussing him Its Its been that kind of year for freshman Um tough McDonalds AllAmerican Coach Shberry said we need to show him some love I agree Shersbury touts oneonone with Kyle Serta lets it fly Thats a guy youre going to want to watch if youre the orange Hes coming off a 34point performance from the loss against Virginia in double overtime Dave picks kind of found something running the offense for him and Shrewsbury Well see if they continue to do that Into the corner looking for a three and theyve got it from Kings one of the more solid consistent players that Q have had this year King has been a steady constant in this rotation scoring and defensively Something they need when theyre so up and down at their wins and losses Hes a red shirt senior from Salem Oregon Third leading scoreer on the team Kings averages just over 10 per game The Orange have made their last four shots Harrison had it denied by Kyle and out of bounds and its orange basketball is really good Averaging 15 points a game as a freshman in AC is no small feat We saw Tester Ritter earlier today for Virginia Caleb Wilson for North Carolina They scored a victory against Georgia Tech Back to the action inside the dome This is GEORGE Kyle against Tal Nice offensive set coming out of a timeout Another game stifled it T stepping out on Kings to prevent the Fury off the screen Shrewsbury comes up with the miss shot Orange coming off of that loss at NC State on Tuesday They trail by just four at halftime but it was all Wolfpack who by the way have their best ACC record now at 72 in 20 years for that program The game was a lot closer than the score indicates for Syracuse They were in it down the stretch deep into the shot clock for the Orange Ball near the Syracuse bench Itll be Orange basketball So far so good for Syracuse Showing a little bit of defensive intensity Hands and passing lanes right here Just George just keeps coming Active hands right here Making it tough MOTION MOTION MOTION I think thats what coach Archery wanted to see Maybe Freeman coming off the bench kind of spooked him a little bit Say Hey look I could be next Let me play a little defense Yeah that was Logan I who lost the handle He tried to give it to Harlson when they collided right in front of coach Aut Stling has a three in the first half Pivots and shoots I would have liked Stalin maybe to take that three in rhythm He made it a lot tougher shot but he is that type of player Hes really good Beautiful fade by him getting to the lane No surprise Coach Autry told us Starling sets the tone for his body language attitude and leadership qualities as a veteran player in an orange uniform He said he has brought in and the team is better for that And theyre trying to create a turnover on the baseline Its out of bounds The diving attempt though to try to keep it in play by Nate George Oh Dames got to settle in a little bit Syracuse turns over at a clean decent clip Top 20 in the country Theyve got to slow down a little bit and move the ball This is what Syracuse does So Harlson to the bench for Notre Dame They need to shoot it Shbury Kyle came out to challenge T couldnt get it away Fact He had it smothered by Sadique White Theyre going to rule it a shot clock violation Some suffocating defense from the Orange right now Theyre clicking on all cylinders defensively which is leading to things offensively right here The block by Sadi White Jr who hes been really good for them off the bench Nice to see him get a little more run with the starters He kind of fits in there a little better HE doesnt really want to score the ball More of a defender Starling trying to inch his way down the lane Kings lets it fly Tow high for the board Its been almost 4 minutes since the Irish scored points in this game as we go inside of 13 minutes to go in the first half Notre Dame had a 19point first half lead in that loss against Virginia at home That game went to double overtime Tout looking for a safety though I mean the defensive intensity is just night and day right now in their past three games Deep in the shot clock again Kind of a desperation shot at the end of the clock and Sundra hits it Got to finish their possessions Look great defensive possession didnt finish it with the challenge and things like that can happen with a good threepoint shooting team like about Garrett Sunder who had just two points and 25 minutes off the bench in a loss Tuesday against Virginia at home for the Irish George weaves his way into the paint gets the shot Here comes Shbury trying to work two game with Tout Tough catch Sundra cuts down the lane Cant lay it in Foul was called Got a little bit of something with the chest a little bit Looks like he elbowed him a little bit and and fouled him See here Nice pass by Tal to recognize the cutter Oh yeah he hit him in the head Not Hopefully they dont look at that though Its just a nice hard foul Second foul against White Garrett Sundra is at the free throw line coming forward Hes only been there seven times all season and made four of them Next week CW courtside Saturday back with another double header First Virginia Tech heads to Raleigh for a pivotal matchup with NC State followed by Boopy Miller and SMU taking on Tough minded Kick Its a CW courtside music Saturday double header next week starting 130 pm Eastern 1030 am Pacific Its only on the CW for us all day We started with Virginia on the road at Boston College That was a back and forth matchup ultimately won by the Cavaliers Game two CW courtside Saturday Kings in the Orange against the Irish and Kings has three Nice double screen and roll with Freeman and Kyle The roll by Kyle freed up Kings in Kings in the corner They need to run that again next time until Notre Dame stops that Nate Kings has a thousand points in his college basketball career playing in his 79th game Once he get deep into the shot clock and thats a miss from Sir MOHAMD Starling looking for some rhythm Did that hit the glass and go I dont know what time it is but I guess the bank said on Saturday cheering Whoa It was kind of an awkward up bring it down and then try the shot and it worked out okay But then again man good things happen when you move the ball and play the game the right way Shots like that will fall from four of six on threepointers for the Orange as a team 33 this year from beyond the arc Tries one for the Irish Donnie Freeman elevates for the board Freeman looking to get into the buck score in the scoring column Sophomore from Washington DC kicks it back out to Kings King steps around the defenders They go around the perimeter Darling cheering he is feeling it right now Jay Scarlet this is the break the Orange needed in this losing streak They look really good right now Not only offensively but defensively Theyre playing their tails off Thats a 9 run in the last two minutes for the Orange 2112 Kyle has it cheering Freeman steps into a three over top of backboard and out of bounds into Notre Dame Carlin by the way playing in his 106th career game tonight And both coaches left no doubt This is a very important game This is paramount at this juncture in the season for both these programs John Syracuse gets a win They start kind of creeping up towards the top half of the ACC And thats all you can ask for this late in the season Give yourselves a chance Intercepted George bounce pass Anthony up and under trying to spin it off the backboard Fouled in the process The Orange break neck pace so far John Yeah the break neck pace defense into offense right here Nice pass to set up Anthony for the reverse Almost gets there Anthony will be at the mark Hes got two shots Cayenne Anthony at the free throw line His numbers were slightly up when Donnie Freeman was out of the lineup Freeman missed nine games with a foot injury So the production has gone down slightly for Cayenne Anthony Just lineup change figuring out your place as different players come in and out One thing that is for sure he has an elite offensive feel and he will definitely figure it out on that side of the ball Free throws going in is a good indicator for the Orange as well They struggle from the line 63 of the team is at the bottom of the ACC Mohamed This is oneonone action with Anthony Drops it off to tout over the front rim Looks like Notre Dame made an emphasis to kind of go at the freshman Anthony make him defend on the other end Just created a layup for tal off the glass for Stling on the drive 13 points now for Stling Thats above his season average of 11 and a half Second on the team right down Broadway from Mohamd with a layup Kind of a miscommunication between Anthony and Stling Theyve got to figure that out as theyre going to Mohamd right now I just see kind of a weakness in the Syracuse defense on the other end Orange five of eight on threes Theyre going to try another one and theyve got it from Tyler Betsy 70 of his shots are threes You have to know that coming in the game understanding that is what he wants to do 35 made threes on the season for Betsy Six made in the game Syracuse has run away from their made average per game from beyond the arc They average about seven which is 16th in the conference Shot clock to eight Serta Freeman may have altered the trajectory of the shot 100 he altered that trajectory making sure to think a little bit on that layup ultimately affecting that shot Anthony Long rebound and Top comes up with it Taylor entry Tout got it right back Lets it fly Tout lays it in Anonys got to put a body on T I know it was mismatch right there with size but cant let him just have a few run to the rim ultimately leading the two points Notre Dame looks like matchup zone trying to switch it up a little bit on the offensive side for Syracuse Touts the grad student spent the last four years at Northern Arizona and a turnover Taylor came away with it Missed from long range Notre Dame is one of the better threepoint shooting teams in the league as Stling spins and loses it Irish are sixth in the conference in threepoint shooting First its another threepointer for the Orange Betsy fires away He hits the three Six of the game Tout on the offensive uniform And Jim Beahheim courtside 47 years over a thousand victories the most at one school and the most at your alma mada He was a player here and an assistant coach as well Thats an offensive foul against the Orange Trying to run something for Betsy Syracuse has got to keep the ball popping a little more Switch sides Thats how they started the game off Now its kind of one pass one accident shot If its not there they got to keep going Adrien Archery also played 121 games in an orange uniform for Coach Beheim Participated in three NCAA tournaments The Orange trying to return to that tournament for the first time since 2021 A lot of work to do Shbury the miss Freeman the clearance Syracuse going small right now with Freeman at the five Well see if that works out for them offensively has got to get down in the post right now Try to take inside Freeman drives and scores in his first bucket of the game Credit to Freeman for not coming off the bench and being kind of overly thirsty to score right Hes playing within himself within the offense and good things happen Nice drive on a smaller defender Prior to that bucket the Orange on a 232 run and shooting well above 50 from the floor as a team in this first half Shley has to send it back out So the miss right back to him He hits the deck and a foul called Freeman in the neighborhood collects the foul Giving up a little bit of size down low offensive rebound But I like how Syracuse is running Notre Dame off the line Long shots long rebounds happen But they keep running Notre Dame off the line and making them shoot those contested one dribble threes Youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State Youre in good hands So Donnie Freeman now has two personal files He is on the Octry bench at the moment Cole Cert is at the free throw line John 94 on the season Im going to say Im going to stop now I was going to say first in the conference in free throw percentage I cant shoot 94 in the gym by myself So credit it to him A lot harder than it looks from that free throw line So one of two from the stripe for the sophomore who averages over 10 points per game for the Irish Betsy turns around and hits looked good for the minute He turned around loaded up nice and calm shot the ball Its kind of like a warmup jumper for him Syracuse has made seven of their last nine shot attempts Betsy struggled against NC State on the road Braden Shbury does not struggle from beyond the arc Hes going to have to be a little more aggressive This Notre Dame team struggling from the offensive side Syracuse did not get out there on him Hes is the best shooter in the ACC by percentage Yeah hes two for two on threepoint attempts so far in the game for Braden Shbury Harlson picks up the foul for Notre Dame It is a 10point advantage 430 to go in a rapid first half So glad that youre with us on CW Courtside Saturday Tom Wormy along with John Henson twotime defensive player of the year in the ACC in a Carolina And it rolls off the edge of the rim for Betsy Shbury launches again His first miss from threepoint real estate He has 210 career made threes Anthony trying to make his way to the rim and Serta bumped him on the way fouls on number six Thats his second They gave it to Kaylor according to the announcement Slapped him on the arm right there as he was trying to throw it to the corner Sun comes in for Kaylor Kaylor 16 points 10 rebounds in the double overtime loss against Virginia at home this week for the Irish lowle back out Three attempt from Betsy Came up short Haroldson cheering and he rocks the stansion with the onehanded slam I I saw him moving a little slower and he just like he was on a trampoline right there Harelson Wow The freshman from Anderson Indiana Almost took that one off the hinges here inside the dome cheering AT THE OTHER END KYLES ON the business end for Syracuse Nice lob drive in the lane to kind of settle down a little bit after that massive dunk by Harlson How about those two plays on each end of the court Harrelson at one end Kyle at the other inside getting free for the Irish Sundra found a little daylight You heard Betsy say call out the back screen They got to communicate on that Tough for them defensively when you dont know back is coming Anthony puts it on the floor Ran into a double team Stling against Shbury Got the shot away Sterling Stling John 15 points Hasnt missed a shot yet and hes made three threes Keep going Hey till you miss Get Haroldson at the other end Freshman starting to feel a little bit down there They might have to try to get him some help Just chiseling his way into the orange defense for another two for Harlson Stling is not the defender you want him down there down low 67 215 Harelsons a good boy Sean how about the intensity from these two teams in this game Kyle steps around the defender Another just patient move by Kyle I love the patience he has in there inside As a big patience was one of the hardest things for me to get playing He looks like hes got it figured it out right now Six points for Kyle Harrison operates at the other end Harlson That one off the glass Picked up by Kyle cheering Fastm moving first half Both of these teams balls Six rebounds in the first half for Kyle Inside of a minute and a half to go in the first half Shbury clears it after the miss by Kings Tow kicks it into the corner Somehow the Irish keep it alive with Sherta Irish got to settle down right here and run a run a good play Shbury shed the defender and knocks down the three ball Holding true to what he does he has kept Notre Dame afloat with his threepoint shooting tonight Hes played three games previously against the Orange and shot 58 from threepoint distance and hes keeping it up tonight as well Might be a standard color Thats what Im thinking Follow away from Starling Hes got the touch on the baseline John Henson How about this first half for the Irish and the Orange High scoring a lot of offense cheering 4031 the lead for Syracuse First Harl time Harrison says Meet me up top Listen for number 21 Lawrence Molton His family also on hand for our game this evening Thats all coming up at the half 4031 Syracuse shooting just over 61 music as a team John Yeah Um you know Notre Dame should feel fortunate Only down nine right now right This is a big possession for both teams Id imagine theyre going to run something for Shrewsbury Maybe use his offensive gravity to create for someone else to create open shot for himself However should make four threepointers Shbury has made three of them Hey Will were down to 10 seconds Harlson continues to pound it into the floor Trying to work off a screen and drive against three defenders Kick up the Frost Came up short Sparling did not get it away Great channels by Sadique White Jr as well to affect that threepoint shot total at NC State on Tuesday in the loss made seven of 19 shot attempts So cannot forget what got him to this point It was defense not offense Harlson around the edge Ser from the corner Tout had to send it back out They tried the other corner unsuccessfully with Kaylin Kyle got lucky leaving a corner threepoint shooter to collapse in which you tend to do as a big man because thats where you naturally gravitate to the rim Four of 13 for the Irish on threepoint tries on target in front of his own bench Its a three ball Starting the second half like they started the first half Moving the ball getting into the lane kicking it out swinging in rhythm They need to continue to do that if they want to win this game right now So far so good Third threepointer for Kings 149 career threes For Kings Haroldson attacks the rim I guess Syracuse is content with trading twos for threes That was a little bit too easy I think Notre Dame should continue to go to that until it stops Eighth straight game for the Orange John making six or more threepointers So theyve come on strong from beyond the arc White came up short Harlson has it Come here Will Come here Will Got to get it back to Harelson That is your mismatch right here Trying to back it down against George Kyle came to help Tout sent it out TO SHBURY THAT IS SLIGHTLY OFFLINE Another good offensive possession Shot did not fall They better continue to let Harrison create Kyle trying to step around his defender Taylor Taylor Kaylor just picked up his third personal foul Opening moments of our second half Teams played twice last year Each team won on its home floor kept alive on the baseline Out of bounds it is Orange basketball Plenty of time on the shot clock Sadique White Jr has to kind of take his time Hes a little rush down there No one is longer or more athletic than you on the court Gather your feet go up with confidence and score the basketball Syracuse by 10 A chance to increase that lead off the end Kyle tried to jam it over and almost did it aggressively off the inbounds for the Orange Nice setup right here on the screen making Tal go under and and let the cow come over the top for the lob Credit to Tal getting there in time to affect that shot for a free throw shooter that could potentially miss Not very good from the line Just a 49 free throw shooter William Kyle at the free throw line Will the final third 453 lead So Kyle had 40 dunks prior to the start of this game Hes got a couple so far Right Had one instance where Harlson dunked at one end Kyle did it at the other end And now Kaylor cut off on the baseline by White Bash into one another again deep in the shot clock A long attempt hit the rim by Serta And here comes the orange with Starling Kick out George lines up the three Tap back out to Kings George a little closer to the rim this time Same result Struggle this year a little bit George hes trying to find his rhythm still And that will drop Nice spin cycle by Harelson Hes got to keep attacking for Notre Dame Make sure this game does not get away from him First Irish player to get to double digits Harlson now with 11 points 19 times hes gotten to double digits in scoring two George George his first bucket He had been 0 for four prior to that shot Its just trusting your work understanding that everythings not going to fall Keep playing with confidence I love that shot by him The very next possession after missing two Transfer from Georgia Tech Junior from Toronto Ontario Canada Shbury misfires George He was full throttle all the way to the rim and lost the handle Had it knocked away and out of bounds Starting to see a little bit of Notre Dame kind of huffing and puffing a little bit Maybe that double overtime game of four guys played over 40 minutes is starting to weigh on their legs a little bit down the stretch They look a little tired right now You were talking about Braden Shou You played 47 minutes in that game John Tuesday at home against Virginia in a losing effort Kings with a fancy escape dribble Shbury all the way to the rack for the Irish That is not what you want A fast break to a middle drive down the lane No resistance Thats not how Syracuse got to this point Theyve got to sh that up So 11 points now for Shria as well 22 from he and Harlson in the game Stling right down the lane High degree of difficulty for Nate Kings Hanging and scoring Been their most consistent player all year Hes doing the same thing tonight Nice drive middle off the catch So Kings to double figures with 11 Starling defending Harlson knocked it away but picked up the foul Shrewsbury right here with a little bit of hesy Oh theyre not going to guard me Let me just take this right to the lane Layup Syracuse King here coming here with a nice lefthanded finishing what theyve been doing so far Yeah just two points so far for Donnie Freeman who averages 192 per game and that is the best on the Syracuse roster Harlson at the free throw line 62 of the season for Harlson This is his 121st free throw attempt of the year Getting to the strike with frequency Top 40 in of the country in fouls drawn 440 SO HE HE likes to attack Thats just his physical nature of his game 11 assists on 19 made field goals for the Orange Matchup zone right here for Notre Dame Trying to switch it up a little bit See if they can disrupt Syracuse rhythm offensively Plus six on the boards as well The advantage for the Orange Freeman turns and fires Theyve got to continue to get Harelson attacking Get him on the post He has a clear mismatch right here Told you about the enormous importance of this game as gets it inside and lays it in This is an Irish team thats lost six of seven Syracuse trying to stop a four game losing streak Crucial moment for Syracuse to get a good shot on this possession as the zone seem to slow them down a little bit They got to figure it out Starling tease it up Sunder the rebound Harlson back out to Shu Almost had a kind bounce as it popped out Another break for Syracuse They got to take advantage of the ball bouncing their way sometimes Big offensive possession George to Freeman Lot of work on Harlson Big power dribble Harlson tried to stand his ground Got a piece of Freeman who was trying to make his move A little too physical on that defensive possession right here See Freeman with the 192 points per game Remember he missed nine games with a foot injury So hes playing in his 13th game this season for the sophomore from Washington DC Tomorrow CW womens hoops double header first number seven Louisville as out west to face a Cal team looking to pull the upset and Notre Dame led by Hannah Hadalgo takes on Berial Power Stanford CW womens hoops double header tomorrow starting 2 pm Eastern 1100 am Pacific only on the CW By the way Louisville on a 13game winning streak for head coach Jeff Walls and its all part of our double header tomorrow This is game two of CW courtside Saturday SERTA HAD A BLOCK BY FREEMAN RIGHT at the rim That was a high level block by Freeman right there coming across for S even though he tried to quickly to Kyle from George cheering Nice possession That block led to a nice kind of offensive possession for Syracuse in transition Finishing with the nice lob dunk by Kyle Kyle into the double digits with 10 points after that thunderous slam 11 Nice block And then George this is what he does He wants to pass the ball and get his teammates involved Nice dunk by Kyle When he gets to that high I dont think theres many people that can get up there with him Finish strong Five assists for Nate George in the game Its 117 for the season for him That leads the club as Notre Dame keeps it alive TO FALLING DOWN Hit the three He wanted contact He didnt get it cheering And now it appeared that Bill Cington Jr has called a technical foul on Serta Little too much on the back end of that three Probably a little frustrating Hes had a rough day today Syracuse ran him off the line You dont want to counter that with your technical mouth Your three becomes one Nice shot right here But got to leave the ref alone This isnt the association Two shots is a big deal when youre down by nine points for eight points before then Freeman at the line for the Orange County Freeman So Syracuse now seven of eight from the line John they have struggled from the line as a team this season Just 63 is at the bottom of the ACC Tough for Notre Dame This could be a four to five point swing Syracuse scores right here which is not what you need down double digits Last win was January 13th at home against Florida State ITS A THREE cheering FROM THE CORNER from Kings and the largest lead of the game for Syracuse And a timeout Notre Dame cheering right here The technical foul allows them to set up their offense and now an eightpoint lead becomes a 13point lead just like that Thought he was fouled after one of his threepoint attempts Notre Dame is in a little bit of a danger zone right now and Syracuse senses it with picking up their pressure fullourt Notre Dame has to get a good shot on this possession and not let this game get away from them Syracuse has won six of the last eight meetings between the teams Drop it low for the onehanded hammer and it was Serta who found him underneath sort of with the pass Lets see the other way Betsys got three Took too much time to celebrate Harlson spins BACK THE OTHER WAY HE cheering LAYS IT IN AND HE WAS FOULED FOR THE IRISH WHAT A SEQUENCE BETWEEN THESE two teams What a play by both teams getting the ball out hitting the three and right here another just spin cycle Catches Kyle Con with his back turn under and he says Look when youre dealing with a shot blocker you cant just go to lay it up You got to put it on his head Harlson says Look take this since you jump so high The speed I mean right out of the NASCAR promo moment that was appropriate They ran up and down the court Full throttle from the Irish and the Orange High level sequence right there Harlson for the old school threepoint play By the way George is out of the game now Hes got three personal fouls for the Orange Thats big for them Hes been running the point being very solid moving the ball around Well see if that changes for Stling the point now The lead is 11 Kings drawing defensive attention And back out to Stling He takes it to the teeth of the Irish D and hits the front rim Hines comes away with it Thought that Harlson had lost it There is a timeout on the court And when we come back 21 Coach Beheim sitting courtside watching the Irish and the Orange Harlson the freshman right at Freeman Gutsy play Thought he was going to try to euro or something He went right at Freemans chest Thats what you do to a shot blocker You go right in his chest Hard to block a shot when someones riding your grill How about Harrison now with 20 points driving old school finger roll right there We dont see that too often these days I like that First points of the second half for Stling 19 points in the game Hes the leading scoreer for the Orange Theyve got three in double digits Have to go back out to Ims Shot clock is at 10 Shrewsbury Sundra Twoman game Kyle wrestles it away from the Irish in the outlet for Starling Middle got to start stringing some stops together if they want to get this game with the cheering distance of them being able to win Theyve got to get it Its under double digits with 8 minutes to go It could be a long 8 minutes for them trying to come back Shrewsbury trying to get away from the defender Hes able to create contact with the pump fake and hell go to the free throw line His first number of Syracuse Kings picked up the foul for the Orange to send Braden Shbury to the free throw line 77 on the season Hes the number one threepoint shooter in the ACC by percentage Your favorite board games now your favorite game shows All new episodes of Trivia Pursuit hosted by Lavar Burton and Scrabble hosted by Craig Ferguson here

advantage on that backside and Kings rewards Syracuse from moving the ball 16 points for Kings had a season high 27 at Boston College and made five threes goes inside Easy jams out All because of Harelson and how hes affecting this game They got to keep running things for him Maybe put him at the point guard position and see if he can facilitate offenses the offense The game at BC for the Orange was an overtime loss It is part of four in a row Its Kings number four breaks free The lead is 11 Were inside of nine minutes to go in regulation from the dome 16 assists on 25 makes That is how you win ball games Doubt from Shbury And now Harlson bumped by Kyle What did coach Shbury tell us about playing games in the dome Now granted just his third year but he says its always wild when we come to Syracuse and play in the dome It has kind of been a wild game back and forth Notre Dame cant seem to get over that hump from 9 to 11 points Theyve got to string some stops together Once again theyre kind of look a little winded huffing and puffing a little bit Well see if they can sustain and try to make a comeback Teams played in mid January in the dome a season ago That was a win for the Orange 7769 Last win at the dome was January of 2020 for the visiting Irish SHBURY SOME DAILY FOUL was called in the aftermath Usually you dont see Shoes but he missed by that much when hes

aggressive right now with their star freshman out It looks to be something on the side Donnie Freeman now playing in the second half with three personal fouls Rattles out Hes got the assignment to guard Shbury trying to work off of the tout screen It does not develop Hines trying to shed the defender Difficult shot on the following It rims out White with the rebound Six rebounds in the game for White who got the start for Freeman And coach Afrey will call Shelley to my broadcast partner music John Henson I think every game Ive done theres been a Syracuse alum on staff at some point So this is the method You can barely get the words out there John Thanks for the help And on top of that we have an exceptional game between visiting Notre Dame and Syracuse at home where they are 10 and four this season 1 and three in conference play That was the win January 13th against Florida State Two3 right here by Notre Dame How about make a stand Poked away by White Freeman does not have the numerical advantage Didnt care much about it and coughed it up to Harlson And there you have it Under eight Its a twopossession game That is what Notre Dame needed to do They have done that Now the pressure is on Syracuse to score the ball Take a good shot at the offensive end Six made threes in the game for Notre Dame Two from Sa nine of 22 on threes Shot clock is at seven George Kings just got away Just beats the shot clock Hes hit enough threes today where Notre Dame has to take account Hes shooting over 40 in league play Just a mental mistake by Notre Dame letting him shoot uncontested Its now 21 points for Kings who comes up with the steal Bouncing angle to the rim Harlson fouls him Notre Dame Youve got to understand the shot clock is running down The only thing they can do is shoot threes Shrewsbury you cannot leave a threepoint shooter wide open And this right here nice hard foul by Harrison Make him get it from the line from a free throw shooting team that isnt the best Harlson now has three personal fouls Syracuse now with 10 made threes as Sundra comes in Thats the fourth time this season 10 or more Braden Shbury words of encouragement from his father Micah as he goes to the bench for the Irish I dont know how long they can survive without him He might get a quick slick of water and get ready to go back in Theyre going to need him So Kings who had that last three John now has made five in the game Nobody takes more or makes four for the Orange on three points Son of misses Theyre doing this with Donnie Freeman with just five points Kings check the line we side and a reset from the orange Nate George Freeman puts it up and was fouled Listen credit to Donnie Freeman Only five points five rebounds not forcing it playing within himself even though hes the leader with his team Sign of a real winner Something that probably pro scouts are watching how he handles this Hes handled it well Not being in the starting lineup by percentage Donnie Freeman the best free throw shooter for the Orange and Coach Autry who is going to go to the bench and get Starling to the scorers table 81 of the season for the sophomore Coming off his second double double of the year against NC State 24 points and 10 boards The fastest growing cable news network in all of television is NewsNation NewsNation respects all Americans and is news for all Americans To find NewsNation on your screen go to newsowcom Daniels going to have to string together some stops and offensively get good shots preferably threes with Shrewsbury on the side I wonder where thats going to come from Betsy off the miss from Freeman Syracuse just has to get good shots every possession get a good shot on the rim No turnovers and they should win this game Theyve won four in a row at the against cheering Notre Dame And that is George cheering 70 run after the last minute and change for the Orange Thats tapped away and taken George to White Angley to the rim and he lays cheering it in and a timeout Notre Dame a player that coach trusts to take them home tonight Six rebounds as well for Sadique White above his season average of three and a half per game And the Orange is a team shooting 55 John That is well above their season average of 47 90 run over the last minute 40 That is how you finish games Shoes Youd have to think threepointers from him would be part of the equation for the Irish Carlson driving He lays it in beat White to the rim Both players go down and get up Hes good Hes really good Thats now 22 points for Jaylen Harlson And that is a new season high for Harelson Foul in the orange to the dismay of Adrien Archery on the screen here His third personal team on third on white off the screen Coach Al did not like that one to say the least Just over four minutes to go in regulation Syracuse led by nine at halftime Entry Harlson will live with these tough twos hes making right now Just no threes not foul and stop the clock either but either way theyll live with that Syracuse up 13 Back to the free throw line for Harlson who is four of five from the stripe and 22 points That leads all scorers Kings with 21 for the Orange and he looks really good right now playing Syracuse tonight Hes five of 10 on threepointers in the last four games 55 from Nate Kings from long distance Harlson at the line for the Irish You wonder how much gas in a tank Notre Dame has I mean four guys played over 40 minutes this week This Virginia looks like three or four guys are going to go over 35 in this game I think thats a factor against the Soyus Harlson is one of those guys John He played 44 minutes on Tuesday at home against Virginia Had 20 points He was eight of 10 from the free throw line seven assists Hes the leading scorer tonight for the Irish with 24 points Six of seven from the strike down for Harlson Well good thing about this snow outside Well get some recovery right there outside the arena No need for the Freeman Hes got nowhere to go The shot clock is at four Starling look not a a great offensive possession but you ran the clock down and got a shot up Dead ball turnover You can live with that being up double digits right now Now you just got to get a stop 10 of 25 on threes for the Orange leading by 11 319 and rolling John No threes at this Threes are the only thing that can beat you right now Braden Shbury hasnt made one in the second half and they produce a turnover Kings will jam cheering it Double fisted rim rocker for Syracuse Our player of the game put an exclamation point on it What a fitting way for him to finish this night Shbury gets a kind bounce Kings now with 23 in the game on nine of 15 shooting King season high We mentioned that Boston College in an OT loss 27 points where he made five threes Freeman in tight quarters Couldnt handle the pass from White Certa steps into a free ball The Irish needed it Its too much Then they fight for the loose ball Harlson and Shbury in the vicinity George hit the court awkwardly Fourth on Harlson now Leading scoreer for the Irish tonight Oneonone situation Syracuse nine of 12 from the free throw line We had mentioned the fact that it had not been a strong suit so far this season You know coach Autry told us prior to the game despite that miss an apparent foul against the Orange Bill Cington Junior calling a foul on White If theres Syracuse right here this is still late game execution You have some tough games coming up North Carolina with those two bigs You still have to execute and focus down the stretch because youre not always going to be up 11 points and thats a big one Stopping the clock and letting get points potentially Its Kaylor at the line for Notre Dame John youre right Monday at North Carolina 7 Eastern Theyll also host North Carolina at the dome on the 21st of February And then the next game is at number 17 Virginia next Saturday which we saw go on the road and win at BC in game one of CW courtside Saturday today Not to build good habits in a game You cant make them That right there was just a bad free throw kind of box situation In fact the next home game not till February 11th against Cal for Syracuse Just over two minutes remaining Not in front 77683 Tout picks up the foul for the Irish Not the guy foul 80 free throw shooter One and one for Freeman Syracuse has led by as many as 15 in this game here in the second half Shri had it knocked away by Kings on the way up Active hands GEORGE DRIBBLE AND cheering THE ALLEY TO KINGS FOR THE JAM AND A FOUL That is what George does He likes to distribute and give his give his teammates a chance to make plays Nice split double team with the lob right here Nice split right here and then the lob at the end Unnecessary foul right there but Syracuse looks to have sold this thing up with about two left How about 10 assists in the game for Nate George Thats 13 in the last win here in the dome Florida State Thats what he did at Georgia Tech So its good to see him breaking out of that shell and getting more comfortable with this team Lot of activity around the rim as Freeman defended on the driving Harelson George was also there Drive right here Verticality is good but you know what He got the body and came down That is a foul indeed It feels like John once you bring those arms down as opposed to keeping him straight up in the air theres a likelihood of a foul call And thats what weve got to put Carlson with the free throw line My rule you got to stay vertical When the arms come down theyre going to call a foul every time Dont forget the womens double header in the ACC tomorrow Louisville Cal Notre Dame Stanford Irish men making the trip to the dome where they have not won since 2020 And now were down to the final 140 It would be five wins in a row against Notre Dame here on their home court to the Orange if they can hang on to the 10point lead with 27 from threepoint distance Thats way below their season average of 35 Thats one of the better numbers in the ACC Thats been a critical part of this game Over their last four losses theyve allowed 82 and 12 points now sitting at 70 Thats how you win games Double team on Betsy Stepping through ANOTHER JAM AS HE DOES A chin up Making a good game Great by Kings Just stay on the back line and trying to be open Make sure his teammates is open Harlson got fouled Credit to Betsy for being patient and hes good at define and open Kings under the basket Good execution by him not panicking with the double team So 28 points from Kings Now thats a new season high His careerhigh is 30 This is coming off a game at NC State where Kings had six points and three rebounds and made two threes cheering Massive production from Nate Kings tonight the red shirt senior from Salem Oregon cheering The five threepointers just went off his careerh high What a night for Kings cheering cheering 48 And now the final minute from the dome Starling accelerates to the rim and stays down after the play He had a head of steam to the basket Couldnt see it but looks like he hit himself or someone hit him in the face on that drive So theyll attend to Starling on the baseline Calling the floor is a common foul on blue six Were going to review the play for a possible update Thats Kaylor whistled for the foul for Notre Dame on the drive by Starland Bombs on number six Brady Taylor of Notre Dame His personal foul But Kayla was trying to block it on the other side of the rim and got a lot of Starling on the follow through Hopefully the nose is okay Ive broken my nose twice So lets crack that thing back in there and keep going Still handsome as ever This is Bill Cington Jr After review the common foul has been upgraded to a player one foul The basket is scored He will be awarded two free throws and the ball will be placed at the end 20 seconds on your shot clock So Kaylor fouls out His foul upgraded to a flagrant one And essentially the terminology involved there excessive and or unnecessary Flagrant two involves extreme andor unnecessary So that deemed excessive and a flagrant one against Kaylor So we just been informed that Starling he may have been taken back to the dressing room applause He was He was escorted back Obviously there was some blood after the contact So Syracuse selects Freeman for the free throw attempts Looks like Notre Dame has waved the white flag Um you know Yeah So this Starling was Kaylor going for the block Kind of caught him in the facial area off the inbounds for the orange And another foul Thats Zephr whos coming in the game Another day and you got to kind of flush this one Youve got a big time game at Louisville coming up on Wednesday Theyve got to figure out how to get these guys some rest and and recovery Its two tough games that their starters have played over 34 35 minutes and its not getting any easier Yeah theyre going to be two and eight in their last 10 games John with the wins at home against Boston College and at Stanford And the Irish will drop to 11 and 11 on the season Syracuse with its largest lead of the game late here in the final minute Theyre going to improve to 139 four and five in conference play and 11 and four at the dome this season Tough shot from Mohammed Nate Kings led the way with 28 points JJ Starling had 21 applause and cheering Now if youre Syracuse right now youre sitting at four and five trying to creep back up into the top half of the ACC You got to start stringing together some wins And remember only the top 15 of 18 Go to Charlotte for the ACC tournament the 73rd edition March 10th to the 14th at Spectrum Center for the fourth time Dukes won it twice there North Carolina won it back in 2008 Expect himself with Kings at the free throw line trying to add to his season high Theyre trying to get him this theyre trying to get him his season high It looks like he he mess it up or his career high cheering Noah Labell has come into the game number 24 in white for the final 157 seconds Action in his fourth game this season and well put the finishing touches on this one Final five seconds A ninepoint halftime lead and a foul on the play with 15 seconds to go Ref said to the fat lady scene I got to make these calls Adrien Autry just kind of threw up his hands Well its going to stop a four game losing streak though He said everything has to come together for us A lot of moving parts if we can just combine all the good things and make it happen Valiant effort from coach Shburys team is not quite enough here at the dome Five straight wins against the Irish at the dome for thanks to Johnny O the official apparel partner of CW courtside Saturday And once again that final score 8672 For John Henson our entire crew Im Tom Wormy We thank you for watching Tune in tomorrow for a big CW
