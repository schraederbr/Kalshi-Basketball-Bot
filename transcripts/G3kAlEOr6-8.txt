main man Hunter Salis this guy can knock it down on the outside he can get anywhere on the floor anytime he wants to get 30 points versus the trees from Stanford because he goes inside for H clock basket the concentration and the strength to finish around the rim six straight 20point games for Hunter Salis officials today Clarence Armstrong Trey Di and Jeff Pon Virginia attack after a rough start to the season much improved theyve won three out of four their three and three in conference wake comes to blackburg 5 and one in leag play and riding a four game win streak Salis controls to start for Wake Forest heres cam hildr out of 30 burger last weekend against Miami and an early turnover by wake yeah they went inside to the big man f Reed treding to put some pressure on poti underneath but he was ready for the challenge gets the turnover starting lineups for Virginia Tech Ben Hammond back in the lineup as the wall misses the three Hammond missed three games with a foot injury and Toby Leal coming off that double double 2010 game against NC State and a 15point comeback starting lineups for Wake Forest they are 4 and0 since Tyler Johnson moved into the starting lineup with the three rims out by Salis and then Trayvon Spillers down low last three games 22 out of 28 from the field really like Spillers strong aggressive guy right hand left hand hooks youre going to see a big heavy dose of that over the course of the ball game today heres malel potit immediate double team extra pass the three on its way no Good by jayen Young goodlooking sophomore who had 14 against Cal last weekend yeah we T talked to Coach Forbes and he wants a double te po te on that B on that post see if they can create some turnovers Reed from the outside Fon Reed just a second three in 14 attempts this season I I was getting ready to say they left him so wide open I was going to be curious whether or not the big fell was going to stroke the triple and he did its a different ball game the one I played back in the ACC and the yeah they pull you to the bench if you took that shot right coach Smith yeah the ball wouldnt have it hit the rim he would already had somebody up for me Virginia Tech turns it over Toby lell Aton Reed yeah he can shoot that threepoint shot but just 22 for his career is you look at Mike young Milestone Mike on Wednesday picked up his 100th win as the Virginia Tech head coach has a chance for career win number 400 today you know hed like to get that today at home in front of his friends and family and faculty ELD loves to post up facing up left it short he struggled from the field on Wednesday against Stanford one for 12 but got to the free throw line 10 times here is Hammond to lightning quick point guard the skip almost a turnover retrieved by Hammond to plenty of time on the shot clock Music poti picked up the bounce Tyler Johnson The Freshman almost turned it over shot clock it one and that is a shot clock violation good defense by wake really good defense by wake did a nice job communicating the all the dhs dribble handoffs cut off the Baseline first a tough pass into the corner with two seconds and it wasnt much Hammond could do it when he caught it so SE some good D on both sides Hokes defense inside hasnt allowed anything and nor has Wake Forest Steve Forbes is telling us it shoot around that yeah the struggles on the road hard to explain its been a jackal and Hyde sort of team in Winston Salem and away from Winston Salem the face up by Trayvon Spillers falls short yeah they I love that little inside reverse pivot he created some space but spillers at his best when hes getting into the paint no doubt about that thats a rare miss too he has been hitting almost everything the last few games out lot of dribbling by potit here is the hero from Wednesday Jaden shot who scored nine of the last 11 in the win against NC State including the gamewinning free throws yeah he was fantastic six of 10 from the field he went 0 from California they benched him he came back and he delivered here at home gets NC State spin cycle hildr you got to watch hildr now hes a threepoint shooter knocked in six on the road at Miami on his Ro way to 31 points but I think he likes to be able to mix up that both the inside game in the outside game to get him going this time he went inside lets see if his next three doesnt fall because he got to visualize that ball going through the Applause Basket Hammond turns it over here comes the Speedy Tyler Johnson six assists in backto Back Games hildr open rebound poti well thats something wake did really well against Stanford they forced 13 turnovers theyre second in the ACC with 235 forced turnovers and they forced a turnover on three of Virginia Tech six possessions shoot using the shot fake and the rebound to the sophomore Johnson the Louisville Transfer you know the pros make that side step look so so easy at the next level its not so easy to get back out in balance in stroke one from 20 plus feet Jaden shoot Richard sophomore a Duke transfer battled through some major injuries from a year ago hildr fakes the pass that ball was tipped and the put back is there Hunter Salis with his first two Hunter Salis is just a baller I I love watching this kid play hes constant energy out there on the floor and he saw that his teammate came up a little bit short hes the quickest one out of the corner to go chase down that offensive rebound three ball no good by Tyler Johnson well this 37° outside so right now Virginia Tech having a tough time finding the range from distance just give it to number 23 sales you know what thats like yeah exactly yeah it doesnt have Bulls on the front of his jersey but Ill tell you what this kid flat out put the team on his back when we did that game against Stanford on Wednesday in that second half it was a beautiful thing to watch the way this guy brings his energy hustle and enthusiasm to the arena hes the accs third leading scorer was fourth in the League last year and were going to get a moving screen on poti thats where Pos got to be careful cant pick up those fouls setting offensive screens Applause Music Applause ACC mens basketball is presented by Food Lion official grer of the ACC on Wednesday night here in blackburg Virginia Tech showed a lot of grow down 15 they rallied back to knockoff NC State closing the game on a 19 to4 run and the reality is 6 weeks ago a month ago Virginia Tech is blown out of that game they find a way to win and every night every game it seems theres a different leading man yeah I love that right now right you got a youngish team still trying to figure out all of Coach Youngs Playbook but they in the second half just decided hey lets stop thinking lets just start competing and thats what they did and thats what you got to do when youre down by 15 at home hey put your hard hat in your lunch p on and go to work into the the game for the first time since November 10th for Wake Forest the Iowa State transfer and former McDonalds AllAmerican Omaha beloo zero in Black traffic at The Rim Spillers denied beloo had been out with a broken foot four Subs on the floor for Virginia Tech the three is good Brandon Rex Steiner holla if you hear me hes the son of Scott Steiner WWE Hall of Famer yeah I had a chance to get my picture taken with the young man his uncle was the Bulls trainer when I was there so Ill have to send Wally a message and say hey your son your uh nephew got in the game and he started stroking triples about to step back Ty Lord Johnson thats why I love Tyle Lord John SL remember he took a three late in that game against Stanford yeah he lost his M called a quick timeout settled the young man down same possession with 11 seconds to go he knocked down a midrange jumper thats where hes got to live Rex Steiner another turnover by Virginia Tech thats number five already and a foul on the floor before the shot well wesler did not go and attack that basket when the pass was coming to him he was waiting for the pass to arrive rather than going and snatching it it allowed Wake Forest Defender to catch up to it and slapped it away and then Tyler shy Johnson just so quick at getting the ball to the hands of the guy that can perin Tech the most Hunter Salis and hes always an attack boat and gets that foul thats two team fouls now on Virginia Tech Juke Harris 67 freshman working on the smaller Rex Steiner here is beloo first shot since coming back Strokes of three interesting shot selection I know he can make that shot when hes wide open but L only time when youve been out for a while you want to get something closer to the Music basket Ben Burnham looking for help 13 and orange Charleston transfer tag sloppy with the ball another live ball turnover blue spin cycle itll stay with wake yeah got it poked away but youre right Hokes got to take care of that rock six turnovers for Virginia Tech but wake has yet to capitalize on any the field six turnovers yeah and when you get these live ball turnovers now the dead ball one but you get these live ball turnovers and youre trying to win on the road you have got to convert those to point right now zero fast break points off and zero points off of turnovers for Wake Forest so theyre going to have to pick it up and its early in this basketball game still nearly 12 minutes to go in the first half but they got to do better but they you can see you know wake wake defense versus the Viria Tech offense right now they Viria Techs got to start taking care of that basketball theyre going to find themselves at a deep hole like they were against Inc State on Wednesday night Juke Harris way too much Wake Forest has had its struggles from three All Season 29 on the year theyve been a little better in League Play at 36 and thats another one we talked to Steve Forbes about it this morning and he just said theres good threepoint Shooters on this team Salis Parker Frederick and Devin Cosby even hildr showed he can knock down 3 six against Miami its just not been something that theyve been consistent with all season hrth here for three that time it goes and yeah the end result of that theyre taking the fewest threes in terms of overall percentage of their shots of any ACC team in League games and I love that one by Salas he knows his guys been struggling outside the last couple basketball games just a little penetration and pitch hitting right between the numbers in his shooting pocket and he lets him not you know lets it Fly and he knocks it down see brings the double team over he knows hes got his guy cam over there on that left wing but look at the pass you know not down below the knees not up above the shoulders hits him right in that shooting pocket hell just knocks it down foul was on blue now look at the discrepancy better in conference play really struggled in nonconference play and Steve forb said sometimes thats just a confidence thing just waiting for conference to roll around to start shooting 36 look at wow down there working out and one he ended the Miami game with a game winning and one exactly like that he was phone fed in that one by shoot excuse me by Ben Hammond in Miami and this time l who I think is probably their Energizer Bunny hes the one that gets this team going he sees this big guy over there on the right block just give them the ball 260lb potit would not be denied underneath yeah they need potit to be more consistent earlier this month 25 points gamewinner against Miami and then Wednesday night he was largely invisible for a guy his size 69 260 three points one of four from the field yeah just one rebound and thats the thing if you cant if not if your offensive games not going and youre that big chew glass set screens and uh you know help your team win another ways H with the live ball turnover Rex Steiner pulls and hits ah Rex Steiner wanted that one right away K tongue came out like Michael Jordan he he saw that big tasty threepoint shot and he ate hes another guy better threepoint shooter than hes shown 29 entering play Salis the soft tou boy he can get his it feels almost whenever he wants cant stop that thats indefensible he puts the ball on the right spins back clear space from the defender and has a feathery soft touch its beautiful to watch Rodney Brown for an orange into the game shoot off the shot fake wow over spillers steps yeah I think Ls strength is doing that left hand drive down that left lane line line but his feet got tangled up underneath caused him to to to walk look at this one one more time I love when players are unselfish just kick it ahead throw that 35 foot pass and let me get my feet set square up and knock it downstein off Good Start two triples Salis has six in the early going heres the double on Reed extra pass Juke Harris not there theres that 49 12 in Bur IAL that you saw from Toby L can we call that 50 if youre at 49 half can we just go ahead and give him 50 yeah watch the we get a foul watch the video of his vertical test and the strength and conditioning coach has got to get on a chair with a pole just to hold the the device in place he gets his armpit up over the rim but you can see right here a foul there on Rex Steiner wow thats what they yeah you got their feet yeah but anytime a player goes to the floor with the ball an you know they dont want to whistle him for a turn over so everybodys watching you got to almost call that foul on the defender Salis cork screws inside turns it over here comes Rodney Brown he falls down what with this floor everybodys slipping and falling Salis in the passing Lane Salis pressing downhill poked away out of bounds to wake again Virginia Tech turns it over wake unable to capitalize and thats the reason Tech is hanging around yeah it not like Hunter salz to get that ball on a break and not be able to finish it so thats thats one of those ones where you know they they they got the ball to the player that they wanted but they just couldnt get it to go you know in Virginia Tech 14 turnovers on the season today in the first half in the first 11 minutes they B already got nine Aton Reed to Frederickson great cut by Frederickson and Reed the awareness thats old school basketball right throw it into post cut off the big man let the big man slip into you get an easy bucket you dont see that from Frederickson 91 of his shots for his career are threes and he has not been shooting it well this year Rex Steiner misses you wonder if thats a play where maybe you get Parker Frederickson unlocked well thats exactly right like you got to do sometimes the easy things to get your offensive game going you cant just camp out behind that line think youre going to get hot as Salis comes up front Music rim and we get a foul as Toby lall put it on the floor teach just so quick like that first St just so SL explosive he is gaining an advantage on the defender before the ball even hits the floor coming up next our basketball triple header rolls on Notre Dame I know the record says below 500 but Martin Burtons back remember they almost beat North Carolina it took a fourpoint play by Elliot cadoo almost beat NC State theyre playing better theyve become dangerous out now in the ACC wild shot there by Hammond out of bounds to wake well you know H Hammonds going to have a little rust on his game right first game back I was talking to his dad before the game M Hammond and he was saying that the guys a little bit nervous hes probably going to be a little bit windy hes got to harness that adrenaline and have it work for him against rather than against them yeah two point guards and Tyler Johnson and Ben Hammond extremely quick Salis wide open and hes got nine how about that crosscourt pass finding is down there in that deep corner its just so hard for the defense to rotate all the way out and challenge the shot and this time they got Tyler Johnson poking that ball away but getting too much of the forearm trying to get another turnover here in this first half and Johnson active hands Louisville Transfer took him a while to get acclimated and adjust a Wake Forest but since wake has put him into the starting lineup theyve seen the dividends theyre 40 at as a team theyre shooting it better than 50 in those four games yeah they did a really good job putting the ball in his hand saless hand the second half versus Stanford they shot 65 in the second half W out to Applause Hammond gets iron offensive rebound Tyler Johnson around Salis and over re you know I love when I come to the arena early and I see a guy out working with the coach two and a half hours before the game was Ty Johnson out there working with the coach doing just little moves around the basket and he gets on the glass and it pays off for him in the game Spillers thats not really his shot just five of 18 from three Music now W over Spillers the bound pulled down by Salis match up to watch youre going to see a lot of Tyler Johnson on Salis today Johnson The Freshman tenant orange hes their best on ball Defender and I didnt have Fon Reed with two threes on the bingo card I didnt have him in my Scouting Report even shooting any threes but yet he said the big fella is getting left wide open as the defense is sucking into the paint and hes knocked down two dribbles so coach young made her make some adjustments he get out on Fon Reed he was 1 for 13 from three entering today nice weave Inside by Rodney Brown the Cal transfer yeah thats the easiest probably the easiest bucket the hokeys have had inside and they needed it because that lead had balloon to the largest of the game so big bucket delivered inside Reed almost traveled theres the double team poked away last tou jeon Reed fourth turnover by Wake Forest well they stole a page out of the Hokies the Wake Forest book by double team and the big guy and they forced the turnover but I love that one by Salis give me that quarter pocket triple and let me knock it Music down hey you know what I think plays here lets sell uh you got the lonardi now wake according to Joes projections as of right now theyre nine spots behind SMU whos not in and is one of the next four out so for Wake they have to play themselves on the bubble today theyve got a quad three opponent in Virginia Tech which means a win doesnt do much a loss hurts you but opportunity is coming for Steve Forbes team you look at the next four games UNC could very well be a quad one win by the end of the year yeah they got Stanford today they probably get that win but its its you know its like you said North Carolina Duke Louisville pit you got to play well in those games but then you cant let up because then you got Stanford and K on the west coast did you think okay we just beat Stamford no problem there and then Cs kind of on you know struggle bust a little bit but you cant let up or even if you go three and one or since you go four and0 youve erased everything youve just done and the margin for error in the ACC is not even close to what it normally is a lot of minefields including one in blackburg with an improved Virginia Tech Team theres the pogo stick Toby Lal thats the 50 in as he tried the reverse Jam couldnt get that one to go and said let me just go up here in more traditional fashion how bet I jump higher than everybody else thats what I can do yeah he he he went about 40 in on the reverse Jam decided I better go 42 here conventionally and Virginia Tech really needed those Second Chance points the wall in League Play 69 From the field 17 a game with a shot clock running down Johnson hoist it up and its Virginia Tech basketball yeah I think Johnson had more time than he believed he had because when that thing airball there was still almost three 3 seconds left on the shot clock so curious decision to hoist I I almost think he thought I Ive got some contact here maybe if I if I shoot through the defenders arm I can get a whistle and try to get you know three free throws out of it but the officials werent buying what he was selling we are told they looking at the Flop or the clock excuse me the clock make sure they have the clock right all that to add a second I dont think anybody would miss that you I know the officials thats their job right lets get it right but I think for the pace of play the way college basketball should be played lets just play on nobodys going to miss a second at the end of 35 games pull up by Hammond swirls out how about that job by Spillers you think coach forb didnt say hey put a body on the wall and keep him off the glass Johnson through the contact and gets a blocking foul arm a freshman Hammond to the displeasure of this crowd well thats just a crafty move by Johnson against the young freshman saying I got a speed I me not a speed Advantage but a size Advantage if I can get him on the move and I can get that contact Im going to have a chance to go to the free throw line and you know I I understand theyre showing the replay here here in Arena and the fans dont like it but thats the correct call you you cant draw a charge when youre moving back like that unless youre taking the contact Square between the numbers you get that shouldertoshoulder contact youre going to get the whistle every time uh oh and they turn it over miscommunication um Harris is trying to plead his case but it looks like itll stay with Virginia Tech and and thats what wake will do they will press and shoot around this morning Virginia Tech worked quite a bit against wakes press BN burnam and Hammond got lucky right there because to me it looked like he threw the ball right on of Bounce three no good by shoot Burnham landed over the back of Frederickson yeah good job by Juke Harris boxing out Burnham hildr using the body no and the rebound P down by Johnson and he is fouled they get the Freshman Juke Harris 356 to go opening half wake up by eight on the road Music Applause Music Music Music Music Taylor thank you you talk about dry January how about pit four straight losses after winning on New Years Day against Cal yeah and thats no bueno and no bueno also here tonight or today is Virginia Tech they average nearly 71 points a game yet just 18 points here with just under four minutes to play on three of 20 shooting for 35 so one of the best defensive teams in the ACC Wake Forest is getting it done here through 16 minutes Virginia Tech has to clean it up a little bit more turnovers than field goals in this opening half Burnham the College of Charleston transfer poti great position Inside vetoed by Reed but they get the big guy for a foul just his first oh well I love that one right there because you you come out of that timeout realizing that you need to score and you give a nice entry pass to the big fow who spread out wide right in that painted area and went up strong to the basket and gots the gets the whistle really knock down elel potit at the free throw line as we look at the Sunday womens basketball slate theyre excited here in blackburg for that 4 pm game Louisville and Virginia Tech the great Liz kitley will have her jersey retired three time ACC player of the year what an honor absolutely love that you know people get to see themselves hung up in the in the rafters you never happened for me in North Carolina you got to be like player of the year or a twotime allamerican to get your name in the rafters there some studs come through North Carolina a good stop by the hokes there nothing inside made them play on the outside trying to cut into that deficit gain a little momentum going to the break Young over Reed altered the shot Salis the Applause Ford entry pass Reed fouled on the catch big Fon Reed runs the floor well goes down does his work early establishes good low post position and they have to foul him down otit picks up his second and for Reed really the key is stay out of foul trouble and I dont think Steve Forbes had any problem with the foul Reed picked up on the other end hes going for a block its been the Ticky Tac ones the moving screens the region that Steve Forbes wants to see eliminated from Fon Reed because hes so important to this team and you we saw the two threes even though he hadnt hit a three this season last year I remember Steve Forbes telling me yeah this is a kid who can pass from anywhere he can go outside and knock down a three and a year here we go Aton Reed changed this team for the better challenge for him this year also has been you add in a guy like Trayvon Spillers now you got two big bodies down low and you got a team thats been taking more shots inside the arc than they were a year ago well you knowy thats but thats to me where the game should be played play an inside out I knew you were going to say that the 90s guy right you know that thats in the 80s and the 90s thats where the game was played you play inside out you get the higher percentage Shots by going inside you get more open looks from the perimeter because the defense naturally is going to suck down to the level of the ball and if you got a big that can pass out of the post youre going to get open looks is that style still viable today they dont play it in the NBA anymore first guy down with a clean look from three Jacks it up you got 7 fo4 Wim Yama wimi he averages about eight or nine threes a game tonight at 80 Eastern after our mens basketball triple header the nothing but net crew will break down the day night in the ACC Taylor M long day for them in the brisol studios but you know Scott to your point Steve Forbes has kind of realized hey were not shooting the three ball well its okay to take more twos and you see how to Wake Forest they play inside out some of it by necessity because theyve been erratic from three but Spillers Reed even their guards hild Salis Tyler Johnsons not really a threepoint shooter they want to get inside yeah but but thats okay you dont have to shoot a bunch of Threes I mean the nonconference games they were shooting 28 from behind the arc take a few less threes you play inside you shrink the defense now you come back in the in the six ACC games youre shooting 37 from behind the arc so you tell me whats better a a couple inside at to 258 22 on the uh shot clock they adjust both the shot clock and the game clock Clarence Armstrong Trey styons and Jeff Pon the officials today Reed backing down wesler hrth puts it on the floor draws the defense Salis catch release front rim I think H just would have been better serve to go up with that shot we were just talking about how important it is get shots in the paint he wants to find his shooter 20 ft 20 ft away from the basket when hes right underneath uhoh thats going to be on foul there on Le and thats his second yeah Fon Reed we were just talking about how the Big Fellas reading btit have to avoid the silly fouls and cant afford to get into foul trouble I dont know if this is a silly foul um but coming over to help defensively just runs right into Burnham and knocks him to the floor so that is the s7th foul on Wake so Burnhams going to go to line to shoot a couple free throws and cut into that sixpoint deficit you know I always I always like talking about greet your big guys staying out of foul trouble Anish I I I was the alltime ACC fouls leader for about 20 years there in my time at North Carolina and then if I recall your early Chicago Bulls teams right did Phil Jackson have an army of guys like you Stacy King will produce do hey Patrick Ying listen dont be afraid to use your six fouls right oh thats right we got our mones worth out of fou of those guys Patrick you and ke Elijah and uh ke ONeal always tell Shaq hey say Shaq Im gon foul you buddy I want you to go to line and make those free throws just dont hit me in the mouth I want to have a steak dinner afterwards is that Johnson trying to go in there for a block left Dr now uh for Wake Forest 4 and 12 minutes without a field goal it it its gotten chilling its 37° outside this Phoenician was freezing this morning coming over with my cup of coffee but it it must be chilly for these players they got to have to try to warm up their hands at the in the locker room at halftime see if they can get something going good ball movement here by Virginia Tech shot clock running down shoot wide open and a foul are they waving off that basket they waved off the basket its a foul on Virginia Tech and now theyre going to talk about it and Mike young is upset oh Mike young just get the fatigue they teed him up coach young he wants that 400 career Victory and he got teed up the basket they say is good but an offensive foul on Virginia Tech away from the Applause ball and heres one more look look one more too I love that extra pass by Rex striner shoot he gets the iron so kind it looked like it was Johnson that just used his hands there and yeah he just slung the defender out of the paint Applause Music Applause Solis went to the free throw line and hes going to get two free throws and W Forest going to get the ball Applause back one out of two on the technicals well looks like we got it all straightened out now we can get back to Mike young wanted to make sure the scoreboard said 22 the shot by shoot was a three so theyve got the scoreboard updated the threepoint basket good the foul was an offensive foul on Virginia Tech and now wake after the two shots with possession and a fourpoint lead with 90 seconds to play in the opening half you know sometimes a tech by a coach can wake his team up I wonder if theyll have that effect for the hes hildr the pretty turnaround Vs been struggling to find the range but that was as you said a very nice use they ice with him on that left wing and just let him operate down low the r is doing a little bit of everything here backto back assist want for the Triple time for the 50in vertical man off his mate underneath for the easy Deuce got ourselves a fourpoint game when it look like Virginia Tech was about to get their doors blown off they keep thats because in todays game youre looking to kick it back out to the three you like those threes I know you do no I I I used to enjoy the old school Music postmen if youre awake right here you got a minute to try to reestablish the momentum see where they go if they can get the ball into the hands of Spiller hes posted down that left block the left corner rather hes matched up with Tyler Johnson Virginia Techs best on ball Defender and the rebound snatched out of the air by the human pogo stick Toby leall lewall goes up so high to get those balls its like hes looking at the ball while its on the rim just waiting for it to get outside the cylinder so he can grab it they feel hes just scratching the surface Late Bloomer who didnt come to basketball until he was about 16 as Burnham has the pretty old school finish Burnham hes a guy like Tom Chambers he just likes to drive down the right lane and throw a little left shoulder into the defender and rock down the little hook that technical on Mike young energized this building final 10 seconds opening half and that is a foul on the wall I believe thats the seventh team foul so Wake Forest is going to be going to the line to shoot a couple free throws here or at least a one and one so lall picks up the foul his first and cam hildr who was only one of 12 Wednesday from the field but 10 of 10 from the free throw line and the win against Stanford yeah he did did a real nice job salting that game away down in stretch when Stanford had the foul they put the ball in Hs hand and he kept knocking down those free throws time and time again fouryear guy a unicorn in the Modern Age and that all four years at Wake Forest and hes averaged 12 plus a game three years in a row now and has nine in the opening half Rex Steiner final ticks and hes fouled so a oneonone opportunity coming for Rex Steiner 70 free throw shooter is better than 66 and 23 yeah and you know you had mentioned something uh about hildr when he was at the line being a fouryear starter at or fouryear performer at wake Florest hes one of only five guys in the ACC playing right now that has played all four years with one school so this portal has these guys moving around a lot you two guys over at Clemson and then uh RJ Davis you wouldnt see in Rena the Stanford product yeah meanwhile Virginia Tech lost eight of its top nine scores from last year hard reset a lot of inexperience on the roster even with the transfers a lot of those transfers hadnt played big minutes at their old school Johnson launches from Beyond half court would have been good if it went instead wake will take a twopoint lead into the break at cast Coliseum 63 and 18 when leading at the half with Steve Forbes at the helm time to get you to the accn studios heres Taylor averaging double figures from last years team for somebody else not a single starter on this Virginia Tech Team averaged in double figures a year ago whether it was for Tech or anybody else it took them a while to find their groove and theyre right there in this game yeah they really are and and maybe design technical by Design realized this team was as flat as a pancake after the tech they go three for four and three assists and they come out knocked out a triple here and Jaden shoot the hero Wednesday against NC State gives Virginia Tech the lead and a chance to add one more at the free throw line where was this guy at in California he went over California in the last two games here in the friendly confines of two ss two Ls in Cassel he is just on fire knocking down shots from all over the place and got to love that one right there the concentration after the contact and Applause finish a Duke transfer shoot he added 20 lbs of muscle since transferring to Tech last year was lost due to a torn miniscus and a thumb injury and hes been providing a spark now two games in a row coming off the Ben Spillers looking for his first points forc that one up gets the friendly roll hell go to the free throw line boy we were talking about this pregame he dips that right shoulder loves that little leftand baby hook well you know I I love the fact were watching two coaches that are Masters at their draft they understand spers having a tough time getting off that launch pad in the first half so what do you do you throw the ball to him down there on that right block KN one he wants to go right shoulder turn to his left across the lane even with the contact he finished cuz you put him in a position to succeed thats what Phil Jackson was so good at and how he got so much out of his players at the next level maximize their strength minimize their weaknesses and everybody wins fourpoint play for Virginia Tech a threepoint play for Wake potit out of the double LA and theres Tyler Johnson on the follow Johnsons been a force in there inside and I love that one right there so Virginia Tech I think the is their first lead of the game if Im correct and they took it a moment ago with shoot Salis missed everything Hammonds pass Johnson fouled by Salis hey Virginia Tech has been a harder working team the last three minutes of this basketball game thats why theyve taken this late rebound the basketball get it out to your outlet pass and then Hammond pass Force first point guard always with his eyes up looking down the floor finds running down the floor I mention this guy was out here 2 and a half hours before the game getting ready for this yeah they love his upside hes been a force on the boards today seven rebounds last Saturday against C became the first Virginia Tech true freshman in a decade to record a double double 11 points 12 rebounds he also has the task today of guarding Hunter Salis Tyler Johnson The Freshman already Virginia Techs best on ball Defender and I like The Moxy that hes up for the challenge yeah you know the accs leading score let me go down there and try to get him and look at this one right now pillars back inside to that left hand hook a little too strong the pendulum is swung to Virginia Tech hammonded against Johnson now potit trying to dribble his way through the defense and coughs it up and Virginia Tech the bench wanted a foul they wanted a foul are to say that wake bis deflected that ball out of bounds and it should had remained with the the guys in and the orange 10 turnovers for Virginia Tech remember they had nine in the first 11 minutes of the first half that was their first turnover since Salis from the elbow yes around those little screams here comes up to about that elbow he can get his body on balance so quickly and then the elevation while hes elevating now gives him an opportunity to get a longer look at the front of the rim and he cans the shot its almost not fair for the defense what are they going to do just pray he misses that kids too good and again thats the type of shot that a lot of coaches around college basketball and in the NBA theyve outlawed that we dont want the midrange jumper its either a shot attempt in the paint its a free throw or its a three and and thats sort of the analytics heat map if you will telling me I couldnt have played todays basketball poti draws the foul if thats on Reed its his third it is on Fon Reed so three fouls oh make it four excuse me on Fon Reed well thats bad news for Wake Forest because yes they have Spillers down there as a big body but Fon Reed is the biggest body that they have on their roster and hes going to have to sit for an extended period of time here in this second half theres 1737 to play and he can only get one more foul so coach Forbes had make a tough call how long can you leave Fon Reed on the bench its going to be up to lead to about the 8 Minute Mark yeah and they bring in Omaha beloo whos playing in his first game since November 10th they only have blue penel in for about 10 12 minutes former McDonalds AllAmerican top 11 recruit coming out of high school transferred in from Iowa State they expect him to be a big part of the equation this year but he had been sidelined with that foot injury same foot he injured back in may he cant go over here in the right corner lets see if he can operate out of this corner puts it on the floor outposts up up burnner shot clock at five Belo to strong battle for the rebound one by Tech yeah wow that guy does a little bit of everything to help you get a victory how about that effort by Spiller hustling back in transition knocking that ball out cuz that would have been an easy two Virginia Tech had a player streak into the Applause basket has have been pretty basketball but they are they are playing hard Ill give you credit for that Burnham against Blue and Burnham able to draw the foul 78 free throw shooter yeah are they going to say that thats on the floor in the act of shooting yeah theyre going to give him two shots so nice job Burnham who likes to drive right so the Scouting Report says get up on his right shoulder and blue maybe a little too much gave him a straight line to the basket down the left side now Ben Burnham a year ago averaged a dozen points a game for the College of Charleston started every game for the champions in the colonial a team that lost to Alabama in round one and Burnham in that first round loss had 19 points used to be a skateboarder as well okaying Southern California doing skateboard but not not what those guys do like in the in the pools and stuff like that spinning and everything you werent a Tony Hawk Tony Hawk thats who I was trying to think of how did I forget that Legends te buram from Fort Mills South Carolina just outside of Charlotte driving on blue and blue picks up his third yeah blue Blues out here for the first time in a while and they know that so theyre trying to attack his feet and Blues going to have to do a better job measuring the speed of Burnham and stop getting these fouls on the dve five team fouls already for Wake we have not even reached the First Media timeout and this ones stolen Applause away Salis pull up three good onepoint game well you know Salis is an opportunistic threepoint shooter find me in the corner lose me in transition and Im going to make you pay and you say uh we got ourselves a onepoint game because every time Wake Forest needs something positive happen Salis does it with either the bucket or on the pass Teardrop by Hammond not there HR the other way pushes downhill wake back on top how about that Push by HRI uses the other side of the basket to get himself a cleaner look allows the rim to be kind of a protector so the shot blocker cant get to his shot shot clock inside of 10 Hammond puts it on the floor Lal the three gets the bounce wow Virginia Tech has had some bounces here in the last eight minutes of this game one by shoot that hung on the rim and fell and fell in and this one by loau who had been struggling to get going knocks down a triple from the right side that bounced up high about 3 fet Above the Rim before going down in the basket Salis cant get the answer its tip back by Spillers good feed Johnson Salis three good 18 for the accs third leading scorer thats what makes Johnson so good thats why Wake Forest is a better basketball team with Johnson in that starting lineup because he realizes that hey if I get this ball back over to my Music shoot Toby lewow on the bike so initially it was signal that Mike young had called a timeout it was an officials timeout because of an injury cramping for low and that was the under 16 media time time out but threepoint shooting starting to pick up for both sides yeah he jump 50 in in the air youre going to cramp up I love that one in transition they lost Salis and he knocks it down and then you get L with the friendly iron on the right side hes got 10 points and then I love that one cuz Salis had just missed a triple and then Johnson finds him in that right corner Rex Steiner into the game guarded by Belo Rex Steiner knock down a couple of shots from the outside in the first half potit that didnt look coming out and didnt look good coming out and a way off there by malel poti yeah he saw big Fon re shoot a couple triples he said let me try one from distance confidence spreads wake down by or up by one Salis two points away from his seventh consecutive 20point game a lot of dribbling by Rex Steiner theres burnum coming down the lane his shot blocked back to potit he picked up his dribble now hes in trouble almost turned it Music over five to shoot and were going to get a foul its going to be on Spillers you know I I know coach Forbes loves the effort defensively there they get the double team down on poti that they wanted they want to try to make him throw out of the traps but dont want a foul right there at the end of that with 4 seconds on the shot clock its their sixth team foul Rex diners three a tad short yeah one more Virginia Tech is in the bonus with 13 minutes plus to play in regulation Applause hildr against Jaden young lowered his elbow and then misses the turnaround offensive rebound Spillers hildr again down the lane Tyler Johnson off the shot fake leans in using the window he went right at the big man he went right into his chest like a squirrel up a tree up ptis chest and threw a little right hand Banker off the glass that was pretty thats why I like Johnson to live Spillers went for the field potit gets it back Johnson got his hand in there yeah see they think they can turn potit over theyre going to make him play in a crowd Salis fouled on the drive S just so quick in transition you got to find him early and wall him up and and if hes out at that threepoint line you better run him off that threepoint line as well and look whos coming back in for Virginia Tech ATT number one Toby a little Gatorade in him some electrolytes in them pickle juice maybe supposed to help with cramping no sir Music this Salis bodies inside against Rodney Brown his 25th career 20point game thats seven 20po games in a row what I like about Sal right he knocks down a couple triples coming out of that break and roll of package you think hes going to shoot more triples no hes going to keep putting the pressure on the defense by going inside yeah thats something Wake Forest has they have a goto guy when they need a basket re Steiner no good Mike young admitted to us and shoot around he said listen were a by committee team L is the closest that they have to a goto guy but as weve seen last four games for Virginia Tech four different leading scores they got to find somebody here was rein Off the Bench in that first half but but where do they go now nearly with five where where do they go here where where does the where do the hokes go little pick and roll with low try to get Rex Steiner going now Jaden young goodlooking sophomore he Hammond and Tyler Johnson really a potent young core and that ends a 70 Wake Forest run well a nice play right there a little traffic at the top and young does a nice job he had good ball handling there didnt over penetrate got just close enough to the basket to get a high percentage shot switch by Johnson and then out of control Rex Diner almost traveled young tried to play wingman had a good look well I love that because the ball went way down to the Baseline all the defense one down low and look at cam hildr he just so good at coming back in transition after that Miss basket gets right into the paint gets the contact quad four opponents but a loss to Virginia Tech would be a quad three loss and for a team that right now again is trying to get back into that conversation yeah that kills your resume bacon on the line for this free throw and hildr gets it if a visiting player misses two free throw throws at any point in the second half two consecutive free throws during a trip its bacon for everybody so thats why the fervor started a climax after that first missed free throw well hey I love bacon but Wake Forest you know if if theyre going to start improving on the road they got to start getting better production from the bench and I know bench players generally play better at home than on the road but just two points theyre getting out scored uh 23 to two in bench points so they got to find some players coming here in these next 5 to six minutes and help out those starters so they can be fresh down the stretch who does that guy have to be juk Harris right like I keep I dont want to keep harsh on hes playing good defense right now but hes got to get his o going too side of the backboard for Burnham and there is Juke on on command sometimes good stop on defense allows you to all of a sudden feel good about your game and something positive will happen for you on the offensive end last year both these teams split their two meetings home team won each time in fact Virginia Tech rallied from 15 down to beat wake here in blackburg that was in March and that was a loss that really took some of the wind out of the sails for Wake Forest tournament hopes yeah Frederickson there you know aggressive drive down the middle but just no payoff yam and with the members bounce well here you go again right so just one wake opens up a couple possession lead Here Comes Virginia Tech a team that wont quit down by 12 with 6 minutes to go against NC State on Wednesday and now all a sudden here fighting scatching and scratching and crawling trying to get back into this one here got a sule one possession game with nine to play a team that had a sixgame losing streak at one point Salis boy hes doing it all and he might have to put this team on his back 22 tonight yeah 22 hes probably be on his way to 30 tonight cam hilberth at least is helping him out a little bit hes in double figures but these points now are going to me maybe something that not as IND is fresh down the stretch if we got a couple possession gain hes not going to be fresh Burnham air Ms the three I know Burnham can shoot that triple but Ben Ill tell you right now the way hes attacking the basket youre down by four at home you got to keep continue to put pressure on the defense inside they let him play and Johnson will get two shots well thats what Johnson does though right like I dont think his strength is stroking the outside shot his strength is hes got great handles so he can put the ball on the floor in a crowd and then just utilizes a little bit of a Head and Shoulder P fake hesitation whatever you want to call it to get the defender to try to close the space on him and then he leans right in and gets that that contact third foul on low since Tyler Johnson moved into the starting lineup wake is 40 had a plus 17 plus minus rating in the win against Stanford hes had six assists in backtoback games not really much of an outside shooter but hes quick yeah and hes been able to get them over these last four games into some transition as well with his defense yeah and he gets to he gets to the line hes a 79 Sher from the line as you saw I knocked down those two give the give him wake a little cushion Applause here Hammond off balance and he gets Two Shots yeah its the arm while Hammonds in the air by Frederickson its going to put Hammond on the line so this young man he hadnt been to the line much obviously in the last about week 10 days he going to earn a trip right here as father Mo up in right section going to be watching these intently Tech now 12 of 14 at the strike today Hammond 78 entering Play We remind you Notre Dame Syracuse follows us here on accn Cal and NC State to cap the day and then nothing through well have a recap of all the days action Clemson big win against Pittsburgh earlier both of those teams now looking to move up in jool lardys rankings both of the projected field here wake with a fourpoint Music lead with a huge rejection give her two more and maybe Music another one of the alltime greates and one that they remember fondly even though she was just here yesterday Liz kitley will have her Jersey retired tomorrow for Virginia Tech game against Louisville you can watch at 4 Eastern on accn threetime conference Player of the Year ultimate winner and uh really just one of the great basketball players period to come through blackburg well what an honor for that young lady to see her Jersey hung up for all eternity Salis to Spillers we were just talking about Spillers having to get going and best player on the floor for w Forest Finds him right underneath the basket for an easy bunny spoon fish big man underneath potit excellent position for the Finish Pos having his way inside so when do you come back if your coach Forbes over there when do you come back with Fon Reed right like I think right about now is the time right hes on the bench Reed is with the four fouls hand drives right past frericks in everything but the basket 22 for Music Salis hildr puts it on the floor again shoot and the rebound to Tyler Johnson crowd doesnt like hildr using that body Johnson thought about it potit little get squirt out of his hand a little short is that what I was kind of blocked out by the official but you got to roll right in he wanted it 5T in front of the basket potit got to go with more power and hildr shows potit how its done yeah when youre 64 youre supposed to shoot the flo when youre seven floter you put Power that ball between your your legs and you go up and try to finish overhand I felt the table there Scott well you know I I I want to see these guys push all that weight in the wait room for a reason finish strong around the passet Johnson follows his Miss shoot the three out of bounds to Applause wake mediate timeout Virginia tag has missed its last four wake up by two possessions Music pit Panthers have lost four straight Miami clear clearly brought enough postage SMU had 60 points at halftime and Maxim Reno the Frenchman for Stanford against the UNCC team thats not great on the inside hes been having his way and the Cardinal looking to get their first ACC Road win yeah taking it to my Tar Hill down there in Chapel Hill its going to be a battle to the finish and and thats one Carolina needs to have too right like theyre not only Joe lonardi got him on a ninth seat they cant afford to lose that one yeah youre flirting with the bubble wake looking to extend a sixpoint lead Salis over to hildr swivels inside and wakes Lead is 816 for the senior from England well it has been the Sal Salis and hildr show here theyre 15 of 28 the rest of the team seven for 22 Rex Steiner the rainbow re Steiner has been doing a little bit of everything to try to keep the hokes close and now he got up a two possession game with just under six to play Big stop here pook need one Rex Steiners got 10 Applause Salis Spillers going to that left hand wild shot knocked out of bounds nine to shoot it stays with wake and Fon Reed back into the game for the deakes yeah got a little more presence inside with Fon Reed out there but you were right about spill that was a wild one right like we always said he wants to come out of that right corner to his left hand hook but almost like that was a scud missile the way that thing hit the Music backboard The Freshman Harris lays it in for to you mentioned W needs more bench scoring Ive been waiting on Juke Harris this whole basketball game watch a kid in practice on Monday he was fantastic it hadnt translated to the last two games for him but that was a big time move for a big time basket lead is eight wake is led by as many as 10 Virginia Tech came back from 15 down on Wednesday low over Spillers boy hes got a chance to be special yeah he that hes got more of a wiry body but hes got that old man strength as he just mused himself inside for those two points nine points 11 rebounds for the VCU transfer Salis the drive and kick hildr loves to put it on the floor overshoot yes whats got it going that baskets kitten is large as a hula hoop for him and he is getting himself into that pained area where hes trying to draw contact on the defender create some space and get a clean look at the front of the rim Johnson around Juke Harris and one Johnsons got these 20in python size arms and he just flexed his muscle on the small freshman underneath here Juke Harris did not stand a chance spillers got to do a little bit more than just reaching for some help and try to cut off that drive as Johnson took it from the right side of the floor all the way to the left and used the off hand real nicely off glass completes the threepoint play the oldfashioned way he is one one point away now from a double double had his first career double double exactly one week ago against Cal and that was the first double double by a Virginia Tech freshman since Justin bibs 10 years Applause Music ago well we we wanted a good game on this cold day and were getting it two possession game with just over four minutes to play I Love It 22 points for Hunter Salish to lead all scores and he traveled little too much indecision I think Eon Reed was unsure whether I space or come and try to set a screen and Sal was going to try to combine for 40 they have done most of the work offensively for Wake yeah and they do that on 55 shooting they got 10 boards to go along with that they know where to go to right like if its going to be Spillers traing something for somebody but youre Virginia Tech who do you go to you dont know who youre going to go to in this final four minutes it makes it real difficult to get some points theyve had a different leading score in each of the last four games six different players have led the team in scoring this season and a foul a blocking foul on sales and a one and one for Hammond i c crack be up because Sal is probably the fastest guy in the court P he runs into Hammond and he gets knocked over you knocked him over look at this right here Wednesday it was AOW it was Jaden young last Saturday Burnham against Stanford poti with the big game against Miami and today their leading scorers with 10 points a piece Rex Steiner and shoot yeah you know shoot was good down the stretch against NC State you got Hammond back for the first time threw the ball into Bo on that last pass knowing the double teams come and try to find a shooter on the outside but Hammond 78 shooter its always a little tough when youre more fatigued your first game back the adrenalines pumping big moment couldnt handle the pressure in that first free throw thats a huge Miss on front end number a one and one Spillers hit a ton of big baskets down the stretch on Wednesday against Stanford unforced error as wake turns it over Salis backto back turnovers once with the walk that one just a little careless trying to get it over his Pikman threw it a little too high in the air and off the fingertips and out of bounds so another opportunity for Virginia Tech but they missed the front of in a one and one thats kind of like turnover and then they got a break because wake comes back and they had the traditional turnover so again where does Virginia Tech go will they go to L let him operate or do you attack knowing that youre in the double bonus here on out shoot over to potit low entry pass potit in traffic Hammond thought about the three shot clock down to five Hammond among the trees it is knocked out of bounds Virginia Tech basketball less than three to shoot yeah but you see that right there 27 seconds they didnt know who was going to take that shot they just moved the ball around and and no and tried to throw it in poti but they threw it right into the double team they almost lost that one so coach Youngs got to figure out right now with three seconds their Baseline out of bounds plays K off SC shooter off for a quick try for a midrange jumper Rex Steiner into the game for Hammond the lob to shoot Rex Steiner off the screen designed play there by Mike young but shot clock violation yeah not enough time for Rex Steiner to come off of that after you make one pass inside hes going to try to come off as the inbounder always the most dangerous player in a situation like that but not enough time to try to let him get his feet set he threw up an offbalance shot from from three so backto back empty possessions for Virginia Tech when they needed to get some Music points big size Advantage here for Salis against Hammond Harris backing down Burnham Harris inside offensive rebound he gets his own Miss and he gets the basket and Steve Forbes calls a timeout with 227 to go 224 to go for that mad Juke Harris because hes out there fighting he struggled in the first half he struggled against Stanford and hes delivering what his team needs him you want to come back with that yeah Music Music Wake Forest only has six bench points this afternoon four of them have come from Juke Harris yeah Juke Harris here down the stretch has been Ultra aggressive going inside for buckets once he got a clean one and then this one right here he doesnt get the first one to go but he stays with it on the second attempt he goes up with it and he knocks it down so happy for that young man its hard to keep your mind into a game that you havent been playing real well but he knows that his team needs him here down the stretch and he had two big baskets to put his team up by three possessions potit throws it up toward the rim and Virginia Tech gets bailed out with a foul on Juke Harris holding Toby leow well that was going to be the high handoff and juk Harris knew with that 50in veral he was about to get dunked on so he does the right thing he says no big fella Im not going to let you slam this one down youre going to have to go to the line and er it the hard way double bonus for Virginia Tech and the first free throw no good a wow 75 on the season at the end of the night Taylor and Company from our Bristol Studios will recap the day in the ACC SMU laying it on Miami right now Stanford pushing North Carolina and a much improved Virginia Tech team they have fought all afternoon against wake for as to Demon Deacons team looking to take that next step which is winning on the road thats the one thing thats held this program back the last few years they will get a foul on Hammond and its only the 15 foul so its non shooting yeah and Hammonds got to be careful that reaction after he was whistled for the foul could have been one the officials could have te could have teed him up for H and they used some restraint and did not but clearly clearly Ben Hammond who hadnt been playing a lot of basketball was moving on that uh draw attempt for for a charge into the hands of Salis Applause third leading score in the ACC weaving through now Fon Reed five to shoot Reed Fades away no good Hammond secures the rebound how about that the smallest guy on the floor goes in gets a one of the biggest ports of the game for the Hokies hes got a mismatch now with Reed but he gives it up Burnham inside L theres the double team nearly intercepted Hammond hit the backboard potit on cleanup Duty with the shot clock winding down and Virginia Tech within four with 120 remaining well I love the way Hammond goes inside amongst the trees not able to finish but then nobody can get a body on both teeth and he gets in there and scratches and Claws that ball up uh for an easy basket right around the front of the rim look at this one hamy sit down inside there look at look at po rebounding at a position thats where I want to see that young man eat more often on that offensive glass go in there be aggressive grab that ball then he finishes the play nice timeout by coach young now he can set his trapping defense here with 120 to play and obviously thats not an assist for Ben Hammond but if you go back to the end of the Miami game earlier this month it was Hammond with his penetration that set up poti for the game winning and one youre 100 right almost you know it happened again here what they call that deja vu all over again so so youre learning French now that oh yeah youre rubbing off on that is French isnt it I just always kind of use that in my terminology that deja vu all over again but I love that right now we got a great basketball game here four points Hokes down at home trying to claw back from behind and get another come from behind Victory last March Virginia Tech rallied from 15 down in the building to beat wake hokes rallied from 15 down on Wednesday to stun NC State theyve won three out of four Virginia Tech has after a stretch where they lost eight of 10 going to ISO Salis over here on this left wing and let him operate coming up on a minute to go hriff is fouled and two shots coming for the Englishman youre right I was wondering if they might have got that one on the floor because only the sixth team foul for Virginia Tech so big difference between obviously side out of bounds or hildr at the line we way to again 10 of 10 on Wednesday against Stanford to ice that thing down the stretch Wake Forest an outstanding free throw shooting team 75 Hildreth on the season 84 80 last year gets them both like ice water and his bab c as the other side of the pillow yeah Virginia Tech they got attack a little faster than what theyre doing right here I know theyre trying to set up for a good shot were under a minute to play now they dont need a three but they get a great look shoot missed the wideopen three got the play they wanted there got the shooter that they wanted on the right side on balance just didnt come up with it got a foul here letting too much time come off this game clock youre down by six yeah wheny you foul now you should have fouled 10 seconds ago Salis down the lane for two 24 for Hunter Salis we got a timeout by Steve Forbes its an eightpoint game with 291 seconds to go that was a situation Virginia Tech 16 fouls so a foul creates a one and one for Wake Force theres no double bonus and you brought it up they should have fouled sooner yeah the clock is your enemy and when you let a good 30 seconds come off the clock and with the ball in the hands of Hunter Salah something good is going to happen so got to get the ball out of his hands and fou anybody even if its Salas he might miss the front end of a one and one thats like a turnover in itself but they allow too much time to come off the game clock now theyre down by uh eight points its a tough Hill to climb with only 30 second 291 seconds to play hed be hard pressed right now to find anybody in the country over the last couple of weeks playing as well as Hunter Salis seven straight 20 point games hes got 24 today on 10 of 17 shooting now Steve Forbes has told us that hes one of the most talented guys hes ever coached hes a a coach he practices hard he plays hard hes a leader and hes given Wake Forest a closure yes well you know I I always wonder when coaches say hes the you know the best kid Ive ever had to coach but you know I think you can you can hear it in his voice that he meant that like he he really loves this kid and uh this kid has helped him establish a culture here at Wake Forest that going to serve them in the second half of this ACC action its a threep possession game now Techs got to go quickly Rex Steiner had his pass knocked down Harris had it hits the deck and itll be a one and one for the Freshman well Virginia Tech they fought hard in this basketball game but just had a couple things didnt go their way from the free throw line Wake Forest got aggressive J Carris with a couple big buckets off the off the Ben bench and boy did hbri and Salis put on a show this afternoon 44 points between the two of them and for most of this game Virginia teack was right there they took the lead early in the second half wake responded and now for a Wake Forest team that again is just 13 and 26 on the road since the start of the 202122 season they were expected to win this game but Virginia tank had been playing better and these were types of games that wake has lost over the last few years youre on the verge of a win yeah and now you got Carolina Duke Louisville and Pittsburgh oh yeah you go two and two lets say you go three and one to me youve now played yourself into the conversation yeah Ws playing much better right like this is going to be the the first time in 20 years that theyve won five uh ACC games in a row so you can see its building the players are gaining that confidence the trust in the coaching staff to always make them put their best foot forward clock issue weve had a few of those this afternoon and the deakes on the verge of going to six and one in League Play if if Im correct wasnt that one one loss that they had did did they did they drop one out in California Clemson oh Clemson oh so tough tough game so you they have been handling the business against the teams that theyre supposed to beat now they got to go and step it up a class North Carolina battling with Stanford up by three right now you know got Duke Cooper flag he having a player of the year uh type season as a freshman Duke Louisville and pit are all as of now quad one opportunities North Carolina will be a quad 2 Opportunity and wake only has one win this season against quad one and quad 2 teams thats shoot and the challenge for Wake may end up being on the back end of it as we get a timeout by Mike young so you go through that four game Gauntlet Carolina Duke Louisville pit and Scott human nature maybe kicks in right you want to come up for air lets say you go two and two 3 and one now you got a road trip and its not just a normal ACC road trip because of League expansion youre going to the West Coast so now you get Stanford and c and if youre not careful and you lay an egg in California it can undo any positivity that you might gain from those four games that you see before the Stanford game yeah it it sinks your season it re it really does cuz does it not feel like these next six games are Mak break for Wake if they want to get into the NCAA tournament 100 And and if you kind of look at it you take those four the top four there Carolina Duke Louisville pit you hope for a split right you hope for a split in those two and then you go pound Stanford and Cal problem is your body clock as as a player when you go from the east coast to the West Coast now those games are starting real late right and then youre out of the lab youre not in the friendly confines of your teams practice facility youre not getting up as much as shots youre eating a little bit different everything gets discombobulated when you go on the road so you think hey weve won three three of our last five games were going to cow were going to pound them no you but you let up human Natures the let up and you Dro that one and now you shot yourself in the foot so yeah listen coach for is a better Coach than you know I ever have been hell keep his team motivated out there on the west Applause coast hildr across the timeline and Virginia Tech commits the foul with 15 seconds well listen Virginia Tech didnt get the 400th win for for Coach young this time out um but I like his group you know from where theyve come from November and December to what we saw here now with the effort uh I I think theyre going to be just fine going forward Young play play Young Players having to learn coach Youngs system where hes got a ton of offensive plays that takes a while and takes a while to get his brown to basketball his culture established with these players theyll be fine theyre going to be a tough out for folks especially when teams come to Castle but Steve Forbes and wake find a way to storm the castle this afternoon Hunter Salis magnificent again seven straight 20 point point games wake has won five straight therere six and one in League Play With The Gauntlet
