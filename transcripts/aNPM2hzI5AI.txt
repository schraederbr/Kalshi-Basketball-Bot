guys believe they can get it done the the season starts now were going to see what that did 364 teams all with that belief ready to Make Some Noise come March but it begins tonight in November the

injuries a brand new roster for the hurricanes fdu in their first season under Jack Castleberry looking to get back to the big dance after their historic win over number one Purdue lot of fresh faces on the other side for fdu as well this is Terrence brown one of the few returners he leaves it short and packed the board look for Terence Brown to be very very aggressive early his counterpart Nigel pack with the basketball lays it off to Jaylen Blackman who can fill it up for the Hurricanes Miami in the all wh Blackman triggers leaves it short and its pulled down by Barb Bay I love that shot by Jaylen coming in heat check see if the ball goes in little short on target great look Jones fires it and connects and weve got the first points of the night courtesy of Dylan Jones the Junior from Saratoga Springs Utah fdu is not nervous coming in letting that thing fly can see the hurricane starting five ly kid gets the hurricanes on the board and lets the fans take a seat to enjoy this one you know link kid has the advantage down low you know height Advantage bulk Advantage look to see the Hurricanes go to Lyn very early and very often the same five for the Hurricanes that they had in their exhibition against St Leo last week fdu did not play an exhibition last week so a new look for the Knight timer running down for the knights Jones drives kicks and its swatted by Johnson and fdu cant get it off a shot clock violation you want to see that early you want to see hurricanes popping up on all ball screen switching getting deflections blocks everything you want to see that early especially this first season of the game first game of the season you want to see that Brandon Johnson with the block transfer from East Carolina play a pivotal part for the Hurricanes down low this season Blackman working with Johnson Blackman keeps it himself and a foul called on the floor Blackman is being very very aggressive early being assertive letting his presence be known I think its a transfer coming into a new team you got to show your team that that Im confident yes I came from ston but I can play at any level you mentioned it Jack the transfers for the hurricane six of them on this roster pack the lone returner from that final four team finds a transfer and Linn kid a fight for the loose ball kid comes away with the K spins and lays it in with the left hand thats the immaculate footwork by Big Man reverse pivot finish with the left hand Lyn looks very confident inside you know as a big man when youre that big you come to the game with the height advantage and the bul advantage he already had the confidence going in kid about 2 in taller than his counterpart nesiah down low its nasiah whos got it and its poked away and here come the Hurricanes Johnson out and running contact and a block count the bucket and one you know one thing about Brandon Johnson hes a transfer from East Carolina but one thing hes great about he can get the ball and he can push it in transition hes not a big that has to find a point guard he can get it get in the open floor and finish and look at those kicks that he has on you guys can zoom in on those kicks soon we got to show that all pink with the palm trees CTO PP if theres a man of style its its Jack mclinton I see it I see it thats the first thing I saw I see pink shoes and palm trees with a BJ on the side PP being and J you get a glimpse of them right there ah you got to you got to make the free throw on the am one you just dont feel the same you miss too strong on the first freebie of the year for the Hurricanes Miami an early 63 lead over fdu Jones with the three for fdu kicks it out as the knights work it around the perimeter Brown drives cant get it to go Johnson clears pushes it ahead to kid kid down low cant roll it in but hes fouled on the way up I like the fact that he got foul but I would also like to see him make that extra pass to the corner for Blackman for three you want to get your shooting guard going early CU soon as the shooting guard sees the ball going in hes going to make the second the third the fourth and the fifth at least hes at the foul line but as a big you got to make these fre throws at 6 10 241 lb Lin kid 84 at the line last year cash money first one perfect you know I talked last game last exhibition game about seeing the Dynamics of a great shooter its the way the ball spins ly kid has great great spin on the basketball when he shoots the basketball knocks down both the transfer from Virginia Tech in his first official game as a hurricane someone whos Jim Lena maybe even wanted out of high school went to Clemson goes to VT now finds himself in Miami a drive from Brown cant get it to go Johnson again great pass ahead to kid who throws it down lint kid with authority lint kid with Authority Brandon Johnson getting the ball off the rim couple dribbles lead pass to your big thats what you want to see you dont want to have to depend on your guard to get the ball up Court when you can have a big that can get the ball up Court thats a special sight to see a 100 Run for the hurricane sparked by by Johnson and kid the two post players for Miami thats an underrated pass that pass is on the money three dribbles in the air LED Lin kid all he had to do was go up and dunk it he have to put the ball on the ground or Music anything you looking for an answer Jones down low its tweety tweety turnaround cant get the members roll Johnson clears fdu has scored a near near 3 Applause minutes Blackman the transfer from stepson into the lane floats it to kid who kisses it off the window thats great Pace you see jayen black was able to come up that screen keep the defender behind him and had great Pace he could have shot that basketball kept the defender

to give you a prop one this kid that was good that was good I give you that but you know I was just thinking about that you know when I back to my playing days when you get so many points early you sometimes you know take your foot off the gas you know hes got 10 right now in about 6 minutes 5 minutes you want him to keep his you know his foot on the pedal you know sometimes you keep your foot off the gas you end up with 13 well 13 He averaged 13 last year oh no I dont say that however however well pump the brakes for a second all right no player in the ACC last year had a bigger Improvement score in the basketball than ly kid increased his scoring output by eight plus points maybe well see that again this year all right lets see maybe he has 21 tonight there you go well Lin kid in the Hurricanes theyve scored 12 straight Miamis made five baskets in a row after that early three from fdu courtesy of Dylan Jones looks like theyre trying to get something fixed with maybe the timer yeah we got some subs in early were going to see Matthew Cleveland who was a starter last year whos coming in early you know 5 minutes into the game you got Paul Jo Bay one of my favorite players on the University of Miami a guy that comes in the game knows his role gets it done well you get a glimpse at Matthew Cleveland 1544 as it stopped for two seconds during a live ball Play There

night as they work it down low a tough match up for Tweety against kid theyll go to the perimeter Barb Bay cant connect and its ston McCrae but hes on the end line F you retain possession you want to

feeds it to Barb Bay the knights work it around the perimeter nasiah all over is Joe Bay a beautiful back door pass and a finish from Brown to all the kids out there if youre overplayed on the on the Baseline on the sideline cut back door great play by Fu here is Matthew Cleveland in his second year with Music Miami now to joob Bay Paul zob Bay kicks to the corner Stanton McCrae C thats a great

the transfer from Samford kid cant SWAT it away and Tweety off the window young Tweety with a good lay Cameron tweeny part of that fdu Squad a couple years ago that knocked off number one Purdue in the NCAA tournament as the knights pull back within eight Pat steps back three yes that was tough hard drive right pull back between the legs cash me out please that is seven in a row for this hurricane Squad Brown Its poked away its out to pack numbers for Miami pack up top Cleveland throws it down great transition basketball by the Hurricanes if you pay close attention to Nigels face he told Matt Im throwing it up to you but he looked the way didnt threw it up slam jam transition basketball for Miami pack with the alley Cleveland with the oop the Hurricanes up 197 here in the first half hey you got good work PL bro a 12point cushion for the Hurricanes a tough act for Jack Castleberry to figure out during the timeout Miami just seems like they cant miss right now Jack theyve made their last eight shots if you look at those last eight shots its all off an extra pass and playing unselfish basketball always say when the ball moves unselfishly the basketball Gods give you benefit of Doubt and give you a bucket it was fdu that got off to the hot start Miami answered right back lets see what the knights have in store Reynolds down the lane kicks it out its poked away heres Cleveland plenty of room Cleveland throws it down thats tough off the left leg he got the sleeve on the left leg too giv him a little extra boost shout out Anthony ever with those cool shoes that he has on Matt Cleveland with the AE Adidas on another steel active hands from Johnson finds Bea too strong missed everything and here comes fdu right back the pace picking up its Morris down the lane and hes fou one more look when Matthew Cleveland gets out in space he flies Jack come fly with me thats what he said in his head when hes jumping Come Fly with Me Jack you hit you know fair share of Threes in your day in the just just a fair share you you ever dunk like that I didnt D this is my first year at Sienna College had to save my legs running off all those screens and stepping back had to keep my calves right you know stepping B hits a lot on your Cals man your thighs groins you you you didnt Rock the the left uh leg sleeve that that gave you the extra boost I didnt have the extra leg sleeve with the extra boost I had the I had the arm sleeve though to give you the extra extra accuracy on the jump shot Jam Morris at the line the sophomore gets the second to go just went to the line seven times last year was five for seven look at a first look at Divine Ugo freshman from Texas I really like his game I really like his game Jim Lena revealed last week the plan was to red shirt dine originally Miami liked him so much in the summer theyre letting him run not just run but in the first game thats what you have to do that builds huge confidence for a freshman coming in you know one thing about Devon hes always in the gym I went in the gym yesterday I always like to get shots up before a game like I played but I dont play anymore I go in and get shots up and I saw Divine in there working on his game and I said Divine you got a game tomorrow its 830 he said Jack I got to be ready I said thats a sign of a superstar now the Freshman is ready for his moment a very talented freshman class for this Miami team seventh in the country the highest ranking Miami has had in the modern era big time Big Time fdu doesnt care about the rankings theyre here to play spoiler on opening night Reynolds finds the open man Morris left it short Reynolds the rebound no luck to Morris kick to the corner and theyre going to say a traveling violation that was tough little jump stop probably should have shot the first one it happens weve seen a lot of unselfish basketball in the early going Jack maybe that was a little too unselfish I would agree with Music that eight minutes gone in Coral game AES the Hurricanes up by 13 its a 21 to8 margin as ukuu his bull rush finds Cleveland the twohanded slam I love the way Divine almost lost the ball kept his composure found the open man didnt get rattled thats what you want to see in a young point guard make it 10 of their last 11 for the Hurricanes but a foul called on beia it is hot in Miami and the shooting is rolling for the hurricane getting hot in here theyre doing a little bit of everything theyre showing off the flashh the latest Matthew Cleveland as Miamis up by 15 e e e e e Matthew Cleveland the accs Sixth Man of the Year a couple seasons ago providing a spark for Miami Jack and its been a lot of transition play for the Hurricanes off of turnovers now you look at a guy like Matthew Cleveland Dynamic scorer Dynamic player you dont want to see a guy like that if youre the opposing team getting off his points off turnovers now you know you get you got four or six points now hes in his confidence he make it 8 10 12 14 easily you dont want to boost the confidence up off a guy that gets going off the ball going through the basket has six points in a little more than four minutes off the bench Miami as a team 10 points off of turnovers fdu looking to take better care of the basketball its brown with the timer running down kicks it right heres barbar Bay he loses it another turnover ukuku ahead through contact in in its a small thing that people dont see you know dine gets his hand on the ball gets it in transition puts his body on the man that wasnt easy layup body up layup fdu looks to answer its Jacob Warren the 61 Center showing the range theres stretch fours and then theres stretch fives and Warren showed his touch from Deep UK could chuk wo cant get it to go great move about Divine but you see he kind of short armed that basketball I saw him working on his floor in the gym the other day and I could see he was short arming a little bit if he lets that go a little bit higher that goes in but great move great aggression to BU a freshman this guy is not nervous hes ready to play look see I make the next one for sure the plan for Jim Lena originally was to red shirt him until about a month or so ago he proved himself and here he is in night one you cant reg a talent like that you cannot one thing I know about Divine he believes hes great and you could tell by the way hes playing Super composed getting in the paint making the right play getting it done he coming out he gets a bit of a breather the Hurricanes going with a little more experience on the floor couple of those freshmen coming out couple of those vents coming in for the Hurricanes again a brand new roster 11 newcomers its led to eight of their 14 players being upper classman you know looking at this team theyre very very deep at every position an offensive board for Warren but he cant hold on another turnover for fdu their Music eighth and a foul called on Brown you cannot give Nigel pack any space any space is going up in your face and hes probably going to spread and they call that mace he going to knock it down youre a poet and you didnt even know Laughter it pack crosscourt Blackman up and down great skip up down from downtown all the way in The Gables thats a downtown shot after you looking for the quick answer the trigger from Jones left it short and a board for Jo Bay Joe Bay down the lane cant get it to go its tipped back to him hes got it and theyll say he was out of bounds love the aggressiveness I think he didnt believe he was going to be that open for that layup great touch great aggressiveness great lookoff just didnt finish his breakfast joob Bay maybe the biggest Improvement of the returners for the hurricanes I would say that average two and a half points as a true freshman had a big time showing in that exhibition last week with 16 he comes out the experience of Matthew Cleveland back in you know somebody like Joe B I call him a Swiss army knife he can do everything and he doesnt need the ball to be effective can we call him a French army knife considering hes from France youre right French army knife bonjour K Blackman step back nothing but that Blackman starting to heat up guys like Blackman do not get him going he get started hes like a microwave you know what they say heat me up plenty of lethal scores on the Miami side and theyre going to call one of them for a foul looks like Lyn kid whistled for his first lethal scorers but you call jayen Blackman a lethal shooter shout out to Chris Matthews what are your thoughts on that guy ah not too too bad I just saw this guy lethal shooter Chris Matthews shoot a gummy bear in a water bottle if you havent seen it check out his Instagram page Ive never seen a guy shoot a gummy bear in a water bottle a gummy bear in a water bottle his names lethal shooter okay Joel Emanuel looking to show off his lethal shooting the Junior from New York too strong thats not lethal certainly not you might have to go to lethal shooter shooting school you can always come to Jack mclinton shooting me too poison great pace and a foul call the the Jack mclinton shooting score for sure you know were were always open ju just a few threes in this B just a few threes at the Jack mclinton shooting School were always open no pun intended I can step across half court Im open you want to get in the gym its open p for Miami running the offense up by 19 the floater flation divide is nice everything rolling for Miami 14 of its first 18 shooting just under 78 Jones the extra pass its now back to Emanuel hands off to Brown spins and wins browns with the left hand its a great move hard drive right change the Direction with the spin finish with the left hes a very Dynamic and confident scorer look to see him be more aggressive trying to get to the B and trying to get his team some buckets an NEC all rookie team selection Terence Brown ready for a big sophomore season with the kns thats going up pack tries it for three its short ground with the board heading the other way ground with a head of steam and lost the handle another turnover being aggressive maybe a little bit too aggressive but you want to see that from one of your best players transfers these are older veteran guys they come in with a you know a lot of talent a lot of confidence cuz theyve done it for a couple years so look at them to feed that on to the younger guys oh my God put that on a Applause poster and the Music Applause Heart leg sleeve gives me powers I think youll see that one on Sports Center tomorrow might be that might be top seven you might see that on someones bedroom wall as well a poster from Matthew Cleveland for sure Cleveland and he hit the bucket at the end andway make it nine points off the bench for Matthew Cleveland as the Hurricanes up by 22 thats a highlight reel dunk going right at the front of his tape Jones with the mismatch on pack fdu kicks it out heres wadu and a foul called on the loose ball they going to call it on ston McCrae actually check that theyre going to call it on fdu on Cameron Tweety Cameron Tweety Music and itll send Miami to the line Lyn kid one of the best free throw shooters in the AC a year ago seventh in the conference in free throw percentage at 842 his first is cat thats strong if your big man being a lethal shooter at the free throw line thats something you want to see cuz you know bigs tend to get fouled a lot more theyre always around the basket and hes proven why he shoots a high percentage hes now four for four at the line tonight call Wendys four for four hes four for four from the field hes got 12 points and Miami is on a 122 run hey whats your four whats your goto four for four at Wendys whats your goto jack Im going to let you down I cant tell you the last time I went to Wendy its all good me I couldnt tell you but I used like the junior bacon junior bacon get a frosty small fry maybe the Nuggets yeah barbecue sauce nuggets is the key with a frosting Im yeah for sure nuggets and a frosting is it a hot take to say Burger King better than Wendy no chance McDonald Im not trying to eat the trbo burger McDonalds ah yes got so many options just like this play right here just like the kanes too many options its pack too many options kid an open option for Nigel a slam dunk on the oop from kid hes got 14 got 14 he got to get 21 what you got whats the over under you think hes going to get 21 over under depends on how long hes in the game very true its Emmanuel with the step back it falls to kidss lap Im heing are you rhyming on purpose right now at some point Im like are you ring up just coming out like that its just coming out I feel you heres kid with the spin the other way the left hand is spin for the win that was on purpose my bad I tried great great footwork great by link kid with the left hand he seems like to go left a lot more than he likes to go right Jones dials it from deep and fdu ends the drought trying to force some turnovers with this full court pressure fdu has turned it over 10 times Miami just twice thats been a big difference in this game the hurricanes have capitalized of a lot of those fdu turnovers Blackman Flo and gets it to go I love the way Blackman gets in the paint and slows the game down sees everything in front of him saw the defender behind him maybe didnt see him felt the defender behind him pulled up for a easy twopoint basket and Dylan Jones a heat check and thats good they might want to step up on Dylan Jones he made his last what two threes that is now three triples for Dylan Jones hes got nine of the 22 for fdu he pulled that one from Deep too back body body Blackman steps away from Jones too strong State McCrae the board and flips it in you know State McCrae reminds me of Drew holiday hes able to get to the basket very strong guard finish with the left hand thats what you want to see you want to see your guards being able to rebound like that especially offensive rebounds keeps the ball alive at all times the same number 11 as Drew holiday as well oh he might have did that on purpose actually Im going to ask we got to ask after the game Terence Brown on McCrae and kisses it off the window had to get his get back on that one you know you get a somebody gets the offensive rebound on you and scores its time to get your get back he did that both offenses clicking right now the hurricanes have made five of their last six the knights three straight buckets pack to Cleveland hand off to Blackman Miami sets things up in the half court its kid down low and it knocked off his knee and out of Applause bound Joe Bay back in for Miami Schwartz making his Collegiate debut for the hurricanes and almost a wholesale change for fdu on the other Music side its a 21p point Advantage for the homestanding Miami Hurricanes here in the opening day of college basketball 364 teams all with that belief Jack that we talked about at the open Emmanuel rises in hits that belief that belief is a real thing let me remind the fans listen to this a belief is nothing but a thought youve been thinking for a long period of time so you better think positive so your beliefs can be positive pack down the lane through contact an offensive board for jobet puts it down puts it up and gets the members bounced great Joe B always has his hands on the basketball hes always around the basket heres Emanuel contested by Cleveland and theyre going to say he got Applause hit two freshman coming in the game deine and Jal beta theyll Che bring it theyll check in on the other side of this mediate timeout with Miami up by 21 here in the first half Music e e e filling it up in his Miami debut Jack this kid can play no pun intended but hes got it game 16 points for ly kid all around the bucket six for six the slam dunk the work at the line and here may be the highlight of the night for Lynn that alley 6 for six four for four you think he stays perfect rest of the game I mean his BS are coming pretty simple great footwork in the paint left hand finishes Ali oops I I see him coming with a perfect game he was third in the NCAA last year in field goal percentage that led the ACC so hes an efficient shooter to say the least I think we see why the one thing about ly kid he gets great position before he catches the ball he does his work early all the young big men out there watch how ly kid does his work early he doesnt have to get the ball pound pound Pound Drop step hes getting the ball in the paint underneath the circle and hes just going right up do your work early kid at 6 10 has dominated down low the Hurricanes changing things up going with a smaller lineup here in the closing minutes of this first half its ukuku the Freshman running the point for the hurricanes and a hand check called on the floor and UGA chuku will head to the line great composure he doesnt get sped up thats what you want to see you dont want to see your point guard get sped up great composure they know theyre in the bonus two free throws lets see if he can knock him Music down Barb Bay back in for fdu the kid we were talking about Lind kid is back in the game for the Hurricanes potential mismatch for Miami down low with fdu having Jacob Warren go to the bench hukuku cant get the freebie to go hurricanes up by 19 with three minutes left in this first half Miami has made six of its last eight Fu for strength Jones Rises Jones hits hes got another triple make it four tonight Jones has a very very quick release fdu is running a lot of dhos a lot of handoffs great speed by Divine Divine does it itself doesnt need the handoff as these teams go back and fourth up and down the floor and the pace picking up and for the people out there dho stands for dribble handoff theyre running a lot of dribble handoffs and handoffs they learned that at the Jack mclinton Shooting Academy aint that right yeah thats one of the terms you learned there thats one of them pull up and well share more information for you either that or a chalk talk with Coach Al one of the two Joe well Emmanuel at the line for fdu hes got four points in this first half two of three at the line the Junior from New York a preseason all NEC selection cant get the first one to go and kids got it its Austin Schwarz The Freshman for the first time tonight feeds it to another rookie The heralded Freshman Bea he pulls it up from the free throw line Joe B the offensive board cant get the stick back to go and fdu Applause recovers ground down the lane through contact and got it to go no call an impressive finish from Terren Applause Brown and dont say good night to fdu just yet theyve made six in a row and they swap one away but a foul is call Great attack by dine Ugo hes always on go maybe his name is Ugo you go hes always on goal get to the basket get to the line we got to see him knock down these free throws you would score a lot of points in Scrabble words with friends with ugu chuku for sure I forget how to spell it every time wheres uh the number 99 if it wasnt unique enough 99 putting a Target on his back letting you know Im one from 100 and Im him Dylan Jones back in for fdu the Sharpshooter thus far for the nights knocked down four different triples already I want to see Austin Schwarz get going you know you we 23 you got to get going great freshman out of North Carolina Dynamic shooter Dynamic scorer let to see him get going chuku cant get the second to go as the hurricanes have reached the 50 Mark 50 to 33 under two to go in this first half Brown finds nesiah whos been quiet tonight the transfer from Jefferson bounced it to Brown its taken away by Schwarz numbers for Miami Schwartz lays it to Joe Bay Jo Bay pumps and knocks it home just talked about as Schwarz getting it on hes a dynamic score but he gets in the paint finds his teammates for easy Ducket Ducket bucket I was going to say Deuce thats throws it home no longer quiet is bismar nah bismar rip the bismar H hack step back jumper yes to the hes been to the Jack mclinton skills academy once or twice but hes had that in this game great sh by now jaet Messiah fakes the three back to Brown slings it Jones triple left it short cant leave Jones open Miami Got Away With It Jones misses for only the second time tonight from Deep hurricane spreading things out with about a 13second difference between shot clock and game clock kid spins the other way left hand off the window his footwork is immaculate Immaculate loves to finish with his left hand already up to 18 nah missed the triple and the timer turned up I was looking for a high pick and roll with Divine getting downhill 5 seconds left dine off the pick and roll down the lane and its taken away by brown brown heaves it and missed it wide right I love the split but you cant double pump on that and were ready to go here in half number two Barbara Bay quiet first half finds the hot hand Jones cant get it to go and a board for Johnson Brandon Johnson had to sit much of the second half of that first portion ran into some foul trouble with two personals pack extends and gets it to go you cant give pack any room up a ball scream or hand off its going up if he sees that basket that Balls going up its most likely going to go inside the basket great release by Nigel P one of my favorite point guards in the country both sides with their starting fives on the floor Emanuel creates some space Johnson recovers Emanuel with the left no if you got if you look at that move two foot stop so now he can pivot off either foot jump stop off two step through with the left hand fundamentally sound play ston McCrae uses the screen from Johnson isolates Emanuel and hes fouled looked like brown reached in and picked up his second foul miss see State McCrae be a little bit more aggressive on offensive end hes got a huge offensive package you can tell hes still trying to get his his Vibe going within a new team and new system Id like to see him be a little bit more aggressive offensively averaged 11 and a half at Sam for a year ago hes gotten five tonight ston McCrae too strong its tipped out of bounds from kid FCU basketball great aggressiveness got to finish those around the basket but I love the effort hell get it back on defense hell get another opportunity and well see a different out hurricanes did a pretty sound defensive job in the first half eliminating some of the goto scores for fdu it was Dylan Jones that made him pay nah cant get this one to go two on one for Miami up top to kid and its over his head from Johnson great play you know you want to see your two big men get down and transition not to many time you see the fourman throwing the alley to the five man but were going to see a lot of that this year little less than two minutes into this second half a triple try from barbar Bay and short pack at 6 foot with the board here he comes the other way slicing and dcing pack the screen from kid too much space pack cant give him that window and he makes fdu if you look at fds defense what theyre playing is a drop which basically means when the guard comes off the screen the big man drops with the score like Nigel pack you cant play a drop defense because hes too good of a shooter you got to hard hedge or come up watch the big man Drop see the big man is dropping you cant drop on a shooter like Nigel pack is going to go in they might need to switch their defense preseason all ACC first team selection average 13 points a year ago for Miami bismar nesiah at the line a transfer from Jefferson you know going back to that drop defense you know you kind of want to drop because you dont want to get the big man going for an alra getting the big man for an open layup but at the same time you have a dynamic here like Nigel you have to hard head you have to come up and you know get a hand in his face Messiah makes up for it with two at the line as fdu slowly working their way back seems like Miami hasnt missed a shot all night shooting at 70 pack lays it up kid throws it down great play you know when you got a shooter like Nigel K off that screen off the hand off you have to be up if you come up too far and the big helps drop off ALU for the big and Lin Ki can finish that you see the drop again but he droing didnt identify the big man if you drop you got to see the ball and man he lost his man link K with the easy dunk make it 20 points for lin kid eight of eight from the floor four of four from the line hes been the star of night for the Hurricanes Emanuel lays it off they find it in the corner its Reynolds down the Baseline through some traffic and fdu answers very confident finish on the base line little Hang Time finish with the right little little Old English action Blackman looking to get going in the second half Blackman from the elbow and connects great pullup didnt waste any time getting to a shot coming off strong right left right finish a transfer from ston with nine points in 15 minutes Emanuel skips it to Tweety lefthanded pass heres Reynolds Emanuel tries his luck left it short gets his own board back up and the laying is good you know what we call that fet shut up my guy filet big extension on that lay up too big extension Miamis made three consecutive shots Pat going to work finds Blackman hoists up the three left it short kid the offensive board one dribble down turnaround misses his first shot of the night he is human Jack hes human I thought we was going to see a perfect game by him its all good one kid eight of nine from the floor Reynolds answers and here come the knights the knights theyre not stopping the fight theyre not caught the knights for no reason they are going to fight theyre not saying good night they are not its not night night time yet pack skips to ston mccre theres some contact and kid finishes it off see thats what happens when youre aggressive on offense as a guard you get to the basket you make the big man kind of help make the big man try to get the rebound he loses track of his man and the offensive big man comes for a big dunk Brown and Stan McCrae got tangled up and here it is its been the Lyn kid show all night hes kind of worked the game this time cleans up a mess puts Miami back up by 21 here in the second half Music e e e e Jim Lena Squad active hands tonight they have forced 12 fdu turnovers its led to a big discrepancy in points off those turnovers active hands leads to big plans leads to Big baskets Im sure after this basketball game fdu coach is going to go back to the drawing board and say guys we got to take care of the basketball theyve cleaned things up a little bit in this second half as these two sides 1010 after the intermission pack with the mismatch kicks it right ston McCrae left it short grabs his own board cant hold on and theyll say Miami basketball you know St McCrae is one of those guys that he just always around the basketball a knack for finding the ball missed the shot short defense forgot the box out got his own rebound gave his team another possession finds pack in the short Corner Miami with 15 to work with pack in the mismatch hands off Johnson under and hes fouled great step through got to be aggressive get feet in the paint make a play at the basket you would think Jack with the shoes you pointed out a man of

attainable right records that could be Rewritten in night number one for sure 111 would be the most since 1989 oh well get that for sure and 115 would be the most since the Hurricanes refound the program and what year was that this is the program was reborn in 1985 85 when I was born this is from 8 seven against C state copen state shout out to copen State Baltimore Maryland my hometown copen State we played cman State this year as well there you go in 1987 Jim Leno was in his second year as the head coach of Bowling Green now hes in his 41st season definitely done his time one of the

the arkc Four Freshman and a grad transfer in for Miami heres UGA chuku to Schwartz triggers too strong and Basha amama called for the foul Jim Lena cant believe it I love how coach ell is still engaged in this basketball game as a player as fans you want to see your coach be engaged the entire basketball game thats one thing coach El is doing he is gazed jamadu heads to the line for the first time tonight a freshman in his debut one of two Canadians on the roster for fdu and he has no luck at the line got to hold that form young fellow you got to hold that Applause form if youre fdu you obviously want to win every game go go empty at the line youre trying to win every game of course 100 when youre going up against a power four team like Miami you want to show your best 100 and both sides have plenty of things to clean up but 70 points against the Miami Squad is is nothing to you know hang your head on no for sure it is not Im sure this will be a huge confidence builder for fdu ukuku Up and Under flip at home a freshman is showing off tonight showing off and showing out great spin on that reverse Music layup now matches the most points since 1989 in the game for Music Miami what else does Miami have 60 seconds to go in Coral Gables Bea long range shot bosha AMA cant Corral it its great look balil you know I love how Jalil uses his you know his hang dribble his heesy PO to get into a shot he has so many options off of that and a foul called on Bea aatu will head to the line all right so if youre Jack Castleberry youre pleased with the 70 points of course but maybe whats one or two things that you think theyre going to try and clean up before their next game the turnovers and the free throw shooting those are things that you can control you can control your free throws you become a great free throw shooter by putting in an extra work you control the turnovers by confidence and believing in yourself and treating that basketball like its your wife you
