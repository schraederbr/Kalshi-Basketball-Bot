pair of 2 and 0 teams Its been 25 years since the Hawks and the Hokes have played in Southwest Virginia Here we go The second week of the college basketball season Virginia Tech and St Joes underway Both teams play manto man They dont really pressure except pressure in the basketball Theyre in the gaps Both teams will play a little conservative on the defensive end not so much on the offensive end Tough basket No problem Neo of Dallas Right where he left off on the way to 107 point effort for Mike Youngs team on Saturday against Providence What a game that was Meanwhile St Joes coming in off a win against Drexel St Joes will do a lot of Princeton type stuff on the offense And the guy we talked about takes the first shot Abdollis the Hanssberry had the huge three in overtime cheering Lwal unable to get that threepoint shot to go Kobe Lals really worked on the shooting since hes been here 37 a year ago He thinks hes even better than that this time Of course thats not his specialty Well see that later on on the highlight reel Johnson rejected at the rim Head coach of the Hokes Mike Young in his seventh year at Virginia Tech A lot of excitement around this squad coming into the year Hes got to be pleased two games in Yeah both these coaches a lot of similarities Well talk about that as the game goes on But Mike Young has assembled a really good crew after a disappointing year last year Hes very excited about this group Bedford patient Hanssberry cant finish with the left hand Hanssberrys gotten off to a really good start Hes hes missed some perimeter shot but hes been a beast on the backboard cheering Bedford the head fake NO LOOK TO HANSSBERRY for the twohand flush Yeah you got to close out on Bedford Shot fake Drive it to the hole and dish to the big guy for the finish Number zero Bedford Last year St Joes with a doubledigit win Backto back years the Hawks and the Hokes have met in the nonconference Opening points Deir Haskins Yeah thats why we thats why we featured him Hes been very very good and really had a good year last year but theyre expecting even bigger things out of him for his sophomore season Lal of Dallas with eight to shoot contested and miss fires Aabal the rebound Derek Simpson played a careerhigh 38 minutes last year against Virginia Tech The senior runs the show for the Hawks See Big Aball entering the offense through him Hes really good down low But and theres the twohand flush from Simpson point guard Hes the real leader on this team The transfer from Ruters Quick five points for St Joes First lead opening minutes Hanssberry creates positioning and well head to the line Really nice job A little cross screen right there St Joseph 22 Theres the head coach of the Hawks Steve Donahghue who was hired in May to be the associate head coach of this program Billy Lang left in September and he was elevated to the head coach position Yeah I got to do a few of his games when he was at Penn Of course he was successful at Cornell went to BC in the ACC and then on to Penn and now at another big five school Hes a Philly guy and one of the nicest people in the business You know both coaching staffs both head coaches Coach Donghue Coach Young ausive in their praise for one another Yeah theyve become good friends through the years Both of them have similar philosophies about how to do things offensively defensively and how they run their program Johnson with the takeaway THE SOPHOMORE IN TRANSITION Thats a scouting steal right there He knew the play that was coming Tech forces a turnover Abdales so good in transition Has great vision Good job of getting back that time by St Joes though Abdales too strong Anthony Fininkley out of Philadelphia Justice Aza ball cheering finley left baseline Glover Tusano St Johns transfer with three turnaround shots Well get the friendly bounce and itll stay with St Joes when we come back Couple early dunks here Mccarthy Yes Tyler Johnson switches right here Hand in the passing lane and the sophomore says I got this for a while Evan music both teams played really physical games on Saturday I think thats going to continue here this afternoon First few minutes early indication says yes Heres Deuce Jones the second one of the top scorers not just on St Joes but in the A10 Hes on the floor THERE HE IS ON THE BACK DOOR AND THE WALL SAYS GET THAT OUT OF HERE WITH THE REJECTION YEAH Jones Jr Jones I had the back door cut but rejection of Dallas at the opening baskets Hammond off a screen from Dorne and a whistle from Lee Cassell Weve got an allstar crew tonight Phil Coington Lee Cassell Roger Ays Dorne you mentioned in the game and also a new center Jaden Smith for the Hawks OF DALLAS DOWNHILL THROUGH CONTACT applause Hes so good He just probes He doesnt have to explode by you He kind of probes the defense Waits for an opening See the hesitation Gets a little bit of advantage Defense is in a in a bad place and he jumps in creates that contact finishes and goes to the free throw line I know a lot of Hokeie fans have been waiting to see Dorne did not play the first game and of course the Providence game was back and forth so much uh he didnt get as much time as he probably expected I would look for him to be on the floor more here tonight for Mike Youngs group Deuce Jones A10 rookie of the year last year at Lasel trying to create a Dallas looked like he got a hand on it but last touch by a Hawk Hooks take possession back Neither one of these teams press very much unless just necessary sometimes on dead balls Well teams have stayed in that mantoman as expected Hammond rising fire foul line jumper Another guy whos more confident as a sophomore obviously than he was as a freshman Has really played well in fall camp for coach Mike Young Scored over 20 in the exhibition Hoks on a 70 run Bank not open Long rebound for Hammond Thatll slow things down Lal picked up by Finley The pump fake No THE SECOND EFFORT LWAL WITH ANOTHER HIGHLIGHT REEL PLAY YEAH WE KNOW HE could jump high but how quick did he jump cheering applause He makes it look effortless sometimes Yeah Watch how quick he responds and gets up He is an amazing athlete Youve got one of the best freshman in the country and maybe the best athlete in the country on this Virginia Tech team Is that play coachable No No No No Not at all Not at all You know we talked about that when you see a spectacular play and you can describe it its not special But if you cant describe it it was special Its one of your best lines Thats a good one there Youve got a lot of good ones Finally a little too strong The Hokes and Hammond A little bit of contact Hanssbury off a great feed from Johnson MAKES IT A DOUBLEDIGIT Virginia Tech lead Great pass by Johnson and a great post up by Hansbury He held that contact and created that passing angle This is something else Hansbury can do He can guard a smaller quicker guy And the second effort its Austin Willilifford there onto the baskets Yeah hell be familiar to a lot of Hokei fans Jason Willilifford his dad great player at UVA longtime coach now at Georgetown His son from St Ans Bellefield in Charlottesville A really good freshman Hansberry is rejected And theres Fininkley whos been active as a rim protector early Yeah hes been good on both ends of the floor Hadnt got a lot of production but he has been active and a factor down low Also a really good threepoint shooter throughout his career Yeah hes hes averaging already 14 and 35 Good free throw shooter good offensive rebounder We talked about Haskins but that thats a nice pair of forwards for coach Donahghue Eight seconds to shoot Shoot Open look You bounce I tell you Mike Young is one of the best in the country at baseline out of bounds And of course special teams special situations always has been big in Blackburg Largest lead of the first half for Virginia Tech Glover Tuscono Jones into the hands of Hanssbury His forced the turnover HAMMOND DROPS IT OFF FOR JOHNSON The sophomores make the play Sharing the basketball and a timeout What a start on this Wednesday night But previously 10 years as the head coach at Penn take you back to the 2018 Ivy League championship What a game this was Yeah at the Mecca the Pstra If you havent been there you need to go Coach Donghue is no stranger to the NCAA tournament And what a win this was against a really good Harvard team Coach Donahue There you see Cornell head coach Boston College head coach and most recently at Penn as we just showed you Yeah hes hit two of the big five I dont know if hes going to go for all six of the big five which well explain later His team converts under the basket after the timeout Justice Azabal Hokei shooting over 50 early Hanssberry cool calm collected draws the foul Yeah And we we talked about both these coaches not only good in special situations but the ATOs after timeout possessions they score a pretty high percentage Lonnie Hansbury what a start to his Virginia Tech career Two games two double doubles 17 11 against Providence and really the basket that put that game away in overtime Yeah he made some big stops He made some key baskets especially like you mentioned down the stretch in that game Hes been good from the free throw line five out of six on the season so far And hes just versatile You know he can play five four he can guard a three or a two Meanwhile for St Joes M What do the Hawks need to do to get things going offensively Well they havent solved the the defense down here Theyve got to execute Every you know a lot of their shots have been rushed or contested You got to execute a little better Match down Jaden Glover Tuscano with a hand in his face And Hooks made a nice switch there but they didnt switch aggressively enough Glover Tusano now is an outstanding player Weve talked about Deuce Jones Tusano is really a great scoreer Also the transfer from St Johns as you mentioned late in the shot clock Bedford turns fires Hanssberry Johnson banks it in Johnson cheering It still counts Thats what Tyler Johnson is saying right now What time do Banks close 7 8 I dont know I dont know Its 722 right now on the East Coast 67 something like that Finley long three unable to answer Yeah Finley didnt look good right there Hes a 40 threepoint shooter Didnt look good on that one Good defense by St Joes Theyve got numbers Deuce Jones coming off that 29point outing against Drexel with the left hand Yes Deuce Jones is show you he went one for 10 the first night then came off the bench and like you mentioned 29 And speaking of somebody who can shoot it Jayen shoot makes it 284 Tech Hulks shooting 52 from the floor And this team you know Coach Young said Were going to be able to run more Weve got more depth We got more athleticism We got skills And were going to be able to offensive rebound And theyre doing both of those things here early in the season Bedford gets the friendly drop off the iron Another guy who had a big game against Providence on Saturday cheering Meyers Nobody there on the kick out Another St Joes turnover Six turnovers for the Hawks and several of those have led directly to baskets on the other end Eight of Virginia Techs 30 points have come off of those St Joes mistakes and the Hookies are dominating in the paint We talked about the shooters but 18 points already in the paint here tonight music Thrilled to have you on your Wednesday night Evan Hughes Mac McCarthy music alongside our entire outstanding ACC Network crew pair of 2 and 0 teams And if youre just tuning in Virginia Tech and its offense has been one of the main stories early Abdales just checked back in Hes got four Drops off for Johnson and hes met at the rim Jones Step back three Wont fall Lals pass intercepted and the left hand finish Glover Tuscano Yeah Ruth we talked about 64 out of Brooklyn New York Great oneonone skills that time Knocked the ball loose Kept the Hookies from fast breaking and scoring ADL Yes with the right hand absorbing contact Yeah doesnt look strong but hes physical when he drives the basketball Pull up three Finally back rim Good look Better looking at Tuskano Glover Tuscado almost got another one and thatll take us to the under eight media timeouts Hokey Welcome back Castle Coliseum His leading 326 and its the reigning ACC player of the week Neo of Dallas turns shoots and miss fires Got to where he wanted to off the triple couldnt convert Will the freshman cans the corner tray Yeah you get a defensive stop get out in transition you get a higher percentage shot So far St Joes only shooting 37 but that kind of shot will help Posasha the Delaware transfer off the side of the rim Rebound from Simpson the point guard Robert Tusano has shown his range Thats a long three Clanks front iron PASHA DRIVING FINISHING WITH THE RIGHT hand under the baskets Yeah he plays similar to Abdales Not nearly as big though but but he has some of those same skills that transfer from Delaware Eight different Hokes have scored in the first half ROBERT TUSANO INTERCEPTED by Pasha Lewal will take it all the way in transition Leaves that short Nice job by Simpson contesting that shot Good transition I thought St Joes might get a good look cheering Finley guarded by Chute Play on No whistle Will Ford looks to create Finley probing the baseline A jump ball whistle Itll stay with the Hawks Second 15 again the change of pace create the contact lay it up head up masha yeah but you know that when the left arm extends like that you usually get the charge call on that but this has been a physical game You know we talked about it at the top You got a really good officiating crew and two teams that like to get after it Virginia Tech number zero Thats a foul against Jaylen Bedford off the ball Thats the first team foul against the Hokes Yeah I I was looking at St Joes zero free throw attempts and of course the Hokes havent been there a lot Just three for five Jones open Hell make it pay Oh hes hes really good You mentioned Lal transfer 29 in the last game with 12 made free throws against Drexel Hanssberry has shown the range early Not that time The feed inside from Haskins Layup off the mark TECH IN TRANSITION THE LOB FROM THE DALLAS in the wall ANOTHER EXCLAMATION POINT When you get a great passer with a great athlete thats the kind of play you get Right hand layup from Jones That might be on Sports Center tonight Those two might be on Sports Center quite a bit to be honest of Dallas with 10 to work with on the shot clock STEP BACK THREE SWIRLS around in transition Run the floor You dont have to throw it perfectly for Lal to get the finish How difficult can is that pass from Abdales to throw it to that such of a high point You know youve got to have great vision Youve got to have great skill You have to have touch on it just like a quarterback 13point Hokei lead Johnson steps in front of that pass Handsberry gets in on the action Thats what Im talking about And saw where he was going to go before he even caught the ball cheering Under four minutes until halftime Jones rebound from Solano Tech basketball Bedford Cant leave him open Jaylen Bedford 18 points against Providence 13 against Charleston Southern UNLV transfer gives Virginia Tech its largest lead of the first half Yeah he he and Shooter are in close competition to whos the better perimeter shooter when theyre left wide open on a right hand finish Pretty move Derek Simpson in the lane Yeah I really like him He kind of keeps things calm out there Averaging 10 and six Mac whats been most impressive about Virginia Tech offensively here Well they just share the basketball They are always making the neck pass Frankley by himself Lal got a piece of it in transition A Dallas JOHNSON LEFT HAND FINISH and again fumbling the ball in transition Back to the play He still knew where he was going to go with that basketball Good job by the Hokes running the floor too Haskins through traffic Lost the handle And heres Tech again Corner three Too strong Too much from Tyler Johnson Playing at a much faster pace than they they have the last couple seasons Fankley wanted an early three in the possession Too strong on the other end Mike Young wants to talk about this possession applause Timeout Hokes are best in transition and this is one of the reasons why You got bigs that can run the floor You got a great pass Theyre heads up looking for his teammates And watch the reaction from the bids Those Suns are something else Duke with the win last night against Army on the road at Army Yeah really cool scene Welcome back Castle Coliseum shoots off the mark Just over 90 seconds left until halftime If youre just joining us Virginia Tech shooting 50 in the first half A lot of different contributors Yeah again I think this is going to be a really balanced team And we we talked about the fact that they have five guys averaging in double figures and two more at 8 12 and eight Of course when you score 107 and 98 a lot of people score double figures Derek Simpson 31 starts at Ruters his second year at St Joes Defended by Shoot skip pass to the corner catch and shoot three and air ball but thats off the shoulder of Tyler Johnson whos tied for a game high with nine points He he he again uh has just improved and understands he was good as a freshman but he is so physical and so hes probably the toughest guy on this team High praise for just a secondyear player Eight on the timer He might have been the toughest as a freshman laughter Glover Tuscano with one to spare The wall couldnt BRING IT IN AND JOHNSON swipes that away HAMMOND ALL BY HIMSELF TO THE RACK IN TRANSITION cheering Really good decision making right there Hesitated and then split the defenders Hammond What a defensive move Surveying whats behind him Backto back baskets for the sophomore Ben Hammond from Manasses Yeah cant block it if you cant catch him And Smith couldnt get there in time cheering Simpson misses the left wing three Second chance under the basket Drops in Glover Tuscano 10 seconds for Tech to work with Hammond has the hot hand Creates for Hansberry And thatll do it for the first half Really physical first half Virginia Tech We know they could score They did that again but they were really good on the defensive end doing it on this Wednesday night Thrilled to have you both teams starting fives on the floor to begin the second half His ran played a lob for Lal and they took that away and instead who always seems to struggle in the first half from three but heats up in the second half Simpson had 18 against the Hokes last year with the right hand Drills it outside the lane but nice patience He kind of let the defense get out of position and knock down a little 10footer Good start for St Joes trying to cut back into this big Virginia Tech lead Dallas right back to him No look past far corner Hansberry behind the free throw line leaves it short Great hustle from Lal He can just go get it whether its above the rim or chasing it down on the floor Step back of Dallas wont drop How about a third opportunity on this possession Bedford with six on the shot clock Lwal with two Third times the charm for Tech on that possession What a possession for Virginia Tech Deep in the shot clock And Lewal not the most likely threepoint shooter but a solid threepoint shooter and something that he really has worked on in the offse On the other end Simpson Abdales the board Hokes in transition with Johnson Lewal tries it again Not that time And its Glover Tuscono The board Averaged a little over six minutes a game last year at St Johns Turns it over Glover Tano A little miscommunication right there Deep in the shot clock Pedford cant get it off Good job by Simpson And laid on the close out And Toby Lewal with confidence had a SC top 10 transition dunk in the first half Seven points five rebounds and two blocks Its amazing how much he has improved You know like weve talked about before in previous broadcasts he didnt play basketball his whole life talked about at ACC tip off when he declared for the NBA draft and came back He wanted to understand how to you know make reads a little bit more and expand on his versatility He has shown that Yeah And he talked about how going through that draft process really helped him Opened his eyes and showed him what he needed to get better at Hes also made tremendous progress in the weight room with with strength coach David Jackson too former Hokei great Jones Long two close out from of Dallas This is a good basketball team Virginia Tech is beaten up on Lal patient drawing the foul Yeah no doubt Again St Joes with 22 wins last year backtoback 20 win seasons 24 in school history and they have the second most production returning in the A10 And thats a league I mean thats a really good league that produces some great NCAA tournament teams BCU Dayton St Louis Richmond on and on A lot of good basketball played in that league Theres more on the George Mason playing well Yeah theyre off to a really good start They come to Castle Coliseum in December Always big when you play an instate game of Dallas The turnaround Jay from the elbow Does he make the game look easy He He really does And on the other end pretty scoop layup Derek Simpson Yeah Mike Young wont be happy about that Not paying attention in transition not getting back ahead of the ball And last year an 8262 win for St Joes over the Hokes and one of your favorite venues the Pstra Hokes going against a two3 zone now Bedford knocks down the corner three Doesnt matter if you play man or zone youve got to find Bedford The cut Jones is fouled cheering Going back to Jaylen Bedford for a moment because if you think about how he finished last year at UNLV double figures in 10 of his final 11 games here at Tech 13 against Charleston Southern 18 against Providence and tonight Bedfords got eight Yeah And and I dont know that a lot of people were talking about him being in the starting lineup but uh but he has absolutely earned it in the in the summer and the fall camp Jones coming off that near 30point performance Lost the handle Abdales play on No whistle Eight on the timer Bedford extended that right elbow Yeah 5831 your score Hokes have outscored the Hawks 11 to4 in the second half When we come back shorts of the St Joes basketball players it reads The Hawk will never die How about that partner I love that tradition Uh its got to be one of the best in college sports There you see top right corner of your screen the Hawk flapping the wings And we were wondering what time he was going to come out He did not appear until right around tip off And rightfully we were talking about stay in the locker room as long as you can right before you got to come out He cant stop once hes out in public That is so good Good form there 3500 No I could see a little more extension there but uh but its hard to critique somebody doing what hes doing Sign me up for going to the auditions Little 131 zone right now Different look And Hawks get a stop And the block from behind by Johnson What a night the sophomores having ON THE OFFENSIVE END WITH THE LEFT HAND TYLER JOHNSON DOING IT ALL Say thats like the guy in the outfield making the catch and get hes up at bat first If you make the block you ought to get the shot at the other end 29 point Hokei lead Jones one of the top scorers for St Jones Off the mark Second chance Haskins delivers A lot of contact in there This game is not for the faint of heart for sure And the players adjust I love it The 131 late in the shot clock Skip pass far corner Lwal lost the handle with one cheering Out of bounds with 15 It will stay with Virginia Tech Yeah And I dont know whether theyll say he had possession and reset the shot clock Nope So tough situation for Virginia Tech Catch and shoot Shoot Got it off Its about as good a look as you could get with 15 Haskins The jab step and the triple Game coming to life Did we say wed see more of him in the second half to Seir Haskins out of Willingboro New Jersey And hes hes the one causing trouble in this 131 at the top at the point of that zone defense Ball movement from Tech Theres Dorne under the basket A goalend and the freshmans first points inside Castle Coliseum Yeah it itll be the first of a lot He Hes a good player and that was a nice pass by him A little shot fake little pass fake and found the big guy down low with position Coach Young said when he signed that he brings a unique combination of size skill and toughness He is another tough guy Weve seen that toughness on the defensive end here tonight And some people were asking about the defense after giving up 101 to Providence I think they got their answer Azure ball tied up with shoot Possession arrow remains with St Joes Azure great shot blocker not much of an offensive player but number five in the nation in block shots a year ago He had eight blocks in the Hawks NIT game against UAB Onto the basket there is Deuce Jones whos going to be a big part of this St Joes team this year Yeah hes hes an explosive guy We talked about Glover Tusano Derek Simpson is a solid scorer also They have a lot of weapons Lal all by himself Yeah thats not a shot he could have made last year Hes stronger and more confident cheering Haskins feeling it with the step back Strong rebound from Johnson His fourth 11 points four rebounds three steals one block Hammond had that stripped out of his hands Well stay here It play right up through the chest of the best one of the best shot blockers in America Well that was that time Sorry about that still 6 n very tall presence Now Im going to do the Marquette transfer Yeah I gave it to AAL The St Joes team does have some height on it Oh yeah Solano in now 7 foot 260 shoots Yes Baseline out of bounds Special situations Mike Young dialing it up cheering Near corner Simpson Deuce Jones reigning A10 Rookie of the Year looking to create OFF THE DEFLECTION THATLL WORK JADEN GLOVER Tuscano says Thank you very much on the deflection Yeah he can get his shot off now fourstar recruit Amdales other end right back at you with the triple Oh well he sure given up tonights assist That time he received one with the skip pass cheering Both teams trading threes landing ACC player of the week Neil Abdales out on the floor Shoot from the top of the key against the zone Defense is late And then the skip pass to Abdales but they decided Drexel has been successful enough Well put them in there Like the Big 10 is not 10 people The Big Five is not five people And they have this inseason tournament And the team that wins two in their pod they play for a a title if you will the city title And uh and basketball is so big in Philadelphia No doubt They love their college basketball I think its so cool to have even though those are regular season games the tournament feel of it the bragging rights Oh yeah In an inseason tournament like that Dallas Hanssberry at the rim You know like a quarterback leads the receiver to the opening He led the receiver to the rim Hes had a couple of those perfect passes Solano couldnt control that entry pass His in transition Abdales shows the range cheering On the receiving end and the giving end Well coach Donahghue talked about it with us today about how he can just impact the game in so many different ways He can set up his teammates he can score it Yeah Do you take away his scoring and he and he leads that leads to scoring for someone else or do you try to play off of him and then he scores So theres no real good answer for one of the best freshman in the country Much longer three from Abdollis left iron and sincere Jones tiptoeing the baseline Theres a little live pass in the lane from Abdales And here penetrate into the paint Kick it back out And Avdales doing special things 14 points six assists three rebounds 11 on the shot clock How about Jones The effort to keep possession Yeah he he hes he like everybody else out there is playing really hard and of course when the shots are going in uh sometimes its easier to play hard But both these teams have continued to give good effort even though St Joes is down by a considerable margin Jones St Joes and Fininkley pushing works on Abdales and he lost the handle Thats turnover number 17 for St Joes averaging less than nine in two games And AD has gotten a lot stronger just since hes been here And he didnt get here till late summer But but you can see the change in his body already also which is something that hes going to really have to work on at the next level where folks think hes going to be a lottery pick A foul against Tech quickly You know the 17 turnovers Is that about what Virginia Techs doing Has that been a little bit on St Joes What do you kind of credit that too Yeah I I think its been Virginia Techs defense not necessarily steals but putting a lot of pressure on the basketball and denying the next pass Uh I you know maybe a combination but I think Virginia Techs been much better defensively and I know that was a point of emphasis for Mike Young coming back from Providence on this pretty quick turnaround Finley Not that time Second chance Mai Johnson cheering Sinkley had a good look at it that time and you can see the form Its good but uh he has struggled tonight If youre just joining us Virginia Tech got out to a big run early The Hokes have led by as many as 34 and Virginia Tech ready to bring in five at the scores table as Hammond unable to bank that in off the glass but will go to the line Yeah the Hookies are always attacking whether its off the dribble or running down the floor and uh and and have been more conscious of offensive rebounding with this group too And some of that is just athleticism Some of it is depth And I think Mike Young is is excited about the fact that he thinks seek can wear people down with the depth And and that being said we have a line change from the from the hockey coach over there laughter with five Hokes looking to come in the game back in the season for number one early second week of the season to be able to get some of the younger players extended minutes like this thats a luxury Im sure right coach really is and of course three starters came back in along with Dorne and Pasha getting ready to check in for Hammond Hammond eight points five assists and theres the Delaware transfer Isaiah Pasha Well see Posash at the point guard spot with this group out there The finger roll from Deuce Jones Yeah that was a good job by him Beat Beford whos a good oneonone defender Tell how good Duce Jones the second is Hes in double figures Nine minutes to go on this Wednesday night Pasha finds Johnson Lal lost the handle and a shot clock violation Good job by St Joes That time they they cut off the penetration and recovered to whoever they kicked it to And on the theme of turnovers again Matt you brought this up but I think for context worth bringing back up again Providence Virginia Tech two turnovers final 25 minutes today Hokes five total turnovers Yeah just two in the first half Lal climbed the ladder for that rebound I dont know if Ive ever seen just four turnovers in 45 minutes Thats Thats pretty amazing Pasha kick to Bedford Lal got by his defender Up and under Toby Lales coming back down the floor Thats another shot he did not have in his uh you know his you know artillery last year cheering Finley backing down the wall turns patient chance for a threepoint play Anthony Fininkley a 7945 lead for the Hokes Well pause and return after these messages Yeah he he really works hard Look at this deep post up 14 music points four rebounds three assists two steals and the three for the Terry on top He has music been efficient as well 50 from the floor The Hookies have been efficient in this second half from threepoint range Six out of 11 in the second period St Josephs seventh year last Pressure on the inbound Bedford in trouble there in the corner Jump ball possession with Tech Mike Young and staff uh worked quite a bit against zone and man pressure Of course you want to do that early in the season You never know where youre going to run to it And this is not a pressing team by nature but of course the score dictates that they try to speed this game up a little bit and get more possessions going down the stretch Weve seen St Joes go to a zone in the second half and now pressure is able to break it Pasha is very good in the open floor and the foul on Duce Jones Jones mentioned that he was outstanding last year at Lasal averaged over 14 a game in 810 play and then regular season finale he had 27 points against St Joes Then a couple weeks later he was with the Hawks Yeah In a big big rivalry game on Saturday against Drexel where he had 29 And a little little chippiness Pasha called for the offensive foul right there And theyre going to take a look at it Our officials Roger Ays Lee Cassell and Bill Cington Jr caution See if the uh contact was excessive The previous call on the floor is being reviewed for a hostile act Thats new Thats new verbiage It is hostile act Heres a look at it Jones looks like he gives him space And yes dont know that theyll see that as an offensive uh a a basketball play if you will He did extend and catch him with the elbow So it could be I think by definition a flagrant one Certainly wasnt intentional Still a lot of contact though The Hokes have look like theyve done another line change Looks like they have five subs Veteran crew Yeah we talked Its been a physical game but I dont I dont think theres been anything excessive about it And uh and I dont think it was excessive here although again it was a lot of contact So uh the fact that it wasnt intentional doesnt mean it still couldnt be elevated Take another look And he was not in the in the offensive player cylinder I dont think the cone if you will After review the ruining on the floor has been upgraded to a flagrant one St Joes will have two shots and the ball right here And there you have it from Roger Harris I like that You know I I enjoy the officials coming over to tell us but thats a much more efficient way of of dealing with it cheering Thats exactly what we predicted it would be unnecessary cheering Jones 12 for 13 at the free throw line last game These are the first free throws of the night for St Joes A team he shot 51 in the first two games and just two now midway through the second half of this entire game I those were two real big things for St Joes Their two wins protecting the basketball and getting to the free throw line And tonight its been uh really difficult in both those situations 7 and 12 minutes to go Theyre 2 and 0 teams Myers steps back long two Not that time Lewal pulls down his eighth rebound of the nights Meer is an interesting player You know red shirted last year after knee surgery Uh really explosive Not a real big guy but they really like this kid Local product Hansberry Back rim wont go Myers out of Newman Geredi famous school in Philadelphia Glover Tuscano dumps off Smith A dribble and a layup on the right block Really nice play by Glover Tusano to create the help Found the big guy Smith with the finish in with some contact The form transfer Hes out of Chicago Played for an AAOU coaching legend named M Irvin If you if youve recruited in college basketball youve dealt with M Irvin at some point in time One of the great AAU programs in the country Hanssbury the whistle and the foul against the sophomore Jaden Smith Forom transfer number 10 Jaden Smith second personal team foul Thats the fifth team foul Two more will put Tech in the bonus Saturday morning at 1000 am Eastern the ACC Huddle Crew will be at the University of Pittsburgh to get you ready for another full day of football with a 2hour pregame show Theyll have game previews along with expert analysis and featured stories right here on ACCN and the allnew ESPN app Its that time of the year college basketball star college football some meaningful games in November Its a great time of the year Crossover season Got to pay attention Keep up with everything Jones with the right hand Bank is open Two points off the ben Hes up to 16 points to lead all scorers tonight A whistle off the ball Meyers trying to defend Abdales Yeah thats a little bit of a mismatch right there How difficult Abdales again his height at 69 Its a foot a foot difference between those two guys Im not good at math It may be 11 in but its a lot And just in general too for other teams to match up without Dallas Yeah I mean you know you put a little guy on him and that that bothers him a little bit but you put little bit guy on him hes too fast for that and Shoot continues to shoot the ball very well here in the second half Jones other end short also gets into double figures Okies with five now Bounce pass of Dallas hands bury over the outstretched arms What a find What a play at the rim Youve got to be kidding me That was incredible AND ABDALES THE BLOCK Hes got the board Hammond and the finish Casty rocks cheering applause the love Anybody could have had it Hisbury says Thank you very much Fleet eight back in this part of the country Originally from Maryland you mentioned 18 and 12 against Providence Hes going to have quite a few double doubles if uh if he continues this level of play Glover Tusanos Kevin Kierney Glover Tusano high arcing leaves the three short And a whistle Nice job by Smith Shoot Did a good job of taking the three away Then he contested that shot but must have stepped out of bounds Good call there partner Couldnt quite see what happened Yep He went down in a heat Thought it was a foul but stepped out of bounds before the shot Person Gak getting some minutes for the Hokes Gaks played well in limited minutes so far Just a another freshman Posasha gets it back Gerak cleans it up under the hoop Hes got one of those bodies People just fall off of it Arsman from Charles Town West Virginia Meyers the dump off Great decision and the dunk from Jaden Smith Yeah you see a little bit of why theyre excited about Meyers He actually tore his ACL as a senior in high school and recovered all of last year Uh and they think his explosiveness is back Posa screaming big rejection Kernney Kevin Kernney another red shirt freshman But here go the Hokes Hammond had the assistant transition LAST TIME HE FINISHES AT THE RIM and will go to the free throw line Yeah And Kernney got there just a little bit late A little bit of contact Van Hammond a transition layup He was fouled and converts the threepoint play What a change of pace from Abdales at point guard at 69 to Hammond at point guard at 511 Maybe 511 Its been interesting to see them on the floor together and and we will see it some for sure The right hand Kernney whos been made an impact off the bench Yeah he hes hes making play Hes a Richard Freshman from Brooklyn Jones creating space Thats off of the freshman from Churchland High Schools hands Hes been impressive in practice Uh thats exactly why hes getting some some game time minutes here Will the freshman posa the box out draws the foul Will hadnt had a lot of time Made a three early in the game but uh he hadnt been on the floor a lot this evening Played play quite a bit He was in that se six seven eightman rotation those first couple games 17 Hookies are in the bonus Check it back in for the Hookies 77 Dorne replaces Gerak for St Joseph Well not the result St Joes wanted tonight Mack But this team in the A10 cheering going to be fun to watch this year Oh they they theyve got scores theyve got size theyve got solid guard play uh theyre theyre going to be just fine in A10 play And the A10 is good this year VCU of course is good Dayton is good There are a lot of good teams in the A10 but uh I think St Joes is going to be near the top of that league Nice night for shoot with four threes Hammond with four Crossover dribble The right hand floater the tip in door No gets his own miss that time Yes stayed with it Good awareness by Hammond to get it up on the rim Good job by Dorne staying after it Carney fades fires and hits Boy very nice shot right there Heavily contested Rose up took his time Hammond step back three right side off the mark Had a good look off the ball screen Smith stepping out Shoots the ball fake The kick out Jones too strong A good look Nice pass by Chute Transition three Will Ford misfires with under 60 seconds to go His will slow this down Get deep in the shot clock Shorten this game Get this thing to the end A very successful night for Mike Youngs Hokes And theyll be back in action on Sunday with the Charlotte 49ers in the house Shell have the call with Bailey Angel Looking forward to that Charlottes got a big team too Theyve got several 69 610 611 guys
