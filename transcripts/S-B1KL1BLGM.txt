their game on Wednesday against lesle University with an ankle injury after Just 4 minutes and did not take warm UPSs in sweats on the side so that is obviously a big loss for the Skyhawks so a little bit of an adjustment there and our first threepoint attempt is good Ethan muser the Junior from Pennsylvania steps back and knocks down a three hes a 38 threepoint shooter and how about that start for Stonehill well you watch this Boston College team theyve been vulnerable to some bigs who can step out and shoot the three you go back to the Dartmouth loss here just after Thanksgiving that was a short turnaround for BC coming off that tournament win down in the Caribbean and they beat Boise State in that final a quad one win then lost to Dartmouth theres Beetle a deep three Chad venning gets an offensive rebound then lost the hand a lot try to na trying to navigate his way through the double team there Im not sure if he was trying to pass to Dion Brown underneath but obviously coming off that roughly week long break now have to think that Earl Grant wanted his team to get off to a quick start today so Amir Nesbit gets the start in place of Morgan the grad student and hes out of bounds there for Stonehill thats Todd brogno the sophomore hes been really good eighth in the NEC in points per game theres Chris Krauss 11th season at his Alma moer third year that Stonehill has been a division one program a little bit of step back last year they had a ton of injuries ended up going just 4 and 27 theyve obviously exceeded that win total by two already this year Elijah strong straight on from three is no good has a rebound not going to complain about him shooting that ragna kicks user thought about it again instead goes to Nesbit throws the extra pass and Stonehill still cycling straight on kofs jumper is no good Herman Kofi starting his eighth game in a row hes averaging 11 a game over these last eight for Stonehill stonehills had some nice wins on their resume so far be a quak team that was picked highly in the back need a Bryant team its a former League rival only lost in this last stretch of five was to Marquette on the road brogna is Good from three Todd brogna the sophomore first in the NEC among qualifiers over a 54 threepoint shooter you can see the game plan very early on here for Stonehill Eric is theyre going to shoot and theyre going to shoot from distance and theyre going to try to sort of play that game of our threes will beat your twos and whatever shots we sort of allow you to get on the defensive Applause end Donald Han long two is good so the Eagles get on the board Donald and junor the red shirt sophomore Boston Colleges leading scorer 14 a game in over 30 minutes Stonehill packing it in defensively good ball denial into the low post so hand has to settle for the jumper but knocks it down andu had 13 points in the game against wake Boston Colleges last game last Saturday where they lost on the road to start ACC play long three ball no good from Kofi Applause MBC On The Run Dion Brown on the Baseline a good job to find Elijah strong and there is beetle short from Applause three Josh Beetle has been inserted into the starting lineup over the last few games second start taking over that spot for Chaz Kelly theyve both been about even in minutes nbit jumpers good air Nesbit coming in from Hampton University taking advantage of a miscommunication there on the pick and roll Beetle and venning both went with the same guy that left nesbet wide open Got Deep to the free throw line for an easy shot a good offensive start here for Stonehill up 8 to2 beetles got a good left hand and he finds the runner I think part of the reason you see the move into the starting lineup was because of what he had done Off the Bench previously right he been sort of become that goto guy down the stretch hit some big late game buckets in that that tournament for BC in that Cayman Islands win so he gets rewarded getting into his starting Ro trying to find some of that offense early on drive from Stinson and he traveled but a nice start here for Stonehill eight points early off a couple of threepointers something to watch today for a Skyhawks team that makes nearly 10 per game theyre up four early chance once you get a conference play and obviously only four wins a year ago thats not a surprise when you see teams you know who have made the jump from D2 to D1 its not always that first year its that second that third year where sometimes that recruiting hit comes nice drive by Chaz Kelly whos into the game second game in a row coming off the bench for Chaz the Junior from Houston Texas whos averaging four per game still the team leader and assist with three per contest and just to finish point one thing that I think will help ston Hills with the Northeast conf has done which has allowed teams in that transition a Stonehill and a Le Moine to be able to play in the conference tournament even though theyre not yet NCAA tournament eligible Luis Simona the sophomore whos come on really well here over the last few games hes set career highs in backto back games at 18 against Quinnipiac and then 24 on Wednesday against Leslie Dion Brown No Good from three and a foul called on the rebound attempt on the floor stals challenge themselves as well this is their fourth Power Six opponent that theyve played this year at Notre Dame at Providence at number 10 Marquette week and a half ago and now here against PC now if youre going to make that move youre going to have to go play some Giants and sometimes you have to take your lumps in that process although really Marquette was probably the only true true blowout of that group of three you mentioned Roger McFarland did game turnaround jumper no good so Boston College is three for nine from the floor to start this game Stonehill couple of threepointers the difference and a 106 lead early on Chaz Stinson the Junior from Charlotte North Carolina Neil markart in the game for the first time as well for Stonehill and that is turned over much better defensive trip that time for the Eagles probably their best stretch of Defense handling that pick and roll situation much better in terms of the communication when to switch when to stay think a little bit more versatility with Jaden Hastings on the floor playing that Center Spot and hes got that foot speed and obviously the wingspan to be able to recover and close out on a forward whos more of a shooter quickly yeah Earl ground Grants gone deep enough down the card but theres still opportunities to earn some roles here as ACC play its begun they already played wake farest but really will click in after the New Year Donald Han right to the basket and Hastings follows good read There by Jaden Hastings to follow the Miss its what you love to see from the big man just Elevate use your size nbit throws it away a Bost to college ball the Skyhawks see Hastings was behind that play the whole way read it really well wait for that ball to pop off the rim and everyone Gathering underneath he says dont mind me while I just come over the top Hastings who red shirted last year former fourstar recruit from Orlando Florida chz Kelly back right Kelly up Kelly no and a rebound for muser couple is in tight but I like the mentality at least early on of Kelly going to the rim baites for three in and out good looking shot from Alex Bates the transfer from Music Iona and right to the basket hand goes up and his foul so BCA its certainly aggressive getting to the basket here you can see the game plan early on well and youre seeing the shots from the outside not falling either so sometimes you miss those first few from deep and the mentality changes and you say all right shots not working early on let me try to get myself in Rhythm attack the basket either get some layups or get to the free throw line Donald hand has been an excellent free throw shooter this year comes in second in the ACC 88 hes now 44 for 50 this year taking a huge leap this season last year and really his first full year remember he played two games as a freshman before the injury just Five Points a game 142 minutes hes more than doubled most of those offensive categories and he will check out here for Dion Brown and Boston College has tied this game again its a story you dont see a lot in college basketball anymore just because theres so much movement in the transfer portal year to year its its not often you see a guy sort of wait and eventually get his opportunity to see the uptick minutes and all of a sudden the uptick production in points and rebounds in efficiency comes as a result sometimes youll see it but its at a different place right you grow into it that way another three Chance In and Out couple of good looks that time Simona was no good The supp Point again almost everything coming from the outside for Stonehill Jaz Kelly for three k Kelly did not pick pick his sneakers based on his opponent today but knocks down the triple to give Boston College their first lead of the day so remember Stonehill started this game with a couple of threepointers its a seven nothing run though for BC since then and it continues as Hastings goes up high for the rebound of the nbit Miss Fred Payne right to the basket and is blocked from behind Jaz stin got it and now Simona on the run out little too strong hes got a piece of the rebound and is fouled going up so free throws for ston Hill when we come back but the Eagles have flipped the script on this game early a 7even nothing run capped by the threepointer from Chaz Kelly as BC up three be the same guy every night and you have to if youre Earl Grant kind of re that early in the game and feel who has the hot hand and could be different people at different positions even on a game and a nightly basis but thats kind of going to be how you figure this unit out still I think looking for what those perfect rotations are with this group well certainly its going to be a matchup based attack and I think the toughest part is for Earl Grant over these first 10 games he hasnt seen the consistency that he wants on the defensive end of the floor and that is an area we know Eagles head coach Prides himself in having tough hardnosed teams that want to play with that defensive mentality they want to press you they want to turn you over they want to be tough to play against and it just hasnt always been there in this start for BC and so thats why youre seeing as much rotation flipping through these early stretches as anything else brown right to the basket was no good and a long rebound Hermon Kofi finds for Stonehill down by one cuz I think with all Grant hell hell let you play if youre going through a tough stretch offensively if youre not there on the defensive end of the floor and youre not giving the the effort that he thinks you should be then that thats when you get a seat brogna trying to find a lane and he does brogna going up against Dion Brown has five points really solid year eighth in the conference in points second in rebounding thats three point percentage we already saw him hit a three earlier 55 of the year only returning starter from last years ston Hill team and Eagles throw it away Kelly expecting venning to get around his man and get to the front post there theres a look at bronia really staple guy for Stonehill nice fake to his right turns it back to the jump hook a local product Worcester area twotime nepsac CH you know kind of one of those tweener prospects right you know lot ofam probably looked at him as maybe a little small to play a true post at this level but he can step outside shows you he can hit the jump shot nice building block for Stonehill for the future seven is shoot Simona against strong he tries got the back cut up and under no good look from Stinson at the end of the timer but he couldnt finish and McFarland back the other way for BC strong nearly lost the hand on it its back to McFarland Beetle drives lost his footing still got the pass away for vinning second effort for Dion Brown chaos underneath eventually finds an open Chad Benning for his first two good composure underneath by Brown after that offensive rebound just sort of fell into his lap he throws up the quick head fake to get Bron uh brog off balanced and then slips it to vetting for the easy Bank Shot Boston College eight of their 15 have come in the paint Brock a straight on good two threepointers already for Todd brogna hes two for two and Stonehill leads again back and forth early on Stonehill three for nine from behind the AR nearly going Beetle drives got it up Beetle got it good look from Beetle you watch those kind of plays and you go man you see the potential you see those Flash plays that just for Beetle and hasnt quite come consistently see where Stonehill wants to go with the ball brogna thought he was fouled did not get the call Beetle stops got the cutting McFarland decent look there but it just slipped off yeah pass just a little bit low McFarland at full speed couldnt catch it in stride take another look at the hang in the hit here from Beetle surviving the contact those are the kind of plays that you see just make him you know special special talent you can see those the minutes the usage the points as a result all up recently here for Josh Beetle its not just the big shots as youve talked about but definitely has earned more time and now getting his second start in a row rogna got to the boy hes been good getting into the basket what an early start here for brogna who has 10 points by the time he got a hand on him and he says well I can take this guy in the low post well goes back to his old school game just muscles his way to the rim its averaging 12 per game this year LCA Taves is in for the first time for Boston College immediately turned over and a jump ball will keep possession here for the Applause moment Stonehill making life tough on venning forcing him to catch the ball away from the rim quick hands slapping at that ball guy whos coming coming off a tough game against Wake Forest held to just six points for rebounds you know hes chopping at the bit to try to take advantage of a matchup he feels he should win venning right there underneath Chad bennings gotten off to really good starts early in games hes been an important piece to Boston Colleges early offense here recently and he is SC St Bonaventure transfer so 19 a piece here with 8 minutes to go in the first half brogna a fast ball to the corner and the three is Good from Louis Simona oh you see brogna the score now you get brogna the playmaker senses that double coming and makes a perfect pass easy catch and fire for Simona Elijah strong nearly lost the handle a little no look for venning who draws the foul nice job there for Elijah strong ears like what are we doing played 2 years ago in this building the first time they played his division one opponents and Stonehill gave Boston College all they could handle 6356 the final there and theyre giving them quite a bit early on today as venning misses the front end off the foul on Ethan muser the Juniors second foul this first out Benning is a 63 free throw shooter one of two its going to force Stonehill into a little bit of a smaller lineup brogno Simona a little bit more Mobile on the outside so theyll try to take advantage with the shooting out there offensively you can see what it does it brings Chad venning out to the threepoint line defensively against brogna go switch does leave them a little bit vulnerable inside defensively though well see if the guards for BC continue to attack as a result RNA going to back down go to his left got to fall away a little short but an offensive rebound by Stinson a fresh possession for Stonehill second offensive rebound for the Skyhawks and this is going the other way its on brogna well lets look at what bragas done so far for Stonehill we told you it might have more touches with Josh Morgan down today and he certainly has been good so far again utilizing that mismatch then giving him room to shoot he takes advantage and then when he senses the smaller guard on him easy spinoff in the low post nice finish at the rim and again only a sophomore hes definitely a building block for this future for Stonehill had 16 and eight 21 minutes on Wednesday against Leslie ja Kelly back in for BC that stolen was trying to get it to McFarland its Simona out front and he is fouled on the floor Lou Simona the sophomore off the turnover first foul on Chaz Kelly and McFarland cuts his run a little bit short there allows Simona to jump into the passing Lane again couple early miscommunications on offense for BC whether its guys like from there not coming to the basketball not setting up where teammates expect them to be lob inside oh boy Brock that was behind he couldnt quite catch that pass NZ knew it too yeah he had a good seal again just got to get a little bit better execution on that pass competitive back and forth game here early first half Kelly step back three chz Kelly has his shot today already one shy of a season high in points eight of them so far for Applause Kelly Austin College back in the lead rogna against Elijah strong and contact called on Music strong 31 how about Chaz Kelly again coming off the bench today for the second game in a row hes been good you talk about ER Grant looking for you know trying to set up the rotations right now Chaz Kelly appears to be earning himself some valuable minutes in the second half with how he started this game nice little move and brogna is fouled and thats I think two in a row on Elijah strong well how about the design here the inbounds and brogna now will go to the line creates a nice free Lane for brogna tried to make a statement by throwing it down see some of his numbers this year the threepoint shots hasnt had the same quite the number of attempts as some of the other top threepoint Shooters in the NC but youre seeing more of it because of how good hes been average 5 and A2 points last year playing in 28 games as we said really the only returning starter from last years Stonehill team battled a lot of Applause injuries he is on his season average in points he has 12 of stonehills 24 Kelly kicks Mick Farland High reing three is good Roger McFarlands first triple his fourth of the Year oh Grant with love to see that shot start to go down for McFarland the grad student who came in from Southeastern Louisiana and thats back to back games with a three as well for McFarland so well see if that sort of fuels his confidence a little bit well Stonehill is showing you where theyre going with the ball its going to be brogna every possession back on it five to shoot brogna drives crazy shot no but markart gets the offensive rebound I dont even know how you describe that last but hes back on it brogna up brogna good Tod brogna showing off in conty early hes going right at Elijah strong say you got two fouls I dare you not to commit a third exactly right put his shoulder into his chest and created the space Jaz Kelly matching so far new season High 10 points good confident take there from Kelly his Defender goes under the screen he steps up takes the easy money on the jump shot 2826 Falling Away Stinson was way off rebound loose for a while before McFarland finds it three on one fast break for frit pay like to see a little more of that from Boston College especially if you can get the rebound and run in Applause transition looked like a Leonard perau and Hagens there out front fourpoint lead now for Boston College four minutes to go and the first Applause half marar gives it up threepointer no good from Hermon Kofi and strong fighting for the rebound and that foul if itss on brogna thats his second so something to look at when we come back Eagles get out front thanks to the rebounding of McFarland and Fred Payne finishes for a fourpoint lead more especially with muser on the bench with two fouls whos ston Hills best rim protector DC overall has made seven in a row from the floor last three threepointers as well chz Kellys made a few to get some good minutes today the way hes going and take it away good steal by Chaz Stinson who averages two per game and he is fouled going up against KY Shonda the first year from the Congo yeah tough start for Shonda right hes had to sit and watch pretty much the entirety of this first half he gets in the game makes a tight pass turns it over and then commits the foul on the back end in transition skks sson so Chaz Stinson now the junior in 23 games last year for Stonehill started 10 averaging seven points a game hes sixth in the NEC in steals as we said averaging just under two per game just saw his first of the night you talk about key stretches of games I was going to say coming out of the timeout this is a key stretch for Boston College remember this was a point in the game at the start of this losing streak in against Dartmouth where felt like Boston College had started to grab control of the game but it was the final three minutes where Dartmouth started to find some Rhythm offensively and pulled their way back can ow ston Hill to do that here well if that was a pass it worked well Kelly too strong on the three but Roger McFarland has had a nice first half with a putb for Five Points well he might try to sell you it was a pass but that was definitely a long shot ended up working out with McFarland right place its a pass in the Box Score Applause tomorrow Fred Payne just called for the pal there is Josh Morgan as we said stonehills leading score SC just under 15 per game so far this year fourth in the conference coming in as a transfer from Incarnate Word a huge step this year an ankle injury as we said in the four minutes into that game against Leslie on Wednesday and out once again today certainly the hope is that its not a longterm issue and that hell be back somewhere around the start of Northeast conference play so can Stonehill do it without organ and without br on the floor right now out with two fouls down by four at the moment and McFarland with a burst of speed Hastings saves it and then the foul on Nesbit its a heck of a job by Jaden Hastings to save that give Boston College a chance and eventually they draw the foul yeah McFarland just getting a little sped up here tried to flip it off to Hastings and nice job to throw it in the area where he felt like he had some help a couple of wonky offensive possessions here coming out of the media timeout for BC Fred Payne whos gotten a lot of reent minutes feels like hes getting more and more in the rotation for Earl Grant missed at The Rim there well they played really well against wake had a missed opportunity there hopefully not still ruin the free throws he missed against the deakes toward the end of that game yeah had 12 points made a couple of Threes against wake three pointer no good from Stinson might have got a piece of that shot so BC can kind of slow things down a little bit theyre shooting 50 from the floor made eight of their last 10 even with a couple of Misses here McFarland that was something you can see it I I think it just rolled off his fingertips I me hes trying to argue for a foul they did not call it no there was no contact there Simona straight up has the size Advantage there against frit Payne eight to shoot for Stonehill down by four and that is thrown away so now all of a sudden weve gone a couple of possessions here without seeing a ton of points SC sonel has not scored in the last two minutes theyre one of their last seven from the floor but theyre still right in this game because BC all of a sudden after they went seven for seven missed their last three shots without Brock on the floor well same thing I think you know sort of goto players for both teams out of the mix right now I know youve got Kelly out there for BC but hes taking more of a a setup roll at the moment instead of looking for a shot like he was earlier boy this feels like a massive last 109 and a timeout called by Chris crous if going into the halftime you want to be playing with confidence you want to if youre BC build that lead if youre Stonehill try to grab the lead back and really both teams kind of lost in the woods over these last couple minutes on the offensive end of the floor for the Eagles no Donald hand venning had come off and so not really sure Shonda had come in for the first time theyre still trying to figure some things out with this group and for Stonehill its very clear with brogna out of the game that they dont really have another goto option out there to direct the offensive track traffic so final minute well see where Stonehill goes with the ball and with brogna out with two fouls its sson inside and he draws the foul good attack right at Hastings yeah this is Hastings trying to do the right thing in terms of just staying still problem is he never gets his body squared to stin him as hes coming to the basket you can see his hips are turned so that makes it an easy call for the official on the Block Chaz Stinson whos a 60 free throw shooter has his first Music point you talked about you know you look at stretches of games and for Stonehill its almost you know survive is not the right word but it almost feels like that when your best player who was so involved remember of stonehills first 24 points today brogna had 12 of them that was literally half of their offense and you can see Earl Grant knows how important this next 45 seconds is because he gets Beetle and vending right back out there see if they try to go two for one McFarland gives it off red Payne 13 to shoot Shonda thought about it got up in the air still manages to get it away for pain what a big shot oh maybe a little fortunate there Shonda looks like he might have gotten away with a walk he finds Payne who sticks the three how about the Eagles Who start Ed 0 for four from behind the arc now four for their last seven and Fred Payne earning more and more minutes 43 threepoint shooter knocks down a big one seven is shoot for Stonehill here at the end of the first half Stinson on the drive theres a ton of bodies there pay got it gets it off and nearly hit a wacky end the half but a big three for Fred at his Alma moer he just recently passed David mlin on the alltime wins lead for Stonehill Krauss took over for David mlin now the head coach at Dartmouth who just came in and beat Boston College in this building a couple of weeks ago yeah really seemless transition right he goes from player to assisant coach elevates to the head job and oversees that transition always helps when you have sort of a programed guy right whos able to oversee that transition because you know hes obviously been through the good times knows what they look like and you know still a young coach on the rise so Boston College again that shot from Fred Payne took this from what could have been a twopoint game to five Stonehill really hung in without brogna without making shots heres a good one from Donald T made the first shot of the first half and does the same here in the second yeah itll be interesting to see what the mentality is early on offensively for BC they look to attack or if they stay a little bit more passive great pointer no good from Nesbit rebound available and its Donald H who has really been a good rebounder this year eight per game as venning lost the handle on it the foul on Ethan muser who missed a lot of that first half due to foul trouble and immediately gets his third yeah this is going to be a problem early on here from users as you see the nice free throw line Jumper by hand just gets to his spot elevates over the defender now M are going to have to take an early seat as well you could see it was a problem when he had to come out Stonehill gave up a little bit more space around the rim led to some check Second Chance points for BC as well venning drives venning good one off the window just using his size and strength there he has seven yeah I think you want to operate through vening right now if your BC especially because if brogno is going to defend him on the other side chance to draw an early third foul there well see if Boston College tries to deny it br whos so impactful in that first half he spins not an A look though and Elijah strong on the run out strong to the basket good take and a quick time out for Stonehill well Boston College good momentum at of the halftime break they score the first six and build the lead to 11 Music point lead for Boston College and a couple of really key baskets coming out of the break good momentum early starting with Benning well seems pretty clear what the discussion was in the halftime locker room from Earl Grant was lets get our nose dirty lets go to the rim and lets take advantage of our strength inside especially if they get that early third foul on muser which they did and so right away BC attacking the basket and getting rewarded for it so a 6 nothing run to start the second half if you go back to the Pain Three its a 90 run in game for Boston College after Stonehill cut it to two strong with the block but count Applause it again its brocka just going right to the basket he now has 16 yeah nice little spin move and youll see strong wants this review but this is clearly off the backboard before strong strong makes contact with it smart play by broget getting it off the window Music quickly strong reaching for it tip somewhere itll stay here clearly want to get Elijah strong more involved 0 for two in the first half just one rebound for a guy who plays so much for BC got to get some more production out of him heres Beetle Benning goes inside for strong Elijah spinning turning left hand no credit Simona did well defending there in the low block gave ground but still forced strong into a tough jump hook brogna tried to go left and a reach in foul called against Boston College it was a pretty simple game right now that stonehills playing with brogna theyre just screening on to a smaller guard and letting him go to work in the low post and right now BC is sort of giving up that matchup and I think willing to try to defend it you see Beetle get switched on just a little too much contact for the officiating crew now vening wants him this is where bronna will try to take advantage with the outside shot so that goal tending call sna the nine nothing Applause run down to three to shoot got to go Simona couldnt get it off good defense from Elijah strong he stay down on the pump fake Dion Brown was open instead he drives right to the bucket got the rebound first two of the game for Dion Brown play its nice effort getting his own Miss and putting it back up almost would like to see him shoot that corner three though still trying to find his game early on in the season someone that Boston College was very excited about hes doing a lot of the little things though he does get those two points theres the block first from strong yeah I think you like the effort obviously you know sees the defender running at him feels like theres going to be a path to the rim meets a couple Defenders and good second effort but again for a guy whos you know searching for his offensive game you feel like you want to see him show confidence in that jump shot even if his natural tendency is to attack hes averaging six points a game last year remember the first team All America East selection last year at Applause UNBC St forced deep into the timer quite a bit today forced to bring muser back as well playing with three fouls heres Kofi for three Herman Kofi the necs leading scorer among freshman and he has his first points of the game on the three a big bucket there for Stonehill thats got to be part of the recipe I think Skyhawks came out early looking to shoot sort of play that three for two game a little bit I would like to see them get back to that now that BCs made some adjustments on brogna yeah we keep saying theyve hung in heres Brown for three and that is good well theres a confident stroke from Dion Brown he has five beautiful tandem work between he inventing their Inside Out offense a double down on venning that leaves brown open good take there on the Applause three ragna on the handoff baates is good tough shot off balance I was going to say the one thing that we hadnt seen from Stonehill as much as we keep saying all right theyre hanging in was at some point the shots had to start to fall and now thats two in a row made for Stonehill interrupted by the Dion Brown three and now the problems have started to come on the defensive end as DCs offensive confidence has grown a little bit Beetle to his left taken away but it hit the timeline and is that of bounds so Boston College of 46 37 but ston Hill continues to hang in there the Freshman Hermon Kofi from Quebec from Music Deep from a little bit earlier on Elijah strong and they did just take a peak to be sure and indeed they did get one right today good to see they brought their sense of humor today venning up and good so they beating Chad venning here in this second half Boston College back up 11 you see what made him such a threat last year with the Bonnies great touch around the Applause rim an 11point lead for Boston College and that is Tipp by strong wise decision by Alex Bates to let that go he said over this last little stretch Stonehill hanging around hanging around they started feels like the word right hanging in but can they make enough shots cuz Boston College is doing that on the other side BC is six for eight from the floor in this second half follow up good good job by Ethan muser to find the rebound he its five thats the question right so in the first half they were hanging around over those final few minutes because of the defense they were getting stops now theyre trying to hang around in a different way by making shots but theyre not getting enough stops to really make any Hy in this game entrance for venning nearly lost the handle and is blocked well thats why they need user in the game had to play in foul trouble all day Stinson all the way in no good defense by Brown and Boston College with numbers the other way Brown on a bounce pass to the corner extra feed for strong he gives it up again for Donald H it felt like strong had a shot there on the three maybe got it to hand out the corner of beatley beetle Drive stops to the corner for Deion Brown whos no good another good threepoint look this time it doesnt go hell take that good setup from Beetle good look for brown cant ask for much more than a good shot attempt too high on the pass Che back into the game for the interesting here they had Beetle sort of running the point doesnt necessarily feel like thats his natural spot obviously a guy who likes to have the ball in his hands but it feels like when he does he looks more to score rather than set up Chaz Kelly the opposite of that but hes been the one doing the scoring there is Elijah strong goes up and is fouled thats another one on user into Boston Colleges credit theyve gone right after number 33 and he now has four fouls with still more than 13 minutes remaining yeah Stonehill knew they needed him back in there for their defense especially once BC started to operate underneath through strong inventing and ultimately strong just 2kg knowing how to draw that contact hes got you know a good variety of moves down around the rim some good shoulder fakes some head fakes good footwork and see hes definitely put the time in practice over the last couple years to develop his low post game well Elijah strong this is not the first time weve seen one of these remember he did not score in the first half against Dartmouth and then found 18 all in the second half of that game and he wears his emotions on his sleeve quite literally as you hear him yell out after missing the second free throw sometimes its good to have a guy like that though an Energizer on this Boston College team ragna going inside and they called a block strong yeah he was trying to sell the the charge there and may have sold it a little too hard thats three on Elijah strong the the Eagles one sometimes it depends on the officials angle right do they see that level of arm extension well and it was called for the official on the low block as well so was behind strong nbit for three thats big one Amir Nesbit hes performed really well in these games against Power Six opponents averaging 11 points per game against Notre Dame Providence and Marette in those three games this year and he is five today a guy who has the ball in his hands a lot sometimes has to make tough plays and does he take by Donald Han Jor up to eight points and remember Stonehill is doing this without Josh Morgan today the grad student and leading scorer for the Skyhawks he out with an ankle injury threepointer Simona no but what a job by brogna to get the offensive rebound and the foul on Chaz Kellys Morgan they say theyre doing it without him but theyre also not getting a lot from brogon this second half just two points just two points and just two attempts Austin college has done a good job Den L Simona the basket blocked Big Time rejection and the Eagles now on the Run hands to his left kicks for Chaz Kelly pass it up floater Applause good that was a frantic sequence that the Eagles calmed quite well to get the lead back to 11 yeah nice composure by The Duo of Kelly in hand in transition keep that ball moving quickly but get to your spot find the right shot ragna against the double team and theres nowhere to go Hastings again but it ends up with Simona got it back in for brogna and he finds a bucket 18 for brogna too shy of a career high again just trying to go too quickly in transition that time in nice hands by Simona and the Eagles offense continues to be excellent 8 of 12 in this second half Stonehill six of 14 McFarland brown brown spinning to his right Dion Brown good work seven in the second half for Dion Brown you see the quick footwork by Brown inside gets to his spot nice quick turn to shake his Man Applause Loose good an offensive day for Boston College theres six of their last eight from the floor they were desperately in need of it 55 overall from the floor tie up jump ball and possession to Boston College Chaz Kelly earns the tieup at Boston College with an 11point lead theyve been active defensively as Hastings on the rejection and Kelly with his best offensive game of the year had coaching job one day is just I love being in the gym and this is a way to get back in the gym he has been such a valuable asset for Chris Krauss to have on the sidelines this year well certainly knows what its like to to coach at this level especially with a small program trying to make some big waves trying to build a program as well Dion Brown what a take so maybe one of the better halfs of the Year here for Dion Brown offensively nine points hes onepoint shy of a season high and Bon has their largest lead in the while turnaround shot nezbit finds the Roll Another solid game against a power 16 for Nesbit who has seven and again Stonehill starting to find some Rhythm offensively starting to make some shots illbe in some tough ones they got to find a way to anchor down here defensively McFarland open for three little strong Hastings with a big offensive rebound how about that in a ton of traffic Jaden Hastings has for just looking like a man amongst boys there keeping the ball alive against two three Stonehill players eventually Gathering it going up strong Hastings getting some time here in this second half in a key moment Stinson on the drive the foul before the Applause block Stonehill looking for an n one I think they were maybe asking if it was a goal tent but first the put back on the other side Jaden Hastings as we said red shirted last year former fourstar recruit from IMG Academy you certainly see the flashes here lets see it was close certainly not off the backboard like the earlier go question is is that ball on its way down did it already get past the Apex I think its pretty much right there at the high point that last foul was Chaz Kellys third by the way Austin Colleges leading scorer today with 12 points so Stinson whos a 60 free throw shooter this year but is six for six today G Stonehill continuing to hang close within contact but can they get enough defens stops against an Eagles team shooting 70 from the floor in the second half Brown drives hes feeling it right now and the follow no good for Hastings just slipped out of his grasp as he went to throw it down but have taken a roof off this place user by the way is in there playing with four fouls for Stonehill something to watch 33 in purple brogna lost the handle Deon Brown On The Run beat everybody and then the back play by Stinson blocks it clean it looked like he beat everybody down the floor and then he kind of just stopped enough for Stonehill to catch up yeah I dont know if hes trying to draw a foul there by throwing the brakes on I mean again youve got to step just Elevate and go right through the rims Stinson gets right to the basket he has eight BC has missed their last four from the floor and its back to single digits now heres the push that Stone Hill needed not necessarily how you would have diagrammed the stops that theyre getting but theyre getting them Kelly turned over Simona out front against hand and Hastings there again fair to say he affected that shot I would say itll stay here when we come back 746 to go in the second Skyhawks trying to make a push and they find their way back in all right BC Music is well certainly you hope that this is the start of a little bit of a breakout stretch for him so its a ninepoint game as we return here with under eight minutes remaining nice takeway by Fred pay and a big moment Brown got caught in a little bit of traffic yeah got put in a tough spot there off the pass did well to keep his dribble entrance for venning to his right venning up venning strong take yeah this is Chad venning time right now if youre BC you missed your last four shots get your starters for the most part back out there go back inside M are not on the floor so let venning do his thing entrance brogna wide open way too easy and he ties his career high with 20 points if youre going to front the post like that defensively you got to have help behind no help that time easy lob easy finish for brog had 20 in the opener this year against Framingham State and now he has it at kti for him this a little bit of a different level no offense to the Rams venning double team comes needs help three to shoot Brown got to go and it was enough time for pay to put it in how do you like that brown actually probably had another beat but because he launched when he did there was enough time for Fred Payne and the take by Nesbit rolls off well how about Payne doing the right thing and just sort of staying home I mean if he recognizes that the shot clock is winding down a lot of times you see a guy throw up a prayer you just start trotting back on defense and this time pay stays home right under the basket and has the presence of mind to get his fingertips to that ball it was often plenty of Applause time eight points now for nesit well Fred Payne weve seen more and more minutes at this time of the game go back to November 19th last seven games coming in today averaging about 17 minutes a game scored 10 plus for those seven some increases for the sophomore who miss most of last season 10point game pain is stripped good anticipation of the pass by Stinson and he get its all the way in got his own rebound off the Miss and a jump ball will keep possession here to try to run a twoman game with pain and vending on the offensive end Stinson does a good job sort of keeping it halfway recognizes when the pass is coming takes it away and then again sees parting Stonehill spreading the floor in transition allows Stinson all the way in user still out there with four fouls brogna against venning brogna gives it up five to shoot Nesbit big bounce off the Miss and a foul called against Kofi well and thats one of the things you love about what Dion Brown brings to the table I mean hes arguably the smallest guy in this force him going up for the rebound and yet hes the one who comes down with it its those little things that can make all the difference and its those little things that have really kept him as a key part of the rotation even when hes not giving you the scoring that you would necessarily hope to get or maybe it expected going into the year but sometimes roles adapt and change one thing Boston College can do their guards can rebound the basketball weve seen it with brown weve seen it with McFarland weve seen it with Donald T sto thought a long time about it one too many Donald hand of course hes averaging eight rebounds per game which is 10th nationally among guards well thats really going to come to light the further you get an ACC play right because thats going to be such a big key to trying to get Second Chance opportunities Beetle was trying to get it back to Brown but nowhere to go under five to go its a 10point game stonehills gotten to nine a bunch have not been able to get closer can they do it here Stinson against Deion Brown muser for three thats a big shot playing with four fouls Ethan muser close as theyve been in a while nearly a walk there from strong and you got to find him on this in brown drives double team comes venning for three no pay had a piece of the rebound but couldnt secure it I dont think thats the shot you want if youre Boston College you want venning underneath the rim right now if theyre going to defend him with muser you can draw that fifth Bou if theyre going to defend him with bronna you have to like that match up in the low post muser with 11 to shoot its Nesbit against Elijah strong Benning nearly had a strip muser throws it up and he hits Ethan muser with back to back threes its a fourpoint game with under four to go Bo credit muser a guy whos been in and out in and out in and out because of the foul situation and comes up with two Dynamite shots the first one by Design the second one little bit of accidental offense certainly caught a to break his venting slip but strong was right in his face and he just Chucks it up and finds nothing but n seven points in a row six of them from Ethan muser we got a finish for you folks come on Music back s youre in and out for brief stretches like hes been this entire ball game but they find him at Key moments late he comes up with a couple big daggers now the question is how does BC respond out of this timeout their last couple offens of possessions have really been wanting nearly 3 minutes without a point for BC tie up B entry pass I dont know if that was deflected kelly didnt get the wrap that he wanted to spin it into venning does stay here Donald hand is back in the game by the way for Boston College lets see if that got deflected I think it had to have just based on the angle it took yeah it might have gone off the toe of Stinson just wasnt called a kick again thats one of those you got to get some English on the ball wrap it around and off for Kelly from venning Kelly trying to throw it up literally strong finds that he still has time good take from strong thats some bailout offense there again right idea attacking the basket but Kelly just gets himself in no mans landay delay of game warning was given to Boston College after that basket but strong with a important take and just knowing how much time he had as he said because it did not hit the rim so now Stonehill more magic to be had brogna for three little short it was a good look but it was not there for brogna who stays on 20 points to today with under three to go thats where teams have victimized BC in the past that pick and pop play with venning and drives saw a burst and his fell Kofi had to play Applause catchup now this is exactly why you have Donald hand out there guy can just put the ball in his hands and trust him to make a play line after strong makes the basket to get Boston College back up six and hand whos an excellent free throw shooter to try to add a little bit more Applause space 88 on the season from the foul line second best in the ACC and he makes two big ones so Hand up to 10 points DC has scored four points in a row out of that timeout got the lead back to eight Stinson against strong nowhere to go needs help does get it off to brogna unsettled sequence now for Stonehill brogna for three he got it again unsettled but pick and pop Le close out again and brogna delivers and then a tie up before the ball was even inbounded Stinson tripping up Kelly there its only the fifth foul theres the threepointer from brogno is a new career high 23 points nine of 15 from the floor today with three threepoint makes the necs leader in threepoint percentage its been a good shooting day for the Skyhawks over 40 from three and that was something in the early stages BC had won six of their first seven they were keeping opponents under 30 from behind the arc Elly gets a double team finds venning no follow for venning Applause yes almost lost his balance it looked like on the first attempt but then he does a good job on the second 13 points for Benning eight in the second half other end another three Hermon Kofi and the Skyhawks will not go away well not as long as they keep getting good looks from outside again and remember the Skyhawks down their leading scorer Josh Morgan today within four and the trap is on Brown gets it across got to come to the middle of the floor there when you see your man trapped Stonehill does have a foul to Music give 112 remaining for to shoot hand for three short rebound Stonehill with 105 to go down by four not a look inside on that possession for BC all the way down on the timer and they got the three for hands under a minute to go Applause DC is led by as much as 13 Nesbit against venning with six to shoot Stinson driv Stinson no it was a good look and it didnt go he got a foul yep youll take that look yeah absolutely it was a good look in the end I still dont think its what Stonehill really wanted on that play I think they wanted brogna against Kelly in the low post youll see off the switch here brogna takes Kelly with him neid hands it off Stinsons able to turn the corner and credit Kelly for not going with him which would have opened brogna as you said on the backside for that little pass he absolutely asked to stay home there so that was the sixth team foul against Stonehill it went on Nesbit heit going to play it out defensively Brown taken away by Stinson and then hand commits the foul oh no and ston Hill with life Donald thats his first person thats the only thing you could not have if youre BC there you could not turn the basketball over its one again where they make the play but you didnt give it away yep dont need to keep your dribble at that point once youre across the timeline let the trap come and find your outlet just had to slow things down and there have been a couple times not just today but over the course of this season where it feels like BC has gotten too sped up for its own Music good so now with 303 remaining in this second half its a 6965 game what a job by Stonehill continuing to stay in Music it you know fortunately Eric is is hand committing that foul that was the last one that BC had to give so the good news for the Eagles that you dont put Stonehill at the line in that situation remember it was a 10point game with 605 left and we went a while without a basket before user hit those back to back threes to bring it to four and weve held a out there and even just moments ago Boston College got it to 6962 and Stonehill off the three from Kofi and here we are its brogna gets by brogna right to the basket again communication break down on the defensive end venning not knowing whether to switch or stay and nobody stays at home on brogna good quick reverse they needed to get a bucket right out of the gate he has 25 points fast ball for hand timer is off got a foul and Stonehill does in a twopoint game with 167 left wow third foul on NB well I know this was a close game two years ago know less than 10 points pretty much the entire way but I dont know that even if you gave Chris Krauss some truth serum he would think hed be in a one possession game with under 20 seconds left here at kti without Josh Morgan exactly whos 15 points a game for Stonehill hand is the guy that Boston College would want at the Applause line and Chris Krauss will try to ice the 88 free throw shooter well that was the important one but this first and foremost you trust him to make this free throw and then just try to play it out from there 167 to go hand for a fourpoint lead and he does make six for six at the line today for Donald H Nesbit against strong Nesbit all the way in and got it too easy again no help he has 10 for the fourth time against a power six opponent this here now you need the turnover 74 to go inbound to strong and they Applause fou its brogna who commits his third with 58 left the tough part here is the Skyhawks are out of timeouts now so even if strong only makes one of two you dont have a lot of time to get the ball up the floor theyre going to leave Nesbit back unlike hand if youre Stonehill youd rather have someone other than hand at the line and its Eliza strong who is a 68 free throw shooter he is one for two today with 58 to go Boston College does have a timeout by the way should they need it Stonehill does not front end good take a big deep breath right now if youre Elijah strong he told us he does this on every free throw he takes no matter the situation imagining hes back home as a kid in his backyard the lights a touch brighter right now and he can make this a twopossession Applause game big couple of makes for Elijah strong ston Hills got to go quick its out of bounds stepped on the out of bounds line with 29 to Applause go we feel some heavy size think coming from that PC bench I think the whole building got to get it in they do and this game is over Boston College survives a major comeback from the Skyhawks
