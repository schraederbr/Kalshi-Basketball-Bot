rebounding of the Cavaliers Couple of story lines well keep track of here today Are they going to be critical of that And then its a problem His the length of the front line could give him trouble if he gets too deep in the paint Here at the home of the Charlotte Hornets we are underway And I love the baby blues for the Dayton Flyers They call them their Chapel Blue uniforms Theyve got the basketball first and on a back door cut A beautiful set Jordan Jerkack the assist Montgomery coming off his careerhigh performance against DTSU as the first two of the afternoon Great set play to start with a back door cut taking advantage of Virginia Virginia defensively they dont force a lot of turnovers but they do pressure the basketball a lot trying to speed you up so they can get back and put pressure on you on the offensive end of the floor as well Virginias coming off its best performance of the year as Hall is followed by Durkat The Whos on Wednesday in the ACC SEC challenge went to Austin and hammered the Longhorns 8869 They shot it especially well 12 of 24 from the ark And it really bodess well for the future this season for the Cavs if they can play like that Yeah thats their their superpower They got multiple shooters on the floor They can space you with all five guys and then they let Tester directly there attack you at the rim and you cant help much on them because of the shooting ability around Amayel Laton with the basketball as now Dayton brings it up Theres the same starting five weve been accustomed to this year in the first nine now 10 games of the year for the Flyers Called by the way was on Durkak at the other end Theres another terrific cut and another find Bennetts got his first two off the feed from Laton Great job by Dayton coming out taking advantage of the pressure defense of Virginia How about the attack by St Louis and a better response defensively by Dayton We talk about rim protection you think of Virginia from Tong there at the rim using his length Virginia comes in second in the nation in block shots averaging over seven a game and Daytons been up to the task here to start Latong averages 12 Hes the best rim protector for Dayton on the possession arrow Virginia keeps the cheering basketball Nice defensive pressure inside Here come the Flyers again on top early Four nothing Taken away by Don Hall on the run out Ditter throws it down The 22yearold freshman from Belgium averaging nearly 18 per game has the Cavaliers on the board States game plan is to get one limit Virginia to one shot Rebounded to get out push tempo that time last possession just a little too fast and turnover led to an easy basket for Virginia Durk tries to make the pass a little behind Lon and its a Dayton turnover on the sideline Its a turnover Sam Lewis received that pass and stepped out of bounds After the turnover here turning defense into offense They play fast They usually dont turn you over The Ritter wont get an easier basket than that Break the scoring drought here for Virginia to start the game Why do you think coach Ryan ODM takes test Ritter out of the game just two minutes in I think one just two to settle them down Each team with two turnovers in the early going 42 is our score Screen by Keante Jones Tong trying to find Jones His pass hits the underbelly of the backboard So its a turnover Their third of the day And there is Ryan Odum in his first year as head coach of the Cavaliers And its an entirely new roster Theyve only got four points returning from last years team Completely revamped Boster and ODM did a great job He and his staff did a great job in the portal Really value shooting the basketball and theyre playing with a lot of pace Theyre theyre fouling a lot and Dayton isnt the team that you want to have that problem And well see if they can resolve those issues and just force turnovers Theyve done a great job here in the opening three minutes Yeah the bench has gotten a little longer with the return of Devin Tillis He missed the first four games with a knee injury He made his UVA debut at the Greenbryer against Northwestern And Tillis has come into the game and hes another older guy who brings experience and a physicality to this UVA team Hey the ex UV Irvine and theres a connection there back to his wake days growing up and Turner there does a great job with that program So couldnt play for Turner and I know he had no problem with him going to Brian Od Long rebounds tracked down by Malik Thomas attacks again and lays it in absorbs the contact and the former USC Trojan and San Francisco Dawn has tied the game at four Youre worried about Virginia shooting and they spread you out so much The driving opportunities are there Theres the former Dayton Flyer Anthony Grant class of 1987 in his eighth year as head coach at his alma mater And he has this team as one of the better threats in a deep Atlantic 10 conference this year He does Ive had four teams in that league and Ive been impressed with every one of them St Bonnie VCU and St Louis 18 to me looks really strong Looks more than a one bit league at this point in the season And Dayton has already beat two Big East teams Durkat leaves his feet and its another turnover All of Virginias points so far have come off of turnovers Fight for the basketball and we finally got a whistle and a foul call cheering And you know in this neutral sight game its hard to tell where the booing is necessarily coming from Weve got a lot of Dayton fans and of course with the Virginia football team in town to play in the ACC football championship tonight the Cavaliers are very well represented Also theres no question who was disappointed with that call Thats Virginia has the luxury with the ACC championship game being played this afternoon So youre saying they were saying boo and not who I very sure that was a boo They didnt like the call They they wont like anything against the Wahoos today Lewis picks up the personal foul Long rebound comes to Virginia The Cavs have numbers if they hurry Tillis into the corner Gives it up to Thomas from the midrange Puts it in and Virginia has its first lead Concern you got to have for Dayton is Virginia teams plays with pace but they dont force turnovers And they forced Dayton into some early turnovers here and gotten their offense going And eventually the offense is going to click You dont need to give him any help taking care not taking care of the basketball Flyers have gone more than three minutes without a point Good defense by the freshman Chance Mallalerie trying to stay with Javon Bennett Durk again into the lane He is fouled by Thomas and will shoot a pair of free throws When we come back the in this game here today another opportunity at a neutral site to play a power conference opponent I dont know why more teams dont do it I mean these type of games do not hurt you come March They can only help you And but again we talked about I think the A10 is is really strong and looking more than just a one bit league at this point early in the year This is Jordan Durkak at the line a senior from Colonia New Jersey Played a couple of years at Marramac He actually was in the same recruiting class at Marramac as Javon Bennett They have come back together And Bennett helped to recruit Durk after he was leaving Ruters And theres his old teammate current teammate Bennett grabbing the missed free throw Melvin Thomas has come in Three ball by Montgomery misses the mark Tester Ditter back into the game for UVA Also see Jakari White Hes number six in white with a white headband Ditter misfires Dayton back the other way trailing by a point Yeah this is the pace Virginia wants to play at They want to get up and down Thomas for three The former Villanova Wildcat whose dad played nine years in the NBA out of Syracuse Satan Thomas Oneno the senior from Nigeria has Virginia back tied at eight Great job attacking the pressure Dayton scores Theyll youll see them switch so many defenses Theyll run a one two one p full pressure manto man 221 You dont spend time thinking about how to attack it You just got to get it out and get aggressive Bennett over Onienzo The rebound goes out of bounds Back to Virginia Well it is something how Virginia has changed its entire DNA with the new head coach Ryan Odum And the most stark contrast in is in pace of play The fact that UVA is getting up and down and putting 80 points on the board every game it takes a while to get your head around that It is It used to be the first to 60 They were controlling tempo and pace It is completely flipped Fun to watch spreading you out Averaging nearly 87 points a game Montgomery with the takeaway and the flush Great job there getting to the passing lane This is how Dayton wants to play Pressure the basketballs speed you up You dont know what type of defensive pressure theyre going to apply And theyll even mix it up and fall back to a zone as well Derritter challenged at the rim and he missed it Nice shot defensively by Bryce Herd to go up straight Back at the other end Thomas went toward the rim with bad intentions Odeno met him Here comes White who lost his footing Dayton has a clear run out and the windmill by Malcolm Thomas cheering applause An elite dunker who during his time at Villanova won a slam dunk competition Showing off his stuff here early this afternoon in Charlotte He is awake We were worried ABOUT A NOON TIP BUT guys be ready to play The energy and effort is here today Getting in the passing lane here by Montgomery Coming in dunking it with the right hand And Thomas getting into the act with the windmill Getting rewarded for a little cherry picking laughter I got no problem with cherry picking Not at all Well apparently Malcolm had to reach out personally to Obie Topphen to get permission to wear that number one uniform Hes the first since Obi left Dayton went out of the NBA to wear it as Onienzo makes the first free throw What do you make of all the turnovers both ways so far Randolph cheering I would be concerned if Im dating and they have to take care of the basketball Youre always concerned about Virginia Virginias trying to speed you up But at that center spot now Glos coming back in the game they have rim protection So its not just beating your defender Theyre in drop coverage got to continue to take advantage of that But its a surprise for both teams I think both teams have done a fairly good job of taking care of the basketball Dayton with their DNA theyre more reliant upon pressure and forcing 17 tournaments a game Thats going to go against Thomas As we talked about I think itll be a ton of fouls called in this game We were joking with the SID of Virginia Sometimes they filed and they hadnt wanted to and Dayton fouls because of the pressures they put on you The efforts going to be there The energy is going to be there These are two physical teams and both teams know how hard in this game is and they need it with the basketball Chance Mallerie the terrific freshman from right there in Charlottesville Virginia Coming off an excellent game in the win over Texas Derritter misfires out of bounds to Dayton I love to see the zone Most teams are afraid to play teams with zone when they got good shooting That time Dayton goes to the 131 The key is can they rebound here They got a dead ball rebound there Got to try to come away with clean rebounds so they can set their offense Well how many different defenses should we expect today out of the Flyers You you cant count I wouldnt imagine if Coach Grant created one He might have he might have put it in boxing one or triangle two in this game You never know You got to prepare for everything Just know its going to be manzone mixture fullourt pressure and when they score fullourt pressure is coming Herd puts it in to give the Flyers a fourpoint lead Just over 8 minutes in here in Charlotte North Carolina Ditter swings it Mallerie a little short Strong rebound by Malcolm Thomas Every bit of 68 220 Dayton shot the basketball well so far today Six out of 10 Foul drawn on the drive And Jeff McInness And the crossover and something thats brought up every single day in your life which is fine But I found interesting He asked you uh about did you score 35 or 40 in each particular game and you seemed like you didnt know how many you scored each of those games I said I knew the total I knew it was 107 I didnt know what the breakdown was The only argument that Ryan and I have is is Im considered the third son of the ODMS But Im older than him So I consider myself the second and him the third He kind of refutes it and says Im Im third So thats about the only argument we have going back and forth And I wont put coach O on the spot I got to go with him because youre like the interloper to the family Well Im the one that they wouldnt allow him to hang out with laughter Thats called good parenting Yeah Yeah Maybe thats it With Randolph Childris Im Doug Sherman back in There are advantages to being an accomplished coachs son He did not take the short path to the ACC He didnt get a power conference job until he was in his 50s No hes earned it Hes earned his way to the top and thats why hes so respected Its Hes done it differently And I can tell you Ive been on many of chats with his dad pleading for him to change things and Ryan has done it his way And hes been uber successful doing it his way Really proud of him Well his Cavaliers down 15 to 10 9 minutes in in this nonconference matchup at the Spectrum Center in downtown Charlotte North Carolina Well I guess they call it Uptown Charlotte Uptown trying to join you Southerners to figure out exactly where I am Well get you there You just move down here Well get you there Johan Bruno the freshman from Germany with his first bucket And that awakens the crowd cheering rooting for the University of Virginia Both of these big Ronaldo and Laton both are capable of stretching the floor And I think the threepoint shooting between those two guys is critical because it lifts them out of the from the paint No rim protection otherwise on either side when theyre not in the game And I think its be really critical more so for UV I mean for Dayton Now Grunlow is now six of 17 from three this year Lang only three of 14 coming into the game That is the matchup as the ball screen is set by Laton on the pick and pop He tries to put it on the floor Lost the handle Durkak picks it up Now lets see if he tries to attack on the switch Its another bad pass by Jordan Durkak Its a really bad turnover there You had the switch inside You wanted tried to force it End up creating a turnover when you had the mismatch inside No need to force it Just let it happen organically Bruno spotting up Durkat gets tied up with Thomas and weve got a foul call Itll be a war when that shot goes up A lot of bodies fronted in each other there And really critical for Dayton to try to get rebounds clean And I think we got our answer I think this is a pro wahoo crowd here No doubt about it But I Randolph I love the intensity that weve seen And you do talk about neutral sight game noon tip off Both these teams got to town relatively late Didnt have an opportunity yesterday because of a concert in the building to have a practice here But this building is energized and the players are going hard Theyre taking on the identity and personality of their coaches Theyre ready to play These are two really good teams Virginias tired of hearing about Dayton and their fullcourt pressure and theyre setting the tone on the defensive end with their pressure and Daytons tired of hearing about UVA and their rebounding and theyre demanding of theyre fighting their physical Theyre rebounding the basketball right now So both both teams are cheering accepting the challenge here early Quick to the basket Javon Bennett 1713 Flyers Jakari White into the corner Sam Lewis pulls up on the midrange under control for the two You wont see many of those but that was a great decision there Good ball fake The one more pass on the easy one dribble pull up I just love to see no over penetration Yes Bennett can ski 510 You saw him get up to save that pass He is an acrobat going to the basket this time though Trailed by Gumla who averages three blocks per game Swats it out of bounds Yeah thats an opportunity there Bennetts got to spray that to the corner Did a great job of beating the ball screen defense and forced the rotation Hes got to spray that Theres no weak no one left on the weak side Just five on the timer as Durkak is given the responsibility of getting the basketball in UVAs other sevenfooter and other terrific shot blocker Onenso comes back in Grunlo will take a seat Ono is trying to erase everything inside And again I think its critical of the tong to try to spread him out stretch the defense Tillis poked the pass away out of bounds Dayton will have it on the other side of the basket now with 48 on the shot clock Bennett rises and fires Jakari White picks the rebound away Bullet pass inside And the former Brigham Young Cougar Don Hall has his first two points We are tied at 17 When you take baseline JUMPERS YOU GOT TO GET BACK AND NO ONE GOT BACK FROM THE FLYERS THERE They punished got punished for it in the transition offense by the Wahoos cheering Tillos on the reach in the Booze have turned to whos and now back to Booze If I can interpret for you Virginias really getting out there defensively again havent been great at forcing turnovers all year but they have been active here forcing six turnovers out of Flyers and theyve gotten out in transition Theyve struggled in the half court gives to Durk cheering off the screen Bennett looking to go to work on the switch Shes got Tillis stepping out Bennett step back long two off the front iron Fight for the ball Comes to Virginia cheering applause Mallerie absorbs the contact and its a held ball Wow Well I tell you what Javon Bennett is about as sticky as a defender as youre going to find in the country Hes showing you why hes on the all defensive team in the A10 there Great job tying up Valyri there on the drive Thats a big matchup I mean coach ODM even told us he said he considers Chance Mallerie a a starter and hes like who wins that matchup between these two small guards That little battle there was won by Bennett Well Bennetts only 165 but hes not afraid to stick his nose in there As a freshman at Marramac he led the country in steals He had 99 steals as a rookie in college hoops on the post entry Durkac was fouled by Dalon Hall Hes not so sure The Whos are in for a fight here this afternoon with the fly Remember that history between the Tar Heels and the Hoya MJ and Eddie I think Ive been as impressed with Kansas more than any team in college basketball Losing a star maybe the number one pick in the NBA draft and Darren Peterson and they havent missed a beat I cant imagine theres theyre ceiling when he comes back and I think Carolina has another ele step that they can take as well with Seth Trumble gets back from his broken hand Yeah I was really impressed with what they did in Vegas without him You know losing a player like that and on the fly they didnt seem to miss a beat Not at all Not at all Bills reminding everyone hes as good as anyone in this business How does Virginia get Derritter going I think hes settled too much You see thats more of what he is Hes a big physical frontline guy Catching it on traffic putting it on the deck driving you I think thats his strength I think hes settled too much on the perimeter to start this game And I think thats why Oden took him out and say Hey lets lets do what we do well get in the paint get it on the glass rebound and play inside out And he told us yesterday after practice he was battling with Jabari Parker Yeah Before coming to UVA to play college ball So that gives you an idea He was playing 30yearold men former number two overall pick in the NBA draft And now Ditter is playing at a different level Hes I just asked him How was the transition He was like Man I played against Jabari Parker Now Im coming here playing against these guys you know hes like its just a little bit easier playing against this level of competition than that guy Well the NCAA determined that given his combination of age he turns 23 in January and previous professional experience in Spain that he has two years of eligibility Now that doesnt mean hes going to be in Charlottesville for two years He was projected as a potential second round pick had he gone into the draft in 25 but I know Ryan ODM and his staff would love to have Tester Ritter around for those two full seasons Well have a decision to make I think the feedback that he gets this year hes allowed the freedom to show you his perimeter skills are I think thats where his game will be judged at on the next level Well he came into this game making 47 of his threes Missed his first two attempts so far here today His percentages are good Excuse me His percentages are good He doesnt take a lot I think thats what hes going to have to learn and adjust to With the shot clock under one the runner is missed Thomas back the other way for Virginia Onenso plays catch with him Back to Derritter Oneno had good size and shape inside on Thomas Didnt get the pass Now Derritter posting up off the switch Doesnt try to take advantage Ditter again from the short corner Good ball movement by Virginia to get a good look and the Whos retake the lead Look thats how he gets going gets inside punished the switch Double team comes and the ball comes back to him Nice set from the right wing draws the foul for Dayton You put this one up and you show the entire team This is how you win a lot of basketball games Just unselfish play across the board and the guy who starts it gets rewarded for his unselfishness Eight team foul against Virginia and itll send Malcolm Thomas to the line Young man who was homeschooled up until he attended to Math Catholic in DC Apparently his mom Nicole handled math and science His father Itan taught him history and English Yeah I know his dad I got to I got to I got to call his dads bluff on that one I think mom does all the work on that one I might he I might get a text refuting this but well his dad a very thoughtful man both father and son are poets really something else Yeah his dad is absolutely amazing guy So whether he had his son looking at a textbook or not hes done a marvelous job teaching his boy he has the ways of life He plays with a level of toughness like his dad Then after the change in coaches at Villanovva after last year after red shirting he decided to switch and come to play for Anthony Grant at Dayton Oansu couldnt handle the pass It goes out of bounds and will stay at this end And you know I love my DMV guys I I with that one I know you do laughter Trying to force it inside Now they say it was Durkak the last to touch Bono was fouled on the shot by Malcolm Thomas Thomas got to avoid those type of fouls That is his second personal You got to protect the first foul Now you put coach Grant in the dilemma Oni Enzo at the line and he gets the shooters roll Well this is the 24th annual womens Jimmy B Classic This year the Hawkeye State rivalry Number 10 Iowa State hosting number 12 Iowa Wednesday night 7 Eastern 6 Central on ESPN the ESPN app Hilton Coliseum and AIM should be rocking And to donate to the V Foundation for Cancer Research go to vorg On the end so two for two from the free throw line And Virginia back in front 2220 Virginias giving Daytona their own medicine there with the fullourt pressure and Durkat calls for it gets it back Under six minutes to go in the half Durk doesnt want to handle the ball Full court pressure against Mallalerie cheering Boy to try and get that shot up and over Oni Enzo is a tall task You got to pull him out of the perimeter Attacking him at the rim gives him total advantage Got to find a way to lift him up Lewis lost it Thomas has it Poked away from him and it goes out of bounds A lot of contact no call cheering And so the Flyers will keep it By the way our officials for this afternoons neutral sight game Ron Groover Clarence Armstrong Tony Chiaza Big time crew for what has shaped up to be a big time game between the Atlantic 10 Conference and the ACC A lot of dribble handoffs and ball screens Got to communicate How you going to defend the ball screens Are you switching right now How you going to be in drop coverage applause Thomas hit one earlier and again the length as they get closer to the rim favors on feeds the post and the Ritter able to fake it in big to big Virginia 24 Dayton 20 See this is why Thomas second foul is critical because you really want to put him on the rear and put your smaller defender on the end zone because hes going to flash in the high post Try to pass into the high low action cheering The Dayton drought continues Their last field goal was at the 9003 mark and now they missed their last seven shots against the UVA defense White thought about it Quick passing Ponenzo banks it in Virginia by six cheering What a boost off the bench from the senior from Nigeria with Oni Enzo You think first defense and shot blocking but we have seen him set up his teammates and score for himself Yeah you fronting the post is automatic there That high low action is a big part of Virginia in the half court You got to pick your poison If you want to front the Ritter is so physical Does a great job of moving his feet sealing sealing you on the high side If you play behind he buries you deep I think this is why I say that the foul on Thomas was big cuz now he has two You cant put him on the rear and risk the third But I would put my smaller defender on the Enzo and live with his ability to score Hell spend more time on the perimeter setting ball screens The Ritter really punishes his four four men and smaller guards on the inside And so Latong the 71 sophomore from France back in out there with Jacob Connor the Marshall transfer the two bigs on the floor currently for Dayton with Durkak at the line Jordan Durkak from a huge basketball family His birthday is March 28th So every year his mom has made him an NCA tournament themed cake And her piece resistance was for his 8th birthday Jordans cake had all 68 team logos from that years field of 68 Thats impressive Thats very impressive That is impressive Had to be a big cake too Absolutely Payton trying to force the turnover Derritter handles it How about that Grunlo then is fouled by Laton Tester Ditter under control breaks the pressure and gets Virginia into a point where they draw a foul Good stuff here in it was Seth who gave Ryan ODM his first job in the coaching industry as a GA at USF and then Ryan would later spend seven years in Blackburg under Uncle Seth He has overcome that Yeah Yeah Hes uh had a different approach to coaching than coach Greenberg You think laughter Seth is a little tougher Ryans got a little laid back to him now Well the twotime ACC coach of the year back in studio watching another member of his coaching tree do well Ryan ODM and his Virginia Cavaliers have gotten hot while Dayton has been cooled off That is their first made bucket since the 943 mark of the first half Benn is just doing a great job that hot You got to get up and get to him on that ball screen Just unable to get to the rim and fall to the shot Simon commits the foul on Mallerie Simon here he does a great job there You see they changed their coverage Theyre not in drop Tried to hedge and recover Bennett is too quick for Mallerie to get back in front of the basketball Well he can put up points averaging 16 per game Hes gone for as many as 30 against FAU in last years NIT One man from Orlando Florida who was underrecruited out of high school went to Marramac and was just marvelous as a freshman and cheering has put together a terrific threeyear career at Dayton Petes got to be happy with this game as well Hes a defensive guy fullcourt pressure guy Hes got to love the fight hes saying from both of these teams here early This is a battle here in the first half Theres some of the numbers on Javon Bennett as his counterpart Chance Mallerie makes a couple of free throws First two points for the freshman out of St Ans Bellefield in Charlottesville You got to throw a lot of bodies at Javon Bennett You got to use length You got to change Right now Mallerie draws the assignment Hes a physical guard even though hes not very tall but you got to put length You got to mix up your defensive coverage Well his granddaddy played football at Virginia Tech and he looks like a football player Chance Mallerie played high school football through his junior year And youre right 510 doesnt matter Hes physical Bennett gets away from him for a moment on the give and go Misses the floater Derritter got a hand on it Simon no Out to Montgomery after the flyby cant knock down the three Shame McGomerys had two good looks here Just both of his attempts early White tough pass And here comes Montgomery Second run out of the afternoon Cant fake the layup though A pocket pick Tillis had it taken away by Bennett who then lost it to White UBA to the freshman And Mallerie delivers Ryan ODM has been waiting for this moment on the defensive end of the floor Theyre playing with a lot of pace The Shane Montgomery with the long arm of the law Its a shame Montgomery didnt care anything about the Virginia defense Take that Wow The junior from Fort Lauderdale with a facial Little Kareem Abdul Jabar Look there for Grunlow Got back to the left shoulder with a skyhook cheering That was Virginias first miss in 8 minutes Boy Montgomery can go right hand left hand Hes coming to dunk on you cheering Doug Heres this just a highlight reel Just tell us get down Hes not done at all Turns the corner with a right hand Punches this one on the footer Man hes got three dunks already This a young man out of Piper High School in Fort Lauderdale He started at Mount St Marys He was the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Rookie of the Year Played last year at Georgia cheering applause I mean here comes off and Virginia Grunlo for the second time theyve changed their coverage Yeah hes talking a little bit here as hes backing up Anthony Grant youre not upset with your guy for that So you get those two points back as Mallerie after the technical foul makes the free throws But man the energy and hes given his team with those last two buckets It almost makes the technical worth it But hes got to know if Dayton wants to pull off this upset Cooler Heads has got to prevail What backto back dunks there by Desane Montgomery Well he has been the energy giver for Anthony Grants team all season long 64 200 and has shown here in the first half Hell dunk on anybody cheering righthanded or lefthanded Hes a really good player and I think hes taking on more responsibility on the defensive end of the floor Offensively hes shooting it better from behind a threepoint line And here gets it back Cole tries to lift his arm up to get through and call for the offensive foul No he doesnt like that call but and Randolph that is his third And so he has gone to the bench with just over a minute to go in the half Bennett spotting up You cant give him room He will do that Its a threepoint game Great play on the baseline out of bounds Mallerie to the corner White spotting up Cory White punishing Dayton defense They never matched up on him He was open the entire time He was shot ready He was waiting and had that pass in his mind before it got there And you can see that game on ABC You got to shave your head if youre going for that look Hes Randolph Childris the Wake Forest Demon Deacon Im Doug Sherman Glad youre with us Bennett wraparound pass Couple of extra passes to Lon Back to Bennett Here its a wedgie applause Yeah Bennett saw Grunlow running out He tried to rush that a little bit to get it off and number three Wahoos defensively are flying around All five guys Its a great defensive possession there for Virginia Derritters pass off the hand of Lewis and the quickness of Bennett Shot clock is off and the Flyers down by six can hold for a final shot Thats a big play here if they can convert Virginia gets it in They have the last shot to create a turnover off the inbound and man you got a chance to dig into this lead Watch the isolation of the ball screen action here after the switch 5 seconds inside Simon lays it in A defensive lapse for Virginia and another turnover Montgomery shot came after the horn So the Whos limp to the locker room with a couple of turnovers and Dayton makes him pay yet still Virginia has a fourpoint lead in this second half What do you think about the uh as they call them Chapel Blue uniforms Dayton is wearing today I love the powder blues man I dont say anything Chapel you know Im not doing that I dont think its a reference to that Chapel Hill Yeah I thought thats what you may have meant No no no Although who knows It could be But it makes me think of uh the old Buffalo Braves or the old San Diego Clippers Okay With these powder blues lets say powder blue baby blue Durkat Hes not afraid to penetrate and get himself at the free throw line Well say this Youre new to the Carolinas When you get that color theres only one school they think about down here So get used to that Those Chapel Hill guys Yeah that was definitely I get it Theres a good look at Jordan Durkac the senior from New Jersey His father Jean was a an 1100 point scorer at FIU and a threeyear roommate of Raja Bell who is by the way Jordans godfather Plays at his own pace You cant speed him up I like to post him inside if you switch a smaller guard on him does a great job using angles using his body Had scored a field goal yet but hes hurt Wahoos from the free throw line Mentioned the basketball family he is from His sister Taylor plays at UMass and his younger brother Aiden is a fourstar recruit in the current SC Next 100 Sam Lewis with his second field goal for Virginia Good pass there by Connell Well theres some of the energy youre going to get from Chance Mallerie I think hes the best allaround guard on the team Talking about Mallalerie here as you see Lewis on the back door cut 7 foot You got to guard him on the perimeter even when hes not making shots His ability to pass screen and roll Both of these starting big for both teams are more skilled than they bring physicality Well what if anything do you make of Mallalerie getting the start Hes been playing starters minutes often and also he and Hall have played together some of the time But do you make anything of Mallalerie getting the call to begin the second half I think its just foul trouble and I think also hes hes had moments and I think he is their best allaround guard Hes playing well I mean hes he brings a dynamic to him Hes changes gears his speed Hes shooting it really well You got to find time for a guy like that And hes embracing that role coming off the bench and he plays like a starter But again with the foul trouble and then hes guarded going against a guy in Javon Bennett and hes constantly attacking You dont need to foul trouble First point today for Lon after being fouled by Grunlow who picked up his second personal foul How does Dayton get Laton more involved He averages 13 per game Hes got just those two points With the bigs that hes going up against he need help from his guards and thats whats going to make the game easy for him He get an open look He just has to continue to be solid continue to try to man the paint Mallerie protected the football like a running back but then his pass was behind Malik Thomas And again the turnovers are an issue You know Dayton turned Cincinnati over 24 times in a game this year They have forced three other opponents into 20 or more turnovers This is what they do And if theyre on their way to doing that against Virginia but thats a good turnover meaning its a dead ball turnover You get to set your defense What you dont want is to pick six turnovers leading numbers in transition Like we have seen repeatedly today especially Deshaine Montgomery with his three slam dunks Bennett on the dribble handoff into the lane A little floater Nothing but net Great play there by Bennett Comes off the drop coverage cheering And again the inbound pass from Derritter Knocked away by Dayton The Flyers continue to make the Whos work for every inch of the floor Man you got a dead ball here You cant run the baseline Virginia has 13 turnovers and Dayton has turned those into 13 points cheering Lewis up ahead and the dunk by Grunlow That is how you handle the little court pressure head is and Virginia has the ball handlers to really hurt Dayton because everyone on the floor can put it on the deck and make decisions So when they do break it theyve been successful punishing the full court pressure but theyve just been burnt by turning it over Bennett works his way into the lane A little fade away left it short Really not a good shot there by Bennett Little fade away there Around and out Everything but the bucket for Thomas Out of bounds Itll stay with Virginia This is what you do You break pressure You got numbers there You always tell your team to attack the rim You get layups and open threes Cant give Dayton pressure any freebies Grunlo at 7 238 lbs played the last couple of years in Germanys top professional league Now off the bench Don Hall with some instant offense is back to a sixpoint lead Did start the second half because of those three fouls He struggled shooting the basketball but I think hes coming out of it Lon traveling Well if youre a Dayton big you know that if you have the ball in the low post you are going to be going against an elite shot blocker no matter what today Yeah I think its best for him to get going But again play off his guards Throwing it inside in the post but the physicality and the length of the two centers for Virginia will give him trouble Dribble hand off ball screens get him rolling to the basket applause Foul on the drive goes against Grun And this is why Hall is so important I think its critical for him to be a part of it because I think hes showing you his level of experience Hes really heady Shots coming around that time He gets the angle Tom doesnt like the call but great job using the rim as shot block By the way Randolph Ive gotten clarification on the Chapel Blue from Doug Hoschild the former SID for Dayton Hes just texted me Doug is about to go into the Dayton Athletics Hall of Fame and he says the Chapel Blue is an homage to the color of the dome of the Immaculate Conception Chapel the main chapel back on the UD campus So it is not Chapel Hill We knew that It just needed to be told for everyone else Im just saying that youre in Charlotte That color wouldnt say that Then in capital letters he says definitely not for Chapel Hill There you go Hey you got one shot here Well the folks back in Dayton and those who have traveled here to Charlotte take their flyers very seriously as they should It is one of the great college basketball cities in the country as evidenced by the fact that they have hosted the first four for decades and sell out the building anytime they throw the ball in the air They have a great support class and this is a really good team here again But they are facing their largest deficit of the afternoon with the basketball Laton spotting up That is how they get him going Thats how you get him going Again he needs to let the guards create opportunities for you Pick and choose when you want to roll and when you want to pop cheering Flyers get a stop Montgomery looking to attack Hall now on the back The pass is taken away Sam Lewis Hall picks up his dribble back outside Tillis into the game He was ready to fire 4941 Virginia applause and cheering Great job by Virginia pushing tempo they trying to switch back and get their man and they didnt get caught up in matchup Sometimes you just got to get back and you cant get your assigned player You just got to match up and guard somebody That time two guys went to one and left someone wide open and Tillis made a bay Durkat able to line it up but unable to connect Big spot in the ball game here for Dayton Jakari White cheering Feels like were in Charlottesville but we are in Charlotte North Carolina Taken over the city of Charlotte here this weekend with Randolph Childris Im Doug Sherman Glad youre with us for this entertaining basketball game between the A10 and the ACC Virginias been on a 133 run to seize control of things at least for the moment Theyve shot the basketball so much better at this end Randolph after missing their first four theyve made six of their last nine Yeah Daytons come out Theyve got to get some type of production out of their front line the length of an Areno inside His ability to alter shots is getting trouble Jakari White with his third triple of the day Hes explosive and hes starting to get it going Hes creative He can shoot it off the dribble and the catch And not many guys can do it as efficient as he can He put he put 32 on South Dakota last year Onenso with a block shot We talked about how important the bench points are And heres another bench point Whites got 11 off the bench Malleries got seven off the bench On Enzos got eight off the bench Its been the biggest difference in the game Dayton draws a lot of fouls Thats a big part of what theyve done But Virginia when they go to their bench its actually a strength Not a lot of teams can say that cheering The Flyers have been outscored 208 here in the second half Bennett off the mark out of bounds off of the foot of Jakari White So the Flyers who are in a danger zone right now will have the basketball when we come back And now to track Jakari Whiten company who is perfect from the floor so far this afternoon Four for four including three for three from distance and Randolph as a team The Whos are seven of nine shooting in the second half Yeah they were only three of eight from behind the threepoint line in the first half and they shot it well in the first half when they didnt turn the basketball over and they come out this second half and only one turnover They are four of six from behind the threepoint line and a lot of that is Jakari White and this bench I mean Virginia is 29 points from the bench Clarence Armstrong the lead official heading over to the scores table Looks like were going to have a review The common foul on Virginia is under review More potential play That is Ron Groover Call on the floor is upheld Common foul dating ball So the Ritter just grabbed him by the shoulder and then with the collision with Mallerie went down Just a common foul I didnt think it was much when it happened live The R didnt jump to the basketball and got beat on the cut Just reaches in and gets the foul Its only his first Chill Whats your sense of UVA this season Were a little over a month into the year They were picked fifth with an entirely new roster fifth in the ACC Are they that good Are they better What weve seen their last two games at Texas and so far today makes me think the ceilings going to be higher than that It looks the part I mean they have everything that you need Theyre not dependent upon one guy They got balance inside outside bench scoring as were seeing here and multiple guys that can handle and make decisions A lot to like about the Virginia Wahoos Mallerie drive and dish White remains perfect on the afternoon Hes on a heater Four four behind the threepoint line And this has happened so fast Its so explosive And this is against a really good defensive flyer squad Im thinking about getting a headband laughter You got to shave your head Ill do it Yeah Yeah Well see what Sherry says about that Well the look keeps getting better and better for Jakari White with every shot that goes in extending the largest lead of the afternoon to 19 the Jakar army Itll itll see a lot more headbands and shaved heads in Charlottesville Come conference play he keeps playing like this Well the folks have traveled JPJ John Paul Jones Arena about 4 hours from where we are here in Uptown Charlotte And for this afternoon basketball game and the football game tonight Virginia against Duke for the ACC championship A lot of folks have made the track Tell you what Jakari White is putting on a show 16 points to lead all scorers Doug that was just too easy Just a simple turn the corner get down the lane A little resistance there And when everybody can score you tend to hug your defender and you got to constantly guard your man and be prepared to help Counter back out to Bennett The extra pass to Durkat fights for the basketball The UVA crowd wanted a foul but does not get it I thought Connor just grabbed Mallerie on that one and moved him out of the way Jones takes the contact misses the shot Latong on second effort able to get it through the cylinder Here comes White Throw it up to the rim Lon got a hand on it Flyers down 19 Someone else other than Bennetts got to be comfortable creating offense Tillis and Durkak tied up Is on a heater for a very good Cyclones team that will move up in the standings and remain undefeated with a huge road victory at Purdue Virginia here has seized control in the second half just shooting the lights out of the basketball while the Flyers have cooled off In the second half Virginia is nine of 11 for 82 Lewis in trouble able to find Thomas on the left wing Six to shoot Ditter puts his shoulder down and its an offensive foul That is number three on the freshman from Belgium I thought Virginia did a really good job of passing the basketball there I dont like the call I didnt think Montgomery was set I thought Ditter had the angle I didnt see him extend the arm Montgomery going the other end Derritter cleans up the glass and the big man will dribble up Derk trying to cut him off at the pass Lewis strong into the lane It trickled off to Derritter Check that Grunlow and he will shoot two Only the fifth offensive rebound Daytons done a really good job limiting Virginia on the offensive glass but on the other end I think theyre taking really difficult shots at the rim Theyre driving it Theyre just kind of Theyre struggling against the length of Grundlow and Onins cheering Our ACC Network crews will be just a few blocks away here in Charlotte for the ACC Championship game today between Duke and Virginia Our game day coverage begins at 5 Eastern with inside music access followed by a 2hour ACC huddle Then during the game well have a field pass presentation with the crew on the sidelines providing commentary and reactions And after the game well have a complete breakdown with coach and player interviews You can always watch everything on the ESPN app Duke of Virginia in the ACC football championship I dont think that was on anybodys bingo card Don Hall was tracked down by Durkat with the chase down block and the Flyers cash it in at the other end Jayon Simon burries the three Thats the effort were used to seeing applause from the Flyers Chase down block at the rim and come down three in transition Oh thought he had an easy one Out of nowhere gets it blocked and then coming out in transition knocking down another three cheering Thats the type of game you got to sc if youre Flyers You got to get this thing going up and down You got to pick up the pace The more it slows down it favors the shooting and the rim protection of Virginia But theyre so difficult to press because everybody can handle it and pass it But you got to speed continue to speed them up Well try White back outside Mallerie Tillis back to White I started to yell counting but I didnt want to jinx him I mean hes just Its credit to the group The balls moving Everybodys sharing the basketball Theyve had multiple possessions where five and six and seven passes before anyone takes a shot Ron Guber has four on the Virginia bench after the make by White Seven for seven from the floor A perfect five for five from distance White lighting it up for UVA Montgomery Great defense to force that turnover by Sam Lewis Shen is defending at a really high level I know sometimes you get so caught up in the numbers and they pressure you dont you dont get a lot of turnovers but theyre really making you take difficult shots Mallerie takes a difficult shot Here comes Bennett Jones has an angle to the basket Missed it Lewis will dribble up 840 remaining in the second half The rim protection is just really giving them a challenge They theyre struggling inside with the two bigs of UVA Every time they turn the corner theyre getting pressure and then they get forced into this length at the rim and the inability to finish They probably got to do more driving and looking to kick out All right You scored over 2000 points at Wake Did you ever score 16 straight Demon Deacon points I dont remember things like that laughter The reason I asked is because Jakari White has scored the last 16 points for the Cavaliers He is on a heater You know you did You could say yes I I I dont like to brag laughter No he is come out this second half and been on fire But again theyre not forcing and necessarily running actions for him The ball is just finding him Theyre just moving it and passing it to the open guy And everyone on the floor knows who has the hot hand Thats what makes this team so unique Off to bounce Javon Pettit with the pull up 6650 The Flyers back within 16 Mallerie cut off Back out front Tillis all by himself two What a luxury in my press offense I can take my my fourman and my three and break your press and put my point guard on the other end of attack And there is a maturity and a physicality about Devin Tillis that is so valuable for the Cavaliers off their bench And dont forget his ability to shoot nearly 40 behind the threepoint line Nice makes his own three And he hadnt shot a three well this year I mean he shot nearly 40 a year ago And the behind the man of the hour That is now 10 consecutive made threes for Jakari White The UVA record is held by Kyle Guy who once hit 11 in a row All right Do you feed number six in white No you just he he hadnt chased it yet Look at this This just so unselfish And these are open looks and and its just created by the ball movement Simon Thats a three for the red shirt sophomore from Mapleton Georgia Now I definitely would have shot that one FYI I would not I dont know what the record was I wouldnt have thought about it I just know I hadnt missed that that shot was going up I can assure you that one Tillis along the baseline a little too strong Simon clears the rebound for Dayton Dayton I think again someone besides Bennett has got to get it going and cheering there with the drive and finish and he had it going early attacking the rim that time Got an angle Takes the contact gets a chance getting to that left hand here initiates the contact Ground low takes the bump and finishes Bruno Yeah Hes like Wheres that been applause cheering Standing ovation for the leading scoreer Jakari White who has not missed a shot here this afternoon I got to talk to Ryan about that Theres got to be a rule If I dont miss a shot I shouldnt come out of the game This This breather needs to be quick I got to get on little brother about that one That that that taking me out of the game and I hadnt missed a shot And I would think Ryan would be expecting that from you Oh yeah he better His dad wouldnt have took me out I can tell you that laughter His father Dave Odum former head coach at Wake Forest who my partner Randolph starred for back in the 90s Gallon Hall This team is so fun to watch Stepped out of bounds Seems so fun to watch Theyre just someones selfish with the basketball Theyre theyre driving the pass I think this is like a teaching tape More teams should put this in Theyre spacing you Theyre in correct spots Guys know where their teammates are when theyre driving Theyre where theyre supposed to be You mentioned it Doug earlier in the first half I I I think this team is amongst the teams in the ACC I know they were picked fifth This team looks as though they could be a team that finishes a little higher than that Well in the preseason it was Duke Louisville Carolina State and then Virginia And Virginia certainly has showed well so far at seven and one Their only loss so far was to Butler back on November 23rd at the Greenbryer tip off in West Virginia and SMU Clemson Miami Syracuse Notre Dame And Id say right now Id have to flipflop them in NC State I think theyve been a little more impressive here in the early going than NC State how it started for you But with both those teams with new head coaches and entirely new rosters how on earth do you know coming into a year You dont and and NC State obviously had a disappointing tournament in Maui and Ryan coming into the last two games you didnt know you didnt know how good his team was because you didnt you know you look at the schedule like ah they didnt play anyone great and it wasnt challenged I thought great win at Texas and then theyre handling a really good Dayton Flyers group here in Charlotte take the metrics team thats been overhauled Coming into the season is it better to schedule the way the Virginia team did for the month of November against teams that okay you can say they werent challenged but you learn who you are in terms of getting wins and feeling good about it or youre better served trying to play a tougher schedule right off the bat I I think your first year its a lot easier to do that but theres no right or wrong reason You look back a year ago and I take somebody like Pat Yelson he took on all comers in his first year and had a really good year come conference tournament time And I credit the coaches that come out and challenge their teams and play difficult schedules early College basketball is fun when you make matchups like this Well Virginia certainly has upped the competition level the last two times out on the road in Austin on Wednesday They beat Texas in the ACC SEC challenge 8869 and they have continued that over against a quality nonconference opponent in Dayton here this afternoon The Flyer faithful who have made the trip here to Charlotte still hanging in there as their team has rattled off nine straight points to get it back to 12 And I talked about we talked about scheduling as well I mean they have had some good opponents We just didnt know how good applause Virginia is going to be Youre talking about they beat Queens and that theyre picked first in EA Suns Thats a really good team as well But the last couple wins Virginia if they can hold off has been really impressive but a lot of time left here with the way the Dayton Flyers press create turnovers here they just did cheering The Flyer faithful making themselves heard Under five minutes to go in regulation Bennett for three Dont look now but the Flyers are back in it Its a ninepoint game cheering Bennett is talking Hes knocking down threes and hes talking cheering Mallerie went down hard gets up and will play on Hall with the basketball and hes fouled 40 ft from the bucket by Jon Simon That is the fifth foul against the Flyers here in the half Heres the ball screen here Mallerie goes under He wasnt expecting Bennett to shoot it from that deep but hes a gamer Hes letting him know about it You better chase me over this screen You cant go under Imma lace up another one Kevin Tillis looking to go to work backing his way into the lane trying to get to that right hand and he missed the shot Everything but the finish And here comes Durkat Hot shooting goes out and Virginia goes cold and they takes advantage of it So Whites back in Anthony Grant has his team in fullcourt pressure again Plenty of time on the clock Over four remaining in regulation Paul to Grunlow Bad pass cheering fight for the basketball and that Dayton defense forces another Virginia turnover Its a bad decision though Hall You dont bounce pass with a bad angle and you definitely dont do it on a switch with a guard on your big Bennett throws it up Virginia needs a bucket in the worst sort of way Bennett turned the corner a few times and he shot that floater I think the lob is there Youll go back and watch tape and wish he had thrown it lobb a few times Now Derritter has not attempted a shot in the entire second half for Virginia They attack from the other side Finding Derritter open from the corner Mallerie able to pull it back out to White 11 consecutive made threepoint shots over the last couple of games for Jakari White Ties a UVA record cheering cheering This is how the game started and Im glad were back to this Both teams are just battling again Just unselfish plays It looks like Jakari White every time he touches it it looks like hes wide open but it comes off an offensive rebound by H Mallerie Goes in there and battles Comes up with it And White has been perfect here today cheering And as Doug mentioned threes he had last four threes against Texas and hes up to 11 straight made threepointers man So the 14 nothing Dayton run is snapped by the brilliance of Jakari White Big stop there as Jerritter clears the rebound Here comes White applause A little bit of breathing room here for the Wahoos Take their time Up by 10 Hall run low nicely down They work 25 seconds off the clock and got a good look to build the lead back to a dozen The collectively is talented This may be the best passing team Ive seen all year Everyone is passing it The space is great Theyre unselfish They dont care who gets the ball Just the open man gets it Creates a lot of trust with the group here Theyre flying around on both ends of the floor making things happen cheering cheering cheering previous Orlando with his final year of eligibility said I want to go and be a part of something special for Ryan Odum A lot of teams missing a quarter Virginia did not And I think theyre going to get better because I think Hall is going to be better I think as he gets more comfortable hes going to be much better shooting and hes going to be able to help finish and close games for the team Paul defending Durkak called for the foul Thats his fifth They changed one earlier No they flipped it So just four on the BYU grad transfer What about Don Hall makes you think that he will continue to play a bigger and better role for the Cavs One you need is experience you know down late in games I mean Malleries a young guy Hes explosive Hes more in attack mode looking to score Hes going to the offensive glass Hes part of that group of bench guys that you just turn loose I think hes their most explosive guard Hall is just steady makes the right plays cheering gets the guys the ball Hes really unselfish Hes a big physical guard He can switch on the defensive end of the floor And you need them to close games in moments like this because the only knock that I only concern that I have about Virginia right now early in the year is theyre not a great free throw shooting team So as they get tested and they get in closer games you need Hall on the free throw line knocking down free throws shooting over 85 Whites pass deflected to cut it to seven Long rebound tracked down by UVA cheering Mallerie lob ahead a little too tall Didnt need that Thats why you need Hall Just normal freshman mistakes You got the lead Mallerie the freshman should keep that run the shot clock They didnt need to shoot that till under a minute No need to make that pass And thats why I say thats Halls role on this team to kind of control the game and close games in moments like that Randolph the 21st turnover committed by UVA Montgomery foul White and Derritter were defending his third Turn the corner Yeah Put pressure on the defense Throwing the foul Hadnt shot it great from the perimeter here today All of his damage has been going to the rim Had it going early I think Virginia did a really good job of keeping their bigs in between the ball and the basket forcing everything over the top and their length took control of this second half in particular front and blow and oh Montgomery appeared in only 17 games for Mike White at Georgia last year A number of his credits did not transfer from Mount St Marys and getting a fresh start this year at Dayton as Tillis comes back in replacing Grunlow This is kind of the Virginia small ball lineup now when they got a lot of spacing Ditter at 69 is the tallest player Neither of their elite rim protectors are on the floor We havent called Onen Enzos name much if at all in the second half but he was so good in the first half Gave him eight instrumental bench points Just a lot of different pieces for Ryan Odum You need handlers in the game if youre Virginia Thats why you went to the smaller lineup Crowd wanting for White to continue shooting the basketball Got to come to the basketball Dont force it but you cant be so passive If a layup presents itself you got to take it Really strong This is what we talked about with Hall This is why you got him in the game Durkak with the foul I just love Tillis Again the grad transfer Hes from Los Angeles Sixth year in college He started back in 2020 at UNLV They double teamed him along the baseline He didnt panic at all Not at all I mean just hes been in these moments Again hes not shooting the three the way he wants Shot 39 a year ago Only 28 so far this year Hes knocked down one And the threes will come As weve seen tonight the ball finds you when youre in this lineup and with this group Bennett gives up the foul And that is the seventh foul on the Flyer So a one and one upcoming for the Virginia freshman Most teams you tend to divide the season up into threes You know you start the year theres a level of excitement Then you get to finals break and you get a chance where the finals theres no class You get to be pros You get to practice You get to double up practice correct the mistakes and change things that youve seen early in the year Were approaching that now We enter the second and third week of December Youre going to see teams depending on their schedule be able to take advantage of that time And Brian ODs got to be really impressed with what hes seen from his group early in offense defensive switch Jakari White out Johan Bruno back in as Mallerie connects on the front end of the one and one Timeout followed by coach Grant applause Pressure has been a big issue I think they sped up Dayton at times and obviously their shotmaking ability is is I think is what this team is really going to be known for throughout the season groaning and screaming UVA up by 10 Montgomery on the attack Tillis had it lost it but its Virginia basketball Yeah it touched Montgomery He was laying out of bounds automatically Its going to go to UVA The Cavaliers number six Montgomery White He drives You see Montgomery laying there on the ground He punches the ball before it falls out of bounds Hes just frustrated there Tillis barely gets it in All fouled in the back court so well have a one and one I think UVA has hit every portal addition to this team all year long Everyones here They know their role Theyre buying in Its a fun offense to play in Montgomery checking in for the fly And Ditter didnt necessarily play great today but he hes the guy that gives them the balance on the offensive end When you stay home on the shooters then he kind of gets going on the inside And today they didnt need to lean on him as much with the shooting The explosive game from Jakari White Eventually Virginia is going to switch all the ball screen Theyre going to give you the twos Theyre going to trade your twos Bennett takes the two Hes got a team high 18 points 8173 In the NCAA tournament if he does that I dont know many coaches in the country that would have done that Five years at UNMBC two years each at Utah State and VCU This is year number one at Virginia as Chance Mallerie made the first and it worked out very well that Ryan ODM and his staff had been recruiting and had recruited had a relationship with Chance Mallerie when they were at BCU So when the coaching change happened Chance reopened his recruitment but it was not starting from scratch He knew Coach Odum and it was not a tough cell for a young man who wanted to stay home to play for the Whos anyhow Its a good system that fits him well His family gets to watch him play Hell be a major force all year long as he continues to grow and develop as well He is fouled And well head back to the free throw line And hes going to get better in throws like this No one questions He He brings an element to this team We talked about Ditter and what he brings Valerie brings something thats a theres a dynamic to him as a guard He has a speed and a quickness that you just cant match You cant Theres no scout team guys with his shotmaking ability And as soon as we finish here well get you to the Swack Football Championship between Prairie View and Jackson State Ladies and gentlemen Im picking on Doug here a little bit I kind of told him I said Dayton draws a lot of fouls I was like theres no way this game is going to end by 2 pm Its going to be around 215 220 Well were coming up on what 227 laughter Hey its been a lot of fun A neutral sight game in a day where the University of Virginia has taken over the city of Charlotte Theyve got a huge ACC football championship game coming up at 800 over on ABC to be played just a few blocks from here Well the basketball team has done its part here this afternoon They have Can the football team close out the ACC season with an ACC championship And who thought that Who saw that coming Can the Duke defense stop the Virginia offense and its running attack especially Well find out Looking forward to 11th win of the year Unbelievable season cheering Montgomery around and out The rebound secured and so too is the victory A record setting day for Jakari White who put up 25 points
