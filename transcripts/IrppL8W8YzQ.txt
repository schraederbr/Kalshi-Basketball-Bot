season pole and living up to it so far unlike some other teams in the league but well talk about that as the night progresses the big red they lost their first game as Mike mentioned havent lost since and theres all five starters and then three guys coming off the bench so that would be a pair of eights in certain places Mike you always want to split those just saying opening tip controlled by the big red its a different game and a different show okay this is ACC basketball and were so glad that youre with us trying to take it inside omir rejects the first one the second effort is Good from Hanson nice job staying with it I mean over here its its tough to describe him the undersized I said but there really plays Above the Rim really strong um its a really nice job staying with it up on the rim and Jordan Miller lays it in come back this is now both teams should fall into an easy rhythm going up and down the floor I mean Cornell is ridiculous as you see right there their average possession length is 14 seconds Tom Applause pretty quick in the landscape of college basketball and thats long stepping back thats a three Isaiah Wong actually he had a little bit of a leg issue against Louisville uh season low 21 minutes in that game they didnt really need him for that win still got the double digits at 10 points and five boards turn over to pack that was a win on Sunday at Louisville 8053 and as a team they shot 50 percent but only made six threes Mike on 22 chances for the canes on Sunday against the cards well they dont want this to be a threepoint game shooting game either they they know that they can beat Cornell in a twopoint game but uh Hanson has been really aggressive early on here Applause so Hanson able to spin that one in he averages nine points per game and as their leading rebounder five and a half per game and the layup is Good from Miller chances Miami doing a great job here early even on made baskets changing ends of the floor Applause Hanson doing all of the scoring so far for the big red but you really like Hanson that aggressiveness to try to maybe get uhmir and foul trouble and so far Cornell showing no fear of going into the paint area Nazir Williams calculating the angle high off the glass you know I said OMeara and he can block shots but theres no real big impediment in the lane for Miami so you can get to the rim and score theres a mirror trying to make a move on the Baseline lost it out of bounds back to Cornell Music Jim larenegger in his 12th season as the Miami coach deepest run of the NCAA tournament a year ago all the way to the elite eight Applause Music Applause so Cornell brings in four new players trying to take it down the lane and off the glass and good Chris Manning probably their best athlete out on the board nice try at that time but youre gonna its gonna be like hockey line changes with Cornell in this game theyre gonna theyre gonna go 10 Deep and uh you know theyll probably go two or three minutes and theyll sub out Miami Applause heres the look and you know for Miami theyre going to defend the threepoint line and theyre going to live with some shots like that like I said Cornell has not been afraid early on to accept that and go into the lane along in some traffic under foul is called on the contact of the drive from Jordan Miller earning free throws ragman picked up the foul here tonights four keys to the game with Mike jaminski well for the big red they want to try to match the athleticism of uh Miami and going up and down the floor and for the Hurricanes to fend without fouling try to be solid stay in front of their guy limit the drives but uh so Farrells been able to get to the get to the rim free throw by Miller ties us early on in the first half score for the Kings this season please only missed two free throws all year hes now 15 of 17 well and for Miami they dont go to the freethrow line a lot as a team Applause trying to drive it with Watson Applause shot clock is down to six Applause to the rim for Madden and that may be the longest possession of the game lets just think of the same thing youre not going to have to shot clock on their back a lot that was a very good defensive stand by Miami they just gave up that drive all 10 of the points for Cornell in the pain and that one somehow squeezed up on the rim by Wong and it drops so you know you look at the shot distribution for Cornell theyve only taken one three so far thats the second one theres another one from Watson in a Miss way out of the lane trying to beat him to the rim and it rolls off with a chance for Casey he was looking around to see if there were any bodies to avoid I mean thats thats what theyre going to do theyre going to run for layups or run to the threepoint line walks in with the three shoots a robust 52 percent from Beyond The Arc is 153 of the season on the drive and two for Jordan Miller accelerating to the goal Applause he points for Miller in three of three shootings scrapping the paint for the loose ball Health ball situation the arrow is going to favor Miami Music a couple of teams that are rolling Miami has won four in a row the big red seven in a row after a season opening loss to Boston College and here is the Wasco Center we are all tied at 13 games and big red fabulous as a team but going so far only one three here they get the turnover out of the timeout still with a chance to harvest some points off of that turnover around the perimeter three from the corner for Cornell last two baskets have been threes now thats starting to open up for them after a bunch of layups early on so Williams knocking down that three the mirror went up for the alleyoop attempts and able to gather it Cornell right now shooting 64 percent that percentage is going up Applause long hops into the lane and creates contact veteran move and that foul will be against Ragland Jr heres the look at the kind of wild finish but then you if you give up the offensive rebounding and this is the thing especially the mirror out there this Cornell team to get an offensive rebound but that sets up the open three everybody was compacting the lane and that you know for for Cornell and for Brian Earl and his team this is about as good a five and a half minutes as he could have hoped for early on his team is playing with a lot of confidence right now Hansen is back in for Cornell Four Points is here Williams leads leads five Millers got eight for Miami Wong can add to his total from the freethrow line and now hes got seven is a 73 free throw shooter Music talks about maybe pressuring up to try to get Cornell out of the Rhythm a little bit we might see that early on here defensive Joseph has almost knocked it away and now Wong picks up the loose ball omir off the glass for two really nice price good decision that time and it all starts on the defensive end of the floor Joseph is going to get hes going to get most of the minutes off of the bench Catch and Release goofy he leads the team and made threes take another three attempt that rattles out and that time it was Missouri Williams with Mavericks corner on previous possession Isaiah long on the handle the Junior from Piscataway New Jersey senior Bonner High School of Philadelphia playing his 105th Collegiate game and a strong move Inside by number two yeah it was uh it was close as to whether he was going to be back here at Miami whose name was in the portal and he pulled out at the last minute foreign Joseph was bringing it up and got fouled heres a heres a look at Wong you let him get to his right hand a really nice ball fake that time Music now time for The Fresh Market discover the best on our subject is Isaiah Wong Applause yeah you know he hasnt been shooting the ball great lately but you know very consistent of course the first time coming back all ACC preseason player this year a big part of their drive for the elite eight last year stepping back and knocking it down and I think those two will build chemistry as the year goes along and theyll be a lot more dangerous than they are now and theyre pretty good at this point Kanes on a 90 run Applause passes intercepted from Joseph brilliant not a great decision that time by Joseph Greg Dolan into the Lane Gray high flying for the layup there are there have been times early on where it looks like both teams have signed a nonaggression back on the defensive end of the floor 2220 bounces it there for the canes on that attempt okay that almost looked like a lob attempt against the tire go ahead with a three for Cornell Jim larenaga warned his team of what kind of game they were getting into Ray got a defender in the air Arrow will favor Cornell and to your point Tom I mean he texted his guys on the way back from Louisville talking about this game getting their attention early about how dangerous Cornell can be its a team thats won seven in a row that man right there is 700th Win earlier this year quite an accomplishment came against his alma mater Providence Hanson with a strong move and it drops hes the one who got them off to a quick start and uh he is he just got teed up as well Mike he was complaining about not getting a foul and he just got teed up by Tony Henderson and that you cant you cant do clear would last that long here and let alone what hes accomplished at Miami hes got 234 wins here Mike thats the most in school history yeah hes won over 100 ACC games last year to the elite eight that win by the way number 700 is for his career was November 19th against Providence that was in the Hall of Fame tipoff in Uncasville Connecticut Mohegan Sun casino 7464 and the technical shots taken and see you know for as a player you cant especially this early on you know that the technical that serves no purpose youre not going to sway the referees you know just just play on in that situation not surprisingly coach Earl has handsome next to him in the bench now long trying to get the defender in the air score of the basket and foul for Isaiah Wong hes been very aggressive hes mixed up hes had some drives and finishes in the lane and knocked down to three Miami points to this point you talked about long Mike as a consistent score hes now got double figures in 53 of his last 63 games Music he is across the 1400 career points thresholds now 13th in Miami school history and long leads everybody with 14 points for the weak side OMeara able to run it down and that was really solid by Miami no drives they kept everybody in front and then on the threepoint shot you get a challenge Miami in the midst of a 144 runs long trying to extend it Falling Away Mike that was high level yeah and now hes just in a group seeing a big basket um its a call by Ted Valentine hes joined by Tony Henderson and Greg Evans and this is one of the things they talked about at practice was bumping Cutters but heres heres Wong and you know this shot like that youve stopped the drive you get him to shoot a fade away and he knocks that down you shake his hand and you know its good defense but its better offense Music hes also type of personal conference and steals became over two but heres you know heres the thing again you know with Hanson with that that technical hes having a game you know he was playing well inside and his answer was six points is long against two Defenders now using the pivot foot effectively tipped up twice Walker had a chance at it as well for Miami wouldnt drop stolen Music trying to find some daylight up against Wong and able to spin it in another point of emphasis is being you know defending without fouling and thats uh you know even though Cornells been aggressive but Miami has not been putting guys at the line inside Poplar flips it out to Joseph so Lefty hits thats a three ball Bensley Joseph and thats an offensive rebound without omir on the floor so good pickup there and uh Joseph only 29 from three so thats a thats a added plus he only made six threes All Season prior to tonight straight away in the Miss from Cornell and boothby knocked around and Dolan got it well what happened Poplar was he was falling out of bounds he probably should have just ate the ball and gotten a turnover but tried to save it inside and he gives up an easy basket so Cornell 52 percent from the floor shooting Miami hits another three this time its Jordan Miller Miami not too bad Mike 60 from the floor as a team shooting a foul in front of that Miami bench Music Wong picked it up with his second team foul for the Hurricanes theyre ways away from putting them in the penalty so Wong will be substituted for 16 points 507 shooting hes got a three and hes five for five for the freethrow line with a couple of rebounds and hes getting a breather along with Poplar and coach Earl coming back in with Hanson had a chance to pull him down maybe uh chirp at him a little bit teach him a lesson and he comes right back in and goes to work Applause I thought Sean Hanson the Junior from Ramsey New Jersey and thats you know thats just too easy thats a direct pass one dribble and a layup and a chance for a threepoint play and underneath out of bounds Applause and foul for Miami 75 from the strike that Hanson on the season you know now we talked about the lack of hype but now with OMeara out not on the floor theres also not a real wide body in the lane either pressure skillfully broken by Miami Walker turns around and fires not hit the intended target Applause Music well fumbled and lost by Dolan transition back close in missed the follow Walker so it looked like Harlan Beverly had a chance but Walker cleans up the mess really a couple mishandles but they got the mistake up on the rim and nobody was there to block off Walker Applause Cornell three max Watson friend we may see a hundred from both teams tonight the way this game is I dont have a problem with that GMan everybodys in good physical condition running up and down the floor and both teams its a long distance attempt Hanson fighting with Walker and the foul goes against Miami and Walker its going to be his second I mean Walker isnt going to give you a ton of offense uh to average in this off of the bench two points but uh Applause about 10 minutes out on the floor and his job to give OMeara a little bit of a break during the game walker experienced player as well 98th career game out of Baltimore Maryland on the bench now for Miami Cornell 56 shooting is a team Applause step back Hanson sends it right back out Williams Amir pulls it in for the Kings hes their leading rebounder this season well you look at the numbers he gets 25 percent of the defensive rebounds he knocked down that first three he says all right lets take this out for a test drive I mean they do call him Bens so Benz is out for a test drive with actually another one they may start calling him Mercedes well see Joseph now has made both of his threepoint attempts and six points thats a deep shot by Nord a lot of contact and the foul goes against the big red as Bensley Joseph hits the court Williams picks it up for Cornell this teams are rolling especially Miami though benchley 1990s one of five sets of brothers head coaches active this season Mike yeah the Miller Brothers probably the best known of that group maybe the Hurley Brothers right up there as well and of course uh Scott drew at Baylor which is the National Championship under his belt Im so old Mike that I covered Dan Earl as a player at Penn State long hes making it look easy tonight Mike yeah I mean its basically uh him and Miller are the scoring for Miami at this point three on threepoint attempts for Isaiah Wong and thats the zero Williams and you know what I mean that being said him having a night like that would normally indicate a blowout this early to the game but Cornell hanging right in this game you really get the feeling that we could go down to the final minutes in this one and his bike alluded to coach larenegger was trying to prepare his team for what they were in school for tonight against Cornell one of the better teams out of the ivy league Music its tipped out of bounds off of mere Cornell bench back to the big red just under six minutes to go in our first half so glad that youre with us for ACC basketball and uh because of those other guys score him theyve really you know OMeara has been really quiet in this game so far especially you know hasnt really gotten on the offensive glass of course Miami shooting ball very well theres only two points for him Miamis shooting 56 percent as gray comes out of the corner theyre gonna line up another three thats North and you know what like no shot that Cornell takes really surprises and its just how what theyre conditioned to do and they so I think theyve all got the green light so Mike theyve attempted 153 so far for the big red and made five of them well well stay at this end of the floor with a foul against the Cornell well to give you an idea about Nord hes five of 11 on the year hes five of ten from three I mean you know he gets a rash if he goes inside the threepoint line I think lets just put a little aloe on it youll be fine theres a lot of that down here so gray picked up that last foul and thats going to put pack at the free throw line we talked about these impact transfers including pack and mirror the top of this broadcast Nigel pack sophomore from Indianapolis Indiana hes a transfer from Kansas State last year Mike he was first team all Big 12 and the most improved player in that League 17 points a game for him more importantly 43 from three so hes got that good range and like I said its its the thing with the portal guys especially a team thats gone to you know that deep in the NCAA as last year takes those guys a little bit of time to work themselves in but uh unless they get through December and get ready for ready for lead play in Earnest theyre going to be fine Miami for the regional final last year against Kansas this follows against Cornell so you lose the eventual National Champion I guess thats you know the other they had the halftime lead on them in that game by six points the second half didnt work out the way Coachella would have wanted well Kansas was behind in a lot of games yeah uh including in the final down 15 right to North Carolina so close for Eva Davis and the Tar Heels whove taken a bit of a tumble its early in the season though so it wouldnt get overly worried you think about Syracuse that started slow but had a great win at Notre Dame Music so you know theres a lot to happen 20 conference games as well it wouldnt be a it wouldnt be a broadcast with you without working Syracuse its just a fact thats all youre an alumni hey I give you that you come by an honest dont look good last night as well and their Victory and the Jimmy V event you know theyre starting New York theyre two theyre two freshmen healthy yeah winning against Iowa last night so we got a lot of basketball to play not only the season but in this game and thats Nazir Williams you know they got off to a slow start from three but they are six of 17 theyre halfway to what they would normally make in this game with Miami really trying to lock in on the threepoint shot just to put this out there put it out there theyre season high and attempted threes is 46 whoa three ball money yeah absolutely they could be close to 20 attempts by halftime right not over that um his third three of the game on four tries yeah this may have been thats a that was a big step back as well creating that the the space between him and the defender this may be as good an offensive half as Ive seen in person this year past the Dolan unfortunately catches Greg Evans in the cheek made the call though look at that yeah very nice note I guess he got need in the uh in his thigh in the in the Louisville game we talked about his minutes being down but they won that game easily so thats Bensley Joseph who goes to the batch touchdown pass up ahead and the rim rocker from Jordan Miller and that was uh that was like Omaha called by Peyton Manning as they made eye contact before that pass talk about eye contact thats Hanson to Dolan and a great again this this you know this reminds me this offense almost like a Princeton style offense with the threat of a three on the other end omir at the other end Im just gonna stay out of the way and dont say anything this is your game my man that talks about a hundreds of running tonight you have to love the effort from these two teams looking to score Music every time down the floor Cornell had one possession Mike that went deep into the shot clock otherwise I dont think Ive mentioned the shot clock all night long so far you know again Ill talk about it you know Jim if youre you know if youre Jim larenagar I did the 3 30 Mark youve got 53 up on the board how many uh only seven another three for the big red theyve now made seven in the half Miamis also made Seven threes Applause looking for the eighth three and a half Applause they probably didnt think they could match Cornell shooting the three that has not been the case there early on and this is after Miami made just six threes on 22 attempts in the win against Louisville Wong shows off the armed Talent up ahead in the variety of ways I mean he has scored all over the court you see the control dribble inside hes knocked down a couple of threes step backs everything is really working for him and Tom how about this I mean 22 points closing in 32 points by Jacqueline is the the record for a half Miami but hes also wires also got five assists in this game so hes accounted for 32 of the 56 points taken away by pack Music up on the rim and Williams comes away with it wants to run and theyre trying to just get omir involved in the offense that time Music and that will be goaltender Music theres the look Im there so good and that the lesson there you know if youre out there watching make a bounce pass in that area theres just so many hands there that you throw a bounce pass you have a much better chance of it connecting and just trying to deliver the ball right to the players so Isaiah long and Jordan Miller in the double digits along with the 22 a mere offensive pass and he hits the square and knocks It Down and Under normal conditions thats going to be his game right there hes going to get a lot of points Second Chance points great another I tell you what Hanson the technical aside not only scoring but doing some great delivery work as well dont blink dont get up from your chair dont get involved in a conversation pay attention to the GMan the canes and Big Red long missing from the explosive driver he lost his shoe so hell be behind the play momentarily Dolan into the corner Watson out of the corner got it right back in front of the Canes bench Wong as we mentioned hes got 22 Mike for Wong that is the 72nd time to double digits and the 26th time to 20 points and omir to the line 60 points with a minute 2411 Heat game and then watch this in the world in the for the World Cup here the header afterwards oh thats good thank you so mirror to the freethrow line you know players will say you know yeah really just want to get out and run and play youve got to be in great condition to play in a game like this I mean this is just endtoend no break Music so thats nine points for omir hes four and four from the floor that was his first free throw attempt that was kicked taken back couldnt get it over the front rim for billion foul on the play though foreign Music Music Applause Music just his fifth freethrow attempt of the Season hes made him all so far lets get a message from Worx Nitro meatworks Nitro powerful tools for any project with gaslike power without the gas fueled by powershare batteries to give you the power to outperform we got plenty of fuel in this first half between the big red and the canes 6151 with Marcus Fillion the senior from Rensselaer New York at the free throw line thats the name its been all Miller and long but uh for Cornell is whats their MO really good balance theyve got four guys who were at or near 10 points right now at the half Max Watson filed omir showing off the dribbling handles bringing it up the floor first on Watson so a double bonus for Miami to put a mirror at the freethrow line Applause Big Time impact transfers in the ACC this season a sophomore from Nicaragua yeah and Im going to be curious to see you know when he plays against the front lines with size you know when he when he goes up against North Carolina you know the teams that have some some size up front but he is really really solid and very athletic six seven 248 pounds number 15 in white Joseph revealous defending Music Mir is the first division one scholarship player from Nicaragua played for the national team in the summer of 21 Applause golden driver Applause Keynes appeared to have a chance at it kicked out of bounds foreign so Miami has now tied theyre high for points and a half since joining the ACC ENT 63 Music I go back lets take East and see what they Applause shot clock was down to five and then Joseph took it away so again the 63 is a new record for Miami since joining the ACC back at 405 remember they did not have a team from 1971 to 1985 I made it to their 11th NCAA tournament of the Season ago only about a second Difference game is shot Joseph on this dribble well launched that three well beyond 22 feet one and threequarter inches away and that book punctuation on our first 20 minutes and how about Miami averages 74 points a game coming in 66 for the half the 74 points per game sixth in the ACC that from the field and thats how you throw in the five assists on top of that as well just as good a half as you could imagine so the ivy league against the ACC ENT right now I mean theres a 14 point lead is not time to take your foot off the gas through Miami Cincinnati has not played an ivy opponent since December of 2018 Poplar Speedy first move and he might have earned some free throws Music the foul was against Hanson third on Hanson now remember he had the technical foul in the first half as well Mike the Poplar at the freethrow line and give us a big part of you know of their success 11 points he was five of seven from the floor had five rebounds a couple assists and these that foul is going to come out of the game right now so Hansen out Ragland Jr ends Poplar at the freethrow line the sophomore from Philadelphia Pennsylvania seven points and five Wards in the win at Louisville Sunday Music Applause Music offers averaged eight points per game in the early season about two and a half rebounds as well really six guys from Miami to play Heavy minutes so a couple guys averaging around nine minutes a game but its pretty tight rotation for Jim larenegger rnl shot 54 as a team in the first half Dolan cut off by the defending in deep with George Miller shot clock at two gray and it drops nice attack and then Miami continuing to try to run them off the threepoint line but that gave him a straight line drive a mirror on the Block across the handle picked up by pack for a floater tried to follow his own Miss Wong lost his shoe again to the rim rolls off to omir look at him step through the double Mike and Jim larranega throws it back to him on the Fly you know its your night when you beat everybody down the floor with one shoe oh Poplar off the front rim OMeara trying to preserve The Possession it rolls out of bounds and Ted Valentine says Miami basketball I mean this is a night right there tries to come up make the steal cant get back get his shoe and then on the other end and then tripler and egg has got the shoe on the sideline and he tosses it back soon thats awesome Wong did well not to slide on the sock without the shoe and travel entry pass on a rim Bender for the big man you look at him and you dont think that he can make that play but thats you know turn into a little bit of traffic and dunk pretty impressive 11 dunks on the season for omir and he leads the kings in that category starting to distance themselves Mike Joseph thats a three uh he just got off to the quick start hes missed one basket and thats inside the threepoint line four for four from the threepoint atmosphere for bestly Joseph who as we noted it made only six threes all season coming into the night and the thing too Tom you you look at what Cornell is doing they have really packed in their defense in the second half theyre going to continue to challenge Miami to make threes and Miami has stepped up and done it so far 80 Run for the canes Joseph now into double digits with 12 points as you mentioned my four or five from the floor the canes now have 10 made threes 16 tries Applause too unpopular and you might see that uh and one of the things they worked on in practice is really bumping the Cutters and thats where he picked up the foul that time gray ball fake way up and two what stops the 80 run and hes played really under control as getting them in their last couple of baskets on drives lead was 14 at halftime 6652 for Miami Applause 50 this season with the halftime lead a little bit of a matchup zone now for Cornell Applause cage with one four in a row all five of their home games this season last home last Wednesday against Rutgers of the 6861 win 2018 challenge the final edition of that event tried to tip it Miller got it Applause Music here drew a double step in the end line trying to find a teammate really has a lot of bodies and his touches in the second half inside people around him a lot of red jerseys each team now with seven turnovers in the game gray is going out Cornell with the substitution and Philly they attack Applause and I am rebounding as well 2318 Miami they have won 16 in a row rebounding the opponent and papa gets it easy for it and theyre not you look at the numbers at least early on their last in the ACC and defensive rebounding and thats even with omir on your team drop off the Manning and now Dolan might have been deflected by Poplar it appeared to change trajectory couldnt stop the ball from going in though maybe Im seeing things yeah with that nice extra pass though he had he had a very good looking at three absolutely I am due to get new glasses these are ladies frames after all pack is crossing it over now shake his Defender into traffic in the kick hey I think thats just going to be their uh their Mos and the rest of this half pack it in limit things inside and see if the jump shots still working for the canes its like Poplar got a piece of Dolan and picked up other heres a little teaser to the trivia weve got going there four active ACC coaches drafted in the NBA and maybe yeah amazingly Applause Music for New Jersey Philadelphia Applause goal pending against Walker Applause I love to hear your travel stories and how things are just a little bit different these days right well yeah traveling commercially was just a little more onerous than having the charter but now youve got the yacht to travel around Miami well thats a good point so its an even tradeoff and Im happy that although its you know we can get I can get you to Wilmington great passing by the canes Walker with the finish and Wongs got new sneakers on too by the way its a pinkish shoe its kind of a Rosy Glow from those sneakers crossover along with the quick hands Mikey does so many things well and he does it effortlessly well and thats but thats an example right there of Miami wanting to stay at home on the threepoint shooter now Wong got a hand on it deflected it but normally hed help on that drive a little bit more but you know Cornell they just want to try to limit those threes as much they can again an easy one in entry pass under underneath out of bounds for a layup Applause all of a sudden Cornell big red within shouting distance Miami had a 21 point lead leading 7554 seems like just a moment ago shot clock is down to five on each side the Miss from Walker Here Comes Watson and thats the three shot has dried up a little bit for my own now 104 in this half 10 of 19 in total Music Fillion came in to clean it up thats a drive and two Chris mannon well if you get past that first line of defense theres all sorts of room because Cornells got five people spaced along the threepoint Arc back Applause Music come on nice control the door floater nine points from pack was Williams at the other end with some contact its like Bentley Joseph is going to pick this one up for Miami you know its funny you talk about leads Tom and how theyre different against different teams like a a 12 point lead by Virginia is almost insurmountable but in a game like this you know 14 points can go away in a hurry dont forget right after us second game of our double header Towson and Clemson check your local listings for the game and time in your area and this has been a dodgy year of football wise for Clemson but congratulate them on the ACC Championship I mean how about that its a down year when they win the ACC Championship in 11 games they got 11 wins and dont go to the football national champion they are going to the Orange Bowl as the winner of the accs Music first time since the playoffs started that both Clemson and Alabama will be out of the Turners estate on some national titles 2016 and 18 consistently winning doubledigit games every year the folks in Coral Gables looking for their football team to respond next year as well they had a chance to be Bowl eligible but lost the pit different sport kudos to the Blue Devils in football this year Coach of the Year Mike Elko yeah it did a terrific job with them eight and four coming up in New York Long Applause phillian picked up the foul for Cornell and aside for his layup uh without his shoe most of Miamis been forced to stay in the half court in this first two and a half minutes they havent had a lot of breakaway stuff and thats where Wong was getting a lot of his offense in the first 20 minutes 73 from the line for wall three made threes in the game Mike gives him 132 career made threes so the graphics just uh just rose up to 13th on the alltime scoring list with Miami Ive been wondering about his career high 30 points we thought he was going to get that by halftime hes up to 26 right now on 812 shooting Williams kicks it to the corner knocked back out Applause fight for the loose ball its going to be a foul coming up well and that that was not the worst foul in the world for boothby at that time save two points appeared that Walker might have had a clear path to the rim for two foul by boothby Cornell was trying not to come back just a moment ago they havent beaten an ACC team since the early 1950s when they beat Wake Forest that was some pretty good teams with uh Applause back in the days we like to say almost when was it 50 years right one 5152 before the well that wasnt even an ACC team then it was a Southern Conference team current members of the ACC there you use it Applause Cornell overall 38143 against the ACC in the threepointer from Golden theyve lost 38 straight ACC opponents and the lead is now 11 Mike yeah and you know for for Brian Earl this was a change too they they started playing like this last year came off the you know the ivy league shut down the uh the Hogan season so he retooled the offense and theyve been Up Tempo and shooting threes ever since Anthony Walker goes high for two there was no Ivy tournament in 20 and 21 and that tournament only started its first year in 2017 well and the thing for the ivy players too none they dont get the extra code of the year like everybody else thinks like a graduate student players scholarships its mostly needbased grants in the ivy league its a different theyre playing a different game without the transfer portal you know their guys come for four years and come for that education Applause Music Applause turn around off the rim Miller had a chance at the missed by Walker Applause Music Williams online but short hes saying that Joseph attempted yeah trying to sell that Ted Valentine not buying that argument I think right now not at this time lets take a time out the lead has been reduced to 11 its been as big as 21 for the game High 26 this career high is 30 and Hanson as well has been a big factor for Cornell but but I like what Cornell has done Tom again theyve theyve kept Miami in the half court theyve really packed it in theyve challenged them to shoot threes and Miamis one of five in this half from three and theyve been able to kind of the scratch and Claw and kind of get a stop here and another made basket and get it into single figures Miamis most made threes this season Mike they made 13 against UNC Greensboro long into the corner theres another three attempts and thats good Christian Watson joins the party his third made three of the year and was wide open and theyve got some contributions from three that they normally dont get Applause driving basket by Chris Mann yeah foreign is one of the five players for Cornell in double digits and scoring in this game because were about to cross the 10minute threshold of the second half so glad youre with us and around Watson I guess that qualifies as a heat check yeah a little feeling feeling good about himself after that made three mannin lost the handle Miller was on his hip looks like a Wong is going to get into reaching in I mean yeah you look at it I mean hes Wong is drawing a crowd and we talked about his assist and you you know hey he was two of four it wasnt like he was over for four right its an aggressive Drive some heavy metal up there too as we went in for the jam challenging OMeara and all of a sudden right now too I mean Miami has been dominating this game at the freethrow line we havent talked a whole lot about that however that was the six team foul for the hurricane so one more in Cornell a bonus for the rest of the game first foul against omir Cornell is a 67 percent freethrow shooting team which is to me low given the numbers that they have from the threepoint line and from you know overall I mean they have an effective field goal rate of about 56 which is outstanding that was the first Miss from the line tonight for Cornell one of two for Hanson as a team point out shoots 49 from before both of these teams tonight above their season averages Miami 48 is second in the ACC and right now the caves 57 and full court pressure by Cornell just to take some time off the clock but an aggressive drive against the Zone by Miller so Hanson just picked up a support Mike for Cornell and this is the Hazel lefthander two going in there righty I guess you could call him an impact transfer as well Mike he spent three years at George Mason second year in the Miami program Miamis had really good luck getting guys from people from George Mason to come down here well their coach did lead him to the final four did lead that program to the final four yeah I you know what I did that game for CBS the sideline reporter and what an atmosphere up in the up uh up in the DC area beating UConn its 2006 they beat Michigan State North Carolina and Utah myself thats the other end after the first time theyve been able to get out and run in this half good transition deep in our offense Applause big time answer though from three Dolmen you know it looked every time it looks like Miami is going to take this game by the throat uh Cornell has come up with an answer four straight games and double digits for the Miller long turnaround happens up to 28 points yeah lets see if uh he starts looking for his offense and its just a layup drill in a space like that Music Applause was taken away Raglan got in the way of that one and heres Dolan not a lot of oops Watson scoop timeout Miami and thats you know thats thats big Dolan their leading scorer on the season with a big red is 17 as long as 28 George Miller has 20 remember theres the fourth different player of the season to get 20 or more in a game Longs done it twice for Miami this year long did it against Maryland and the only loss so far this year from Miami and also tonight thats what Joseph on the Baseline this is back Catch and Release back iron Wong OMeara in tight quarters got that missed back trying to go up strong and got fouled and hit the deck so it looks like omear will go to the freethrow line Kanes out in front here 7 35 to go in our second half out of high school in Connecticut thats how long yeah a house visit uh came to see me and see me play 72 year old from the Bronx New York to high school Archbishop Malloy played for a legendary coach there Jack Kearns part of his life sixth round pick of Detroit back in 1971 for his Collegiate playing days of Providence and ironically picked up the victory against the Friars earlier this season number 700 in larnegas head coach and I cant remember if Dave Bing was still a concussion or playing then probably a little after his career the threepointer from the big red and both feet he is big red isnt he for Cornell and theyve theyve picked up right where they left off 410 in this half from behind the arc sudden eight point game this is the Miamis been having a tough time with this matchup Zone getting anything inside Wong got the defender in the air and then he knocks down the three ball oh and that was a big time bailout that possession was going nowhere huge time for him to rekindle his first half wow Applause Ragland right back at you Wong had very little time to celebrate his new career high 31 points on 1014 shooting and four of six on threes he may make 40 tonight had a wardrobe malfunctioned overcame it with a new set of kicks missed on the first attempt omear I got your back Isaiah Wong Applause well you look at one and thats hes only missed five shots on the evening four or six from behind the arc and that was huge at the end of the clock and then again OMeara has been you know I said hes been quiet 17 points 11 rebounds for him theyre at the freethrow line with a double double cannot complete the old school three points play tonight is his 40th career DoubleDouble Mike transfer from Arkansas state to Sunbelt player of the year last year that was touched on the end line by Cornell Miami basketball or meet omir now with five double doubles this season Isaiah Wong career high 31 points a previous career high of 30 for Wong that was against Louisville last season and and theyve needed every one of those points in this game I mean just you talk about that career high with his season average and its still a 10point game thats pretty amazing Miami two points away from the century mark something they have not hit since February of 2020 and it took triple overtime as Virginia Tech to get there to score 102 I foul against the wall and just a bailout foul at that time again you know was he on this night was he probably going to make that shot yeah but to get the reach in at three seconds left on the shot clock take your chances with him making it a third foul for Williams for Cornell along its after a very modest game at Louisville with 10 points and five rebounds now and in the game Miami 88 as a team from the freethrow line 22 of 25 so heres your last regulation 100 point game back to 2015 against Mississippi State which was in November of 2015 Applause trying Music so long now has his fourth personal in the process and puts them in the penalty so Cornell going to be shooting one at least one and one for the rest of the game until they get to a double bonus 506 on the game clock and zero Williams for Cornell will be at the freethrow line Poplar jumps up off of that bench and okay so pack has gone to the bench it was Williams trying to drive by pack Im supposed to look at it Music looked like you got really hit hard on that play Music so the key things to think about Mike with a flagrant on a flagrant one its excessive and or unnecessary yeah its like two its severe that I dont think that qualifies playground too maybe not even flavored one well but yeah but you get above the shoulder area and foreign Music Tony Henderson and Greg Evans went to the respective puddles to explain the situation to the coaches its Jim larranaga Brian Irwin is seventh year leading to Big Red all right Applause three and three from the line for Williams Music Brian Earl who has the threepointers made School record at Princeton 281 player of the year now yeah its senior year 99 it was a little bit about threepointers and it you know it certainly I think it really helps especially in that conference to have a guy who played in the ivy league who understands everything that thats about so both teams now might have made 12 threes long is responsible for four of them on six tries for Miami Joseph on the handle is four for four from Beyond The Arc they got uh you know right now too long out of the game those four fouls back long rebound he goes after it see those those are the type of rebounds you know you may gonna you might lose one inside with omira but those long rebounds off threes your perimeter guys for Cornell have to come up with that ball shot clock at six transfer driving lost the handle out of bounds now it stays with Miami 09 on the shot clock enough time for a quick catch and shoot yes you must have point three for the catchy shoot theyve certainly got in excess of that well now you know and right now Hanson is on omir you you have to give yourself up and make sure that you keep him off the glass at all costs because all Miami really just wants to get this up on the on the board and let him go after him Keynes have the 10 rebound advantage in that category of the game Music again point nine on shock box 419 of the game clock and a 10point game and try to get it to pack trying to shovel it up on the backboard and that one went up in the vicinity of the shot clock back to Cornell at the head of the field going in for the slam and a foul omear tried to meet men and at The Rim Music foul was called second on omear and you know I thought he took off a little far out to get that dunk but in Dewey so drew the call and they lost track of him he was waving nobody saw him back after that play it was a good look ahead to get him that try you saw him Mike I saw you pointing at him down in the corner there first freethrow attempt of the night for Manning and thats a very kind watsko Center bounce if its a Cornell Mike theyve just been hanging around all night Miami could have run away with this one as I say and there was a stretch there where it was a 13point game you looked like you know it looked like Miami is going to stretch it to 20 but at every turn Cornell would knock a three Poplar he gets the jam omir found him Applause all right Hanson tries to save it and does the Dolan Joseph challenged Williams trying to stay with him front rim follow Henson Applause Music 3 45 to go in the game Applause both teams to Pace the game catching up with him a little bit right now inside nice path knocked Away by Manning score of the bucket Jordan Miller gets credit take the over its been fun though and give credit to Cornell and Miami they built a 21 point lead Cornell came back headed into single digits for a while were over here yucking it up but Im guaranteed is doing a lot he predicted it he said guys be ready for a tussle with a big red deep in the shot clock Dolan he got it well its an eightpoint game Cornell right now they dont care if they throw along and score over the top but they get the steal out front Williams Joseph got back to block it cleanly Big Time Save Right There Applause we had waited just another 10 seconds we could have had CPI Security right there Mike three blocks on the year three players on the deck fighting for the basketball and the arrows going the other direction with 222 in the game clock and this turnover out front you think its a you know its a plan he goes there and what a terrific save that time coming in with the left hand too Applause fantastic defensive playback Hensley Joseph done it on both ends 44 on threepoint attempts Music threes is a new career high for Bensley Joseph Music great first step score that basket and a foul against Miami its on the floor no shots no shots Joseph picked up the foul his third Mike what do you think of all those numbers they have just worn out the uh goodness the scoring and clock here and you know for again wed say for Brian Earl to have a chance in this game this is what it had to look like Applause Casey picked up the foul for Miami s at the free throw line held the and you know the one to keep an eye on Isaiah Wong with those four personal fouls hes got to be really careful in the last two minutes I just went and snared that Miss for men put on a little dribbling Clinic here and hes got to be careful too if hes going to attack the basket you know they havent drawn a lot of charges in this game but inside of two minutes now boltzing still up above 50 shooting in this game shot clock to three long at least three feet behind the line long rebound Joseph had it for Allman Williams took it away up ahead Dolan tap pass man and he got it right back thats for three and its off the mark to omir but somehow mannon gets it and he got fouled how did that happen under the basket how did everything happen up to that point it was kind of sleight of hand and that was with omir underneath that in rebounding position look at this back and forth the three you get the missile mayor its perfect right there in the steal and the hoop Music Mana just kind of knocked it away from omir Mike yeah 16 point well I know Mary he brought the ball down brought it into play and uh they took advantage of it marinadega just called the timeout with 131 to go in regulation two Music Applause 10498 the lead was as big as 21 early in this half for Miami it appeared that the canes were going to roll away from the big red on the strength of Isaiah Wong and his 33 points a new career high dont forget as soon as we are finished youll see most of you Towson and Clemson more ACC basketball check your local listings for the game and time in your area second game of our doubleheader tonight midweek in the ACC and think about this too I mean for Cornell they start exams tomorrow so theyre after this game theyre theyve theyve got to go to the end of the classroom get some work done I think they started exams tonight Mike in this challenge against an ACC team one of the top teams in the entire conference I kind of said it as a throwaway both teams get into a hundred that was the pay and normally the early Pace doesnt carry through over 40 minutes man had missed on the attempt to finish off the threepoint play thatll keep an eye on that game clock is Joseph Paul ends up with Wong in the corner for three Id say along his fifth made three of the ball game and normally youd say run some clock but with Wong on this evening they needed that lift theres still 20 seconds left on the shot clock and he comes up the big three 36 points Isaiah Wong that includes a shoe change in the second half thats Manning Up and Under and Over omir and a timeout Cornell and with Cornell at 100 points theyre the first opponent in this building to score a hundred against the canes here at the watsco center but Isaiah Wong has been enormous Mike 36 points well hes tripled his average coming in and almost 36 points a new career high for him hes been Flawless in this game very efficient to five of eight from three hes gotten to the freethrow line hes perfect there and and then heres that three with still a lot of time left on the clock but his team reeling and uh knocks it down and along with that Tom six rebounds six assists for him what a night on a night of many stars on display shining the brightest is Isaiah Wong he is our hearties star to watch 36 points 11 of 17 five of eight from three for Wong and you mentioned the rebounds as well Mike the assist hes got six I mean that is a healthy stat line and a career high with the 36 for Wong and he hasnt missed a free throw either nine of nine Applause and then you know the big if we talked about the difference the threepoint shooting and the overall shooting numbers are the same the big Advantage for Miami in this game has been at the freethrow line Applause Cornell 10 of 13 from the line Mike as you mentioned 22 of 25 for Miami from the stripe long he is 36 tonight the most by an ACC player so far this season for the five made threes ties his career high for a single game now were inside of a minute Music Manning with the Steal drives drives somehow got it back at the corner Applause Hanson for three he comes up short Williams comes flying in Dolan gets it thats not the way to Manning puts it inside for the champ to Fillion seems like every 5050 ball is going Cornells way here in the last minute and a half its a fivepoint game one three on two tropical Walker he tried to find omir Dolan ended up with it Applause timeout taken this is crazy action Cornell takes a timeout 179 on the game clock 107 102 Music theres the letter we saved how many times in his last minute and a half since they come up this ball flying everywhere but a red jerseys on the other end of the receiving lines great finish inside Music and then just uh you know right then I dont think you know Miami didnt need to be in attack mode at that point you know still plenty of time I mean you can go for the quick two here you dont need the three right now if you got it fine Cornell has made 12 threes Mike on 33 tries we told you they were going to attempt 30 or more threes its exactly what theyve done tonight making the 12 threes thats not anywhere near their season high for the big red as coach laronega looks on anxiously now up the guys now pack has not been to the line a lot this year Premier is the is the lowest percentage at 69 so maybe try to get you know if theyre going to foul get to him but first things first inbounds Dolan that is a long three attempt and off the side of the ring and long tried to grab it here now gets it back second chance that also a missed from Booth B now the layin from in deep from Ragland the only thing the only thing in the Cornell with the timeout right there that that just it took nine seconds to get that point so that worked in Miamis favor running time off the clock it is a one possession game after the Ragland Lane a couple of chances from boothby Mike from three missed them both they just finished coming up with the basketball and uh you know long shots and Cornell now has 56 points in the paint Miami with 40 in the game eight seconds remaining what do we say Mike its going right down to the final minutes how about the final seconds last one yeah and now for Cornell you have to keep everybody in front of you cant get but obviously no long passes over the top as soon as on that entry passed foul as quickly as you can remember this is just the second alltime meeting between the programs havent played since 1962 when Miami won at the Miami Beach convention hall now the other thing too though Cornell fouls theyre not in the double bonus yet so its going to be it would be a oneonone for Miami so if Im you know if Im them right now Im gonna try to funnel the ball to omir and take a foul on him Gaines have been to the line 25 times tonight Applause so Miller is going to go to the free throw line 87 for him but as we said its a oneonone situation its five of six tonight from the line 22 points four players in double digits for coach laronega Music Applause 22 points Jordan Miller we score on the season for Miami well above his season average of 138 points per game Music takes a timeout hit alert the freethrow line Music trying to stay perfect at home Mike theyre 50 on the watskill center floor dont forget at the conclusion of this one the second game of our double header thatll be Towson and Clemson Clemson had that uh you know the good win over Penn State and overtime in the Big Ten Challenge and then following that up with the win against Wake Forest Pete they need pj Hall to stay healthy for the whole year and this guy Hunter Tyson has done a nice job for them to see conference action for Brad Brownell the Clemson Tigers and losing streak to the ACC and hanging in there until the very end of this one Cornell actually led the first half 1813 and they closed the Gap right now to a one possession game with Miller at the freethrow line he was fouled in the backcourt its a oneonone situation for Miller five of six for the free throw line tonight Applause Music two bounces off the rim an old near and I think the foul Now with an 87 free throw shooter Im you know I think thats why Jim larenegger called that time out now you dont want to put the negative thought in there but Im sure he said if he misses take the foul Applause was only the fourth Miss of the night for Miami 2226 from the freethrow line but its going to be in a double bonus so Cornell is shooting two regardless of what they do in the first free throw Williams has four for four from The Strife in 17 points Hanson is coming back in heres the thing that Cornell still he knocks this one down next foul Miamis still in a oneonone situation yes an intentional miss out of bounds off of Miami and theyre going to look at it and they can review that final two minutes Applause regulation in OT and if this holds up oh boy that look at it thats tough tell now you must have Mike indisputable video evidence to overturn the call which is in favor of Clemson at the moment from that angle there you know it almost looked like Hanson might have been the last one to touch it Music lets get another look at it OMeara and white Hanson in red it almost it almost looked like Hanson knocked it out of his hand and that omir didnt touch it after that thats gonna be a close call again the evidence has to be there that Valentine isnt the scorers table Tony Henderson is there as well you got to have the evidence to overturn the call now heres another lets lets look ahead if youre Cornell my logic my thinking was on the road go for the win you know I like that logic rather than go for the tie go go for the win youre probably going to be able to get a decent look at three youve also made 12 threes tonight Mike Miamis made 13 heres a look see now theres the hand and then well you got on that one I mean look it didnt look like Hanson got it on his follow through and theyre going to say yeah yeah Im looking at it a few times I think thats the correct call but it wasnt that wasnt easy it was close definitely close but its ruled off omear see the anxiety in the face of well my friend wow Music so Cornell has 12 made threes on 35 tries Miamis made 13 threes Cornell basketball 48 seconds to go and trailing by two Dolan on the inbounds block omir made the block he went out to challenge the shooter Watson and he blocked it wow and the clock reads double zero and Miami wins by two North Shadow Mirror the block foreign what a game saving with the left hand too a gutsy claw he looked like he was drifting could have been drifting into the shooter but gets up does a nice job of avoiding him
