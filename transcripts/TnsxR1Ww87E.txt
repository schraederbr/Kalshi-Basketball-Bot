Music live from the corner of 10th and Fowler happy to have you with us in midtown Atlanta opening tip controlled by the jackets and Amari Abram transfer from Old Miss at point guard for the jackets he floats it high and an alyo gets her night started taon Claude with the easy bucket great execution off the tip uh coach staly dialed one that dialed that one in first play of the game I was screened by Kenny Blakey so a former player at Duke uh we know his name but you must have been able to set some good screens cuz I missed that one one change in the lineup for Howard from their first game Isaiah Warfield in a point guard ahead of Joshua strong and some nice moves there by Shai Odum the preseason M player of the year and he is a high energy guy a banger a Bruiser he makes it happen in the paint thats where he does his damage a feed down low kaasi Reeves and the yellow jacket attacking the Rim Early yeah and uh really good job reading the defense off the ball thats now two back door Cuts penetrating passes through the defense and a nice finish by the Florida Gator transfer kaasi Reeves yeah Dom Campbell charged with the foul kaasi Reeves in his first game as a jack at 15 points led the team with 33 minutes and you see that hairstyle there didnt see that on opening night John but as Reeves hits the free throw want to point out 31 games in Florida last year 10 different hairstyles there were cobwebs Hearts Xs all sorts of things so you can expect that throughout the season as its fed down low and Odum Chris pass crosscourt doer off the back iron and the rebound to kabari starting lineup for the jackets no different than what we saw on Monday four transfers in and taian Claude who posted a double double Monday night is on his way hes got four and Reeves gets the assist on that I like what Techs doing concerted effort to attack the rim get to the basket put pressure on the Bison defense early Tom Campbell the transfer from Notre Dame logged four minutes against the jackets in South Ben last January and a Baseline Drive and finish Isaiah Warfield and he draws the foul as well its going to be charged to Claude and Warfield came off the bench was the sixth man in the opener against Hampton played 25 minutes in that game six of six from the free throw line so well see if he can continue that perfect from the line on this season Warfield spent three seasons at Liberty he describes himself as a Dirty Work type of player leaves the free throw short and a jump ball here this will be Howard ball as Reeves and odm were tied up and Coach Blakey has made comments about recruiting transfers winning programs and Warfield certainly at Liberty had NCA tournament experience League Championship quality play over there so getting guys from winning programs whether thats high school and or colleges uh with the transfers is is his DNA long two from Docker wont go loose ball on the floor scooped up by kapari driving and he turns it over right into the hands of my Stewart just checking into the game odm goes with the left too strong Abram and he will slow it down to Reeves Miles Kelly 25 points his first touch goes Baseline underneath and Claude has it ripped away and that is bison basketball good Hustle by Claude on the perimeter really like his addition to this Tech roster he brings a lot of Versatility hustle athleticism some of the things Damon St AWI was looking to address in the offseason when he took the job defense and shooting already a better start offensively for the yellow ja as they had just two points media Timeout on Monday Odum from the elbow and a nice Nifty hip pass down low and finished by Bryce Harris J Georgia Southern had success getting into the cracks getting in the seams early on in the contest on Monday night and you saw that again on that possession Howard getting in the pain another back door Applause cut just carving them up on the back door action Miles Kelly those 25 points on Monday night 19 of them came in the second half and that looks like that was something Jord Tech worked on the last couple of days straightway three and down the well Isaiah Warfield the Bison shot 50 from Beyond The Arc nine of 18 from the floor in their season opener yeah they can shoot they went 56 from the field is claw a little Euro stpp and mushes his way towards the 10 hes got six now well team shooting the ball well here the start contrast from what we saw in those game one Jitters against Georgia Applause Southern first up coming to the table for Coach Damon statamire Warfield doesnt have a dribble he got the screen set there from Stewart seven to shoot Harris has it knocked away and its Georgia Tech coming up with a loose ball and Reeves an early way to stretch your legs as he elevates kaasi in transition Georgia Tech doing a nice job getting off the ball early pushing Tempo early on in this one plus four advantage jackets have hit six of their first seven Shots tonight OD to the Lane and off the window hes got two Applause Howard five of eight from the floor as well so both teams have come out hot another cut into the lane a kick out gari tons of time he left it short Stewart there for the board Reeves lost his footing but was uh able to hold on and get the pass off before the travel violation and Bryce Harris left alone and a twoand flush ties us at 13 both teams going into this media timeout will have to address you know dribble penetration too many buckets easy at The Rim on both sides we didnt see very much of that from Georgia Tech in the first half against Georgia Southern as Abram and Claude not on the same page warin wants to push Tempo and its deflected Away by Abram and thatll bring us to our first media timeout Georgia Tekken Howard tied at 13 and already the Rim is Music rocking again here in the early going yeah hes versatile big he uh finds the seams he can finish at the rim with the dunk obviously you see there um but hes got a nose for the ball thats what really stands out about his game he gets in there does the Dirty Work led the Southern Conference in rebounds last season and the transfers as a whole for Georgia Tech such a key component to this years success four of them in the starting lineup youve got eie danana and Carter Murphy also Off the Bench but John for Jordan Tech to be successful this group needs to come together and find some cohesion yeah and I think collectively those transfers had 19 of 34 rebounds for Tech in the opener so just addressing size length rebounding and defense were things that coach star wanted to do and and definitely accomplished it 11 of the 13 points early on in this one coming from trans transfers in Claude and and Rees so uh thats why they were ranked the top 20 transfer class uh kudos to coach STM and his staff for getting it done first free throw good from Warfield that foul charged to Kyle stelt you know one number that really jumped out to me about taihan Claude on Monday night zero personal fouls he drew five and thats a winning stat uh you know thats not one people are going to talk about coaches will see that uh experts like yourself will see that if you if you drag my finger to that call In The Box Store I can find it I promise you just just show me the way John but no thats thats uh thats a winning uh winning stat right there good call out all screen from danana and the elbow jumper around the rim and in for Kyle Sturdivant sturdivants a veteran guy transfer from University of Southern Cal hes a senior played his high school ball at weager High School uh just a a great player Im sorry not wheeler Norcross High School another thorough bread here in the state of Georgia Metro Atlanta how about that pure J from shy Odum Reeves thinks about it lets it fire and he swirls it home jackets able to match three for three there but need more resistance on the defensive end and Harris is going to go to the line for another Bryce Harris preseason all MC and you know John I think a lot lot of ACC fans may not be familiar with the Leaps and Bounds and the growth of Howard the last couple of years I mean theyre just three four years removed from going 4 and 29 they won 20 games last year and they returned some important pieces including Bryce Harris this will be a stiff test tonight for Georgia Tech yeah and Coach Blakes done a a tremendous job uh number one with his staff you know hes got a guy like Rod balanis who spent 17 years at noted aim associate head coach hes a former Yellow Jacket himself played for Bobby kremens back in the day during those Kenny Anderson Dennis Scott glor years 1990 final four trip for the jackets stants got that 15footer working right now and big toe was on the line there from Marcus Dockery hes a guy you really got to look out for when it comes to shooting the three ball hes only taking Two Shots tonight the coach blakney says hes one of the best Shooters in the country and I tell you what the stats back it up he shot 44 from long distance since last year yeah second in the Mak and threepointers made uh the former turp Maryland transfer St devant leaves that one short Harris with the rebound Carter Murphy is checked in for the jackets first time weve seen him on the floor this year transfer from Air Force raring number four Dom Campbell chisling away on danana theyre banging hes going up and hes cashing in for two very methodical plot the double team did not come high quality shot Howards hit seven consecutive shots T teex hit six of eight both these teams shooting 75 from the floor and and John you mentioned it during the break the defense has got to improve on both sides I mean yeah youre seeing penetrating passes again right there dribble drive a pass into the paint uh both sides of the ball are going to have to get active hands uh and really prevent the dribble penetration yeah that real estate down low is trading at a discount right now and thatll be go tending on danana and that gives daer his first two points of the night and here comes Jordan harston transfer from University of Texas Tyler this is his fourth school and now Jordan Tech is called a timeout and you mentioned Jordan heirston is grassroot Roots High School play out of Flint Hill Dennis Scott the former Georgia Tech great and then former walkon Brian deik uh we also a part of that Flint Hill Rich tradition played for the legendary Stu veter lot of 90s yellow jacket flavor in the building tonight as far as Howards concerned this what were talking about 22 and 13 last year they won the Mak first time theyve done that since 1992 and made their third ever trip to the NCAA tournament and John when that season ended coach Blakey was under the impression they would bring all five of their starters back theyd be ready to go for an even greater season that wasnt the case they had three starters hit the portal Elijah Hawkins to Minnesota Steve settle to Temple Jordan wood to two lane and so coach blatney said there was no time to Exhale after the season I mean it was Breakneck recruiting out there all summer until early August yeah and that may be the biggest challenge for your successful low major mid Majors they you know ultim if a high major comes calling that may be the dream but another turnover right there for the jackets fast break layup Bon up four Harrison with the steel and the points he was second on UT Tyler last year with 21 swipes powered by four stur ofan that one wont fall and the rebound corraled by Joshua strong coming off the bench tonight he started Monday night against and their rivalry win 92 to 80 over the Hampton Pirates Harris Baseline no problem he cant finish though and those looks little too easy for the Bison if youre Jordan Tech yeah Yellow Jackets given up 25 points and 8 minutes of play um the effort not quite there like it was in the opener on Monday night yeah coach statam he said that the defense got an A from him which was surprising cuz in preseason he like the offense was ahead of the defense but the bottom line right now Howard ahead of Georgia Tech the Bison shooting 69 from the Music field delivered a furious rally at the end of the season but ultimately it was not enough Debo Coleman Force into a new role this year John hes coming off the bench and his effort on Monday night 17 points including three threepointers it got special recognition from Damon statamire in the postgame press conference saying look thats a tough spot for D its difficult when you go from me a starter to the bench but I want him to think like hes our sixth starter yeah thats a good way to put it and thats the value of uh having maturity having gone through a couple Seasons credit Deo with 17 points and then Georgia Tech right there uh another illadvised turnover no awareness coming out of the timeout shot clock violation so Techs got to connect the dots here mentally uh just coming up short right now and then defensively the efforts uh they got to dig in a little bit more prevent that dribble penetration we got a moving screen there Dom Campbell picks up his second foul you also noticed that a point was added to Jordan Tech during the break they changed what was originally ruled a two point basket from kaasi Reeves to a threepoint basket so that is our threepoint margin Campbell will head to the bench with his second foul theres kaasi Wy you mentioned uh Debo and coming off the bench you got like stur event coming off the bench Miles Kelly is returning in the starting lineup but the recruiting class uh and the transfers iron sharpens iron and when theres competition and practice over time youre going to see everyone get better Kelly misses the floater especially because you know all reports you hear from the coaching staff theres not really a whole lot of Separation on this Tech roster as Jordan harston drills a three hes now three for three on the season from Beyond The Arc and Howards lead is up to six their largest of the night a nice feed from post to post and a jam from Tai claw and miles St took the poster on that one said post a post I saw a poster number four at what point does a and a stone cold response Joshua strong sinks of three look Howard they can do this theyre one of the top shooting teams in the country we sh saw them shoot 50 from three on Monday and Amari Abram three the hard way Music Howard bison youre not going to shake them up mentally uh theyre led by a guy named Kenny blakney who grew up playing for Morgan Wooten at damaa the most wins in high school history and then he goes onto his college Years at Coach K so his pedigree hes been in big games hes been in competition and you know he exudes that in his coaching style you just see Poise out there by the bison and for a dama the grad to be coaching at a DC University John get much better than that and what a cell just uh recruiting wise DC HBCU NCA tournament you know its Nows the Time lightning in a b in a bottle for the Howard bison to hit the recruiting Music Applause Road fourpoint lead for Howard after the and one from Abram another triple that ones Off the Mark and clauds got the board taian Claud just stuffing the stat sheet right now eight points three assists and a rebound to boot and Abram cant finish at The Rim itll stick with Georgia Applause Tech Tech did a nice job especially in the second half executing out of side out of bounds Baseline out of bounds situations well see how they do on this possession but they were able to set some good screens get some good looks out of situation play in the opener after a brief appearance Ibrahim oako heads back to the bench the freshman Music from kakri Guinea and Tara gari Music returns Kelly a wideopen look from the logo off to the right claw the offensive board one area where Claude excelled last year Western Carolina was the offensive glass Kelly Chris passed to a cutting claw and it is rejected shy Odum with a denial on the other end Stewart pretty far south but he gets the Applause contact we take a look at it again Shai Odum goes up and gets the best of that possession right there got off his feet a little bit quicker different result on that possession bison with the stand at The Rim Stewarts free throw does not fall got a sub coming in for Stuart here it appears while Stewart just about eight minutes a game last season he did post his career high 11 points a year ago today and he hits the second Stewart takes a seat Bryce Harris back into the game for Howard I like what Stewart did there though you know he may have got dunked on but he just keeps competing gets to the line earns him back uh thats what youre supposed to do as a player so credits to it yeah Im not sure how often that happened to you John but for others of us you know getting over a poster is just sort of a hat one of my first ACC Road games vivid memory at Wake Forest uh Tim Duncan was a senior and uh I was definitely the recipient of a couple posters in that game so what youre telling me is you were you were baptized that day yeah but you know I just got the ball out of bounds took it out of the net and was hoping no one saw it start the break if somebodys going to make you feel wet behind the years nobody better than Tim Duncan I suppose theres a guy named Vince Carter uh that I had to guard as well that didnt turn out well for me either you go back to ishma Muhammad though he had that on the Yellow Jacket Side open three for Claude connects taan Claude keeping the yellow jackets in this game hes got 11 points how about Claude five of seven from the floor its a one for one from Beyond The Arc now hes got two boards three assists to go with it Odum Nifty bounce pass and Harris draws the contact theyll get two shots here right there on that action the ball screen inside the three on the wing Tech just not doing the job getting hung up Debo gets hung up on the screen no one catches it so youre looking at offensively 10 footed in and its you know you can either shoot it or pass it Tech has to do a better job catching that penetration before the the offensive guy turns the corner so in that situation either Debos got to avoid getting H up on the screen or maybe some extra help coming for Claude from maybe gapar is what youre saying yeah absolutely and and 15 ft and in a division one player can make a play you know you just got to put it up on the backboard defense is scrambling theres offensive rebound opportunities the key in that situation at 15 ft out is dont let the offensive player turn turn the corner Howards hit five and eight free throws tonight hanging cant hit owed him another rebound high percentage shot though on that possession for the jacket just didnt drop Warfield the Music left Docker he finds some oxygen he cant hit battle for the board Harris has got it for Howard oh he nearly had a special and one opportunity but the Howard bison looking for their first win over a power five opponent in 15 years theyre on their way greatness is a field so Harris will be at the line for two after that foul was charged to Tara gari as he went to break Bryce Harris he had 23 points to lead the Bison in their win over Hampton gets the second free throw hes now got nine tonight a fivepoint lead for Howard Music Abram lends it over to Kelly he finds a step the pass Claude cant finish Warfield leading the break out for Howard solid possession by the jackets uh getting into the paint high high percentage shot again just didnt finish aiek goes down lob in the short Corner Odum Harris pulls the trigger wont fall and Mari Abram the rebound for as well as Howard began tonight offens they havent had a field goal in nearly 3 minutes is that threepointer from Reeves wont Applause fall Marcus daeri beats Claude finds Harris man it has been crisp passing inside the lane for Howard John well again dribble penetration uh the weak side Georgia Tech defense no help theres theres no one covering and there was no contest Kelly left it short gets his own Miss up again and this time hes got two Joshua strong running the point here for Howard Bon sh in 64 Applause Music tonight now Odum left his feet loose ball Kellys got it on the Run falling down and he draws the foul its going to be charg to Odum and Miles Kelly maybe that gets him going he has four points right now but at two consecutive possessions he gets on the in the scoring column again in the opener 25 points he was nine of 18 from the field he had four triples plays like this maybe gets the confidence going gets the Rhythm and thats what Georgia Tech needs their star to step up and start dropping buckets he set a School record in free throw percentage last year making 53 of 59 lot of Subs coming in for the jackets as e danana Ibrahim asako and Kyle sturdavant are in and again these line changes this needs to become the advantage conditioning make it a make it a a factor in the game fouls on the Bison needs to become a factor and over time Georgia Tech needs the guys off the bench to just raise the level and intensity of play Miles Kelly missing that free throw hes already missed three free throws this year missed all six last year hariston into the lane and hes blocked from behind by Reeves but a nice job backing up the play Bryce Harris collects an easy Applause bucket stent with space just inside the free throw line thats his spot danana turns it over second chance no and still loose stent retrieves it Kelly steps into a triple Off the Mark stay with Georgia Tech just one of those nights right now Beyond The Arc two of seven now for the jackets 28 uh but you would think his feet were set hes had a couple wide open looks from three miles Kelly uh thats the guy you wants shooting those shots just hav drop it was a second half on Monday night when he really got going hit four of six threes in the final 20 minutes and a block there called on Jordan harston thats his second and the yellow jackets and the Bison will be shooting from here on out this Georgia Tech roster its a roster with veterans scoring is not going to be a problem its defensive side of the ball is where theyre going to have to continue to grow and mature and practice and learn there you see St event he drops the bucket again a veteran guy making plays the offensive side of the ball is not going to be the challenge for this roster well coach stamar was asked after the first game if he had an ideal rotation length you he likes seven guys 8 n 10 and he really dismissed the question as danana gets a piece of that layup attempt from Marcus Docker itll be Yellow Jack at basketball but he really said it depends on who were playing you know if were playing a smaller team well play small were playing a larger team well play big hes plenty comfortable using a malleable approach to this lineup in this roster given the dep yeah and were talking about a guy thats been around the game hes played at every level hes coached at the Collegiate level he knows what hes doing and you know when you start a season its a blank canvas to paint on and it takes time but to have a guy like Carl Hobbs on your bench you know a 30 plus year vet in the biz NCA tournament finalist Champion theyre going to get it done it just takes time Kyle Stan has now taken eight shots and John Ed wager say all eight of those red on AC logo inside the free throw line Shai Odin returning for the Music Bison thir of EMP into danana the transfer from NC State Kelly guarded by Warfield Howards best defender and still Kelly finds a little bit of breathing room just enough to float it in the lead down to two see if the jackets will be able to string together consecutive Music stops AIS trying to get it to and Odum it wont go Miles Kelly rebound good active Hands by The Freshman Sako there on defense interrupting that pass Kelly little behind the back shimmy leaning in Kelly couldnt get it the fall its still loose he heaves it high oh that would been a highlight but another rebound from the seat of his pants hes battling here no whistle and the call a jump ball the legendary official Teddy Valentine getting in there quick calls to jump jackets coming back twopoint game 340 to play rems Court in Music Atlanta he given up 57 from the field and uh you know only three transition buckets for the jacket so you know how does that equate youve got to get stops uh to get transition buckets and so thats what we saw in the opener for the jackets they scored 52 points in the second half of that one because they got stops and got the tempo of play going and I think its safe to say for Coach statam this year hed be more than happy to get in a track meet again with the depth and the athleticism hes got him his Rock that that plays to Jord Tech strengths I would agree I think play to your strengths youve got depth you have athleticism and theres Shooters on this roster and youre going to find open Shooters in transition because they have veteran guards that have been through it Stan takes it back from Claude three and a half to play Howards lead has been as large as seven cerent trying to tie it up Claude went up lost it 6 seconds to shoot CLA again bumped hard doesnt get the roll oh but he will get the foul and thats now going to be is that four fouls on Bryce Harris number 34 no thats his first Meer right now the our stab monitor says they went to Warfield but Im with you thought if we saw the replay on that one Bryce Harris had the contact right kind of at the oval in the middle of the paint but well see if they go back and adjust that but Teddy Valentine is is very rarely wrong so I think were going to be on the wrong side of that call fair enough you know what 43 years well follow the legend referee in college basetball when you when you get over the four decade mark it doesnt matter we defer we defer onepoint game eight to shoot Odum backing down tries to go underneath and a foul there against Georgia Tech thats going to go on taian Claude thats his second and the Bison really had nothing going right there Claude with the Music bailout TV Teddy and Shai odm he was the Mak Rookie of the Applause Year and it was a pretty winding Journey for Odum to get to Howard he dealt with a serious knee injury at which point some of his scholarship offers rescinded at some high major levels he also lost a dear friend in a car accident ENT Terrence Clark it was an emotional Journey for him and you know we talked to Coach blaty about and he says the amount of growth he has seen Shai Odum experienced the last 12 months is one of his proudest moments as a college coach as Taco gets the offensive rebound tugging away and I think we got a foul coming here I think this ones going to be on I think it was on Bryce Harris I think he signaled 14 oh yeah thats on yes theres the correction okay its on Bryce Harris and going back to your statement on Coach Blakey and talking about you know proud moments in his time at Howard and you know the the Dream Factory is is a common saying youll hear on the Bison campus and what thats about is become a Howard man come to this campus the skies the limit opportunities everything and Kenny Blakey preaches that such a great message its its really about hey its more than basketball here sacko hits the front end of the one and one there is coach Blakey this is his first time in this building John since his senior year as a Duke BlueDevil in the mid 90s spring of 95 to be exact do you know the result of that one 95 not off the top of my head although that was actually Dukes last losing season they had a school record 18 losses that was a season where Coach K had to step way due to back in back issues and exhaustion I would have seen a Travis best James Forest Drew Barry team attack another great team the history of the Yellow Jacket program strong rice Harris with two and a chance for three as Kyle Stant got him on the forehead get off me and Miles Kelly on the offs side hes got to be able to make a play on that lob hes got to come in there there and get a hand on it and and step up for your teammate uh so just a little lack of days AG goal position off by Miles off the ball but over time those are the things that will come out in film session you got to improve the game everybody remembers between Jord and Duke when coach blon he was with the Blue Devils was 1993 when Jord took down number one Duke and snap their 23 game win streak as that threepointer ill advised well off the mark But it saved right to Reeves and hes got two look what I found Reeves having a half now 10 points three boards two assists hes now four or five from the floor under two minutes to play here in the first half and weve got a nip and Tuck battle here strong lost the handle for a moment for giving it up to do hell go all the way across Warfield into the lane strong dialing up a three cant hit but he gets the the foul on tar gari coach stmy looking with kind of a blank steer like did you really just foul him 40t from the basket its a man of poise though he just thats a play right there got to find a way to avoid that Music contact Joshua strong at the line for three he didnt have to make much of a case for that foul be called but if anybody can do that maybe maybe the Lost student yeah and a hey play by strong is just ability to stretch the floor back up three feet allowed him to get that shot off so good spacing by the bison and movement off the basketball strong got his Bachelor from the University of Minnesota duth in two years he had 58 credit hours coming out of high school into college hes come to Howard to get his law degree and and really made his way onto the powered roster by going to open tryouts competing and you know the current bison vouching for him and Coach Blake me said okay and lo and behold he starts on opening night against Hampton at the point guard spot 90 seconds and a tough screen layup wont fall Warfield hit the deck there on Sako no foul called Down Low Harris faces up the defense collapses kick out to Warfield wont go batting for the board its Harris strong lays it in the lead back up to Applause four bison just continue to throw a punch Scrappy play Second Chance opportunities offensive rebound into a putback fourpoint lead trying to hold on to lead going in the half stur ofan can hit and power the other way strong with a headful of steam and they will count at the Goen Reeves couldnt get there before it hit the back court right now energy Advantage goes to the bison and theyre manufacturing some offense off the defensive side of the ball yeah clearly goal tending well the Howard bison Revitalize their program and Coach Blakey really talked about how thats about the only thing Howard hasnt excelled in is Athletics historically I mean take a look at what Howard is all about some of the alumni they have brought in and so many other big contributions here to the country youve got 19 division one sports Steph Curry sponsoring both golf teams th Good Marshall Andrew Young the list goes on and on its a rich tradition uh a great institution and the alumni base fully support of Andrew Young not the only Howard Alum who served as the mayor of Atlanta how about the honorary Captain tonight cim Reed on the bench with the Howard bison and we got Andre Dickens the Georgia Tech grad the current mayor of city of Atlanta in the house as well so all the dignitaries coming out to support the jackets and bison even John Babels here well thats we got goals we got goals long way to go I like your optimism though Wy thanks youre a good teammate but speaking of of Atlanta Mars by the way Howards going to stick around tomorrow theyll fly out tomorrow night theyre meeting with Andrew Young a networking opportunity for the Bison wow what just just a moment that all of these student athletes can look back on and and say you know one day I met Andrew Young when I played in Atlanta against Georgia Tech thats great stuff coach Blakey and the staff putting that together 30 seconds a little less stur it goes to the Lane kicks back out Reeves sends a three it wont go the rebound controlled by Howard they can hold for the final shot thats what coach Blakey wants to do so a sixpoint Edge in hand with 10 seconds left Coleman coming way out to press on strong three seconds he kicks and fires no Kelly tries to heave a 34 shot he wants the foul and Teddy Valentine I think ruling that the clock had expired the players in the second half and they all got to do their job and you know when youre highfiving youre smiling youre playing with energy uh the results usually come with that shy odm preseason M Player of the Year pick lays it off the glass and finger rolls at in man kapari a challenged to go on the weight room after that just bounced off hold his ground kars already got three fouls as well and itll stay with Georgia Tech Bryce Harris pleading saying it went off of kaasi reeves fingertip not impressive Kenny Blakey just dialed it in coming out of that uh halftime got something going to the rim high percentage shot bison up eight in control of this one Wy their largest lead of the night orch did not score in the final two minutes of the first half and Kelly misses the floater dangerous pass and Campbell off his fingertips and nearly took down kaasi Reeves into one of our Applause cameramen Sean all right down there he looks like hes okay theres a big smile all right thumbs up all right oh got it in the back hes all right hes back keep tell him hes got to bring some knee pads to work with him Tai on claw can hit it from the free throw line and some shots that were following early John theyre not going down right now for the jackets yeah good look wide open Lane Bryce Harris with the Jam 10point lead for the Bison just laadle off the ball Abram and taon no reaction to step in and show resistance Abram backing out now J Tech needs a bucket instead a turnover for three take a look at this Runway it was wide open for takeoff I mean just just bird watching right there no resistance you got to wonder how can you not step in and contest or take a charge claw with two fouls here starting the second half so hes not necessarily in trouble Music Applause yet six to shoot Docker to threepoint threat hoist one it wont go but wide open offensive glass and easy tip in for shy Odum Odum now with 11 points five boards coach stmi have seen enough of this got to stop the bleeding 12point lead for the Bison in control it is a 60 run to start the second half the largest lead of the night the bison are enjoying Music Applause it first team selection still out with injury and Seth towns as well a transfer from Ohio State hes waiting on a waiver to be approved to play this is his eighth year in college basketball Amari Abram with the J to begin out of the timeout nice execution coming out of the dead ball situation and this is where its going to have to happen for the jackets on the defensive side of the ball stringing together consecutive stops that snaps a fourminute score list out for Georgia Tech entry inside contested loose ball still now with Howard Harris has it and he has it nearly ripped away by oasi Reeves a jump ball called beforehand it will be Georgia Tech basketball but if you could bottle that 5second exchange a deflection a block shot and a tie up you know they havent done that all game and in in 5 seconds active hands you got to you got to know coach dmire challenged him in that last timeout well theyre taking a look at something Applause here theyre going to put N9 seconds back on the shot clock at the time of the jump ball yeah which and Coach Rod Banis associate head coach for Howard contesting that that was a rebounded ball so it should be reset to 20 if it hit the rim of course coach Banis a former Jord Tech Yellow Jacket here from 1990 to 1994 I got a fun note on him John he was the last guy to wear the number 15 before man Haring and harings number in the rafter right former teammate that was tough I was a freshman he was two years older and that was an education guarding Matt Music Harper one of the greats enjoyed a a lengthy NBA career and then was on the broadcast team with the Utah Jazz and he had such a career I can remember him getting a standing over ation his senior year when we lost in the ACC tour or his senior year losing in the ACC tournament the entire Arena got up and gave him a standing o its a nice tribute to his career in the ACC so what theyre saying is Howard called timeout before the jump ball ruling shot clock does not reset though Campbell with five hes got to go up with it trying to find a way the shot clock resets and he muscles his way in for two and he lets that a roar well deserved tough work for Campbell underneath bison right now just willing their way uh to the lead in this one and theyre hunting down a victory Abram stop and pop no and a foul and an injury Marcus dacker grabbing at his right foot its going to be a foul on Debo Colman yeah Deo had contact in the back back with the push off the right call for sure but the injury on the the back end of that play is what hope hes okay that was that was a hard fall Wy going to stop and go start to the second half come here and a look here there you can see the contact and it was Shai Odum who goes up and oh lands right on doys right ankle ouch hope hes okay and thats a lot of weight a lot of force coming down on that one yeah OD him listed at 66 230 good sign here docky trying to get to his feet no weight whatsoever though on that right ankle thats going to take some time and uh you we spoke earlier in the open about the depth and could that play into this one if you have an injury and foul trouble bison a team that only plays six or seven guys in the rotation well see if Docker can come back but thats certainly a big loss for the Bison if hes unable to go doy their leading threepoint shooter at 21 points against Hampton on Monday night and theres been a flagrant foul test to Debo Coleman John you think thats the right call oh you know Im not the official I dont want to say but there was a push in the back and it resulted in an injury so I would go with Applause Music yes so Isaiah Warfield taking the free throws he hits the first but I will say this I dont think Debo had malicious intent I think he was you know probably getting yelled at at halftime and in the timeout you better find a body and I think he was trying to do the right thing unfortunately the injury occurred as a result of that so its one play get to the next play learn from it and move on thats all you can do as a player Wy so a 14point lead for Howard their largest of the night and theyve got the Music basketball and I would say tempo of play right now just methodical milking 20 25 seconds off the clock Advantage bison Tech will need to get things going a little bit odm kick out threepointer well off the mark and shot clock violation Warfield smiling there saying thats on me coach and Coach Blakey says all right I got Music you still a lot of time left to go in this second half but the Yellow Jackets been outscored 10 to2 so far the first three and A2 minutes after halftime its second game of the season its a growth opportunity for this jackets team a lot of veterans out there have played minutes theyve been through situations like this well see how they respond collectively oi Reeves into the lane hangs and hits one at a time one at a time for the jackets thats got to be their focus and the Bison continue doing what youre doing they taking care of the basketball finding mismatches crashing the glass its been super successful three joins Claude as the leading scores for Tech with 12 Odum catch laying wont roll down Abram will he push Tempo little hesi a feed to claw easy lay impressive Court Vision by Abram giving the assist love the unselfish play and thats what we saw on Monday night from the jackets when they really got things going it was making the extra pass running the floor good spacing Kelly pressing on strong the lane is vacated and nice Step Up by Abram he forces the travel against Bryce Harris Georgia Tech showing a little bit of life here they Trail by 10 we step aside from a cish pavilion a Thursday night of college hoops on opening Music week by an individual player Kenny Anderson and he did it against the Howard bison in the only previous meeting between georia Tech and Howard it was January 2nd 1991 Kenny had 42 out of the break Abram wins the ball back Kelly Scoops it high and he draws a foul hell go to the line thats hard to believe you know that that many years have gone by since a 40 Point scorer here with with all the NBA prospects that come through this program over the years especially because that 42point game against Howard that was Kenny Andersons fourth 40point game in in a twoe stretch he had 40 against Georgia a School record 50 against the oy and marry Mount 41 against Villanova and then 42 against Howard but not a single 40 Point scorer since and Miles Kellys now missed four free throws this year he missed all of only six last season has not been his night offensively he hits the second its down to the single bidets for the Applause jackets some heavy pressure applied by Kelly on Joshua Music strong Odin from the center Applause ring o strong one ready for that took it in the Applause ribs 4 seconds to shoot doery back in with that ankle he turns it over Abram but no look past the Claude and hes stuffed by Harris its batted back Coleman a three short another offensive board and Kelly finishes this time off the glass its down to seven and defense again leading to that energy the fans are getting into it Kelly with a great finish took some body on that but I liked Abrams Court Vision he made two great passes on that possession odm around the horn and its kicked by Kelly it seems like Jord takes much more active in the passing Lanes here these last couple of minutes John well I you know sense of urgency is is something that comes to mind we did not see that um you know in the first half but certainly turning on they theyre definitely collectively playing with that sense of urgency and chipping away seven Music points odm will inbound from the Baseline Warfield weaving in and cant find his man another turnover turning up the heat on defense another turnover for the Bison they played a relatively clean game taking care of the basketball getting high percentage shots Georgia Techs pressure starting to impact the game and and you got to wonder thats you know a short bench on the Bison side is the conditioning a factor fatigue mental fatigue physical thats its a 40minute game Wy in the last three minutes as Kelly lays it in oh that was scintillating with the finger roll that was great action off the ball Miles Kelly set up the defender and had a hard curl cross beautiful Action Moving it around threepointer wont go offensive board for Harris gets a second chance opportunity Warfield backing up and Coleman picks it off down the lane hello ball game Debo Colemans cut it to one possession game Penny Blakeley seen enough hes calling the timeout one possession game jackets back in this one and momentum is all with Georgia Tech right now and in the last four minutes Georgia Tech on an 11 to1 run as Coleman seeing one more ch hes not got two dunks in two games but again no buckets in the last four minutes for Howard and five turnovers yeah its the high hands the activity the close outs uh you know you force a long flat pass across the defense and Debo is gets the uh dunk on the other end jackets defensively is is whats the spark plug right now so a threepoint game Music neither team in foul trouble wiy one one team foul on both sides so you know free throws bonus situations may not come into play for a while Georgia Tech creating turnovers in this second half weve seen this story before saw it on Monday night against Georgia Southern forcing 17 turnovers in second halves this year theyve turned over only five times odm will Applause inbound down the left side he lays it in shy Odum the most trusted scorer and that snaps an 110 Run for the yellow jackets Abram Jacks a three no the tip in yes kaasi Reeves the Mak Georgia product Florida Gator transfer raising High Above the Rim on the tip hustle play got a Westside High cool Kelly knocks it loose and rolling over and a foul is called Amari Abram pleading for an explanation its going to be on Miles Applause Kelly well take a look at it right here miles had some contact there oh I like the demeanor of Coach STM regardless of what the call was he just its like stoneface over there nothing you know he he doesnt waver either way I really like his demeanor on the sideline he was asked about that in his press conference after Monday nights win about his stoic presence on the sideline and he offered more than oh its just my demeanor its my personality no he said he did that intentionally because he has learned that quote kids have eyes when youre watching games back on tape the kids are not only watching what they do theyre watching what I do and they can pick up they feel like I dont believe in them so its an intentional stoicism on the sideline and another foul and thats thats wisdom over time you know just love that love that about Coach St its true I mean kids are perceptive and theyre going to feed off the energy of the head coach Music so that last foul on Sako his first Warfield takes a seat threepoint lead for Howard it was is as large as 14 in this second half and the turnovers have allowed Jord te to climb back into Music it threepointer halfway down and out docky cant get it to go and a jump ball itll be Georgia Tech basketball Howard got a good look on that one just didnt didnt drop pretty good execution coming out of the dead ball situation and they Tech now a chance Wy possibly tie this one up they will take that shot from dri all night long he shot 44 from three and a floer that time wont Applause go doery bringing it up for Howard hesitation in a spin odm weaves his way in high off the window Campbell looking for the tap in no and Coleman secures the board a 132 run for the jackets over the last four minutes in change Colemans three buried in it Debo Coleman now with 17 consecutive games with a threepointer and we are tied and he dropped that one from right inside and the the letter c on the Bobby crummond on the court that was deep strong with an answer kaching Big Time shot there from Joshua Applause strong Abram pulls up he leaves it short Harris has got the rebound now eight Boards of the night for Harris Dy racing the other way and kisses it off the Applause backboard lead back to five hows hanging Applause on Abram trying to lure in Campbell fading away he gets the contact no score its going to be on Bryce Harris and that will take us to another media timeout the yellow jackets tied up at 59 but Howard answers right back Music greatness they can come off the bench and be the spark plug hes got fresh legs hes a great shooter and if he gets his shoulder squared feet set hes got a good shot of knocking it down high percentage threepoint shooter and see if he can keep the trend going in the second half here jackets will need all of it Mari Abram Lefty at the line hits the second fourpoint lead for Howard by the way that threepointer Joshua strong hit just before he went to break that snapped a stretch of nine straight missed threepointers for Howard they hit three of their first four only one for their last 10 now Tech really buckled down defensively theyre on the catch defensively High hands all the little things uh make it difficult for the Bison doer it looked good and its a bullseye looks fine T says if youre not there on the catch hand down man down knocks it in Kelly gets the ball screen weaving in and count the basket Miles Kelly with another long move Kellys getting it going hes got 14 points on the evening five rebounds two assists and um you know hes 0 two from Beyond The Arc but hes making Place Marcus dri began his career at Maryland came into his own last year after transferring to Howard a big three and Dom Campbell thats his fourth foul now its a big presence inside that is without any margin for error moving forward and Campbells ability to set screens hes a widebody a great screener um he plays a part in the effectiveness of of Howards half court offense and and shy Odum a red carpet rolled out through the lane the lead swells back to seven for Howard Kelly going turbo and that foul is going to be on Bryce Music Harris thatll be Bryces thirdd foul hes the leading score for the Bison so three fouls with 948 to play coach Blakey has a decision make looks like hes going to going to roll with him and this will be a shooting foul Kelly hasnt quite looked like himself at the free throw line this year its now three for six in the Applause Music night and Kelly now with 16 points to lead the yellow jackets doy really shook his own Music Applause Music Applause Music handle Applause strong tend to shoot lot of perimeter tracing now odms into the lane and its deflected Away by kaasi Reeves hes so long yeah and stent did a nice job on that possession just Manning the dribble hand off not letting the offense get into the seams for the Bison where will Howard go here with 7 seconds on the shot clock they go down low to Odum against Coleman has it jarred loose doer has to send a three a touch Off the Mark gets his own Miss and on the floor a reaching foul there on Debo Coleman yeah unfortunate for Debo he had a nice close out avoided fouling the shooter but forgot to box out Do the Hustle play those the winning plays right there the 5050 balls dockers getting it Applause done so fresh shot clock Odum jacket cut off the lane there Harris looking to penetrate Warfield gets the screen fed back strong another three little wide right Kelly seizes the board under nine minutes to play fivepoint game physical screen no whistle Kelly off the glass Straight Applause Ahead Kellys been the guy for the jackets in the second half stepping up hes been a leader 18 points Applause Music tonight Harris now we really milking the shot clock here recently odm going up against Coleman and they got another foul on Deo Coleman tough match up for Coleman hes given up some pounds on that and deos a strong guy I mean theres a reason hes called Debo but right there nice spin the body Odum making winning plays thats a third foul on Coleman and theyve all come in about the last two minutes Warfield Applause Washed by Reeves gets a step down the Baseline and a turnover pass off the fingertips of Joshua strong a threepoint lead for Howard with the yellow jackets with the basketball as Coleman takes a seat bison now with 12 turnovers in the game beg your pardon Colemans still on the floor he was just near the bench Kelly Hoist the three and into the waiting hands of Reeves he sends it high and hes got the foul hell be at the line when we come back the yellow jackets since its trailing by 14 points have tied it and now its a threepoint Music Music defy can the Howard bison close out what would be one of the most significant victories and program history on the road here against Georgia Tech they lead 6966 and if theyre going to get it John done John theyre going to have to do it with Campbell and Harris and theyve each got four fouls yeah thats a challenge for sure collectively 21 points 12 rebounds eight of those on the offensive glass Campbell and Harris have been a big part of the reason why bison has been able to hold on a threepoint lead but one more foul on each of them and thats all uh thats all she wrote so got to avoid foul trouble jackets continue to attack uh the theyve been the aggressor for most of the second half AI Reeves hits the free throw Tech has a team now 10 of 16 from the line and the rebound to Applause daeri Howard theyve shot the ball so well in the first couple of games of this season can the shots keep falling for him Jordan hariston checking back into the game tracing the Music perimeter KY looking for an angle kicks it out tend to shoot its strong facing up against stent hanging the foul called and the shot wont fall free throws will be so crucial in this one Wy the Bison just 10 of 18 in the game theyve left eight free throws at the line so well see here great crossover in traffic against the veteran Applause Music stur bison 10 of 18 from the line Georgia Tech Nine of 15 so crucial stat down the stretch for sure and bison come up with one its a third foul on Sturdivant toward Tech 16 fouls Music now Howards got just the one timeout left and those are some good looking free throws there from Joshua Applause strong civant along with Claude Reeves Kelly and Coleman this is the group they closed out that Georgia Southern win on Monday night with these five the veteran thant from the elbow sinks it love the discipline the patience get into the seams get a high quality two jacket just three 14 from Beyond The Arc in this one so go do whats working go to the basket odm goes hard to the basket no basket and no foul Kelly to Claud and hes blocked from behind but itll be called a foul its going to go against Shai Odum 22 shy Odum everything hes got to get back in this one and make a play swipes the face of taon Claude at the tail end of the play here at that angle looks like all ball but on the other camera angle you can see the face swipe on the way down Claude now with 15 points after that free throw a chance to tie it for Georgia Tech with just under seven to Music play he missed it Dockery with another Music rebound Joshua strong into the lane feeds off to Odum and he gets the Applause laye Bison still shooting hot man 53 53 from the field in this game um taking high quality shots converting at The Rim Kelly going up into Campbell and if its on him thats his fifth foul and he is out of the game a little banged up as well Savvy play by Kelly drew the contact hobbled on the play though he took some body on that one maybe a need of the the quad on the right side a bang knees right there knee to knee coach Blake KN working with the Notre Dame transfer of course Tom Campbell recruited by Mike Bray over at Notre Dame Mike Bray was the assistant varsity basketball coach when Kenny Blakey was in school at damaa Catholic High School goes back a long way and Mike Bray the success he had at Notre Dame assistant coach for the Bison Rod balanis was on that bench with Bray so comes full circle here with the Bison coaching staff with the the bray and Dean noted a TI and something is not right with Miles Kelly at the free throw line hes now four for n tonight John hes missed more free throws in these two games this week than he missed all of last season 89 last season right hes four for n tonight hes in his head a little bit early on in the season yeah but Jord Tech does retain possession as it went off of Howard threepoint game claws got all sorts of time theyre challenging him hes taking the shot it wont go and its batted back out to sturon nice play by kaasi Applause Reeves Kelly lost the handle Joshua strong contending that went off of Kellys knee but its ruled to be Yellow Jacket basketball statamire calling number 13 a lot down the stretch in this one he really believes in Music Kelly civant eight seconds to shoot hands it off to Claude at the last minute back out 3 seconds on the shot clock cerent hangs it high off the back of the iron wont fall and a foul this time against Georgia Tech as harston went to the deck and they will go to the free throw line bonus situation so taon quad I know he wishes he had that one back fing 75 ft from the Applause Music basket thats claudes third foul no yellow jacket with four fouls but there are four with three including Sturdivant Coleman and Claude kars also got three but we havent seen him in the second half bison 12 of 20 from the line hit in the front end of a one and Music one Jordan Harrison from Fairfax Virginia 72 shooter last year at Texas Tyler and he sinks them both thats a big swing there Miles Kelly Techs best free throw shooter misses them both and Harriston knocks him down fivepoint Music game Kelly catch and shoot no and its going to be Georgia Tech basketball Miles Kelly contending with Teddy Valentine about the lack of a foul call there see who last touched this one oo that is close cant fa Tons effort coming in crashing the boards making a play jackets right there a 5050 ball a win 20 seconds on the clock a chance to convert capitalize on that hustle play you can feel the tension on both benches ratcheting up here as we hit the final five minutes Applause this is going to be a fun finish Music Claude theyre looking for Kelly to get going here theyre leading score and the floater no same team on the rebound Cent trying to save it but its harston with it fed ahead to strong Docker thinking about a transition three instead power to Applause Music Applause reset Kenny Blakeley saying lets go 10 seconds on the clock we got to move haris for 5 seconds hes going to pop the three and the rebound handled by Applause Coleman ball screen stur devant trying to weep around Harris count the basket and thats the fifth foul on Bryce Harris huge play by the senior stur of him timely bucket jackets now have a onep possession game bison in foul trouble down the Applause stretch thats a big play by the seniors stepping up in crunch time a lefty finish too strong and those are the two top front Court presences for Howard Campbell and Harris who are now out of the game with five fouls its going to be up to Shai odm to supply the size down low Kyle Sturdivant meanwhile looking to complete a threepoint play hes got 10 points tonight this is his first free throw attempt this evening hes got it less than five minutes to play twopoint game in for a treat here in the first week of the Season here in college hoops its odm against the Freshman Sako kick out Harrison trying to slash inside Sak on Odum and a foul called believe this will be on Sako and it will be ibrahima Sako just the minute you bring those hands down and lose verticality and theres contact its its going to go against the defense every time got to hold the ground and if he can keep that right hand up and then left hand down right there keeps both hands up and takes the body falls backwards you might get the charge and instead its Odum at the line one for two tonight and he gets the friendly Rim not an easy task there sakad guarding Odum in crunch time needing a Applause bucket missed the second Saks got the Applause rebound a senior at the controls for Georgia Tech Kelly Applause Music hream Colemans tied it with 1 three tonight earlier in this second half now hes in the lane goes up counts the basket hell get a chance to tie it from the free throw line Debo going Debo mode on number zero Dockery he just utilized his size he Gathers hes got the height advantage and takes the contact Big Time play by Deo a chance to tie Wy a chance to tie for the jackets a first free throw attempt for Coleman tonight thats the second time Jord Tech missed a free throw in the last three or four minutes that could have tied the game instead still a onepoint Edge for Howard jackets just 50 from the free throw line 12 of 24 but another turnover for Howard itll be Tech basketball when we come back to wrap this baby Music up voice of the Jord Tech Yellow Jackets once said we got a thriller in the Thriller Dome Al Caldo and brothers and sisters do we ever have one tonight five ties seven lead changes the yellow jackets they have missed opportunities at the free throw line in the second half John Howard has not taken good care of the basketball yeah Georgia Tech turned up the defensive pressure eight turnovers for Howard just one turnover in the second half for the yellow jacket so thats allowed them to get high efficient offense and good shots and then really just chip away get back into this one free throws its its going to be the story of the game right there Howard seven of eight in the second half getting the job done at the line Georgia Texas has stranded eight free throws s of 15 in the second half Kelly is stuffed Shai Odum wow what a defensive presence youre missing Don Campbell youre missing Bryce Harris because they fouled out and shy Odum says you know what Im up to the task of protecting the rim Georgia Tech just needs to continue spacing get things going to the basket dribble drivs have been fruitful for them in the second half start ofon down low hes trapped kick out Reeves pops a three it wont go in a onehanded board shy odm saying give me that Howards lead still Applause intact strong around the Applause horn screws tightening here defensively for both sides fre to shoot and strongs fade away will not fall under three to Applause play Kelly for the lead hes got it Miles Kelly 14 points in the second half and the first lead and over 30 minutes for Georgia Tech I was watching coach STM has Sturman bringing up the ball he goes give it to him hes pointing at Kelly said they cant stop him Howard looking for an answer does doer have it not on that shot the rebound to taon Applause Claude now Jordan Tech can milk a little clock here Georgia Tech Two timeouts remaining the Bison with one Kelly great touch from the low block he is taking over John 23 points now hes now nine of 23 from the Flor domination not widely efficient and now over 5 minutes of that a bucket for Howard doing large parts of the turnovers odm they need a big bucket the preseason M Player of the Year gives him one talk about domination all over the step board odm 20 points nown seven boards four assists monster performance looks like its going to be a showdown between the two number ones Miles Kelly and shy Odum fall still with Kelly over to Claude hes in the lane and what a move taan Claude the veteran transfer from Western Carolina look at that footwork Joshua strong had nothing for him kind of just get out of the way fourpoint Edge under a minute to play Joshua strong to odm down the lane he goes and a foul called against taian Applause Music claudes fourth foul here well see the Music contact Shai Odum getting it done two of four from the free throw line so shooting 50 these are big ones right here he was a 66 free throw shooter last year and in this half Howard is seven of eight from the line nothing but net Shai odm who was once committed to Southern cow but knee injuries hampered his recruitment decided to go to Howard led the Bison into the ins late tournament for the first time in 30 years last year and he leads him back to within one score here inside mamish Pavilion 545 seconds left Jordy Tech has two timeouts stavon the former USC Trojan with it now to Miles Kelly who else Claude looking to set a screen on Music Warfield CI left a little short but clauds there for the stick back Second Chance points Ty Claude my God hanging Dockery short rebound batted away and a foul called and its going to be on Tai Claude thats his Fifth and final what a play by Josh strong just getting after it keeping it alive for the Bison hustle play he made something out of nothing right there and bison will have a chance to uh capitalize he watch the effort oh theres the offensive putback not a bigger one in this game than this offensive putback right now Tai Shawn right place right time led the Southern Conference in offensive rebounding strong Strongs first Falls threepoint game e danana coming in replacing Tai jeanclaude who is fouled out wondering did he do enough strong now with 14 points hes the third leading score for the Bison hes four of six from the free throw line big one there nothing but net Howard shot over 80 from the free throw line and their win over Hampton and Howard is taking their final timeout Miles Kelly hes had some big shots in this carers hit some Big Shots tonight especially here in the second half take a look at what weve seen so far for number 13 here you see attacking the basket again stmy calling number 13 the entire second half and Miles Kelly has Music responded he had a game winner against Georgia State in Georgia last year but the the nonverbal communication the relationship Im picking up on with stmy just kind of you know giv his leader confidence theres just the you know the body language hes pointing to him go get it I mean thats thats special are you inbounding the ball to Miles Kelly who again set a School record in free throw percentage last year but its just four of nine tonight from the line yeah I think you got to you got to call that number um thats going into the game you want that guy with the ball in his hands uh on the Bison side they have time to play with they could put on a trap here one or two traps in the back court then foul um try to turn over the jackets so a little game of chest right now going on uh in the in the huddles with stat of iron Blakey well theres nobody still in the game with four fouls so no one at risk of fouling out on the Howard side at least if they do have to foul here 224 seconds left whos going to get to two and0 will it be Georgia Tech under first year head coach Damon statamire or will Howard pick up their first Power five win in 15 years civant takes it across the court or doesnt he sto just shy they get it across now and Kelly is fouled so they will put Miles Kelly at the line he will have two shots and Kelly wants these free throws he had a chance to give it up on the wing to Debo his teammate but he said you know what Im holding on to this I got the confidence going foul Music me Kelly at the free throw line can he exercise these early Music demons that looked pretty smooth mental toughness at its finest Kelly he was four of n from the line before that one and knocked it down no hesitation he believes in himself now to make it a two possession Music game automatic Howard has no timeouts Joshua strong to the jackets no fouls right now 10 seconds looking for the easy two and the pass is mishandled Kellys got it and a foul on Harriston Georgia Tech a fourpoint lead 8 seconds left and going to the line and there you see Dom Campbell and Bryce Harris stuck on the bench after fouling out taon Claud also fouled out but feeling like his teams on the precipice of a second win you know we we spoke about it earlier depth and and foul trouble could play a factor free throws we spoke about two more big ones for Kelly the Bison with nine turnovers in the second half little bit of the Achilles heel couldnt hold on and you can just see that says it all right there Harris and Campbell just aching they cant be out there right now John and as Kelly hits both free throws you got to look at those drives from Kelly and Sturdivant to knock those two guys out of the game just a twopossession game but this goes quick no timeout you got a foul theres no timeouts left immediate foul oh my oh its almost turned over to tie it its off the mark and Georgia Tech Dodges a bullet and Damon statamire shaking his head saying we got away with one there yeah teachable moment on Phil
