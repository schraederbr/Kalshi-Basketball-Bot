brownells best team now he has taken a team to the sweet 16 this is a group that is very connected on the defensive end they play in the gaps they dont go to the offensive glass they make you execute for 30 seconds against their d ude its a really well put together basketball team for Clemson ball was in the air Florida State wins the tip in all gold the Seminole 714 on the year a tough loss on Tuesday night against Miami in Tallahassee a game in which the Hurricanes controlled from the tip and it turned out to be a laugher in the end Clemson has won two in a row including a big win Over Georgia Tech in which they dominated earlier this week Clemson switching that weave on the top and PJ Hall gets caught on the top and handles it well two seconds on the shot clock see Clemson can take you deep into your actions and welcome back Chase Hunter the sophomore from Atlanta who by the way gets the start next to his brother here this evening he missed the last three games this is a big boost for Clemson going forward how cool is this that Dylan Hunter this freshman gets to play alongside his big brother Chase hunter in the backcourt for Clemson and Dylans coming off his best game most career minutes nine points still without Ian still without uh Alex Hemingway hes still out he has missed the last 12 games Galloway who will miss today with a lower abdominal injury over by Florida State and the Tigers their first offensive possession what a year its been 17 and four and one as we mentioned in the ACC a whistle away from the ball and a foul calls Jalen Worley get it stuck on that PJ Hall match up now heres what happens for Florida State if you watch coach Hams team they switch one through five when you get a big posting up a little they front the post they have great ball pressure on the perimeter thats the way coach hams teams have always played Tyson a triple to start things off Connor Tyson shooting it at a very high clip here in his senior season hes having by far his best year and its fantastic to see a guy that loves Clemson wanted to stay like swears feet are Mills misses the triple and the response not there for Florida State Tigers pushing the temple its Hunter spinning it and fouled he will head to the line its Chase utter sophomore a top 100 recruit in high school what a cool opportunities you mentioned the chance to play with his brother Brad Brownell couldnt quite figure out if they had even done it in their Foreign Tour earlier this year in France you know Chase was not supposed to be the point guard to start this season but all summer Brad Brownell helped develop that skill set for Chase hes very capable now hes a really good combo guard thats one of the things that I think Brad Brownell does so well is Player Development with the staff they take advantage of the off season and this year they went to France and uh we were talking to him earlier today even in January coach Brownell is still referencing how valuable that trip to France was for his team not just for practice but for team bonding and for chemistry said the last time they were able to do that was the year they made the sweet 16 Tigers leading by five early first half action from the top Mills Bobby weaving Corin to put back is swatted away theres that Brownell defense for the Tigers they make life hard in the paint really got to get in a stance and you got to be able to have high hands on the catch great ball movement another three Tysons got two of them 46 triples on the season for Hunter Tyson came in to tonights contest getting closer and closer to setting the alltime games played record at Clemson as green Sharpshooter misses to the right and the rebound by the Tigers I know Darren Green is capable of making that shot that was kind of early in the shot clock Tysons got three triples Hunter Tyson three triples in the first two 45 of the game are you kidding me go ahead shoot till your arm falls off Hunter Clemson 11 Florida State nothing the hunter Tyson show early in tally Music Hunter Tyson nine points all three field goals in the game belong to that man and Debbie he has been so good this season for Clemson off to a great start well hes fifth in the ACC and free throw percentage so hes a tough check hes got range were seeing that on display early hes one of 10 guys in the country averaging a doubledouble hes really worked on his offensive skill set and at six eight he is really tough to guard and Brad Brownell can go with a big lineup with him at the three and it really helps him up on the glass which is the lineup they have on the floor right now Bob Miller into the match for Florida State The Freshman from Mallorca Spain here he is cant shoot the three misses by a good bit its a cold start for Florida State and a foul on Worley uh Im almost thinking you got to get a little sweat going before you look to score you know run the floor hard a couple of times Im sure coach Hamilton had challenge the pride of these guys right here right I mean look for Florida State to pick up their pressure here look for Clemson get a backdoor opportunity coach ham was not shy about telling us he just was disgusted with the effort early especially against Miami on Tuesday he said earlier this week that I havent had to spend more time with any team that I can remember on motivating them each and every game it has been a struggle for Coach Hamilton 714 Music well the other thing for Coach ham is hes got four guys playing 30 plus minutes in ACC play he said that has never happened in his career theres a factor is the pace and Tempo they like to play with how they defend how they close out on Defenders I mean close out on offensive player sprinting the floor ball pressure ball movement on the offensive end all of those things factor in when youre playing guys 30 plus minutes especially in a system that usually plays 10 guys 10 plus minutes and he likes to tell a story to really a lot of TV commentators to writers about Trek Forest asking one of the former greats at Florida State how many minutes can you give me to give me that level of energy and Trent told him 24 minutes probably a night to give you the level of effort and commitment that you require from Florida State teams well I just think this is a year where you have a lot of young guys and you dont have somebody that has been around long enough and Coach Hamiltons system to understand the level that it requires that takes experience so if you have somebody explaining to you how hard it is to do the things that hes asking him to do how hard you got to work how much time you got to put in how many extra shots you got to get up three freshmen on the floor for the Seminoles right now Jackson the deflection will take us to a break 24 Frank Clemson in control in Tallahassee right now hes three for three from the floor outside the arc look at the ball Movement by Clemson they go inside out they draw help in the gap and Hunter Tyson is ready on the catch these are his numbers nine points tonight he averages double one of ten guys in the entire country to do so hes having a fantastic final campaign for the Clemson Tigers the best that Clemsons ever had under Brad Brown now in terms of a start now without a doubt he had 31 Debbie against NC State just before the turn of the new year so the Tigers canvas as they do someone other than Hunter Tyson took a shot Florida State get on the board its green on the drive step back Jay Darren Green gets the Knowles in the scoring column now Darren Green is the leading scorer for Florida State at 14 points a game Applause had a great conversation with him today about how hes working to find his shots how he knows Clemsons a gap protect team he likes that slot three he likes the fill behind on penetration those are ways he can get open 20point games in Florida States twogame win streak on the road Applause oh comes against Tyson so this would be an example of what Im talking about with Darren Green getting in the Gap see he draws what looks like could be a switch he gets in there Clemson doesnt communicate he gets a wide open 17footer transfer from UCF joining the Knowles before the season all on his pivot foot stayed Al Tyson Red Hawk to begin the game a deflection and a steal but Clemson wins it right back Tyson firing away why not Applause Brad Brownell looks at him says easy slow right theyre getting fired up here Clemson Tigers on the road what a great start foul called is it offensive on Florida State as we take another look at Tyson High hands theres the turnover and without hesitation thats one of those no no yes when youre feeling it like that Hunter Tysons definitely got the hot hand y you played you play college days you ever have a game where it just felt like everything youre throwing up is going in I played so long ago I can hardly even remember playing I can still shoot it though Tyson 142 Clemson ball on the deck and a jump ball possession arrow favoring the Tigers well this is a challenge early in the game for Brad brownells team to keep their focus and to not get loose with the basketball here he is thought about the pullup slips it down in the jam look how quick RJ Godfrey gets off his feet nice feed from the top by Hunter Tyson RJ Godfrey gives Clemson a 14point advantage Shades to Florida States game against Miami on Tuesday the canes got out to an incredible start on their way to a 5428 halftime lead the balls got to keep moving here for Florida State green step back longrange triple not gonna go a foul on Hall muscling off cam Corin first nice ball fake and then look at RJ Godfrey get in space and make himself available quick off his feet with the flush play 10 minutes against Georgia Tech in the midweek godfred sees it high of 10 points early in January remember his father Randall Godfrey an 11year NFL the veteran linebacker another turnover on Florida State well Matthew Cleveland had him earlier and he missed him triple back iron its green Corrals Applause Cleveland improved jump shot rattles in and out Applause now middle Brooks into the game for the Tigers Baseline Drive offensive foul so heres a freshman for you 6 10 Chauncey Wiggins whos playing really well coming off his best game 12 points a career high he went five for seven from the floor against Georgia Tech hes just made what I would call questionable decisions back to back this is where you gotta learn right I mean a quick shot draws the charge right cant make backtoback mistakes on the floor theres a freshman from brace in Georgia no doubt the injuries to Clemson have allowed him some extra minutes we were really playing minus two guards two starting point guards oh Mills is triple from straight away Caleb Mills his 100th career triple of his collegiate career Applause started his career at Houston by the way wow how about Kelvin Sampson and the job that hes done Tallahassee Knowles on the rebound green logo three got it the three can get you back in the game quickly and can give to some emotion I was standing on the floor with Darren Green today earlier at shoot around he was showing me all the spots on the court where he can make a triple that was deep I might have to get my tape measure out for that one unlimited range for Darren Green Jr Music three second violation on Clemson and see Godfrey was open and Clemson didnt look inside and because I didnt throw it in there he picks up the three second call the step back by Mills follow that up with a logo triple hassy fans still filing in solid crowd for this Saturday afternoon Saturday evening tilt the 24th ranked Tigers first in the ACC right now up on Florida State by eight its the Knowles though who scored the last six Corey trying to make it nine front iron the offensive rebound by another freshman green pump fake triple air and green can really shoot it and after that hot start its a two possession game here come the Knowles on their home court Josh Beetle gets picked Mills to the rack high off the glasses fouled and well go to the line for a pair of free throws Darren Green with his second triple nice pump fake look at that beautiful stroke I mean hes ready to score Crossing midcourt its a really good catch and shoot guy he said one of the things coach Hamilton has helped him with is being more shot ready and being a little bit off the threepoint line not Towing the line he said his range is improved hes got a three now made in 14 straight contests and and the games Florida States been able to win this season theres been a common denominator of green hitting shots from the outside Applause those missed the front end splits him and the Knowles continue their climb back into the game now down just four 100 run I want to move to the rack and the finish what a great finish a three on two numbers on the break good job of pushing against the pressure its in the slash couldnt get a soft touch this time Jackson gets on the ball Connor three yes welcome back Chase Hunter he can really stroke it from the outside himself 40 percent on the year from Beyond the yard taurens midrange Jay not gonna fall thats going to be open for Florida state that is an ice and a ball screen and just a short roll into space Music heads up to a right Applause fans with hot dogs and drinks head on a swivel theres 10 14 left in this first half in Tallahassee another look at Boba Miller who missed the first half of the year due to an NCAA suspension well Bob Miller is 611 long range learning how to guard on the perimeter in that switching mantoman defense guarding the smaller Hunter and a three second simulation and thats all you got to do is keep guys in front not let them drive by I thought Baba Miller did an excellent job on that switch containing Chase Hunter with high hands especially after Hunter just hit that deep three you impressed with Bob Millers ability to be able to spread it out to the top of the line fun to watch develop definitely has an international game where he can face up and hes a good putter good handles green Miller stepping into a three got it to go Papa Miller showing his range thats what Im talking about right there so he came in the game early took a quick three no sweat now hes in a better rhythm played in the Youth System of Real Madrid in Spain same franchise as Luka doncic Applause and corn for a Dennis the big man stays with the guard now Tyson trips falls Seminole fans and the bench wanted to travel two on the shot clock good d ude Seminoles had numbers green transition three its unlimited range for Darren Green Jr hes got 11 timeout Brad Brownell in Clemson Florida States last five makes from Beyond The Arc defense leading to offense Cleveland green sniper Music welcome back to Tallahassee 24th ranked Clemson got off to a hot start Florida state has climbed back into it what have you seen Debbie from the Knolls well first of all it was 110 run to start the game by Clemson and its been the turnovers of Clemson that have allowed Florida State to get in transition now Clemsons a team that likes to set their D they dont go to the offensive glass theyre very good at moving the ball and switching sides of the floor and their turnovers have allowed Florida State to get back in it Florida State team right now shooting five of ten from Beyond The Arc in this game they were just three of 22 against Miami on Tuesday Beetle big shot from the corner really good execution nice pass by shefflin an underrated skill for him right in a Shooters pocket his fourth triple of the year now Cleveland unable to respond the ball belongs to the Tigers Applause theres Josh Beadle the redshirt freshman from Columbia South Carolina Debbie you mentioned it earlier no Hemingway no Galloway opportunities for some of these younger guards for the Tigers well I think you go with who you trust the most and Chase Hunters who grabbed the owner trust on the top of the floor in terms of guards he also trusts Hunter Tyson and PJ Hall but with the ball in their hands late in the shot clock making decisions good slip right there by sheplin hes in recovering short jumper rolls off all of the put back that is PJ Halls first shot attempt well they got to get him going DJ averaging North at 20 points per game in his last four Cleveland was cutting green not on the same page turnover for the Knowles that takes us to a break tigers on top of the Knolls in tally they lead by eight to 18 having some fun with the fam great crowd here for Saturday evening its fun to be out here in Tallahassee beautiful day Chamber of Commerce kind of weather Blue Sky Sun Shining not a better day youll find them watching the Tigers and the Knowles Tango Arya masuti Debbie Antonelli our entire ACC Network crew this Saturday evening quadruple header a full day of ACC hoops Im thinking that uh off this full court pressure Im looking for PJ Hall to get something going on the block or a slip off the wall screen its honor guarded by Cleveland Cross Court to Tyson on the attack the reverse that was pretty you come with a longer closeout on them right hes hit so many triples in the game four good attack of the rim a 14 Applause and a double figure scoring machine on the Carl Green short cleared by Clemson Applause cant leave him wide open like that those got lucky as Tyson missed it The Freshman Deontay green into the game Corrals the loose ball now Cleveland the hoop and the harm 14 consecutive games and double figures for Matthew Cleveland its ACC Sixth Man of the Year thats six seven frame elevates over the top of two smaller guards its a beautiful Jumper in the short corner Leonard Hamilton called Matt Cleveland a warrior its an after Cameron Fletcher went down with that ACL tear against Virginia in December Cleveland had to take a step forward on the glass in the scoring Cloud column he has put in a ton of work has a chance to maybe have his name called in the NBA draft later this year traveling violation on Clemson Applause I think the switching defense is actually sped up Clemsons offense just a little bit I mean its not and Clemson gets multiple sides the percentage of their field goal percentage goes up it goes up because you get more sides you get teams in rotation Brad Brownell said it would be a challenge against Florida State just to run your offense gotta have guys that can beat individual Defenders one on one Seminoles down seven Worley in the game with those two fouls Millers already hit one three and missed it by a lot that corner has been a problem for him today Tyson another reverse layup how do you stop Hunter Tyson thats just a great job you dribble right at his Defender and its a great backdoor cut by Hunter Tyson all right for six to play offensive foul on Florida State watch PJ Hall Sprint up the floor okay theyre playing in transition okay freeze it right here watch the defense right here the back door cut by Hunter Tyson double doubles for the Tigers Brad Brownell calls him the leader of the team Monroe North Carolina native Debbie mentioned the double doubles earlier sixth in the NCAA with 11 double doubles on the here for Hunter Tyson Florida State finds something late in the first half Cleveland short on the three long rebound Miller now green back iron Applause two three the other hunger brother Dylan PJ Hall wanted a triple and cannot connect Applause an offensive foul away from the basketball korin and Hall colliding in the paint Corin just ran over PJ Hall Music Applause Applause thatll do it that is corins second foul as he heads to the bench its been a season of bright moments and learning lessons for cam Boren energy post a lot of seminal freshmen on this team having to be thrown into the fire Tigers up nine Chaplin looking for Hall down low good defense by Florida State leads to a three though for the Tigers no good from Wiggins typically shefflin connects with PJ Hall in that high low look Cleveland a three runs out we want to stay in a bit of a scoring drought theyve missed their last four Hall straight away triple not gonna go shefflin battling Miller last touch by Ian chaplain the sophomore from Loganville Georgia I think Brad Brownell would prefer maybe one or two more ball reversals then that quick three what great fight in Florida State though to overcome the 110 deficit to start the game and keep the game pressure on Clemson Morley Al Green angling for space Tigers great defense trying to force Florida State deep into the shot clock Cleveland the midrange Jay not going to fall he is struggling from the floor red hot Tyson rims out both teams cooling off Mills it is back to the rim through contact was last touched by Clemson itll be Florida States ball when we return 24th ranked tigers Florida States Golden Girls on the court at the tuck its 24th ranked Clemson leading Florida State by nine Debbie a lot of turnovers by both teams in this game and both teams starting to fall in love with the threepoint shot well I think Brad brownells team could be a little bit more aggressive at getting a ball reversal and attacking a closeout you know looking to take advantage of those switches trying to punish Florida State in a post for those switches really Clemson hasnt established anything in the paint yet everything has been outside the ark and theyve turned the ball over uncharacteristically eight times they only average 11 on the season that foul on the Tigers Debbie will put Florida State at the bonus now Sola out of BC at the line a walkon added to Florida State earlier this season in the middle of the year coming up next SAR quadruple header is capped off by 12th ranked Virginia Tech and Hunter Couture hosting cubes that at Castle Coliseum in Blacksburg Music its the other night against North Carolina and Syracuse is so close to winning its so hard to win in this league the level of talent and the margin for error is so small judaments I think Ill have a big game against Virginia Tech hes the Freshman point guard for Syracuse Applause great call too with West Durham and Dan Bonner Florida State creates a turnover s in coast to coast strong finish I think that nine Clemson turnovers 12 points for Florida State off those nine turnovers this is where you missed Brevin Galloway another guard another ball handler an experienced decision maker on the road three bedels hit one missed this one Second Chance opportunity coming Hall straight away three wont go put back no foul cold that is on Florida State for the activity level of Godfrey on the glass has been outstanding this evening watch Jackson with a push nobody gets in front if you dont see two hips two shoulders you dont stop until you get to the rim I want to say social head coach Stan Jones and shoot around this morning in fact Taylor Jackson has a chance to be really really good said his father actually just finished a multiyear career overseas playing in France he comes from basketball lineage Debbie Jackson lost one game in his entire High School career well thats the kind of guys coach Hamiltons always had around on winners foreign Godfrey knocks down the free throw splits it at the line the lead six for the Tigers on the road Applause green said Jackson driving muscling offensive rebound step back its out of BC the unlikeliest of Heroes for Florida State Applause Debbie he was playing I am basketball last spring in Tallahassee Applause its impressive but they need the depth to play the style they want to play Paul through contact no Florida State theyve cut the deficit to four theyve got the ball Miller had an ocean Jackson provided some excellent minutes to turn the face the bucket 65 inverted to the block big take with a little bit of strength inside what a rally by Florida State twopoint game Clemson needs a couple of sides here in a good possession swing the three doesnt quiet the Seminole proud a foul it was Tyson crashing the glass now keep in mind Dylan Hunter has one three on the season that was in the last game Hunter Tyson crashing the boards gets pushed from behind you get a couple of or get a oneonone here oh theyre gonna give them two free throws Im sorry over the limit Florida State goes to line for a pair this is the first its a Clemson team that came into this contest tonight Debbie top six in the NCAA in free throw percentage first in the ACC yeah but heres the thing Brad Brownell is going to get his team in the locker room at halftime and theyre going to get reconnected because I dont think this has been a very connected group not the way weve seen them get 17 wins on the season and be 91 in ACC play how is Florida State defended PJ Hall theyve seem to have made life difficult well I just think with the switching commandtoman defense in their front of the post its hard to get a hit now theyre tied after the Mills three the Seminoles trailed by as many as 14 our level at the duck as the crowd comes to life down low foul cold on Adam BC that is a great pass Inside by Hunter Mills gets a great look good ball movement nice ball fake set up RJ Godfrey inside attempt inside the threepoint line yeah Im telling you they have not been able to get the ball inside and its part of the switching D the ball pressure on the perimeter the front and the post the length of Florida state is an issue for most teams Godfrey misses the first to talk to the Seminole coaching staff earlier about PJ Hall I said theres really nobody oneonone that we have that could stop him its going to take everybody denying him from getting to his spots on the floor yeah I dont think hes uh been able to get established inside and were talking about that earlier I think thats the adjustment for Clemson in the second half Miller attack the big man what a move wow Florida State leads for the first time this evening look at that athleticism on Baba Miller wow thats how they make him in Spain turnover in transition no look pass shot rejected oh Godfrey sending it back the roof is ready to come off this building about an eight second differential so Florida state has a chance to get the ball back has been the and turning against the lengthy Miller angling he traveled good double inside Music that was the plan and shoot around by Florida State to double PJ Hall on the Block but PJ hasnt been on the Block to be doubled that time they bring the double on Hunter Tyson its the 11th turnover for Clemson in the first half lets see if Clemson is going to go to Zone here Applause Jackson offensive foul called on Florida State and Jackson taking the blame for him Music Applause coach Hamilton and Stan Jones told us they watch a lot of film with this young group thatll be a good one for the film tomorrow in point three seconds left for Clemson plenty of time to get off a shot Connor on the catch with two Connor with one half the buzzer the floater not gonna fall and its Florida State leading at the break what a rally by the Seminoles spot Clemson an 110 start and battle and fight and scratch and Claw and turn the Tigers over 11 times in the first half here in the second half is as we take a look at what the first half points were by minutes first 10 minutes it was a Clemson barrage of Threes the last ten its been Florida State in transition I think were going to see PJ Hall get established here for Clemson on the inside how would you go about that ball reversal get it inside and they go in an ISO off the halftime and clear it out to go oneonone against shefflin nice execution by Florida State Applause here is Chaplin cant connect Clemson nearly 70 of their attempts in this game have come from Beyond The Arc your point exactly Debbie theyre gonna have to try to find ways to get into the paint its the Knowles by three Mills not able to connect Clemson with those 11 first half turnovers matches their season average Tyson left alone rims out Florida state has scored the last 19 points of the game and its thats a great no call that is a principal verticality no call inside Applause possession of that Applause okay so three possessions for Clemson three triples as a team they shoot 37 they are a very good threepoint shooting team they make eight on the average they already have six its made four of them does that fall on Chase Hunter to try and get you more into what you want to do you just gotta theyre taking what the defense has given them and Florida State has allowed the threepoint shots usually theyre a very good threepoint defensive team but four possessions and four threes and Clemson starts out oh for four Outside The Arc in the second half I think theres got to be some ball fake and some drive to the paint see if they can get a piece of the paint on the next possession Applause Worley he now has three has chef Lynn trying to muscle it in staying with it could not connect Mills picks it up green trail three got it thats his game that is Darren Greens game Music pure as youd like hes got the greenest of green lights for Mr Green Music a Florida State their largest lead of The Game Hunter forcing the issue fouled getting a piece of the paint now going to the free throw line remember we talked about where he likes to get his triples this ones in transition its a fill behind the penetration in a wide open look Derek Reed his 13th game of the season with at least three threepoint Fields you know what hes doing is putting a lot of pressure on Clemsons defense in transition and part of that is shot selection by Clemson has allowed Florida State to get out on the break as Hunter knocks down the first flip over to some womens basketball as the quadruple header for tomorrow starts with Louisville and qs at noon Eastern then at 16th ranked Duke taking on 24th ranked Florida State right back in this building and its followed by the 15th ranked heels and Clemson at four and number 12 Virginia attack caps the day against Virginia should be another great afternoon of Hoops on accn Florida State women celebrating Susan morale who was the alltime winningest coach here at Florida State three Elite eights and as great as the guard play is for Duke and for Florida State Im thinking that the games going to be decided in a pain I think Valencia Myers is going to have to do a really good job on Kennedy Brown inside theres KK Timpson Snoop Turnage Mariana Valenzuela how about the job Brooke Wyckoff has done for Florida State this season Rick Wyckoff is one of four new coaches in the league on the living side and she has done a fantastic job she got one of the best freshmen in the country to Nile Latson form steak fans need to come out and watch tonight laughs and play Shes a ticket selling player got a good one tomorrow yourself over in Raleigh well Ill be Notre Dame NC State a couple of ranked teams in the ACC on ESPN 3 oclock foreign wow the struggles continue to protect the basketball see and thats a veteran play and move by the leader Hunter Tyson who goes right over to Dylan Hunter and says my fault my fault I dont want the young guys to lose confidence its tough on the road and its tough here to win stons missed 14 shots in a row Debbie could use a bucket well I think they got to get a piece of the paint I need to stop here against Florida State Jackson Corner three got it wow coach Hamilton had an inkling about Jackson today in this matchup because hes certainly keyed on you Applause its an early in the second Florida Smith State smell blood in the water Jackson hit from the other side across the lane has it ripped down do some contact good defense by the Tigers keep in mind that Florida state has won seven in a row at home against Clemson Applause its been a tough Place traditionally for Clemson to get a win us running into each other Hall forces a triple and berries thats his first triple of the game certainly capable at 610 of stepping out Cleveland slips it to Corin and the flush thats a miscommunication defensively between Godfrey and PJ Hall and Warrens first points of the game Applause Seminoles by six Dylan Hunter to his brother Chase jumper no good haul offensive rebound Applause DJ Halls open they missed him theres a three a big one for the Tigers again Chase Hunter Applause this is last three contests has really shown no signs of rust green the response and connect tigers can get closer or tie with a bucket here Music Tyson hesitation Baseline Drive found some space great shot fake you have to come with a long close out High hands great take on the Baseline its a couple of times that Hunter Tyson has been able to drive the Baseline and score I think thats three times tonight Applause within one Corin jumper short rebound Godfrey Applause Music Applause thats his first Basket in the paint I think they got to get him going bikers have shown great resolve all season long first in the ACC standings is a hand check foul called on Clemson 70 run by the Tigers Debbie PJ get the ball in the paint because on the season 38 of their shots come from outside the Arc in this game its 66 two out of every three possessions theyre shooting a three now theyre getting PJ Hall involved Hunter Tyson has driven the Baseline three times and scored I think they need to punish a little bit more that switching mantoman defense and trying to get PJ Hall and get some points in the paint is Florida States playing with a lot of confidence coming off of that loss at Miami they suffered here the other night 8663 was at final they were never in the game well theyre in this one were passing his way in muscling and earns a foul thats a great clear out and ISO off the ATO by Florida State Boba Miller with that 611 frame and get him the ball in space against RJ Godfrey and you see its a foot fight to get to the paint you can see Baba Miller well hes going to be fun hes slowly been comfortable with this level and getting back out on the court you know we had a nice conversation with him today at shoot around he really loves the game hes learned a lot since hes been here I still cant figure out the suspension for 16 games but you know what hes handled it very maturely for an 18 year old guy his birthday is coming up in a few weeks and hell be 19 its got incredible upside again after he splits the free throws no look pass Beetle crossover dribble Mills picks his pocket theyre called on calebbles you know Beatles had his pocket picked a couple of times tonight and Leonard Hamilton confused about the call Mills with a strip Music there you see he puts his hand on Chase Hunter and pushes off by rule good skip three balls in the corner rims out Hall has been a force on the glass in this half forces it up and earns the foul hell go to the line Music everything about PJ Hall speaks winner he works hes coming off a couple of injuries hes getting what I would say closer to a hundred percent has lift looks so much better than around Christmas time there was a time where he had to play his way back into shape and they need him they need him on the floor look at his numbers the last four 21 points a game seven boards the tough competitor trying to remember his career high came against Florida State last season 28 points and got to the freethrow line that night 13 times hes had hes had the foot injuries had the knee its at 26 this year against Duke and Debbie Baba Miller in our conversation earlier today said Ive never played a post as talented as PJ Hall officials taking a look at the clock well theres not many posts as talented as PJ Hall Tigers leading by two approaching the 13minute mark of the second its been a back and forth Affair some big runs by both teams Mill for the lead seesaw Fair back in favor of Florida State Kayla Mills shooting nearly 40 percent from three in his last 10 contests Mills now in double figures FSU by one foul called now youre starting to see Hall becoming a emphasis in the second half yeah one of the things I think Clemson always does well is feed the post from the high post area thats a great pass by RJ Godfrey away from the D good work inside by PJ Hall if you dont throw that ball in there that foul doesnt get called now Debbie Florida say it at six fouls one more would have the best freethrow shooting team in the ACC on the line yes good point for a long time fifth in the country is Clemson as a team Tigers trailing by one Tyson who was off to a hot start has 19 should screen by Hall beautiful screen steps up the lane for Jay Godfrey continuing to have some bright moments in the last couple of games Jackson the response off to the right Tyson clears the boards now here he is across the middle of the lane kick three punch a no greed to fall Florida State pushing trailing by a point expanded over to the transfer from UCF Cleveland catch and shoot three rims in and out no good Miller saves it to pouring counter and the foul thats the kind of play that can lift the team what an emotional Outburst by Florida State what a terrific job the hustle you know Marty brennaman and I can go right down the list growing up on Tobacco Road and we send our best to the Packer family especially on my friend Mark who lost his dad and uh we we wish the Packer family uh peace at this time you know what they say legends never die he is definitely a legend 50 to 49 corn could not connect as Tyson quickly gives Clemson the lead that was Hunter Tysons first three since early in the first half now over 20 in the game as Millard wildly misses visiting tigers by two on the road heres Hall he can shoot it from the outside its tipped in oh Hunter Tysons gonna get credit for that I dont know if he got his hand on it or not I think he did but he was closest hell get two thats 24 in the game for Hunter Tyson he will not complain how he got that bucket stick for Clemson extends it to a two possession game I mean what incredible fight in the Seminoles down 14 in the first half thinking with the system if you will mantoman defense ball pressure Applause leading to a transition bucket Clemson starting to take control really good body controlled by RJ Godfrey hes a goodlooking freshman he is going to be great for Clemson one day thats how Im

PJ Halls capable of making a three Chase Hunter theres multiple options here for Clemson they like that passthrough screen on the top of the floor for PJ for uh Hunter Tyson but I also think they could throw a direct pass to the block and then throw it back out Florida state has the number one team in the ACC on the ropes remember Leonard Hamilton has the NCAA record for most wins against unranked teams at 55 could this be number 56 Music and what a victory it would be if Florida State could hold on and a season that has been disappointing to say the least for Leonard Hamiltons Squad they have continued to fight Thats the Way vision now A Time taken yep Leonard Hamiltons going to use his last time out Music Florida State leading by three down the stretch Debbie its been a great one I mean Chase Hunter has been fantastic Cleveland on the other side being the leader PJ Hall Late in the second half getting points in the paint Hunter Tyson what a game for Hunter 27 points its been a combination of multiple players its been exciting thats for sure what we anticipated and Florida state has won the last seven in a row at home against Clemson 15 Clemson fans might remember alamir Dawes buzzer beating win over Florida State a few years back that one at Little John these two teams seem to always come down to the wire what a game I mean Leonard Hamiltons team coming off that huge loss rebounding playing with much more motion off to a horrible start Clemson was up 110 162 but Florida State young guys have battled back a lot of freshmen on the floor have played well okay so you got to make sure you come to the ball of course Florida state is switching theyve been switching all game contestant dont foul Chef Flynn inbounding Miller denying Hall on the catch Florida State fouls was that they wanted yes it was and this is a play that Brad Brownell worked on at shoot around they set this up situationally knowing that they might need a three they did not want to give up a three theyd rather give up two free throws and youre putting PJ Hall in 82 free throw shooter who did miss one in the last trip its this one down to get Clemson within two Kayla Mills reentering Abba Miller will run off as warley will also stay on Applause the Tigers had heroics just two games ago against the Virginia Tech Hokies it was Tyson hitting the big three late in that one do they have similar magic tonight in Tallahassee well the letter Hamilton picks his best freethrow Shooters and rebounders on the freethrow line all berries both Clemson will get Godfrey back into this for defensive purposes shefflin on the ball you cannot get beat over the top and youre gonna have to foul right away DJ Hall does have those four fouls he goes to the bench nine seconds to play Florida state gets it into Corin Clemson quickly fouls the freshman now you go offense defense if youre Clemson you get your offense you get Chase Hunter and PJ Hall back on for threepoint shooting should he make both these and get your best offensive players on the floor Debbie these are Big Shots for a freshman its not been to the line but one time hes over one and misses the first

back to the ball and meet it and then you go thats what Florida State wants to make you come back to the ball to take up time okay they dont want you to catch it moving up the floor youve got 85 youve got plenty of time its almost six or seven actions either pass or dribble before you get a shot if you want to take the shot with enough time to get an offensive rebound so you want to catch it and push it quickly up the floor thats why you want Chase Daniels whos your best ball handler in this situation Chase Hunter did your best ball handler to get it up the floor there he is Chase Hunter set a good screen for him I will say this too shuffling throws the best baseball pass on the Clemson team and Florida State elects not to put anybody on the ball they get it into Hunter with seven Hunter drives the shot is good and the foul Applause he is their best driver Music Florida State doesnt make him come back he gets a full head of steam Matthew Cleveland is on his heels in transition and the body control and the eyes on the rim and he absorbs the contact now remember Florida state has no timeouts left Debbie Cleveland is done that is his fifth foul down to Caleb Mills or Worley here you
