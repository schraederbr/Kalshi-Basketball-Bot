Monday Joe lardy has Carolina Duke Clemson and Virginia in the NCAA tournament right now Wake Forest and pit on the bubble Virginia teket team under consideration and here we go with the hules controlling the opening tip make Comm INE 14 and 11 Virginia at 20 and6 ly kid has it up top heading off to MJ Collins he can really heat up in a hurry shot clock down to 10 the feed for kid on the Baseline working on miner jumping into the paint gets the shot up for two and thats the area where Virginia Tech can be successful L kid won the best in the ACC as far as field goal percentage and Virginia can play him oneonone with Jordan Miner in the lineup and not have to double team Virginia count off a hard fought Victory 4947 over Wake Forest on Saturday in Charlottesville despite making just one out of 11 foul shots you talk about hard fought Brody up top will hit the back of the iron Ro got a good look from three and thats been a struggle for Virginia at times on the road how they shoot the basketball with padulla getting a look good look along with Couture and Collins making up that back court but badulla has been a very cold shooter in recent days as we look at the Virginia starting five beakman Ro McNeely dun and Miner both Dunn and beakman two of the very best defenders in the conference and this guy with the basketball one of the best Shooters in the conference Isaac mcney who has been Dynamite from Beyond the threepoint line weve got two of those guys in this game actually bman nice give the lean in wont go for Miner so its the hokei shutting him down defensively right out of the Applause gates they have already met one time this season Virginia Tech losing in Charlottesville 6557 Applause and the H hes turning it over 15 times in that one Mike Youngs team hoping to do better work hanging out of the basketball tonight three and seven in his career here against Virginia and all of the wins as you point out at home yeah Mike Young and the staff going back to the suits they started that actually after the coaches versus cancer they wore the suits and stuck with them Tony Bennett and staff sticking with the three4 zip Miner picked up the foul this time bman will pick up the foul on from behind nobody steals the basketball better than him the reigning ACC Defensive Player of the Year and right now I think hed get both of our votes to do it again I believe hes a smidgin ahead of Ryan dun its a battle for me right now OB with those two guys but both of them Elite level Defenders padulla kicks it out coutur with a long shot cant hit it yeah Ryan dun the ACC blocks leader and hes coming off seven rejections on Saturday yeah seven rejections and also doing the job defending the basketball where Reese beakman is probably the best or ball defender in the league and one of the best in the country Buchanan cant hit the follow away the 611 freshman no good there early substitution for Tony Bennett getting Buchanan on the floor for Jordan Miner who Miner has 16 points against the Hokies in that first matchup he and Reese beon led the way so interesting to see Miner on the bench early you wonder if thats an injury or if he just feels better about this Collins trying to swing the pass inside batt it out of play by Virginia and Virginia as always a tremendous defensive team allowing only 58 points per game thats number three nationally they rarely turn it over in fact theyre number one in the nation just 82 turnovers per game and they dont foul padulla get shot down there Couture drives it flips it up and thats round and out at the Horn of the shot clock but a second chance this is a shot he likes maybe even more than the layup couldnt get either one of those to go a couple of great opportunities for Hunter coutur on that possession and you look at the numbers for Virginia what theyve been able to do on the road over their last four games shooting the basketball for 47 from Beyond a threepoint Arc and you see Virginia now getting on the board but its been a difference in Styles I mean in contrast in Styles when you think about what happened for Virginia in their first true Road games the first four two Road games in comparison to what weve seen from the as of Lake Tony B talked about that and how the maturation of some of his younger guys has occurred and thats been great Collins with a pull up pop kind of line dri it so not a shooting Clin early the hokei miss their last six shots beakman whos made the only basket so far for Virginia will call for playing but this this pace absolutely fits Virginia they dont mind what the score is as long as they have one more at the end as McNeely gets a great look unable to knock it down but Virginia is more than willing to play this pace MC hit 47 beyond that threepoint line badulla swings it for kid and batted away but a foul on roie so a two two tie slow start for both sides were going to talk some bacon and why it matters here in blackburg

going to be like this all night long just a 2 two game but for more on the big giveaway and the real excitement up in the stands lets go to Angel well guys welcome to the castle where the hes are 11 and two this season and when youre looking at these fans theyve created one of the most electric environments in the league reys Davis can say it Cory can even scream it from the rooftop but what does the castle guard have to say about the commitment here no one is better than castle guard here we lock it down we lock it down at home uh Id say we hate UVA truly like unmatched here in CLE h o k i e s we love this place we love it and the guy also sad that were handing out bricks of pants that are Meats for the bacon as well so theyre saying that these fans are the absolute best they said they show up early making sure that everyone is together chanting the same thing and of course the Sam in is a big part of them as well well the opponent in this case Virginia misses two foul shots in the second half in a row everybody gets free bacon tonight and and nothing gets the castle going like bacon the truth it is one of the best environments you will find especially in the second half as you mentioned Virginia will be shooting into the castle guard with bacon on the line and after Virginia coming off a 1 for1 free throw shooting performance in their win which is rare company alone to be able to win a game shooting that P from the free throw line bacon could be a possibility here see its astounding done with the ball trying to back in gets into that paint strong move but couldnt finish got to where he wanted to be great spot to be able to finish this unable to get it to go but you can see Ryan dun getting right in the middle of the paint but look at these numbers ob one of 11 9 from the free throw line the second wor free throw percentage by winning division one team in the last 25 Seasons Charleston go over for 11 and win in in 08 poti nice save on the Baseline out to padulla way downt hes just been off he has been off and talk with Mike young earlier today he said a lot of that had to do with the shot selection know that one with the shot clock going down you have to take that look but often times Shan padulla puts himself in a difficult position taking tough shots his overall shooting in the slump is now down to 40 for the year 35 from three M nice drive all the way through with a six4 shot Point yeah Strong Finish By McNeely going up against a very good defender in Hunter Couture but getting his a SE to get into the painted area and finishing at The Rim Tyler nickel now into the game from Mike young hes 39 Beyond a threepoint line both sides need help shooting it as Couture gets it to nickel and his first one hell sent back so that was on Q yeah Tyler nickel coming off a strong performance at his former school at North Carolina on Saturday went four for six from Beyond the threepoint Arc so hes feeling really good about his jumper right Applause now Harris will launch cant hit it MC triying to keep it alive and heres padulla coming in at 16 per game just three for 13 0 for four on Saturday from three its two for n against Florida state in the game before that theyll try and get going again swings it inside potit and the accs leading shot blocker coming over getting another one Ryan done making up ground where potita carved out some space in the paint however didnt account for the shot blocker coming over bman shredding the D will lay it in re bman the senior and and the accs assist leader taking it for himself there for a bucket and Reese bman can absolutely be more aggressive as the game goes along finding his spots to be able to take advantage of getting into the painted area and a whistle off the ball and a foul here Elijah bati does a great job using his body to be able to create space against re Reese beakman however Ryan Dunn coming from the weak side with another block and then beakman takes it upon himself to put two Point points on the board look n for the illegal 7 to6 Virginia te 31 Robie hokes are 112 at home just 1 and S on the road Jake Rose into the game now another guy who can hit it from downtown for Tony Bennett whos still number one all time in the NCAA in division one in threepoint percentage after all these years the head coach Harris with a tough angle its going to be tipped up and in by grov thats not something you see often from grov but taking advantage but smaller Defender guarding him as a shot goes up attacking the offensive glass giving Virginia the onepoint lead yeah his game is usually outside the threepoint Arc where hes 49 nickel dumping it down low and the stuck this time for 14 he didnt see Ryan Dunn in that picture had a whistle yeah no Ryan Dunn on the floor which means no Rim protect for Virginia and po taking advantage of it finishing strong through the contact as mcney comes over and gets a little bit of contact on PO however enough to send him to the free throw line for opportunity for the n one so potit 74 at the line and coming up next first place in a big 12 on the line down in Houston as the second rank cougars will take on number six Iowa State thats to follow us tonight on ESPN now how rare is that to talk about first place in the Big 12 and Kansas not involved in that remember a time where Kansas won I believe 18 straight Big 12 championships yes mcell jumping Harris on the dish thats a pretty play Dante Harris guy coming back from injury guy who averaged 12 points a game last year has not been a big factor yet this year yeah Dante Harris actually returned from injury in the game against Virginia Tech Charlesville and of course Jordan Miner getting in the starting lineup in the game as well Couture on the line man have weve seen him get rolling a couple of times in his career here hes number one all time and threepoint makes for the hes yeah Couture and McNeely respectively one and two in ACC play shooting to three at 48 and 47 so weve got two knockdown Shooters playing in this game on the Drive Murray finishes that on the drive hter Couture taking a bump on that last play coming back grimison a little gimpy Mulla driving to the Baseline Harris hip for hip on him nckl wants potin again writes right into his Defender but the foul will go against him with the personal and when we come back talking some more

those are important members around here and kid with a Miss there 1312 Virginia Tech B been up high will swing it shot clock down to seven here for Virginia Harris back for Beakmans got to get a shot in the air hell spin fire and cant connect its a great job defensively by MJ Collins contesting that shot may have gotten a piece of that one recognizing that Reese beakman had to go with the shot clock getting low hoki is four for 12 from the Applause field nickel will launch and hit another one hes really giving him a nice lift off the pitch yeah just a go simple go screen he actually doesnt set the screen slips right out tame Murray trying to hedge that screen allows Tyler nichel to get just too much space hes a knockdown shooter you cant give him that much area to Applause operate haris got past padulla swings it for Miner and one Jordan Miner headed to the line and now as they say the rest of the story we got a great item here courtesy of our producer Kim belon 1971 the great Muhammad Ali spoke at burus Hall at Virginia Tech during the speech he asked for a volunteer from the audience to help him demonstrate the famed Ali Shuffle Now Charlie libum at 66 230 he jumped up the fans everybody the students in the crowd they wanted him to get up there and after a little Muhammad Ali tutelage Charlie did the move so well that he actually nicked Ali in the lip and drew blood from the champ and and then he started running for the exits oh yeah yeah what have I done as nichel puts up another one and this one wont drop well afterwards Muhammad Ali used his own blood to sign an autograph for Big Chuck telling him show this to your grandchildren itll make you famous thats lip right there in the front Mohammad actually stayed on that night he supposed to fly out but he was having so much fun he stayed on campus he also told big Chuck youre the first man ever to draw blood from me yeah I tell you what now thats a story in itself of course were talking about the greatest Tony Bennett actually was fortunate enough to be able to meet Muhammad Ali was called over to be able to go over to the house and meet him a few years back before Muhammad passed a good friend actually was hosting Muhammad Ali and called Tony Bennett over and Tony got a chance to go over and speak and say hello to the champ one of the most uh hell tell you one of the highlights of his oh not only coaching career but life man do I believe it bakman dribbling inside its poked Away by the Hokies in transition Collins Collins coming off 18 against North Carolina Music vula hes working on beakman what a nice given on the Baseline a hand off head with the stop he assist to Collins great recognition by Collins seeing that he was under the basket if he tries to lay that up Blake Buchanan has an easy block dumps it off the kid for the dump and right now Virginia Tech operating efficiently on the offensive end of the floor opening up a sixpoint lead over the Applause Cavaliers bman lost it for a moment back to Harris shot clock down to three Harris went for the pass Buchanan around and out with his shot Virginia normally comfortable operating with a low shot clock they want to work to get under 20 seconds really before they take an aggressive look at the basket but Virginia Tech has put pressure on them on those shots under 10 seconds badulla with a lot of contact SWAT him away and a big block by Buchanan badulla would have been better serve to drop that one off similar to the way MJ Collins does on this possession the back cut and then at the last minute dropping it off to LY kid who hammers it down for the easy Music Finish Well I was on my regular route when I find this note bring rings to beach wedding FedEx presents Tall Tales of true deliveries so I grabb the Rings

Virginia Tech virgia Tech they get Rowdy on there I dont think I ever wonan Applause te well ree beakman has never won at Virginia Tech and for all the accolades that he has garnered his ACC career the game winner in Cameron Indoor against the Duke BL Devils he has never won in this building most likely his last attempt to get a win here and its important for him to be able to do that but right now Virginia Tech off to a great start holding on to a Sixpoint lead trying to make it four straight wins over Virginia on this floor K go off strong hell draw a foul gun going up for the block Virginia young lady who was going to school here and when I came to practice at noon today to watch Virginia she was already out front and talking about Castle Coliseum and she said you know I had a lot of schools I was thinking about going to and a lot of really good schools you know like like Virginia Tech but she said when I walked in to this Coliseum thats when I made up my mind I was come to school here well tomorrow our SEC Big 12 super Tuesday double header starts at College Station Wade Taylor and Texas an taking on Arkansas at 7 and number 25 BYU battling to get back into the wind column taking on Baylor both games on ESPN and the ESPN and Obi as you mentioned that a number of Highly touted recruits on campus for Virginia Tech basketball this weekend so well forgive me for its a big Monday its not the weekend anymore but one of the areas where Mike young and his staff have identified this game and knowing the environment as to what it would be would be a great time for recruits to see it some great defense there shut down becoming and thats going to be a shot clock violation so really the hogies are turning the tables tonight they absolutely are thats normally a violation you get used to seeing in Charlottesville at jpj but a great job defensively by the hokeys there forcing the shot clock viations as we get a look at Julie Foster and Katherine White who joined our got Nate Stevens earlier today they arrived actually Nate was here in 11 Julian C getting theres the stop by Kid Nate who was in first in line the Duke game a little less than a month ago and they are enjoying what theyre seeing from their Hokies to this point especially from Lyn kid well those students such a factor for the hokes who have fallen behind or taken the lead here 24 to 14 Virginia fallen behind by 10 and another turnover and the bounce feed for nickel whos had a hot hand coming off the bench kid with another touch give him two more hes having a big half and a time out Virginia L kid only had two points in the first matchup between these two teams however he is off to a great start here in the first Applause half ah nuts no no what plan nuts its not a nuts its ah nuts because planers nuts are good Planters nuts ah nuts looking like a snack a potatoey Cheesy bacony snack the new Smash Potato balll is just 349 only a KFC Virginias game is not necessarily coming from behind is it it is not and Len kid giving Virginia Tech a 12point lead and the coincidence that he actually has 12 points perfect from the field and the free throw line with four rebounds has off to a great start we mentioned he did not have a strong showing in Charlottesville hes making up for it here in this first half so about 6 minutes to go in the first half here in blackburg Virginia trying to make a comeback roie up high mcnell and could it to the best three point shooters around Ro will get it and around and out it goes talking about that Isaac mcne line that Virginia is not necessarily A team that plays well from behind we are not the fastest and we dont try and pushing in transition too much and Obie that was a result that we saw early from Virginia we showed the graphic earlier with their first four Road games their average margin of defeat was 20 points per game and that shows know that theyve been much better as of late Collins done with the rebound want to remind you the 20124 ACC tournament gets underway in Washington DC beginning March 12 through the 16th at Capital 1 Arena the 71st annual edition of the tournament first time since 2016 its been in Washington DC North Carolina won it that year yeah they actually beat Virginia in the championship game that year in DC but Virginia will be one of the teams most likely with a double buy starting their action on Thursday so get your tickets now I mean Washington DC great place for this tournament terrific restaurants a lot of great stuff to see around the tournament games plenty of things for Cory to do after the game oh Im locked in OB Im just watching basketball n will drop it down and I know youre not kidding Tyler back Tyler niichel running back BR giving the hes too small sign to whoevers guarding him on the interior and ob one of the things Ive always noted about this game even when I started doing this and I was doing radio for Virginia you always take into account how many guys are from the state of Virginia and value this rivalry one of those guys Tyler nickel and hes having a strong performance here today mly trying to end a 5 minute scoring drought but he cant do it for Virginia they have gone Stone Cold held to 14 points not long ago they held Miami to 17 on their floor in Charlottesville in one half heres kid 12 points for him to kicks it kid off his hand beakman on the drive and blocked away Baron got a hand on it theres another guy from the state of Virginia Robbie Baron grad transfer from Richmond from Virginia spending his final season here in blackburg and now stepping up on the defensive end hes a guy we normally see knocking down three Collins yes and the lead expands for the hokes 30 to 14 OB this is a lineup that Mike young used late in the game against North Carolina Shan padulla on the bench MJ Collins at the point with Tyler nichel on the floor and its been a good lineup for the hookes thus far catching the lead out to Applause 16 Groves trying to take that line but hes going to turn it alurn on theor in this state OB where you from matters you see the Commonwealth connection Tristan how and Desmond Roberts from Virginia

report just minutes away he is Seth Greenberg I am Kevin NTI the Monday microscope Iowa State number six in the land at houon houon number two in the country the magic number the first to 60 right now you can say the same thing can Virginia get to 40 how about a 140 run for Virginia Tech the key right now you coming to the game I thought Lin kid had to be good for Virginia Tech hes been terrific they played through him and then Virginia Tech had to take care of the basketball check check Virginia Tech dominating this game at home Cavaliers desperate for some offense Obie back to you yeah theyve gone about 7 minutes kab without scoring so a nasty hole theyre in right now 30 14 and a nervous looking Tony Bennett at the moment they have already beaten the hokes once this season in their previous meeting in January 6557 dickl getting that loose ball going to get done for the foul as he kept on picking at it a great job by dun initially denying the opportunity getting the deflection but once he doesnt get the loose ball has to back up because as Ryan Dunn picks up that foul thats his second so now hes going to have to come sit down5 and now youre talking about taking away one of the best defenders for Virginia in a game where theyve already struggled to guard Virginia Tech one and one first time around nickol and kid 20 points seven out of eight Music and nickel and kid have both shown up significantly in this game combining for 20 points already those two guys alone have outscored Virginia 20 to 14 and locking up beakman to this point 146 assists a game mentioned Lyn kid having a big half nickel at the line Tyler niichel continuing to grow in his confidence in his role here at Virginia Tech 14 points for him against North Carolina on Saturday and off to a strong start here in the first half earning more and more minutes for Mike young as of late throws with it guys hit 38 out of 77 beyond the threepoint line but could not get free hoks defense has been superb throw trying to take that Baseline and kick he swing it out for beakman off Target but another shot with two seconds remaining on the shot clock Virginia down big and still being patient on the offensive end while Virginia Tech continues to exploit the interior this time its malizo poti coming up with the big buckle the 69ine poti getting behind the defense he had a really good game off the bench on Saturday at 15 and hes really been the reasoning for the lack of production in Len kid because at this point now Mike young having a hard time getting enough minutes for both those big guys shot clock to three Bond will try and hit it off the back of the iron but once again another tough shot for Virginia at the end of the shot clock so not only are you taking away valuable time but youre not getting good looks and contested shots elate B with another touch heres Couture straight on got it and the hokes are hitting Virginia right in the mouth thats the one guy you cannot allow to get hot in this building they love Hunter Couture here in blackburg so this is pickle ball pickle these guys are intense with each trade from Morgan Stanley were ready for whatever gets served up dude you got to work on your trash talk Id rather work on saving for retirement for college since you like to get schooled thats a pretty good Burn Right One a leave works all day so I can keep working my magic just w a leave 12 hours of uninterrupted pain relief Al leave who do you take it for and for fast topical pain relief try Music evx everyone has to be on the same page if youre going to front the post youve got to have help and you see Jacob Gro trying to front malijah poti however no one on the backside to take away the easy basket as petite dunks it home in Virginia Tech right now with a 22point lead here on their home F my goodness our bracketologist jool andard said a win or loss for Virginia tonight will not make much difference on the seating line as finally gets two points on the board after that incredible drought but were talking about trying to win the ACC regular season title and a loss could be really crucial for Virginia tonight given their position in third nickel will fire and thats much too strong but the rebound comes out High everything going the Hokes way here in the first half now the Hokies will bring it out try to get still 4 seconds in between the game clock and shot clock but they dont want to give Virginia much time to get a basket or a quality look on the other end Collins spins and fires cant knock it down they had a 9 minute and 43 second drought at the Hornet wont go Virginia broke that but Virginia Tech did everything else right 36 16 look at how they closed that half on a 202 run so impressive doesnt cover it for the hokes on their home floor open space against that Virginia Defense than you typically do tonight ly kid leading the way for the hes with 12 points Reese beakman for Virginia four points and an ugly start to the second half as fumble out of play and right back over to the hokes and Obi you mentioned Virginia leads the country with only 82 turnovers per game game a turn over on the first possession but as you look at the numbers and what happened over the last 915 of that first half it was all Music hokeys Baron and hes going to get Applause hit thats going to be another foul here on dun number three yeah you compound the fouling the jump shooter foul by Ryan Dunn picking up his third foul and now he has to be less aggressive on the defensive end of the floor and youre talking about the accs shot block leader and also top 10 in steel so hes a guy thats normally very aggressive defensively but hell lose some of that aggressiveness now after picking up that third foul Baron good foul shooter 82 a lot of good foul Shooters on the hokes as they make 80 as a team baring the transfer from Northwestern and Obie have you noticed that you and I doing our big Monday games have had three separate teams who have been number one in the ACC in free throw shooting and they all shoot it poorly from the free throw line normally so well see if Virginia Tech can break that curse because I think its been us its got to be us I think its been us as might as well take that on our its the broadcaster Jinx we saw that with Miami and we saw it with wake for thats right beon on the move with a follow away and not there for him padulla on the drive and he will scoop it up an in and the dangerous part about this for Virginia is Virginia Tech was able to have so much success in the first half without Shawn padulla that leading score really getting going they had everybody else Step Up Now sha padulla looking more comfortable on the offensive end into the paint that will be off the fingertips of Miner Collins shovels kid with the Stu emphatic dunk Len kid continues to put on a show tonight 4316 Virginia Tech Virginia now with six turnovers and Virginia Tech with 12 points they are capitalizing on every turnover from the ho mcne from distance cant hit it they need a ton of those to try and get back into this thing and its just not the Cavalier style to play from behind its going to be interesting to see does Tony Bennett speed things up for Virginia on the offensive end here in this second half recognizing that theyre down by 27 points Collins trying to operate some contact there will miss fire and roie going toe to toe Cavaliers only make about 45 of their shots and theyre not a good foul shooting team either theyre a great defensive team they hang there had almost entirely on that well thatll be another possession where youre down under 10 seconds Reese be stepping up knocking down a big three but 20 seconds going off the clock Im interested to see if Virginia has it really in their repertoire to be able to find something offensively that allows them to speed it up and gain more possessions this game cuz as you said they can hit all the threes they want but if its always with two seconds on a shot clock games going to be over before they get back its going to be T especially when they cant stop Virginia tackle on the other end oh what a pretty play as D will scoop it up and in on the reverse and thats what youre looking for if youre Virginia score faster and then get back and try to find a way to get a stop they were able to capitalize off getting out in transition on the last possession youre going to need much more of that to try to make this a game well the crowds been a big factor after a sleepy start by both teams Ill tell you what the Hokies woke up fast Hunter Couture for Collins shot clock down to three padul is looking at it now hes to get a shot in the air and did not touch the rim so its a shot clock violation L kid doing the job defensively and then getting out in transition finishing strong l looks like a young man who knew that he did not have a very good game against Virginia on January the 17th only two points for him in that one and he has shown up in a major way 14 points and five rebounds here in the first 24 minutes yeah hes been the star for the hokes no question about that a whistle with 1611 to go here in the second half Len kid really big time in this one he hit 64 of his shots but hes hitting a wide variety shots so far for tonight he absolutely has and Virginia has elected not to double team him early and hes taking advantage of those oneonone opportunities Bon back in the game and misses there he was the guy that ended that drought an unlikely source of offense cuz he barely played yeah he hasnt been getting much minutes as of late started off the season coming off the bench and getting heavily into rotation for Virginia pulla and from behind Bond will foul him along the Baseline Virginias 35 so we have a Time out Virginia Tech putting a hammer down against a big time rival in blackburg so Music far its time for news about the news sling TV has the same news programming you love starting at 40 a month

castle the Hoke is up big open the Cavaliers Im joined now by the head coach of the womens basketball team here at kitty Brooks and I was told to refer to you more as Corey Alexanders cousin so I dont know how you feel about that but what I do know is that we had a conversation earlier you said you dont get many of these moments to be in attendance here whats this environment like youre 8 and0 at home theyre 11 and2 describe it unbelievable poke nation is the best and uh when you can get a crowd like this behind you and supporting you it gives you a great chance to win and Im so proud of our kids our fan base because we get the same type of crowds now and its really been a difference in us being a good team they made us a great team being a great team will also bring college game day to campus as well when you have that type of recognition what does that mean for the program as well its unbelievable you know obviously you watch it you look at it you see the excitement that it brings not only in basketball but football it just generates so much interest for your program and just womens basketball in general so were glad to be a part of it we lost a basketball Giant in Lefty dy I saw you post something on X or Twitter and you mentioned the impact he had on your life as a coach can you walk us through what that relationship was like he meant everything to me you know when I played for him I thought he was the craziest man in the world but then I got to coach with him and then I saw behind the scenes what he was doing we thought he was doing things to us he was doing things for us and I think he made me a better person a better player a better Coach a better husband and a better father and I he taught me how to incorporate family into your program I saw him the way that he loved his wife the way he brought his family around the program and for me that was that was a blueprint and my family is very involved with my program and it gives it that family type atmosphere I learned it all from H we can see you sitting up in the Raptors with your family as well enjoying the game last thing for you coach I know that this is one of the most electric moments of the Year everyones preparing for conference tournaments March Madness on the horizon as well what makes these moments so special well its its great you know womens basketball has grown so much we have the best conference best womens basketball conference in the country and uh and everyones going out playing you have to play each and every night were doing our part and I think were bringing a lot of excitement not only to blackburg but just to womens basketball in general were glad to do our part I know that youre a lot better than Cory your cousin which when you have a banner I will say head coach Kenny Brooks making history thanks for your time coach my question is better at what angel I mean I mean yeah hes a better Coach I Ill give him that much hes a better Coach however everything that he did Growing Up I tried to copy it emulate it and did it better at an earlier age so you know he was the blueprint however Ill give him that youre both very classy guys I think I know where you got a lot of that from no question about hes a great coach with 31 wins last year final four spectacular season and they can make a long run again this year OB it was an exciting season for me and my family a lot of people were upset a lot of UVA people were upset when I mentioned on the broadcast that Virginia Tech was my favorite womens basketball program but now they see why Kenny and I grew up basically in the same house we grew up in a duplex side by side hes my older brother you see him looking up at his family those are my nieces Gabby Kendall and Chloe his wife chrisy thats my family and again so I was long for the ride all last season on the way to the final four scoop shot by Baron so that ends a bit of a drought there for the hokes a little over four minutes but very much in control of this one where is Hunter coutur fit in in the family thats nephew thats my nephew right now were looking forward to a July 20th Hunter marries into the family bond with the offensive foul so youre looking forward to the wedding theres theres my baby girl theres Chloe Hunter fiance Gabby sitting to the left and then of course the matriarch of the family theres Chrissy Brooks tuning in and now when I tell you the most intense out of everyone oh I can tell that would be Chrissy AKA fry my little brother couldnt ounc her name early so she was fry and shes been fry ever since but she is the true matri of this program shes the one that everyone calls shes the one that everyone looks to well you can tell the answers this is a serious look and her team is up 47 to 23 but she is looking at everything that Hunter is doing her her future soninlaw and she is going to have a detailed scouting report of his game after Hunter get used to Applause that Collins finding po trying to get it out of the double did Nick will lay it up and in thats the way its been going all night for Virginia Tech theyve been getting the bounces they have been outplaying Virginia since about the 16minute mark of the first half but Virginia was started the game out not double teaming and now because of successful Virginia Tech offensively they didnt have a choice but to double team yep and thatll go the hookies way too and Virginia Tech very well prepared for the double team as Tyler niichel cuts down through the basket and you look at Virginia whats happened throughout the Tony Bennett era the worst ACC lost 24 points and that happened twice in 2011 before this true run for Tony Bennett and then February the 18th of 2017th at North Carolina which happened to be a national championship Tamp PO with a catch and the Finish as he got it down deep for the bucket you know Virginia Tech lost Saturday at Chapel Hill and that was a tough loss obviously North Carolinas playing some great basketball and theyre the number one team in the ACC and right now A Man Down is Hunter Couture and grabbing at that leg lets see if Hunter is okay thats fortunate hes looking to Shan padulla to stretch his leg out which means thats a cramp so thats fortunate for Hunter that its and again I say this sitting over here in my suit sneakers only a cramp but he gets up to run it off youre talking about a young man that is tough as Nails hell have to come out on this one actually he may not have to come out because no timeout called n goes over gets a couple electrolytes get a little hydration lets take another look you see jumps and then lands awkwardly but knows exactly what it is as he goes down still trying to stretch it out what what is it Mike young has used the phrase as only Mike can hes as tough as a pine knot and and look at chloee concern Chrissys probably texting Hunters parents letting him know letting them know hes okay I didnt see Rodney and Kathy here in the building today so Im sure theyre home in Orlando watching well 144 games for Hunter a program record its also made more threes than anybody in the history of the Virginia Tech program and I think everybody who talks about him who who has met him who has known him talks about him as a future coach absolutely and you know one of the things that hes talked about is again he wants to play first but will he actually coach with his fatherinlaw on the womens side or will he be on the mens side thats going to be a question for Hunter Couture inter as time goes along hokes in command 5125 against number 21 Virginia Virginia Tech had dropped four out of five coming into this game when were playing themselves into the same position they were in a couple of years ago they had had to win the ACC tournament asz that ones going to be switched in by mcne in order to go to the NCAA tournament tonight would be a big win for them it absolutely would be a big win and when you look at the you know struggles that Virginia Tech has had theyre still 68 in the net so this a team with a couple of big wins can still try to find themselves in the mix but of course its going to be important for them to play well in DC during the ACC tournament to try to get into the NCAA tournament shot clock down to seven and thrown away picked off by Harris he did not have numbers there and kadula forced him into a turnover Tapped Out by Harris Lets go to Angel guys just going back to when I was able to catch up with Tony Bennett at halftime I asked someone with a difference in his team he said simply they outworked Us in every single category but those categories really dont show up on a stat sheet he said theyre more aggressive theyre more physical were a step behind in everything we cant shake loose on anything what he wants more of is the quality possessions but we havent been able to see that in the second half yet but he did say the difference is we have to step up together take it one possession at a time Angel no one values toughness more than Tony Bennett thats going to go the other way and a foul against Virginia and Tony Bennett looking for the answers theyre not coming yet hes got 1141 to go we will take the temperature of the ACC when we return after this commercial break if Advanced lung cancer has you searching for possibilities discover a different first treatment

his dreams his fears even his secrets not a lot of people know this but the geo is actually lefthanded you can see by the way he holds the microphone when he comes to the podium he made it easy with only his left hand what hand he chooses to use as his dominant hand thats his business and no one elses on one hand its so helpful to find the right coverage with Geo on the other hand who cares I care from Cars to home to jewelry its easy to Geico little heat check on the ACC up to the minute well pit at the boiling point fivegame win streak Blake Hinson 68 points his last two games he can do that Virginia were going to call him warm right now they won nine out of 10 one game from first place but tonight all sorts of problems in North Carolina cold after starting 9 and0 in the conference three and three in the last six defense has been their problem defense been their problem when that was their strong suit throughout the entire month of January where they were the best team in the ACC but were going to see V Virginia hosting North Carolina this weekend so you and I will be there for the call on that one going to be interesting to see how Virginia responds still 11 and 12 minutes remaining in this one they have a chance to come back but Virginia has to find something offensively foul off the ball here you have Virginia hosting North Carolina 400 on Saturday Virginias number the Duke Blue Devils are at Miami Wednesday and then at Wake Forest next Saturday at 2 pm Sonic Blockbuster on Saturday and after the Carolina game Virginia has Boston College Duke and then they go to Georgia Tech to conclude the ACC regular season but how about the last time that North Carolina beat Virginia in Charlottesville was in 2012 now that is impressive when you start talking about what Tony Bennett has done because of course for Virginia know the truth rival is Virginia Tech but from a basketball standpoint there are many Virginia fans that think that North Carolina is the Rival and that goes back to of course the Dean Smith Terry Holland days where Ralph Samson was playing against Michael Jordan and James Worthy Etc so the fact that Virginia has won every game in Charlesville throughout that time frame is impressive bar got a great look just absolutely drain to Triple thats a big guy who can shoot it at 69 yeah Robbie Baron thats his first made threepointer on the evening but hes had his impact on the defensive end where were not as used to seeing him be as aggressive Reese beakman at 10 minutes 40 seconds to bring Virginia back here he thought about a three again late in the shot clock has to heave it up there how many times has that happened tonight but its its tough shots late in the shot clock 4 seconds remaining on the shot clock and youre having to take a tough threepointer over a contested hand kid losing command of it now a scrap for it The Possession are will keep it on this end and again a 2024 ACC tournament getting underway in Washington DC March 12 through the 16 tickets available at Capital One Arena great spot to see a game in the 71st annual edition of a great tournament and I believe Washington DC will call it the DMV because I believe Believe In 1976 that was Virginias first ever ACC tournament win with wonderful Wally Walker leading the ho to a championship for Virginias first and then Virginia winning it second in Greensboro in 203 2014 so Virginia fans will be excited great pass nck terrific finish on it but Padulas passed through the ooze and the Oz from the crowd that had something on it yeah Virginias fans will be a little a little more excited about the ACC tournament than they have been this performance here against the Rival Virginia Tech on the road Harris gets an open midrange and thats all net two point pass by number one Dante but 56 30 the hokes they held the Cavaliers scoreless for over 9 minutes and one fateful stretch in the first half and a bum there by Buchanan will commit another foul Shan padulla hasnt had a huge scoring game but right here he flat out drops a dime he put that spin on it OB thats what you call put that spin on it thats what I used to do when I used to go bowling however however you know thats uh hurt my wrist so I had to shut that down but wait wait a minute you you did it when you bold but not in basketball games no no no Im not going to throw that pass in the basketball game Im giving sha padulla the ultimate credit for making that that pass yeah yeah that was gorgeous Che in for the Cavaliers 22 Jord 57 Applause 30 check in for the h the ESPNs womens basketball Thursday prime time thats number 12 UCLA taking on number 18 Utah at Paulie Pavilion starting at 930 Eastern Music Time pull up pop and it barely Nicks the Iron by Harris looking for a second attempt blocked from behind there by Baron its really Virginia known for the block shots at one of the better shot blocking teams in the country but Virginia Tech has turned the tables on him with the rejections tonight you know and really thats the thats the identity also of Mike young Mike young is a great defensive coach when you go back a couple of seasons ago when they won the ACC tournament they did it with their defense you got to think about the teams that they beat to get to that point knocking off both Duke and North Carolina to win the ACC tournament championship and they were a very good defensive team of course they got some great shooting from Hunter Couture Who was the tournament Most Valuable Player 31 points for him in a championship game but it was what they did defensively that allowed him to get to that point takes the hit and tonight theyre even in blocks its usually an area Virginia flat dominates got to get that contact back in especially shooting in the castle guard with bacon on the line you have to absolutely have your contacts right bacon on the line because if he misses them both everybody up there and everybody in the arena gets free bacon tonight and they look hungry well everything else is going the Hokes way lets see if Miner makes this one and disappoints them or sends them all home with a lot of bacon just a 53 foul shooter and he got the second heartbreak in the castle you even had the Virginia Tech players Hunter Couture on the bench up rooting for the Miss so that everyone can get bacon kid down on the Block had a big first half he was the major reason the hokes had a huge lead shot clck to five Collins cant hit but theres bar again but thats also part of when you have Ryan Dunn guarding the basketball and Jordan Miner having to deal with Lyn kid someone else has to be able to get a body on a Defender no one there to take Robbie Baron off the glass Richford one hands it no thats going to be tipped that shot wont drop either Miner couldnt get Applause it and look at this lead Virginia just 13 for 39 okis 21 for 41 and a turnover there have not been many moments like that from Mike Youngs team tonight theres an official timeout hoki having a grand time inside the castle tonight against their big rival whered you want to serve oh I didnt serve but if your spouse parent or grandparent served in the military you can join USAA yeah my Grandpa did so Im already in but I was talking about your serve oh USAA for the military Community when you have a history of greatness the real challenge starts after the Finish Line when Victory alone isnt enough you raise your bar keep dreaming and go beyond the limits of what youve ever thought possible the new 2024 Ridgeline passport and pilot part of our most rugged trail sport lineup yet from Honda when youre great your game does the talk in the ACC our speaks Vol three of the last eight NCAA championships 99 NCAA tournament wins since 2015 eight NCAA titles in the last 22 years six of the top 30 winning his Pro programs in division one most of any time its not bragging if its true greatness is what we do the ACCC accomplish Music greatness Chipotles brace beef Barbacoa might be our best kept secret if you know you Music know Riding High on the in low NOS you dont just want a low price you want the lowest price

you Music coming up next first place in the Big 12 on the line down in Houston as the second ranked cougars host number six Iowa State so the eatens pretty good in the castle too thats one way to fortify the troops it absolutely is one of the places Im always looking for a plate and again I dont know where this was cuz they hid this from me pregame but be sure how to find it after the game because you eat everything no this is very true youre incredible Ive never seen anybody like you this this is very true and you dont gain an ounce oh I do I just got to work out well everything working out for the Hoke 60 to 31 Virginia with the ball we talked about this its just not the style of play for Tony Bennetts team to be able to come back and once again a shot clock violation and thats very disturbing thats happened many times tonight either late in the shot clock or the violation and this is one of the things and Isaac McNeil he said it best Virginia is not necessarily A team that plays well from behind we are not the fastest team and we dont try and push it and transition too much so what I was interested to see with down 20 at halftime would Tony Bennett go to something differently to try to get quicker shots on target Robbie bar in a nice second half and Tony Bennett going with a full line change all five will come out as five players at the scores table checking in at the next dead ball thats thats like Ive seen enough tonight well hes actually getting some starters back in the game Reese beakman will be one of the guys coming back Applause in with the largest win ever for Virginia Tech over Virginia 35 points and thats back in 61 OB and I cant remember anyone playing on the 61 team for either of these groups nickel off Target with that one 63 31 and a timeout with 6 and a half to go and an entirely new lineup coming in now for Tony benett its hard to explain what this feels like moving piles of Earth just by moving a lever Towing up to 4000 lb with

scoring record taking a shot now at the alltime record period held by Pete Maravich the great Pistol Pete 3666 seven which he did in just 3 years in LSU 3 years in LSU and of course pistol was the guy and thats a record that you would never have think thought have would been broken to be completely honest Caitlyn Clark is doing it within 4 years I believe that she will get to that Mark and again Im happy that when it does happen it will be within four years we dont have to put the as beside it that she did in the fifth year at Co year but amazing know pistol did it with no threepoint line also right but I can tell you this OB he had to ice That Elbow every game because he was getting his looks at The Rim he sure did his dad his dad was his coach his dad press so P could do whatever he want he was a great player he also a great passer well you look at Cs numbers passive hes got a th assists its unbelievable and Pistol had over 450 so citn with double more than double the assist of Pistol Pete but again not to take anything away from Pistol Pete but really only to enhance what Caitlyn Clark has done throughout her career absolutely amazing Y and appropriately did it broke the record on a threepointer oh that was that should have been four I mean that that was a and she said simply you guys knew I was going to shoot a logo three for the record right she pulled up from about 30 ft yeah it was nothing but net and po will slam it down and draw the foul and what has become an absolute run away for the hokes tonight against their Rivals here in the Commonwealth Clash fans have been loving it since the early going Tony Bennett is not but Tony Bennett right now is probably perplexed in wondering what has led his team down more has it been their offense or has it been their defense because I mean when you look at the fact that Virginia only allows about 57 points per game Virginia Tech with 65 with still 5 minutes remaining in this one Virginia Techs gotten everything theyve wanted on the offensive end of the floor today Buchanan with a misfire the hok are shooting 51 from the field I cant imagine or remember the last time a team shot 51 against Virginia Collins with a Miss padulla probably should have laid it up but unselfish there 443 remaining mne Le cant hit it they tap it out High nichel going over the top laid up in by Colin you talk about everything clicking over 40 minutes almost here for the Hokies incredible against a really good Virginia team and Virginia with another turnover we started off the broadcast talking about they only average 82 turnovers per game which is tops in the AA and that is now OB 24 points scored off of 12 Virginia turnovers Virginia Tech has capitalized every time Virginias had a miscue on the offensive end yanon has it plucked Away by padulla but he knocks it out of bounds and a Timeout on the floor well no bacon yet but everything else is cooking for the Hoke 69 Applause 33 lets do another in this Clinic we pride

the ACC Networks women basketball schedule after 19th rank Notre Dame takes on Boston College at noon Eastern number eight the hokes will take on North Carolina then its sixth ranked NC State and Duke on acc Network we heard Kenny mention it earlier the ACC is by far the best womens basketball conference in the country it seems as though every time we do one of those promos each and every team has a number besid so many ranked teams in the league and again the only reason that theyre falling in the rankings is because theyre beating up on each other but going to be interesting to see how it works out for the ACC comeing NCAA tournament time with so many quality teams in the league March 12 ACC tournament getting underway in Washington DC we hope to see you there Camden trying to get it inside the hokes with a shot clock down to two and a long one by Camden wont drop hes only the 15th threepointer hes attempted hes hit seven of them thats pretty good percentage hes got to get more shots over here you know thats the way I see it I know you see it that way ger but that wont drop Music so complete beat down tonight for Virginia Tech against their rival to Virginia Cavaliers it is typically a great rivalry normally the games are very close and they come down to the last couple of possessions Miner on the drive and a foul and hell be off to the line to shoot not many foul shots in this game yeah but that foul that foul puts the castle guard in an opport Unity to get some bacon out of this as Miner goes to the free throw line he made one of two last time he had to shoot into this crowd and we had a great shot of it look at our camera crew man come on you cant beat this Obie this is college basketball at its finals miners scuffles at the line look good on that one and the kids are deeply disappointed once again thats the one thing if you take any positive away from this from Virginia theyve shot the basketball much better from the free throw line in this game now four of six from the line where they were one of 11 and winning at home on Saturday but not many foul shots as you point out on the other hand Virginia Tech is 13 for 17 young up high approaching the twominute marked Harris for a moment had a steal but he lost it out of play 69 to 37 so the race for Buys in the tournament the top four teams get a double buy teams five through nine get a single by when you talk about the quality of the league I mentioned earlier coming into this game ver Virginia Tech still a top 70 in the net ranking young with a triple Jaden young being able to knock down the three ball to the Delight of the crowd and at this point for Virginia Tech you get some guys who dont get many minutes an opportunity to play as Elijah ger gets to the bucket for the acrobatic finish but the team the starters the guys who are in the heavy rotation up cheering on each and every one of their teammates recognizing how important they are to this program another jumper on the way and he sinks that one from the other side young coming off the bench delighting his teammates and doing it right in front of his coach Mike young and I mean hey coach I might need a couple more minutes if Im coming off the Ben shooting it like this Harris with a step back no and tapped out of play itll go the other way itll be hoks basketball and the celebration getting into full throat now for the Hokies fans as Mike Youngs going hard to the bench and getting the guys who dont play much onto the floor here this was not the expectation that with like a minute to go Tony Bennett would be emptying his bench and Mike young would be emptying his bench not in a game like this its not typically true but it is tonight going to wind up a big win for the hokes in more ways than one one they really needed having Dro four out of five it gets them back to one game under 500 in the lead and again this is a team that can get hot and make a run not happy about their performance at North Carolina on Saturday Mike young felt like they had this type of performance in them offensively but Im sure that he was not expecting this level of Defense but he will absolutely take it especially here in what was a maroon out tonight for the hokes castle guard showed up in tremendous fashion supported their team yeah the other word is blowout and Virginia finally Breaking the 40point Barrier with less than a minute to play and Virginia to taste their seventh loss of the season and dropped to 11 and five in the leag could be a very damaging loss in their bid to win the ACC title in the regular season trying to chase down both North Carolina and Duke and a big opportunity for Virginia on Saturday with North Carolina coming to jpj long week for Tony Bennett and his team to have to think about this game but also time to recover and get back to their defensive ways batted out by tane Murray 206 to go you know we were asking what would Tony Bennett say after the game Mike young is going to have a really interesting postgame press conference because everything everything went right almost everything they didnt get bacon fans didnt get bacon didnt get bacon number 14 from the corner that wont drop and a shot clock violation never touched the iron they couldnt be happier and obviously hoping that the WalkOns and the extras get a couple of baskets here yeah everyone involved for that one as Ward got the wide open three in the corner unable to get it to go but the entire bench all the supporters up wanting to see him get a basket here in this rivalry Applause game Gertrude looking to make a move and itll be blocked the shot right in front of the horn here the rebound that goes out and thats the ball game Virginia teeken a total runaway over Virginia
