out its starting lineup we told you about Chad venning taking up a lot of space in the middle for the Eagles in the pain as the orange will start with the basketball on the road here in Chestnut Hill jier Davis is the senior transfer from Delaware he is in the lineup today the starting lineup because Freeman is not playing been that kind of season for Syracuse just when Starling comes back out goes Freeman and thats exactly what you want at the start with your star 21 points in a game high in the win against Georgia back at home at the Dome on Tuesday for the orange and JJ Starling the Junior from Baldwinsville New York right outside of Syracuse saved by the orange and Starling Tom Starling brings so much to this team not just with his points his scoring his leadership but he gives them a little bit of swagger they know they got the baddest dude in the gym on their team orange bringing a seven and eight record one and three in conference play looking for their first road win of the season 0 and2 on the road in the ACC in the shot clock at eight Davis operating in the paint over his Defenders for Applause two Davis who averages about eight and a half points per game eight points nine boards four assists and a season High 32 minutes against Georgia Tech on Tuesday side Rim kept Alive by the eagles flying in there for the the board Deon Brown zenning on the perimeter Brown shot clock at five shed the defender side Rim its going to be so interesting Tom watching this battle of the bigs between Eddie lampin and Chad venning for Boston College vendings going to want to take him out on the perimeter but also lampin might have to pay play extended minutes with Freeman now lampin with the basketball trying to back it down gives it up Taylor misses the three hand has it Boston College been second in the league in threepoint shooting in League games rims out for hand for two start for him struggles early on for the Eagles Davis has a little bit of daylight lamp can tried to a board on the weak side and hand came away with it we got two low percentage shooting teams here so rebounding is going to be very important we talked about the ice under the floor spinning around Beetle from Boston College its another thing about both these two teams Tom is that they both love that midrange whatever analytics is happening around the country in the NBA youre not going to see much of that here its not about the threepoint line and the rim with these two teams both of them love the midrange and Donnie Freeman is a real midrange specialist not playing lamin able to get it back and preserve The Possession lamin for all his size is not a proficient offensive rebounder now working on Benning lost the handle Han does not have the numerical Advantage waits for reinforcements Josh Beetle to transfer from Clemson he was part of that team that went to a regional final for Brad Brownell Earl Grant was an assistant under Brad Brownell in his Ascension to Boston College head position Davis just rips it away from the Eagles venning likes to fade away and he likes to go left shoulder might be able to score that way but youre not going to get your man in foul trouble scarling gave it off around the edge Taylor flying to the rim nice job getting downhill for Taylor because Syracuse does not have a traditional pass first point guard rre move jquan Carlos to the bench youre going to see a lot of that uh dribble handoff action to get their offense going cuz they dont have a natural playmaker beetle with the bucket at the other end for the Eagles right back into this one in the early stages of our first half its kind of the challenge Adrien ay has face and getting his offense into a rhythm because Carlos is his best passer but hes a 17 threepoint shooter rrie second season as the head coach for the orange taking over for the legend and Hall of Famer Jim be time and its Davis inside uncontested Jam as he cleared the way thats the second time that Davis has put Elijah strong in the blender Davis who had a double double in the first game of the season scoring threat early for the orange in the lineup Freeman is on the bench for the second straight game fo injury Moore teeing up a threepointer two strong in the long rebound to Starling little soft shot inside the free throw line thats his spot he loves that spot shot like a little tear drop even though he didnt have a defender in front of him thats how thats how used to he is to that shot good start for JJ Starling he leads the way for the orange averaging 19 points per game trying to work it inside and thatll fall itll be vening is that right shoulder you got two shoulders Young fella use them there you go Chad venning the graduate student 69270 from Brooklyn New York spent two years in the Atlantic 10 at St Bonaventure and two years before that at Morgan State venning is playing in his 123rd game as a Collegiate player Taylor Slams on the brakes and hits the jumper its all that curl dribble hand off action and into the midrange teams are 0 for four combined from three so the midrange is key we have played six straight minutes without a stoppage from the opening tip Beetle hand Taylor recovered defensively hand hit the Baseline jumper another midrange Donald Han has terrific size again not a great threepoint shooter only 33 on the season but 65 195 and he knows how to use that body Starling cross it over go in for the cham and he was met by venning in midair mind you back the other way its Beetle drops it off lampin comes flying in strong let him go by and laid it Applause in what a sequence at both ends of the floor starts with the defense at The Rim defense leading to offense Davis who has six points already little follow a spins out to Applause hand and the leading score and rebounder hes 11th in the conference and rebounding tries a three and rips the ropes for the Eagles theres a made three hey were going to get to the Under 12 timeout before we get the under 16 timeout here and with that shot Boston College has taken a 1312 Advantage are we on running time here partner we should do this at summer camp so far we are DC averages just six made threes per game Moore lost the handle Eagles on a 70 run and their leading scorer with some production from Beyond The Arc Donald Han is feeling it pulls up and splash we got a good one here at Music Chestnut supp by the American canc Society total is 2950 scien inov science season savings B will10 to the johnys ands Hub of thank you to savings bal2 m asinger misses two free throws youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by All State youre in good hands e youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by All State youre in good hands Gass and Hall on the BC campus blanketed with snow overnight Im being told the most significant snowfall that they have seen so far its a onepoint game well watch this matchup of the two big men inside well we talked about Donnie Freeman not being there for Syracuse they missed his scoring they missed his rebounds and by the way five more fouls so lampin has to be careful about foul trouble and then you also wonder a little bit about uh Eddie lanins conditioning Tom I know talked to Earl Grant earlier today he wants us to get up into a quicker Tempo both these teams by the way play a pretty fast tempo that would be to Boston Colleges Advantage now we know these teams do not rely on the threepoint shot primarily although a moment ago we saw Han knock down a three for the Eagles and put him in front 1312 well see if that develops as a factor as this game progresses Peter movich has come into the game for the orange he wears number six jquan Carlos as well a driving shot and a miss from Chris Bell out of bounds and basketball just to explain to our viewers what we were talking about theres a mandated TV timeout under 16 minutes and Under 12 minutes we just hit the under 16 so were going to have another one here pretty quickly Under 12 unless they take us to the under four the way these guys were playing thats kind of the way things were going Luca Taves has come into the lineup for Boston College 10 in white and Rises and misses lamin grabs it so Jadon Hastings is in the game now for Boston College up front for Chad vening I would not be surprised to see those two play a little bit more together Carlos weaving his way findes Taylor and its all net for three so now weve got jquan Carlos at in at Point instead of JJ staring for Syracuse now hes looking to set up hes not going to score but hes going to set up so it gives them a different look and easiest way to get an assist is to have your guy make an outside shot so thats a second made three for Syracuse Orange AB average about five and a half made threes per game Taves the Miss from distance Taylor working off a Lampkin screen open for three hes got another hes feeling it right now Applause Taylor good start here for Syracuse partner nice to see that ball go in Taves on the drive sends it right back out Bell has an easy re rebound Miss from strong PC now one for five from three Taylor has knocked down threes on successive trips for the orange this is Bell gathers and drives could not calculate the angle BC comes away with it Hastings Taves wide open cant connect Syracuse now going to slow this down and run some motion run some offense Taves had only attempted five threepointers All Season prior to todays game I was just going to say theres a reason he was open he can make him though just hasnt done it in a game Taylor hand went flying by Carlos Beyond The Ark by the way theres a reason hes open too he was three for 18 coming in now for four for 19 then that kind of start for Syracuse Carlos struggled in 10 minutes off the bench did not score and had one rebound against Georgia Tech hes got a three to his credit in the first half coming off the bench for the orange interesed to see if Syracuse can push open this lead with Starling on the bench they played seven games without him theres a usefulness there Carlos runs it up borovic had it knocked away at the last second defensively by Hastings Eagles trying to cut into this orange 90 run cant do it and those nine points have all come from threepointers for Syracuse Carlos slows it down as we approach the 9minute threshold in the first half Tom wormy along with Seth Davis and our outstanding CW Courtside Saturday production crew side of the rim for movich from the corner thats strong side double from strong Eddie lamin is also a good passer hand driving hell get to the free throw line so well take a timeout almost made the under eight timeout hell be at the line when we come back you think these guys have a flight to catch I know Mr Taylor hes play a little string music all right PC its now time to play our money ball challenge presented by our friends on empow we have ryers our first contestant this evening whos going to try to win some cold heart cash just by shooting wherever the Empower logs are now here are the rules you have three shots the fourth ones a money ball right you can Che whatever you want but they all cost something layups are 25 Wing one here is 50 and then the farther one out is 100 so its whatever you want to do okay right here we go youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for nearly 160 years get the the video board and see if you can actually activate it all right here we go when should you start saving for retirement you knew right away correct lets out yeah I think SS right is to be correct as soon Asar Applause not going with any cashday youre still our first contestant it aint all easy here lets give it up one more time for youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for nearly 160 years the hog Pavilion part of the BC practice facility with the Eagles trailing 2113 to Syracuse which has connected on three threepoint baskets two of those coming from Lucas Taylor who made 64 threes a season ago at Georgia State and now hes up to 86 career threes for Taylor Taylor knocking down a couple in the first half yeah and Lucas Taylor just got promoted to the starting lineup over his last two in his last three games hes averaging 12 points but only averaging five on the season so he get another score for Syracuse that was a nice rainbow three so hes doing it on the catch Tom and now hes doing it on the bouns so its versatility upon versatility and once you see that ball go in its amazing how contain as it can be youre talk youre looking there folks at an 18 threepoint shooter excuse me 177 threepoint shooter I dont want to give too much credit baring the threepoint shot theres a reason why hes open so a terrific start for Syracuse and the thing about Boston College is that thats been a consistent theme in their losses their opponents have just shot lights out and they lose it home to Dartmouth Dart shoots 17 for 31 from three SMU beat him shooting 11 for 16 South Carolina 10 for 19 they just lost to Georgia tech8 for 17 and then conversely in their wins their opponents have not shoted as well uh from three thats why I said at the top one of the keys of Boston College three and D you got to make your own and then you got to stop your opponent from making them and so far theyre 0 for two in that one for seven from behind the arc great start for Syracuse so Hand will get a breather after the free throws Deon Brown comes back in hand is one of the best free throw shooters in all of the ACC at 90 hes second in the conference so hes on the bench right now for the Eagles coming up next surging Wake Forest hits the Coral Gables take on New Look Miami Wake Forest Miami coming up next only on the CW it is game two CW Courtside Saturday out Carlos dribbles into trouble safety valve and Bell contested shot sh storic weak side TR to wrestle away from McFarland foul called against Boston College well I know its not Christmas time anymore but I think at the top of uh Adrien ays wish list would be Chris Bell to get going they actually moved him to the bench two games ago and it seems to have worked he made four for four from 318 points uh against Florida State even though they lost the game but his threepoint shooting has been really down from his last couple of seasons and Bell was just one of five from Beyond The Arc in the win against Georgia Tech entry pass by storage Davis missed a close shot right now were going to see some extended minutes with Carlos and Starling on the court so Carlos on the ball Starling off the ball thats really their best combination as long as Carlos doesnt kill him too badly with his offense Taves hesitation tried for the scoop was looking for the foul didnt get it BC about 35 shooting so far in the first half 43 for the orange thatll go down just a little bit in the Miss from Applause Bell McFarland lines up with three to match the Jersey McFarland to continue the theme Seth 23 so far from threepoint distance this season well you know you watch this game it feels like Boston College is really not playing well theyre only down three Starling twisting in the air and it goes out of bounds off of Boston College how about Roger McFarland lining it up from threepoint real estate cold outside try to get a little bit of heat on the inside catch shoot and splash Eagles are hanging in SC Music you Applause Applause Music Applause about I dont know Applause go youre watching CW Courtside Saturday

tomorrow ACC womens basketball lets take a look at todays game stats brought to you by Morgan Stanley where old school hard work meets bold new thinking well you see the threepoint shooting there neither team really lighting it up but by their standards especially for Syracuse going three for 17 thats key and those 15 to 11 rebounds uh to one of the issues for Boston College is that theyre seven for 19 from the floor they only have one offensive rebound so Eddie lampkins seven rebounds and six on the defensive end have been a huge help even though lanin hasnt scored hes been very very effective on the glass Brown brings it up for the Eagles big reason why this game is moving so fast is each team has one foul so a total of two team fouls close Miss for Beetle 645 and rolling here in the first half Kyle cuff Jr has the basketball hes into the game for the orange finds staring comes up short tries to follow the Miss venning watch out he clears the rebound DC hasnt played since last Saturday that was a loss on the road to Georgia Tech as cuff comes away with it another defensive rebound for Syracuse Brown on Starling who directs a little traffic Starling back at the point now Carlos on the bench Fred Payne is in there for Boston College as well he wears number five in white cuff straight away fight for the loose ball Here Comes pay they really like lamin to play that high dribble handoff position but that takes him away from the offensive glass Fred Payne weaving his way finds venning up against lampin chest to chest bounces around Jer Davis out of The Fray trying to get it up ahead to Bell and a foul is called by Roger SS he is joined by Shan Hall and Kellen Miller as our officiating crew this afternoon youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State youre in good hands Elijah strong strong back into the lineup we just mentioned good hands well Donald hand Jr is back in for Boston College leading scorer and rebounder at 65 210 out of Virginia Beach Virginia Donald H 13 in white this is 13 in Orange Davis Starling free ball angular rebound run down by Beetle and now H he missed it but I dont think you want to leave Starling you dont want to help off of him not only for his threepoint shot but he can put it on the deck orange three of nine on threepointers venning pounds it into the floor difficult twisting shot High degree of difficulty and he banked it in yeah youre not going to see in any like big man tapes still like to see him use that left hand and that right shoulder got two hands for a reason but that was a nice bucket how about BC only one point down here its because the orang and Seth have missed their last nine shot attempts a lot closer to the rim for lampin and he ends that drought thats where he likes to work you know both these guys lampin and venning below the rim post scores so lampin who has seven rebounds B is into the box score in scoring with his first bucket he averages about 10 points per game just below that double team on Brown got it away venning tried to spin move on the Applause Baseline and he was along the Baseline and might have stepped out of bounds here see Chad venning actually putting it on the deck likes to feel that Defender pump fake spinning around threepoint game Syracuses offense has been Boston Colleges best asset here one for their last 11 bc2 of their last 12 must be the ice under the floor and both teams with 10 points in the paint as well DC hockey program want to get Starling going and they lost a meramac yesterday for the Eagles see if the mens basketball team can pick up the slack series of moves by Davis basket and foul and a flex a you see Davis going to work on Elijah strong spinning back to his right venning not coming over to help because he was afraid to leave lamp not going to make it from outside they might as well start pounding it inside first foul on strong puts Davis at the free throw line 65 for the season from the strike canot compl the old school threepoint play fivepoint game just over four minutes to go in our first half if youre Syracuse you got to get JJ staring going on offense hes got four points in this one its nice to have buckets from the other guys but this is alpha male timeline how about Syracuse has attempted one free throw so far look at Han backing down gets it back steps behind the line Starling the rebound so BCs only been to the line twice and made them both and that that free throw by Davis on the threepoint play attempt was the first free throw attempt for the orange in the first half Lamkin chisels his way inside for Syracuse thats just body on body thats bully ball right there Chad vennings got a wall up on that Lin plays with a lot of emotion and intensity Beetle into the paint peton misses another defensive rebound for Syracuse Boston College has one off defensive rebound and theyre shooting 32 lampin inside again he and venning have a quick conversation and now they may have gotten lampin he was talking with SS Roger SS the official yeah he conversated a little bit too much you can yell you can have enthusiasm you cant yell it at the opposing player that was a mistake number Eddie all right BC lets go on over to our video board to show you our 42 North Dental dont smile cam the rules are simple if you see yourself up on that video Bo except for pretty good all year so lets see how you can do BC for our 42 North Dental dont SP C lets get things off properly here you see yourself but you know what youre supposed to do there we go Mom okay did the kid get in trouble no one tell him no one even tell him he has no idea hes never going to know how about you guys up there too someone the assignment not my man here for the win I see it think I see it a little bit huh I know you want to do the dance come on your favorite song do we have another no gentlemen this gus having a very a day today lets take a look at todays game summary presented by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for nearly 160 years threepoint shot for the orange and Lucas Taylor had the range early yeah that was a story early for Syracuse making outside shots lately theyve been doing an inside particularly with Eddie lampin and Boston College just doesnt have the answer theyve got 17 misses in this game and only one offensive rebound that is literally ins sustainable and they were able to keep this thing close for a while because Syracuse went on about a 5minute scoring drought but thats not going to last forever so somehow Boston College its kind of a simple game they call basketball you got to find a way to make baskets if youre not going to make shots you got to get offensive rebounds and you have to get to the foul line and they havent been able to do that afterwards now Roger SS was kind enough to say that uh Mr lampin got teed up for wishing Chad venning happy holidays Im sure thats exactly what he said appreciate Roger for that information that does count as a personal foul as well and so with the technical foul on Eddie Lampkin hand is at the free throw line so thats that counts to Syracuses second foul of the game we got three minutes left here in the first half I that might be a first for me Tom I dont know no youre much older than I am much called many more games than I have have you ever gotten this late Im sure its happened n BC only has four very rare occasion yes n BC only has four total fouls nobody with more than one so Eddie lampin the graduate student from Houston Texas will be at the free throw line venning picked up the foul on the initial sequence that we showed you and then there was the post whistle conversation some Afters between those two players everybody settled on down and number 44 in Orange is at the free throw line its quite a number at that school as we all know some pretty good athletes have worn 44 Eddie lampin spent his first three years at TCU and one year at Colorado where he wore 44 and wanted to wear it in the tradition of John Wallace and Derek Coleman both of those players made it all the way to the final four by the way fantastic Saturday afternoon crowd inside a County forum for this matchup which has a lot of history in a couple different conferences yeah this does feel like an old school Big E matchup students dont even come back until Monday so pleasantly surprised by that I got to say lamin tough D on venning got a piece of that but lamin also got a piece of vening and a foul is called so thats thats two quick ones on Eddie lampin and once again Donnie Freeman the freshman power forward see if if he could just hold his ground its not a foul but once you step into the guy and he got called on the second one I actually thought the first one was a little bit more of a foul either way it counts as his second this winner NXT bringing the heat every Tuesday on the CW and this Tuesday no different catch all the action on WWE NXT Tuesdays at 87 Central right here on the CW fenning is just 6 6 of the season from the freee throw line and he comes up Applause empty final two and A2 minutes of our first half closely contested game between Boston College and Applause Syracuse surprised theyre not running action for JJ stalling right now just just to keep him in Rhythm its only got four points that pass goes out of bounds yeah Im a little Im I am a little mystified by that Tom because you just you want him in Rhythm you want him confident he came out early in the game first couple of minutes he made a couple of buckets and and you dont even know hes out there now Adrien arry second season spent 12 years as a Syracuse assistant under Jim P beheim former Syracuse player Eddie lampin played 16 minutes in that first half averages about 27 a game on the season theres that zone you watching J beheim how they doing I know I know beheim taking notes Brown trying to shoot over the Zone successfully I shouldnt have said that I shouldnt have said Applause that when Syracuse played Zone all those years for Jim beheim you think about a Zone as as packing it in and forcing them to shoot over they routinely led the Big East and then the ACC in threepoint defense thats what its designed to do so to give up a three on the first Zone possession is no bueno BR got foul Brown made the three and now hes favoring the left foot his three by Brown first points of the game for him that zone moving around and uh little slow getting out there onto the wing from Kyle cuff so Brown is going to come out you want to stay tuned for todays halftime show presented by super subu love its what makes Subaru Subaru check in our wake in Miami preview that one go around the ACC and have the highlights and poignant moments and stats from this first half Syracuse has not made a free throw in this half one of the reasons why theyre only up by two and it feels like theyve been in control heres the Zone again and another easy bucket that is strong close to the rim let me tell you Earl Grants going to walk in that locker room you tell me were 3 for 11 36 two offensive rebounds were tied or one possession thats got to feel pretty good 40 shooting is a team for the orange in the first half Davis lost the handle it and right to Starling inside a 10 of the shot clock just over a minute on the game Music clock Starling got a nice soft Connie Forum roll they need to run action for Starling they need to just turn the game over to him and get him more involved the offense will flow from there another possession of Zone theyre 0 for two on the Zone lets track this you see strong right there in the middle against a terrible threepoint shooting team BC three of 11 on threepoint shots this is Han junor met in midair in the foul by cuff on the confrontation against a driving hand there is no dribble containment there on the wing person foul teams fourth fou at the line the eag Donald you got 62 Kyle cuff as your rim protector on that play suboptimal Im impressed with BC to I mean theyve hung in here not a lot of great things going their way and we still got ourselves a ball game so hand is now five for five from the free throw line with one more coming up Hastings into the lineup venning comes out with 334 seconds to go Applause that is six for six for hand hes now made 27 free throws in a row and I waited till after he took the shot come on theres no such sing as an announcer Jes I got you by the way hes also tied the game at 29 well thats because theres 6 for eight and Syracuse 0 for five from the foul line low scoring low possession game youre plus six on the foul line thats a huge help slight advantage on the boards for the orange 2119 about a 3 second difference G game and shot wait for the ball screen on Starling oh bail out that was Bell bailed them out thats a bad play by hand on on a couple levels not least of which is that Chris Bell hasnt made a whole lot of threepoint shots this season so youre aggressively closing out keep those hands up look like Bell got popped for his for his Applause efforts so Sean Hall one of our officials is over at the scores table just taking a look at that previous play I think he lost the contact lens is what were being told 2929 coming up at halftime confir previous players under review theyre going to look to see if its any kind of flagrant theyre very protective now the other thing is if they determine that he was behind the line hes got three free throws coming up as well the r course confirmed three shot Syracuse thats what they were looking at there was a little stutter step but he did not go over the line in the shot attempt so Bell at the free throw line and the orange have not made a free throw just yet Bell has not scored clearly behind the line for the orange and you see the reaction from hand just trying to play straight up defense got a little piece of bell to put him at the line got to keep those hands up 75 free throw shooter Chris Bell yeah its been its been a tough road for him so far this season I talked about 27 on the season ay moved into the bench the last couple of games total of 31 points Point coming off the bench some guys just have that mentality its like Curtis Jones at Iowa State hes their best player but he likes coming off the bench its just part of his mentality I think in in Bells case autrey told me that he did that just maybe to take a little bit of pressure off of him give a give a different look Syracuse has been struggling a lot of times coaches like to switch things up and B is their best threepoint shooter hes made 16 this season and he commits the foul on Kelly Syracuse F number four Chris thats his Aral foul teams fifth foul first on Bell if you were with us early on in the first half we were just running up and down the court like no whistles nothing these teams just going end to end Chaz Kelly in there for Boston College on the inbounds Bell presenting problems on that inbounds stay with BC 38 on the clock Applause Taylor is the leading scorer in the first half for the orange with 10 points Han has 11 those are the two players whove gotten a double digits in scoring in the first 20 minutes CH on the back side thats a foul to give Syracuse foul number two JJ staring thats his first personal first on Starling little end of the first half foul to give uh strategy all of a sudden we have slowed to a crawl and BC is taking time famine man its Feast fam and thats okay I said in the saider anything about how the early part of the first half was going I know right great to be sitting alongside Seth Davis here on the CW court side Saturday I know youve been here before you said Seth but its been a while right yeah its been a while in fact I was I was remembering uh being here uh for a game and and visiting with the late uh Tim russer uh Boston College graduate great newsman obviously and a huge sports fan and uh he he sure loved his Eagles thats for sure uh listen we we did not expect an offensive Masterpiece and in that sense we are not disappointed Syracuse actually not shooting it terribly 42 from the floor Boston College not as well but both these teams really need a win you see them lock Jam uh at the one and three in that fiveway tie for 12 how about Louisville by the way winning at Pittsburgh alone for the moment in second place in the ACC an unbelievable job by Pat Kelsey hes got to be in the thick of the conversation for National coach of the year we saw his first ACC win on the CW as well beating the clock its Beetle and hes got some high fives for the front row here at Connie forum and beetle with a three tied at 30 earlier on this season yeah late in the shot clock late in the game Beetles the guy they go for the the number that jumps out uh at from the box score for me you see venning inside with the an one is the number one thats one offensive Rebound in the first half for Boston College they had 17 misses and only one offensive rebound on the season theyre grabbing about 34 of their misses which is 71st in the country theyre pretty good offensive rebounding team if they were at that clip Tom theyd probably have about five or six more shots and theyd be winning this game so its nice to get a threepoint play play the way venning just did but if you want to come back and win this game youre not going to shoot it well youve got to get to the offensive Class Credit Eddie lampin for his presence on the defensive glass for Syracuse hes got seven of those boards six on the defensive end Davis at the other end for the orange flings it out onto the perimeter Starling Davis got it back ran into lampin and fumbled it away out of bounds to Boston College its almost an offensive rebound for Syracuse and then if youre Syracuse you really want to get JJ Starling going I know I know I harped on this a lot in the first halftime but he only had four points and those came early in the game despite Syracuse losing possession on its last time down the court just three turnovers theyve averaged 18 turnovers per game over their last five and so limiting the turnovers in a tight one with Boston College and theyve got the basketball with Starling want to correct my math by the way two offensive rebounds now where did you go to school yeah I I didnt ma your a math I can tell you that two offensive rebounds 18 misses the point stands yes majored in basketball at Duke yeah Starling on the drive and a foul is coming up so Starling even though he missed his first shot he got a first shot and now they got him going downhill from the wing to the basket you got to run stuff sometimes for JJ Starling again because theres no true point guard on the court with him at the point and Carlos on the bench JJ Starling leading the team in scoring look at those free throws in clutch situations see if it comes down to it they another reason to have the ball in his hands and like I said at the top hes the one guy on Ser he just gives them their Swagger everybody knows hes their best player and out today theyre without Donnie Freeman by the way we probably havent mentioned that enough Davis misses TI back up but in Davis staying with it on the offensive glass offensive rebound freshman Donnie Freeman missing his second straight game with a right foot injury did not play in the win against Georgia Tech at the Dome on Tuesday Beetle pivots tosses inside def betting oh left hand give him three points for that he used his left I think he should have three I want to give him incenter you talk about Freeman not being in the lineup today Tom second game and Starling missed seven so that means since no November 27th eight of Syracuses nine games have been without either Starling or Freeman whos were uh arguably their two best players very hard to find a rhythm thats why you see theyre out of this offensive rhythm today they are the top two scorers the orange and thats Starling thats thats called an alpha male thats an alpha male you dont have to shoot every time but when they go through those scoring droughts as they did for 5 minutes in the first half theyve got to go to Starling by the way theres high cut sneakers and then theres what JJ Starling is wearing with the fluorescent laces you dont miss a trick right like boxing shoes dont they they do Rocky B out there thats what we got theyre trading punches is what theyre doing Eagles and orange hand nowhere to go lampin trying to stay with him and off Target Second Chance Davis got it a chance for strong and he couldnt convert oh he got the offensive rebound no nice job by lanin though by the way not to go for those shot FES really good Lins playing a terrific basketball game in heavy minutes is playing with two personal fouls Starling catching release everything at the bottom of the net and lampin tried to save it couldnt do it you know lampin has a reputation as being not the highest motor guy not always in the best condition thats not the guy Im seeing today got something to say to the ref so you dont want that second technical Im praising him and giving Kevin uh Viller Kell Viller excuse me lamins coming off a double double against Georgia Tech had 10 points 12 boards his fourth double double of the season and he played 35 minutes to your point on conditioning for L which has improved venning stepping back nasty can we just have venning and lamin play full court oneonone the rest of the way wow Applause payperview were going to have a second half here partner that was smooth by venning these teams have done a lot of losing this season and theyre tired of it more had it knocked away quick hands of brown Boston College on the run in Beetle trying to get by Starling Beetle lays it in Boston College would love to see a quicker Pace here today timeout Syracuse with the Eagles up by Applause five we got some energy in the building and the Eagles are bringing it look at venning is that Chad venning is that Dirk nitzky I cant tell nice bucket Music we youre watching CW Court to you by All State youre in good hands youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by All State youre in good hands thats the Chestnut Hill Reservoir adjacent to campus where the Eagles have taken the lead 4136 Chad venning 11 points yeah I like Benning going to work on the inside just go to work right at Eddie lampin with Freeman out Lins got to play extended minutes its very tiring to have to play post defense BC trying to push the pace getting them up and down the floor and going to work on him and Lins got to be careful about foul trouble as well we talked about Chad venning at the top of the broadcast and thats why because I liked this match up not necessarily him getting the better of the matchup but that if he could get the better of the matchup that could tilt things in DCs Direction theyve played a very spirited second half here so far venting to double digits for the 11th time this season last year he hit double digits 25 times as an all conference selection in the Atlantic 10 for Chad venning Syracuse with the basketball Davis trying to work his way into the paint twisting shot it falls over the front r for jier Davis we were tied at 32 after the first 20 minutes thanks to that man number seven and now beetle with a Applause jumper this the first of two meetings between the teams they will also play February 8th and that will be at the Dome and on the CW Starling floats to the the rim for two thats his spot and thats his action off the curl dribble hand off into the lane little push floater feed him till he burps five of 12 from the floor for Starling the third orange player to get the double digits he Taylor and Davis all have 10 you really cant overstate how tough it was for Syracuse nice play there by strong how tough it was for Syracuse to play those seven games without JJ charling theyre already an offensively limited team theyre relying on frh theyre relying on transfers hes their stud second year in the Syracuse program for Starling who started his college career at Notre Dame driving and laying it in he beat Beetle to the rim now hes feeling it they moved Lampkin away to create the space so thats 12 for Starling 10th time this season hes into double digits ninth rather in all nine games and a driving Brown misses lamin got it back and brown might have committed the foul and a little bit of frustration after the Miss Starling just sliding right down the lane for two hes got 12 and leads the orange in scoring trailing by one off at Del as canow line as the Music rules possible each City will have a name on their whoever Tes CER cour we be going home with a 300 gift card to Delta aines all right this you guys ready how over here you guys ready I have a list of your sittings on the plane on the count of three two one wi it all right we got a couple oh this we have some turbulence here oh this one looked pretty good are we going to confirm this one referees are we good on this one I think so lets find out who our winner is who is Rome Italy Rome Italy you a300 card not too letner big to our at Delta aines thank you guys so for playing Applause on youre watching CW Courtside Saturday brought to you by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for nearly 160 years blanket of snow in Chestnut Hill with the Eagles leading by one although JJ Starling now leads all scores hes got 12 for the orange and he had six in the first half so hes got six here in the second half you can see him going to work there on the inside using his size hes just a comfortable midrange player could score a little bit from three but thats his thats his happy place right in that lane that little push floater shoting a teardrop even when he doesnt have a big guy there just get into the cup over and over again you circle around you give him a big man like lampin the screen for him up top dribble hand off get him going downhill thats the idea partner earlier this season against Youngstown State that was an overtime win for the orange 38 points a career high for Starling whos got 12 so far this afternoon there seven games of that broken hand we dont know how long Donnie Freemans going to be out by the way but I dont think its going to be like a long absence they werent positive that he wasnt going to play today so if youre a Syracuse fan and youre looking for raay of Hope getting him back and into the groove and maybe you find some kind of Rhythm later this month early next month and maybe you got something official word we got was day to day thats a wide Miss from starling see hes got the wrap on the left hand that was an injury in practice Freeman missing his second game left foot injury direction right foot for Freeman venning spinning lamin defending in a fou is call thats huge because Lins got three yep the outstanding basketball action continues on the CW coming up next wake Force faces Miami then tomorrow 2 pm Eastern 1100 am Pacific super sophomore Hannah hadalo leads number three Notre Dame against upsetminded Clemson catch all the basketball action this weekend right here in the CW you know it seemed kind of cute at the time when he picked up that technical foul Eddie lampin chirping away feeling good about himself you like the motor but guess what now hes got three where he would have had two got 13 and a 12 minutes on the clock and even if he stays in the game and he is staying in the game now hes got to be super careful in terms of how he defends BC is putting on the Press they want to get this Tempo going and I said they go right to venning when they get that ball back BC now eight of 11 from the free throw line as a team orange just three of eight in the game from the stripe they work it to lamp against venning got the shot away high for the board McFarland yeah I think you really want to get venning with lamp get on his back Chaz Kelly into the game dble zero for the Eagles this is Han around the vening screen defender in front of him foul called in the process I was just thinking that Donald Hs also been quiet he was quiet in their last game they lost to George attch hes got 11 points in this one thats one thing he does is uses physicality hes not always trying to out skill you and out Talent you but in his size he can be really effective 65195 as a guard second foul on Taylor and by the way the teams have combined for just six turnovers in the game great call Super impressive strong on the inbounds movich defending off balance shot off the glass how did he do it Elijah strong the sophomore from Charlotte North Carolina Boston College is slowly but surely seizing control of this game maybe in for one of those patented scoring droughts from Syracuse here if they dont move it eight points now for strong Starling had it poked away stays from it out of bounds off of BC watch Elijah strong going to work on the inside again Im not sure that you would teach this in big man camp Falling Away across the lane with his soft hand counts for two I like the aggressiveness I like them scoring in the paint strong movement between lamin and movich yeah there you go Starling Nifty dribble and drive beautiful McFarland Kelly Hastings tapped it Starling near it off of his fingertips and that of bounds to Boston College little surprised we havent seen more of Jaden Hastings Earl Grant was talking about maybe playing the two bigs together they were playing that lineup at shootter around today like what hes capable of doing the Freshman from Orlando yep IMG Academy in Florida red shirted last year add some strength and little Globe try to dribble and an equally impressive shot as he was going to the court for Donald Han Jr so you can see the strategy theyre going to work in the paint BC has not even attempted a threepoint shot here in the second half that fourpoint lead see Mr Han going to work on the inside everybody fall into the deck and scoring what happened to standing up and Music shooting pretty good so far this year this one could be interesting you see a couple here I think you know what that means get the person next to you up in the air it is time for our Simba Music whos watch that new Lion King movie you know what to do get that circle of life going up there here we go there we go all right lets see it m Simba a little occupied here this evening huh a little two for one ice cream in one hand K in the other okay okay very nice see that BGA C impression you guys all see that new movie huh I see one over here we got

Applause on hes a cop shes a con and together this unlikely Duo uses their skills to catch criminals the hit series returns Wild Card season 2 premieres Wednesday February 5th right here on the CW well Donald Han Jr today for Boston College he is their offensive source and trying to heat it up in the second half Seth yeah and he knows what hes doing too he can score from outside but what he really excels at is getting to the cup getting into the lane using his physicality we told you about his size at 65195 and yes I am old enough to have covered that young fella in college cuz hes younger than I am which annoys me but he was a really good player and a very heady player very smart tough really good Defender great program so a couple of weeks ago Donald Han Jor won Player of the Year a player of the week rather in the ACC late December well Donald Han senior did it in 2000 wearing a Virginia uniform first time ever in the history of the conference fatherson Duo pulling in that award for the weekly Player of the Year in the ACC Davis caught it and missed it is definitely a fact of life I am 54 years young and Ive been in this profession pretty much 30 years on multiple multiple countless really examples of players of guys that I covered excuse me sons of guys that I covered when they were players right there with you parner doesnt seem right Bell its a difficult shot along the Baseline hits the side of the backboard he is just struggling struggling struggling has not made a field goal today B scored 13 points in L against Georgia Tech also made a three in that game coming off the bench for the orange yeah Adrian AR we talked earlier about moving Bell to the bench worked for the first game he had 18 points four for four from three at Florida State shot clocks at five strong trying to back it down puts the shoulder down bounces off McFarland kept it alive hand against Movic and that was off the backboard and a foul thats where you get those offensive rebounds thats why I keep calling for them theyre such a critical part of the game especially when youre not an efficient shooting team and thats just a little bit of fight and thats also not having Eddie lanin in the game the Donald now Donald H is going to the line 90 free throw shoot second in the conference lost College third in the thought I was going to jinx him but I just said say hes definitely missed no no BC third in the conference and offensive rebounding although in the first half they had just one right but its working to their advantage so far it was McFarland who did the work to get hand to the free throw line I talked about Eddie lampin you know he averages 27 minutes on the season Applause hes already played 24 so hes on the bench now getting a blow thats where you miss Donnie Freeman you know Donnie Freemans a super talented freshman very skilled midrange score hes very effective on the glass but hes another body more minutes five more fouls we dont know when hes coming back as we said Tom I think its going to be relatively soon it doesnt feel like a longterm thing the official word we got was day today Freeman right foot injury this is into the back courtman always said were all day today so Boston College basketball with their largest lead of the game right now its seven points 5144 Boston College and thats a really really nice place there by Hastings getting a deflection and getting a turnover We Men we havent seen a lot of turnovers BCs just come out with great purpose and energy here in the second half they have not attempted a threepoint shot I would I dont know if coach Grant told them specifically dont shoot threes or maybe just general instructions to get more physical and get into the paint get downhill but its working theres a three mcfl strong removed Davis from the play and might have picked up a foul a little too strong thats his third third on strong team third foul on strong I like the fight definitely the right call pretty sure its against the rules to throw somebody out of bounds in search of a rebound but I like the Chase and I like the aggressiveness and I like the passion Im seeing from Boston College right now man theyre tired of losing this is a rivalry set that takes back to 1959 a win for Boston College the Syracuse war memorial back in 1959 good year for the football team national champ Starling on the drive really nice bucket there by Starling now Im going to contradict myself as I always do because Ive been calling for him to be more aggressive but now weve lost sight of the other guys particularly Lucas Taylor who has not scored this half Taylor who had a couple of threepointers in the first half of the orange the lead is five that goes out of bounds stays with BC Syracuse led by eight in the first half that was their lead one thing I really like about JJ Starling is he can finish with both hands both sides of the rim he can get to the rim he can pull up for jumpers Kelly floater another Point another bucket in the Applause paint first basket of the game for Chaz Kelly neither team is made a three here in the second half oh I tried and that is still the status Lucas Taylor with a misfire were going inside of 9 minutes to go in regulation Taylor reaching in commits the foul against Kelly so glad that youre with us on CW Courtside Saturday Tom wory along with Seth Davis our maiden voyage and what a fantastic game so far Seth yeah its been fun and and you know were seeing a couple of teams that have know struggled of late Syracuse has been having all kinds of injury issues without Donnie Freeman today Boston College was really really bad on the offensive end in the first half but was able to hang in there defending without fouling has been huge for Boston College both teams really but especially BC and then the Syracuse offensive droughts have really hurt him so better energy and competitiveness from Boston College here in the second half lets see if they can close it out Davis picked up the foul his first for the orange and Adrien arry Chad second year following the great Jim beheim 47 years as the head coach of the orange in a National Championship in 2003 of course Adrian ay was on the bench for a lot of those and more importantly he was on the court for a few of those I think hes still fifth on the career list at Syracuse in assist sixth in Steels erl Grant has done a great job with the BC program as well they won two games at the tournament last year and they had done that made the quarters back in 2022 as well for Grant in his third year yeah its not easy here Tom they lost their entire starting lineup Quinton post went to the NBA and four guys transferred you got to rebuild its not like Boston College has the deepest nil bag in the ACC not easy cof on the explosive Drive talking to Earl Grant today he said this the first time really since the first year in his coaching career seven years at College at char that hes got basically this many new players that is the nature of the landscape in college basketball these days yeah and you know what we underestimate is how long it takes we we talk about the players getting used to playing with each other the coaches have to figure out who these guys are like theyre still figuring out like he said okay I think now we know who our three best players are so we can design our offensive quarterback I mean its mid January laid in the shot clock and a travel from Chaz Kelly was 756 to go BC has the 54 48 lead over visiting Music Applause Syracuse a where my Applause you Lou we got you just got to and Applause you guys you you Applause want look at what a Applause SE were all aware of the dangerous wildfires in California and the devastation theyre causing heres how you can help people affected by those fires please go to redcrossorg or text the word CA wildfires to 90 999 take a look at todays game stats theyre brought to you by Morgan Stanley where old school hard work meets bold new thinking 45 from the floor for the orange trailing by six limited turnovers for both teams keeping an eye on the threepoint shooting as well as that develops Josh Beetle made a three right at the horn in the first half to TI us up to 32 DC has the lead Syracuse has the ball and what did I talk about at halftime annoying everybody about the offensive rebounds second half Boston College has 10 misses five offensive rebounds thats 50 Im pretty sure lampin high percentage shot Syracuse trying to find some offense thats a good place to go Eddie lanins played a really nice basketball game today got those three fouls thats one of the big things to watch in the last seven and a half minutes Kelly cut off by the defending of Starling that pass deflected and will stay with Boston College and its interesting that you know jquan Carlos for Syracuse has not played at all in the second half he did make a three thats not what hes out there for but just kind of the offense ran pretty well with him out there but its hard to put another non shooter in the game and theyve got nothing from The Freshman today Elijah Moore as well and backing down on cuff no you didnt Roger no you didnt Roger offensive foul lets see maybe Im a little harsh on the veteran official oh is that Sauder film come on man Roger a Shan hog Kellen Miller in charge of the action this afternoon back into the left thats no whistle there cuff wow big Collision as venning came over to defend he also got his hand caught in the net on the way up as foul was called now that was a Applause collision hard to the rim and clearly a foul on Benning so they gave the foul Seth to hen okay they got him on yeah so thatll be and third gather I got you to put cuff at the free throw line thats a big one for for a Boston College Benning only has one so it would have been him with two and Han with two and now Hans got three hes got to go to the bench other than that not a whole lot of fouls Lucas Taylor has four for Syracuse and Edy lampin has three including that technical two for cuff Kelly brings it up for Boston College and now its a twopoint game certainly been my experiences in a low possession close scoring game that the game is won or lost at the foul line BC is led by as many as eight in this second half Kelly the Miss l in the rebound we still have not seen a made threepointer here in the second half lets see if I can reverse announcer Jinx I dont think anyone even wants to take one I may have to go out there and take one Davis got rid of one defense Defender and spun around the other i like the no call Elijah strong tried to draw one he said I thought that was the rule if you fall down you get a whistle 80 run by the orange and were tied nice response by Syracuse vetting Wants It Go Adam vetting over Lampkin thats okay bodyy balled around and taken by Taylor tied at 54 I like that match up cuz lanin doesnt want to get his Applause fourth 6 minutes remaining in regulation we got energy in this building partner that ice is melting under the floor Starling had it deflected by Kelly chases after it beats McFarland to the basketball shot clocks at 10 here comes a ball screen from lamp Starling trying tocate to the rim off balance shot oh Starling with the bucket for the orange and theyre up by two 10 run by Syracuse to take the lead the entry knocked Away by lampin thatll stay with BC Eddie lamin came here to play here who all those folks out there saying Eddie Lins got a motor problem Im not seeing that problem and thats what JJ Starling likes he could have pulled up for the threepoint shot and then jier Davis starting in place of the injured Donnie Freeman heck of a response here by K 10 nothing run over the last 3 minutes 16 seconds we got us a game at K Forum 5117 to go in our second half told you that the last time they played here that was January 30th of last season BC won it 80 to 75 Syracuse had won 11 in a row in the series prior to that loss earlier in January last year they had played at the Dome and a win for the orangee 69 59 where Chris Bell had 20 points well its been a rough and tumble these two are old Big East Rivals and kind of feels like thats whats been going on today especially here in the second half nobodys made a free a threepoint shot and minimal free throws and fou as well looking for a Cable News Network which respects all Americans then you have a new home with news Nation see why news nation is Americas most trusted Cable News Network to find newsnation on your screen go to newsnation nowcom the headline in the second half BC built an eightpoint lead the orange on a 100 run 18 points for JJ Starling on 9 of 18 shooting unbothered by the fact that he has not made a threepointer hes 0 for four or or a free throw or a free throw right little L eventually does have five rebounds and two assists and no turnovers shockingly few two turn I mean Syracuse in the last five games theyve averaged 18 and a half turnovers they only have five and BC only has five I keep checking to make sure thats right to be honest Syracuse is doing a great job points in the paint theyre plus eight in that that category this is going to come down to to free throws Im telling you its the frequency of getting to the line and its obviously the percentage of makes but the percentage of makes is reflected on who gets to the line so you got to get your best free throw shooters on the line here in these last 5 minutes whoever does that the better is going to win the game 12 of 16 as a team from the line for Boston College in the game theyve got possession eight on the shot clock beetle Applause beetles tie game cuff behind the line hes got the three for the orange thats a made threepoint shot everybody I almost forgot what that looks like very timely and the first made three of the second half for Syracuse four and a half minutes to go beat a lot of dribbling angling to the rim too strong venning got it back offensive for and the Finish over lampin 5958 venning and lampin are huffing and puffing out there just playing their hearts out Music man Brown on Starling Davis into the paint working on the Block lampin over the top vanning brought it to the court got that th it a walk so the orange will have the the ball when we come back Seth well weve been calling for a threepoint shot and thats what we got here off that dribble hand off again Mr cuff with the three and then venning cleaning up the offensive glass we are bruising in Boston e e e e one of the best in the country thats a heck of a weapon hand on the bench leads the way for the eagles with 16 points 14 for venning orange and cuff hes got another three hes made them both in the second half all of a sudden Kyle cuff is in the building Kyle cuff had made 7even threes All Season before this afternoon only 25 coming in venning fancy dribble cant finish off the play strong tried to follow couple of bodies on the deck and another offensive rebound so thats their seventh offensive rebound on 14 misses for Boston College thats Elite Kyle cuff you say why is he so open like I said he came in a 25 threepoint shooter not of the top of the Scouting Report hes now two for three in the game from Beyond The Arc Elijahs strong as a 69 free throw shooter the game Donald said Donald H was not going to be out of this game for long I hope hes well rested CU unless hes bleeding profusely hes not leaving two misses from strong Beetle tried to save it and did right to Davis cant miss two critical misses from the line and a fourpoint Advantage for Syracuse all about the foul line lampin better to have him catch it that far out but he is a good passer he found Starling lampin second effort got it inside to Starling hes a good passer and that worked on so many levels because the help had to leave them it opened up the driving lane for Starling and that opened up the offensive rebounding Lane for lampin Beetle pass two Defenders sof bounce and two for Beetle and lampin is second on the team and assists always a willing passer hell throw it away a couple of times but hes a good passer in there high IQ player fifth year playing college basketball lot of starts as well lamkins a graduate student out of Houston Texas three years at TCU last year at Applause Colorado shot clocked to eight Starling slows it down acceleration headge fake oh he got the angle so Savvy using that ball screen turning it down and can drive with both hands it sounds simple youd be surprised how many Elite college basketball players cant really do it likes to drive to the left and then use the right yep venning came up short lamin defending he Scoops it up he had kind of an odd angle on there couldnt quite get it off the backboard and I dont know why strong wants to wrap and commit that foul thats his fourth almost like he was trying to stop the clock see he turns down and Brown cant hang with him and he Scoops it up with that right now Eddie lampin was able to create with his first pass to Starling didnt force the action and then dumps it off bonus situation for both teams lampin 0 for two so far in the game for the free throw line 55 from the stripe on the season Eddie lampin playing in his 100 and 20th college basketball game this Applause afternoon I mean hes even made a couple of Threes this season he had never attempted a three before this year so he has really done it all for the orange and improved his play as the years gone on yeah and hes played 31 minutes today which is above his average which is what he needs to do with Donnie Freeman being out the lead is up to eight now for the orange Beetle goes behind the back that pass venning got the defender in the air with a fake and earns free throws jsh Beetle Al m al Maguire would say a little French pastry on that pass I like it coaches dont mind it if you can do it Davis picked up the foul its his third Syracuses offensive execution the last 7even eight minutes is what won them this game if theyre able to put it away well right now its a 226 run for the orange to go in front by eight one more from venning the vening machine gets the second one there no youve been waiting all game for that youve been waiting all weve been saying his name all afternoon and youre just dropping that now its the buildup its really the important part there and the setup heres Davis Starling what a day for Starling 22 points set yeah hes been again they missed him for seven games and and you can see why hes so vital to this team just the ball in his hands everything works better even though hes not a true point guard Starling shovels it off the glass JJ Starling for the orange HS him down he melted the ice under this floor I can tell you that third time this season hes gone for 20 points or more he leads everybody with 24 this afternoon I think Syracuse is getting a glimpse of what its capable of being as an offensive team when they get Freeman back figure some things out they may be on to something Freeman out today with the foot injury Starling who missed seven games of the left hand injury lets take a look at todays key Play Its brought to you by Hilton Garden in Hilton for the stay well you got to think the game before you can execute the game and this is a great example of a high IQ veteran basketball player hes got three white jerseys around him instead of forcing the action he dumps it off to J J Starling and by the way he cant make that play unless he goes and gets the offensive rebound which he created with his pass so Eddie Lampkin you get an A for your game today Split Second decision making because he looked out on the perimeter first set right looking for the threepoint shooter it wasnt there and he found Starling with a little bit of open space well like we said its his fifth year in college basketball hes got a lot of reps a lot of games under his belt and you talk about you know thinking fast but what they also say about veteran players when youre in the flow the game slows down so it looks fast to us but to him its not so fast because hes been there so many times before and this is now a 24 to9 run from Syracuse here over the last 7 minutes and 49 seconds so hand has 18 points hes the leading scorer for the Eagles Eddie Lin by the way just a bucket away from a double double also has three assists rebounds Syracuse also done a really nice job on the defensive end as well final minute Taylor strong fou him Austin 31 Elijah remember at the 851 Mark in the second half BC was up by eight lets take a look at todays player of the game brought to you by Progressive Insurance save when you bundle Auto home and motorcycle insurance visit progressivecom yeah pretty easy Choice here JJ Starling hes got 24 points and yet he did not make a threepoint shot and he did not make a free throw five rebounds three assists and maybe the best number on his Z sheet stat sheet is the bagel in the turnover column for Syracuse only five turnovers for the game and remember theyd been averaging 18 turnovers per game in their last five which includes a home win against Georgia Tech on Tuesday dont forget game two wake at Miami CW court side Saturday will continue hand trying to rush it up the court that spins off venning bumped and scores 418 on the game clock its only two possession game theyre going to need some help from Syracuse missing free throws that they put him on the line he got a foul orange skillfully breaking the pressure in the back court and then lampin gets fouled yeah I dont mind the strategy I like the strategy in this situ you know you got 34 seconds on the clock play a little defense try to get a steal be aggressive and then once they get into the front Court you can Comm commit a foul you got plenty of time whats more important is putting a 55 free throw shooter on the line that kind of day for Earl Grant who watched an eightpoint lead evaporate quickly in the second Applause half Getty lampin knows they fouled him on purpose that was big cuz now its three Applause possessions still time to pull this off its just hard to do without the three you know at the end of the day I mean Boston College didnt hit a threepoint shot in the second half Syracuse only hit two Beetle hangs and scores lamin now with a double double after those free throws as well Joshua so Beetle committed the foul lamin has backto back doubles in the last double doubles in the last two games against Georgia Tech and Boston College and now five double doubles this season for Eddie lamin Syracuse right around 49 from the floor from the game thats high efficiency for them for a team thats 17th in the ACC and offensive efficiency its got to feel good Syracuse basically right on their average for points per game 12th in the ACC 757 thatll be Point number 75 as it falls for Taylor got nothing from Chris Bell and nothing from Elijah Moore and Freeman is out so you can see a little bit of of room between this Syracuse team and their ceiling theyre obviously going to be playing a little bit tougher competition as the conference schedule unfolds looks like coach ay has called a timeout for the orange 206 left on the clock and so Syracuse if they can hang on theyll move to two and three in conference play and even their record at 88 their next game will be at home against Louisville which has been impressive so far this season its a 700 start on Tuesday day Notre a Clemson Pittsburgh and Stanford lie ahead for the orange yeah you know you got to take it one game at a how about Louisville today winning at Pittsburgh by the way super impressive and whats coming up next for uh Boston College theres not a ton of quad one opportunities in the ACC so when you have a chance you got to you got to take advantage there might be a few people at that game January 18th you know Maine that state of Maine is just CL yeah Im not good at not good at math GE Im not good at geography but I understand that we are in the vicinity of M is there somebody from the state of Maine playing college basketball young man named Cooper flag is impressive as a freshman he I think he has the flu or something cuz he only had 42 today he must be maybe a hang nail in his shooting hand 42 points yeah Mike Lee is the sports information director for Boston College and he says the place will be bused at the seams for that game hes credential to couple of bears and some elk for that game for Maine as well that was Mikes line I cant take credit for that the issue here is that as Mike does such a great job as do all of the sports information folks and support staff at every school in the ACC BCC will BC rather will drop to 9 and six 9 and seven now with the loss and one and four in conference play they had been six and three on their home floor for Coach Grant and one and one at home home against ACC opponents I will say I always used to come to Boston College enjoy coming to Boston College cover games had the best New England clam chatter in The Press Room its not a thing anymore so if anybody can make that happen and be grateful a late bucket they try to tie up Starling on the Baseline and commit a foul and so with 10 seconds even Starling is going to stride to the free throw line Li Two Shots coming up for Starling at the line shooting two shots the so the orange and by the way Seth this will be their first official Road victory of the season thats a first win away from home one Tuesday at home against Georgia Tech yeah they dont even have any uh neutral Court wins has not been an easy season for Applause Syracuse some tough losses and lost a lot of transfers first free close of the game for Starling we talking about no threepointers no free throws finally went to the line final seconds from Connie Forum Davis pulls it in and the orange will head back to the Dome with a 79 71 win against the BC Eagles
