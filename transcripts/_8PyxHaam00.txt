tainment down to the wire when Clemson and Virginia Tech take the floor in mens basketball tonight promises to have no shortage of the attrick an important early conference game here at a soldout Castle Coliseum good evening for blackburg Kevin Brown and Debbie Antonelli these teams have played in tight games down to the wire year after year and this is incredibly important because the loser of this game drops three in a row yeah this is a quad one opportunity for both and they desperately need that on their resume right now now so this games important Virginia Tech hasnt lost at home all season and the number 21 team in the country doesnt want to go one and three in the ACC and for Clemson its easy you lean on PJ Hall you just saw hes part of the top 25 wooden award list in the midseason rankings only behind RJ Davidson scoring in the ACC PJ Hall is an AllAmerican candidate an ACC Player of the Year candidate and he needs to have a big game Brad Brownell can move him all over the floor he can have impact on the offensive end in multiple levels of their offense and Lyn Kidd one of the most improved players in the ACC look at his numbers from his freshman year at Clemson into the portal and hes leading the league in field goal percentage he can score left and right around the bucket and hes long and athletic on the defensive end two players that came in the same class at Clemson PJ Hall singing Enter Sandman to himself at the center circle ready for the tip he seems fired up for this game he wins the tip dramatically knocking it back to Clemsons Chase Hunter 11 and three this Clemson team a gauntlet of an on conference schedule they survived but theyve dropped two in a row to Miami and UNC and they will start with the ball in blackburg here is Hunter the fifth year guard mantoman defense and one of the matchups to keep your eye on are the two best threepoint Shooters in the league and Hunter Couture and Joe Gerard thatll be a matchup to keep your eye on theyre guarding each other first basket is Ian cheffins another one of the most improved players in the league averaging nine and 10 as he worms inside Robbie Baron who along with MJ Collins is back in that starting five of Virginia Tech the Main Stays kador padulla and kid its Collins hanging and missing the first shot chony Wiggins cleans it up for Clemson one of the things that most teams try to do is take advantage of Joe Gerard on the defensive end they try to run offense at him and make him move his feet in defend starting five for Clemson a very experienced back court Gerard and Hunter Wiggins hall and then shefin whos got the first two buckets the 68 junr from Loganville Georgia no surprise to see Clemson start their offense From the Inside Out theyve got to build it on the interior theyve got the size and the length on the front line as an advantage to start the game padulla bangs in a three coming off a career high tying 26 padulla and Couture both big time shooters will need to be that for Virginia Tech tonight here is Hall being guarded by Kid Chase Hunter a pull up and Clemson starts three for three on the road yeah I think Chase Hunter is one of the reasons why Clemson is playing so well and needs to play big on the road your guards can dictate on the road how you run the tempo of your team and manage your team and hes done a good job of that all season so far Virginia Tech the eighth best offensive team in the ACC by adjusted a efficiency they get it inside to kid he scores over his former teammate keep an eye on that matchup as well Clemson elects to to play straight up on the interior not bring a double its Clemson team the fourth best offense in the ACC very good shooting team third best field goal percentage third best team from three as PJ Hall misses a three the first Miss shot of the game for the Tigers and padulla brings it up the Flor for the Hokies Shawn padulla The Crossing hunter lost it on the way up kid is there to retrieve it and Lyn kid who scored just two points Saturday in Tallahassee has four in the last two possessions yeah season low for him he has been a an excellent consistent scorer for them all season long try to get it into shefin again whos got two early baskets Junior backing down Baron the Northwestern transfer shefflin gets to the right hand too strong off the glass and baron sealed him for the Music board its a Virginia Tech team that lost 7774 Saturday at Florida State they got a big performance from this young man though padulla and the hokes after missing their first shot of hit four straight after a slow start handling the ball for Virginia Tech against Florida State he came on late and made some shots and hes very good at inverting to the block thats a big part of the offense for him he will score on a clear out that way off the shot fake hunter lost the dribble with padulla on him six to shoot for the Syracuse transfer Joe Gerard big threepoint shooter weaves into the lane finds an open shefan and he buries it from Deep we talked about ly Kidd being one of the most improved players in the league sheins on that list as well he is a 57 threepoint shooter thats his ninth triple of the Season that matches Clemsons total in the game Saturday against North Carolina they were 1 for 18 that one left short by padulla nobody really chased it for Clemson so Baron has the offensive rebound and then Baron is rewarded I love a clean game and thats what we got so far both teams making shots both teams getting into their offense multiple players scoring for both clubs thats the first turnover of the game after combined nine for 13 start Virginia Tech second week of January but it is never too early to set the stakes and for Virginia Tech the stakes are high theyre not in the first four out theyre not in the next four out theyre considered right now by jul lardy that means they need a few more wins to get into serious bracket consideration Clemson a five seed the big difference last year did between Clemson uh their nonconference schedule very weak last season they missed the tournament despite 23 wins and even with a one and two start theyre in very good shape right now early in January I mean the greatest snub of the tournament was going 14 six in the league and not getting in Robbie Baron with a basket Virginia Tech is 6 for eight Clemson four for six it has been a breathtaking Offensive start Mike Young on an atto dialing it up over there that was a beautifully executed Play heres chony Wiggins 611 sophomore gets it in the hall who is yet to score That Remains the case but chin grabs it blocked by kit from behind a rare blocked shot for Virginia Tech which runs the floor with padulla and he drains a three his second of the game was sea padulla needed a great start and before the game I talked to him I thought he was set for a big game and he said I need one he was locked in early he has scored or assisted on five of Virginia Tech seven made baskets and another good rebound hes fouled by shipin Robbie Baron back in the starting lineup today has given good minutes for Virginia Tech Virginia Tech is a team blocks three shots a game right here they do a great job at Lin kid getting out on the break when you block shots into your transition game you get shots like this its hard to match up when youre playing downhill off a block shot and thats exactly what what Virginia Tech was able to do you did ask ly kid before the game do they want you to be a shot blocker and now we know the answer well hes 610 hes long and athletic around the rim I dont think coach young wants him to be take a risky uh get in foul trouble Migel potit is in the game along with maai long for the first time for Tech was on a 143 run heres Collins two long on a three and that ball out of bounds off of long our officials today by the way Ted Valentine Tim clockery and Tommy Mor there is the aention Mike young fantastic coach at his fifth year at Virginia Tech couple of NCAA tournaments to start the hokes last year did not make it 19 and 15 8 and 12 in the league thats Dylan Hunter Off the Bench for a three the younger brother of Chase hits this seven three of the year I mean when both these teams move the ball go from good to Great from their shot selection theyre really tough to beat this another three mikai long who has not hit one this season offensive rebound for potit a hard hit on the floor thats the first foul against PJ Hall who has gotten himself fouled out of the last two Music games the line so free throws coming for for the senior potit rights transfer potit with that power game that weak side rebound here 15 and Clemson for Brad brand is at the most wins ever at Clemson by 75 little bit of pressure to get back to the NCAA tournament hes made it three times a lot of folks thought he should have been there last year this a Clemson team that then again looks very well positioned to return as we just showed you a five seed right now in the projected bracket well their depth has been a little bit affected with out Alex hemway whos still out with injury Jack Clark still out with injury certainly has affected the rotations but theyve had time to adjust the hunter Brothers Chase and Dylan both on the floor right now BOS light is in the game giving Hall to breather that ball knocked out of bounds 11 to shoot for Clemson which also has RJ Godfrey on the floor theyll go nine deep but Josh Beetle and light to dont play much so its really a coar sevenman rotation right now with the injuries for Clemson Gerard for to shoot its going to have to be Joe Gerard he didnt realize it and he got it up just in time but missed it Hunter Couture is known as a threepoint shooter but any coach in the league will tell you hes one of their lock down Defenders hasnt taken a shot yet tonight and he will not there as he turns it over Virginia Tech a much better team defensively this year they were 139th in the country in adjusted efficiency last year theyre up to 64th problem is their offense has taking a little bit of a dip well you know I think theyve turned the ball over more than what Mike Youngs teams are typically do and certainly in the losses theyve suffered theyve turned the ball over more than theyve had assists and thats not a number that he Hunter cant connect Clemsons got a little cold its a threelevel defense Kevin you know its ball pressure its the ability to rotate and then that Rim protection is one of the things that they are working on and thats where Lin kid can come in and definitely make a difference back to poti on the gr transfer Lea and poti cannot spiral it in Clemson just two for nine since a three for three start Hunter with a good find thats RJ Godfrey the sophomore seven point per game scorer Off the Bench I mean the acceleration off the cuts and the movement without the ball creates so much space and opportunity thats a great jump dump down passon 33 Tyler niichel commits his first foul Off the Bench edger nickel is fouled by BOS Lia a fourpoint lead for the hokes here in blackburg Kevin when you turn a corner like this you its just bottle of water things have changed this season for Mike nothing water and hes looking good hes dropped about oh I dont know he probably doesnt want us to know tell everybody how much weight hes lost but hes lost a lot of weight and hes working out and hes taking care of himself and hes gearing up for the postseason heres a three missed in the corner by Brandon rexin of the rebound down to Clemson unusual not to see coach young with the popcorn before the game we probably will have to get some before its over because I think everybody sitting to our right and left has popcorn right now and it was great that was his thing and hes not doing it anymore and its pretty cool nice little water Koozie as well make sure you dont get the hands too cold while coaching dont sweat the details you know the one thing about Mike young that I respect and appreciate so much because hes such a great teacher is he has incredible play recall he can tell you what happened in a game with his Hoke three years ago and the second half of a mid January game he can recall plays like that its phenomenal I dont know anyone else that can do that thats like Tiger Woods remembering every one of his golf shots you didnt have that ability as a player uh not that kind of recalls do you recall specific broadcasts only when Legends like you Kevin W there you go so you recalled all of our previous broadcast is what we saying all zero heres nickel and Virginia Tech which had been cold from three gets a triple from nickel the North Carolina transfer foul by the way was the second against BOS lighted PJ Hall has returned for Clemson which was leading early but finds itself down seven I mean Tyler nichel the transfer from North Carolina sets his feet off the screen immediately into his jump shot its a beautiful look jump shot and you know uh I mean hes like one of the great alltime scorers in the history of Virginia hes the alltime leading scorer and its its a quite a list a laundry list whos who of great Virginia High School players Lonzo Moses Malone Allen Iverson among them JJ reck Grant hell on there as well M mclung was second and thats the company that Tyler nichel keeps theres a three for Chase Hunter the red shirt senior just a 30 threepoint shooter for Clemson drills it tigers Three for five from deep hokeys are four for eight The Freshman Rex Steiner leans in and pubs home a basket Rex Steiner didnt play in the last game against Florida State hall for three and there the first bucket of the game for PJ Hall nearly halfway through the first you know Kevin Four last six games PJ has taken more threes than free throws and I asked Brad Brad Brownell about it today hes not worried about it its just the versatility of PJs Game and his ability to pull away from the bucket pull bigs away open up driving Lanes theres a lot that can happen thats good for Clemson when he sticks triples 35 from out there Hall heres kid missed the midrange shot its cleaned up by Applause long Music Virginia Tech shooting at 59 from the field early on and the hokes with a lead at home building where they have not lost this season but their best win probably Vermont this is a big step up at competition as Halls Miss three is back tapped and collected by Dylan Hunter off the tap by Chase Hunter shot clock did not reset so Ted Valentin stops playing actually it did and it shot clock re they did correct them but the timing wouldnt be exactly right I think Ted Valentine wants to make sure they put oh hes calling it a change of possession they reset the whole shot clock I thought that was an offensive rebound which would have been 20 but the ball did go all the way into the back court so it is deemed The Possession change instead of 18 its a nearly full 28 shoot to cson Im not sure its The Possession change I think its that the ball went into the back court Kevin its a lot of time for Gerard to work with he has not scored yet in the game Clemsons second leading Music score look at the ball pressure by Virginia Tech nickel off the steel nichel flushes n how was that practice yesterday for Virginia Tech and these guys started up off the practice with a wallup drill and then a hustle drill when you start practice like that and you got everybody locked in I he was impressive the amount of intensity that Mike Youngs team brought to practice yesterday Pou hits the deck and still active hands coutur is on the floor thats the kind of plays Im talking aboutus sets up nickel he drills it Tyler nickel with a spark Off the Bench eight points on three shots and the largest hokey lead North Carolina off to an impressive start hosting Syracuse Kentucky at Texas AM struggling agies team coached by former hokes headman Buzz Williams then Arkansas Florida starting our day off with a triple header beginning at noon Eastern on ESPN CL had a tough one last night it was like a twopoint game with four minutes to go and and Bruce Pearls Auburn team can flat out fill it up AM a team that a lot of folks thought was a top two team the SEC 96 0 and2 in the league right now the largest lead for Virginia Tech and Chase Hunter will try to cut into that at the line unusual game right now Joe Gerard has not scored PJ Hall only has three on the other side for Virginia Tech Hunter Couture there second leading score hasnt even taken a shot but the hokes other guys have done more than the Tigers you know when you watch Hunter Im not sure theres anybody that accelerates on off exit Cuts him scoring Cuts better than he does but if you want time of possession in this first half so far I dont think hes had many touches Clemson has done a really good job on him Chase Hunter double figure score 10 of 14 games this season is up to seven points early snaps a seven nothing hokey Music run trying to get Couture a touch right now and he is being absolutely locked up with Wiggins and hes got a 5c call Tim clockery as Couture asks him how about a foul there Wing to Wi I mean watch this right here this is what Im talking about like this is a foul he is locked up Hunter Couture and he is not letting him move hes displacing his cut and Hunter Couture turns around to Tim clocker says hey man check me out over here was already 8 in shorter than his Defender Wiggins getting manhandled as well but it ended up as a Virginia Tech turnover Hall steps out Strokes his second three and Clemson after a 1 for 18 threepoint effort on Saturday is 5 for eight 611 baring triples for the Tigers Tula Baron wraps it around to Couture couple of extra passes padulla from nichel and there a late whistle and a foul as padulla got crunched in front of the Clemson bench PJ Hall is over there and thats the second foul on Hall see now this is not a smart play by PJ hes late on the threepoint shooter and hes out of control off balance and he doesnt give padulla time or space to really come down thats two fouls on on PJ thats one he can he has to avoid you know we talked to Brad Brownell about the two foul rule with PJ today right y because hes fouled out of the last two games and RJ Godfrey will replace him now so this is perhaps a line of demarcation think its 3025 when Hall commits the foul well see if he returns in the first half hes got a couple of Threes but only six Gerard their second leading score with nothing and who is going to answer the Bell here for Clemson after the free throws by pullan I think Gerards got to keep working foul away for the ball thats the third against Virginia Tech Virginia 31 Robbie bar Robbie Baron picks up his second and baron will take a seat four long Kai long replaces him Baron with two two of the Hokies three fouls and theres an offensive Applause foul I mean RJ Godfrey just runs over sha padulla and Coach brownells looking at RJ going what are you doing but his dad was an NFL linebacker his brothers a a linebacker yeah brother Grant of Kentucky how do you think they would have liked that form would have say maybe a little high on the tackle kid spinning got to the right hand beautifully yeah he put up a lot of extra shots today did ly kid before practice working on his post moves his counters being able to go over left hand right shoulder Hunter had a Godfree open for a moment didnt see him flashing Gerard still has not really impacted this game hunter Gerard set him up Hunter missed the three shefflin Taps it to maai Long another big moment on the run out for poule his floater is off the rim well Clemson cant get anything in transition either I mean Virginia Techs doing a good job loading up Gerard leans into Couture and hell get a twoshot foul out of it to the dismay of the fans in Chicago maroon and Bern Arch is this two or a three I think two Tommy Mars he signaling Music two thats offense initiated contact I wouldnt like that one if I were Mike young either they just showed it on the video board either nobody in here likes it so Couture picks it up man its its not a cylinder violation if somebody leans into you no s thats thats right wasnt reviewed either it looked like it might have been a three and now Ted Valentines going to stop play and bring the officials together I think theyre making sure was it a two or a three right they didnt youre right they didnt review Music it yeah its a three well thats what we thought yeah and the officials are now reviewing it interestingly reviewing it after the two scheduled free throws were taken so Joe Gerard whos 40 of 44 from the free throw line should get one more he gives a chance to talk about Joe Gerard for a second I mean hes down more than 12 pounds is conditioning at a peak right now and thats clearly a three so there should be one more free throw Music coming you saw him for four years at Syracuse whats impressed you most about his adaptation to Clemson I think his ability to guard in the scheming defensively that Brad Brownell demands I mean its not an easy defensive system its not just stay between your man and the ball you know you got to be able to understand under overhead strap by switch and all the different variations of ball screen coverage including drop which is eight eight different ball screen coverages you have to understand in Brad rown now system I think hes done a really good job I asked him about it today he said thats part of the reason why he wanted to come to Clemson as he knew that Brad Brown now was a defensive oriented coach and playing Man versus The Zone that he lived in with Jim beheim is a a much different in some ways defensive look you could argue you know that the 32 to is manto man in your area but theres a lot of different principles about manto man defense versus Zone lead back down to seven after Gerard hits all three heres Couture hasnt impacted the game much offensively but he sets up nickel Coutures got his first assist and Tyler niichel has 11 points on four shots Ill tell you what Wiggins has done a good job on Couture because hes locking Trail off that pin down action and thats a lot of length on that curl for Hunter Gerard bounce feed for Godfrey into the body of long and RJ Godfrey finishes at The Rim tough I mean the muscle on the front line of shefflin and Godfrey is tough right now Clemson is not going to be out biged by many teams this year nickel his first Miss Hunter does not have numbers Mouse in the house the 611 Wiggins over the 61 B thats why you push in transition so you can immediately get the mismatch Clemson recognized it right away they played good D rebounded and they sprinted the floor you force those matchups when you sprint long had nickel open for three to his right takes it in inste tries to tap in his own Miss and can Clemson five for its last seven from the field Gerards been calling for the whole way instead Wiggins line drives out of three and kids got the rebound see this is where you miss PJ Hall in that trail position to be able to shoot the three pulla wraps it around nickel another good look his fourth three of the first half go ahead Tyler nickel and shoot till your arm falls off and when sha padulla thinks pass first and moves the ball this is a very dangerous Virginia Tech offense Tyler nichel has tied a season high in about 10 minutes off the bench hes two away from his career hive by the way and his team has it again as long at it strip Gerards on the deck bodys all over and a foul will be called against McKai long diving over the top of RJ Godfrey but more great hustle on both sides for Virginia Tech the in control in the first half at home an official timeout go first half I mean that is a tough kid right there Hunter Couture scary moment MJ Collins is back on the floor for Tech PJ Hall is in the game right now with two fouls for Clemson they bring the double pullup shot is drilled chony Wiggins with a couple of good looking shots here the 611 sophomore from Grayson and Clemsons back within seven without Couture on the floor defensively for Virginia Tech this could open some things up for Joe Gerard okus best perimeter Defender we imagine will not return for the first half Pula jacks up a deep one wow wow I mean thats a heat check for sure cuz thats one of those shots where youre Mike young going no and then yes and 8 for 13 start from Deep for Virginia Tech matching its largest lead at 10 Gerard no Couture in the game d but he got free I mean you know Joe Gerard was waiting for an opportunity and when youre a shooter and you got somebody that is in your grill the whole game and they step aside the next time down the floor youre looking for some space see if MJ Collins closes them off a little more next time pulla goes around Hall had to play a little carefully with the two fouls Im going to tell you right now this is one of the best first halfs of basketball sha padulla has played time out Clemson will be back in Music 30 so correction the timeout was taken by Virginia Tech they use it or lose it time out hoki leading by nine and Shawn padulla with a first half 16 I mean the number you look at with padulla is assist turnover ratio hes had 10 turnovers in the last two games combined he only has one right now but he is effective shooting it inverting to the block and then playing off the bounce when hes got a straight line drive he has to be careful though not to over penetrate Hunter padulla went for the shot fake there Hunter left it short and off the maai long rebound here is Pulu sprained his foot against Louisville its been a lot healthier the last couple of games Nicholl gets the shooters bounce and and ties a career high with 16 in the first half I mean he reads the D perfectly coming off that pin down he curls into the lane he reads the second level nice floater nckl and peduli each with 16 Virginia Tech nearly with a half a 100 in the first half and theyre about to get a 100 long will take it and long is undercut dangerously after the assist by padulla long got undercut by Chase Hunter and went crashing to the floor good to see him up on his feet but doua would like a review and youd imagine there will be there given the severity of that Music fall I dont think Hunter undercut him I think he tried to hang on to the rim he just lost his just he just slipped his hands looked like they slipped off the rim thats a hard fall thankfully he got back up and the officials will take a look but didnt seem like there was anything from Hunter there KY long will take a seat theyve gotten some good minutes from him though the Old Dominion transfer and they were looking for some more out of M long talked to Mike young before the game said who needs to be good today he mentioned long he mentioned Tyler niichel Robbie Baron MJ Collins theyve gotten really positive contributions from all those players outside of the big three of padulla Couture kid I mean I think the officials are over there taking a look at it but I dont think theyre going to come away with anything you know hes an Airborne shooter there is an Airborne shooter rule there is a safety Factor here but I dont think Chase Hunter Music really clipped Music him Music Tommy morrisy will give us an Music explanation so the word we got was purely his momentum there long momentum so no flagrant foul hey tonight1 Eastern ESPN the second game of our NBA double header Nicole yic and the Nuggets taking on the Jazz in Utah NBA Wednesday presented by State Farm ESPN is streaming live on the ESPN app Virginia Tech 10 assists on 19 makes only four turnovers in the largest lead of 13 two teams that are trying to snap two game losing streaks Hall is back off the floor right now for Clemson by the way with two fouls Godfrey with a strong drive and score I mean ball reversal twice they get three sides of the floor and I know Brad Brown now has a package with Joe Gerard on the top of the floor running the point and theyre going to that right now Clemsons shooting at 5250 100 right now field goals threes free throws but they havent been able to defend and they get a steal here final minute of the half theyll work it inside to sheelin who had seven points early and gets his eighth and Ninth there off turnovers or off rebounds Padulas not going to crash the glass hes getting back but hes getting caught on a big in transition and Clemson is recognizing it very quickly pullas in a spectacular first half it continues a mistake by Chase Hunter you know he leans into the screen and padulla rejects the screen its a great play by Shawn Hunter got caught in the air nichel tries to throw it off Wiggins threw it to Wiggins and Wiggins hits a three at the buzzer a bizarre end of the half for Virginia Tech as nickel tried to throw it off the body of Wiggins he bounced it inbounds and Clemson hits at 73 and a half to cut the lead to n its a great Hustle by nickel and a good try but right here to have the presence of time and score thats good a much needed three brilliant shooting half for both teams Clemson 55 Virginia Tech 65 the hokes up by nine as we check in with the studio Virginia Tech and taking advantage of transition got to take something away Kevin career high tying 16 right now padulla with 19 but that bottom note you saw Hunter Couture weve been told is out for the rest of the game Couture was kicked in the head by RJ Godfrey with about 3 and A2 minutes to go in the first half so Virginia Tech will not be with with its second leading scorer for the season here in this second half Lyn kid starts the half by being walled up by PJ Hall excellent job by PJ to wall up and not foul a good job to try to attack him to put a third on him Clemson a little smaller to start the half theyve got Dylan Hunter out there instead of chony Wiggins older brother Chase threw it away off of kid to padulla and the hokes with their fourth steal padulla behind the back for kid a little overly fancy and thats a better behind the back Hunter back from Hunter a little bit of a bobble and Clemson will settle with shefin Hall the trailer Miss to three Robbie Barons got the rebound I I mean you usually dont see a behind the back pass we saw three in a row some of which were successful Sil Nichols starts the half and why not for Virginia Tech that ball Stripped by Hunter another Clemson steel and this time Dylan Hunter will finish his second basket thats exactly what Clemson needs is to generate extra possessions right here with their defense whats the thinking you imagine behind Hunter starting the second half over Wiggins smaller quicker better defensive lineup so far so good especially with coutur off the floor hoki shot at at 65 9 for 14 from three one of their best offensive Hales under Mike young Nicholl trying to lean in thats a tough shot Baron touched it and he touched it and threw it off of Hunter so 13 to shoot for Virginia Tech one of the few contested shots that Virginia Tech has taken Clemsons locking in on D right here this is the DNA of a brad Brown L team and theyre inverting on the out of bounds play right here see Gerard is on nickel you see theyre trying to give some help right here in a corner Baron gets a great look and misses a three that would have really made Brad brells face turn a different shade Joe Gerard a quiet first half only six points made one field goal inside the hall sheflin grabs the short shot and sheflin with nine in that first half to lead Clemson Gerard guarded by Collins leans in couldnt get the contact over the basket its cleaned up by Hall and Clemson is back within five now PJ only played 12 minutes in the first half with those two fouls he should be good for 18 minutes here in the second Hunter again has really caused Havoc defensively in the first two and a half minutes of this half padulla got it back and padulla trains another three hes five for six he is just hot he had 26 in the last game against Florida State thats his season high and career high that career high May last for all of four days at this rate in Jeopardy thats for sure another shot fake by Hunter hell Bank it in and the elder brother of the two Chase Hunter the red shirt seniors got nine well the Virginia Tech bench had 23 points you could credit Tyler nichel for coming off the bench in the first half giving 16 of those but hes in the lineup here to start the second half as well Mulla again only his second threepoint Miss Clemson can make this a one possession game with a three game they Trail by nine coming out of the break Hall got kid in the a drives it into Lin kid draws the first foul against Lin kid watch PJ Hall working hard on the glass right here I mean this is extra effort and understanding where he is uses the rim to protect against the shot blocker and then quickly a little little drag screen enough Music separation and that set right there that PJ Hall drew a foulon Mike young and his staff went over and over and over in practice today with Lyn Kidd on how to hedge and recover kid gets an early breather along with Barett long and Poe Off the Bench for the hokes hunter catch and shoot that was blocked by long right to sheelin who spins and stuffs around padulla and its a fourpoint game you can see sheins motorist picking up right here the energy level for Clemson out of the locker room has been really good on the defensive end and a fumble there the pass from Collins to Nickel mishandled another tech turnover me watch shiin right here he rolls hard to the rim he knows the shot is short hes got padulla on them high percentage finish at The Rim PJ Hall gets a breather right before the under 16 BOS Lio will see the floor at least for a few seconds Gerard trying to get free dropped off by shefflin and Gerard lost control nichel Tekken transition Clemson got back well and padulla was slow to return so Virginia Tech out a four on five and then BOS Lia commits his third foul good start to the half for Clemson 83 spurt to get within four managers are the backbone of every College basketball program every coach points to the effort the hustle the extra time that those young men spend and women spend around helping the college basketball product be the best it can be hey just like when Clemson Virginia Tech teams take the floor as po te slams even the manager games are close even those ones go down to the wire and appreciate you give it a shout out to as you know some of the hardest working people in any program a lot of whom go on to be coaches and involved in the game in other ways as well thats right op the Miss layup by Josh Beetle heres Virginia Tech running Virginia Tech managers were already telling me when they go to NC State they think there should be a line on the game poti breaks it strong rebound shefin PJ Hall still getting a little bit of an early breather he is standing on the Clemson bench Gerard worms around padulla and and padulla sticks with him picks up the steel Virginia TCH p padulla with 22 for shy of career high Nicholls got 16 to tie career high maai long all kinds of trouble and knocked out of bounds 15 to shoot for the hokes and PJ Hall will check back in along with Chase Hunter along with RJ Godfrey and a line change for Brad Brownell a good use of the media timeout to give PJ a little break before the timeout and now a couple of possessions into the next media Music break pulla thats a tough shot rare Miss for him grabbed by Beetle its its a rare Miss but I think they can get a better shot y all three for eight in the game a second leading score in the ACC down on the Block looking for that Hunter Miss Paul tried to grab it maai long was a little Applause stronger padulla again he has come crashing back to Earth these last few possessions Saturday both these teams were in Action a basketball triple header on the ACC Network Clemson hosting Boston College at three Eastern Virginia Tech against Miami wuka popper back for the the Hurricanes tonight and

after being kicked in the head of the first half for Tech thats a travel against po Virginia Tech over for its last four couple of turnovers here in the half little bit of a slower start for Mike Youngs team really trying to attack PJ Hall on the defensive end right I mean youre trying to get that third foul on him L kid replaces Po and Jon Young The Freshman checks in for the first time for the hokes there he is at a goldboro North Carolina replacing Music nichel two Hunters Beetle Wiggins and Hall they five for Clemson Hall screens for Beetle down the lane Josh Beetle lefthanded and the red shirt sophomore a threepoint Point per game scorer puts in his first two Beetle on the floor for defense so scoring is a bonus right now Fula over dribbling it there and Hunter touched it while he was over the line beetle on the floor whos did a really good job on Tyler nickel does a terrific job of attacking the rim and scoring look at the hang time only played five minutes combined the last two games Josh Beetle hes played eight good minutes defensively tonight Okies have not scored the last 244 get it into to kid Collins has H switched onto him kids got Wiggins whos a lot more slender pads got a three his sixth and hes one shy of a career high with 25 no shot conscious at all for sha pad he is moving on to the next play and you like a confident shooter like that Beetle again into traffic picked up by padulla pooki so lethal in transition its Music Applause long this time long held on to the rim Hall quiets the castle as third three boy did they need that PJ Hall three for six outside the threepoint line padulla left handed he scores it a new career high for sha padulla 20 27 points and the distinct possibility of a 28th when we return Shan padulla watch him reject this hit this triple right here and then reject the N for 14 overall hes been to the free throw line hes got seven assists three steals hes going back to the free throw line right here he manages the offense he had 26 on Saturday 27 right now with a chance to add to that at the line know the four games before Florida State the last four before Saturday he had 24 points total he was 6 for 28 shooting a sprain foot had been lingering HT it against Louisville hurt it in practice so he has 24 points in a Four game stretch he has 26 points hits nine shots on Saturday and hes got 28 hes hit nine more today they need every inch of it with Hunter Couture out for the rest of this game after being kicked in the head Virginia Tech which has led for more than 25 minutes up by nine Joe Gerard back on the floor hes only hit one threepointer and only one field goal tonight he hasnt had a lot of clean looks theyve done a really good job on him and in that Series right there PJ Hall slipped every screen I think the next time down lets look for him to to pop Hall guarding kid whos trying to hand it off for Collins Collins drives it Gerard was all there PJ Hall spinning around gets rid of it to Hunter not a lot of easy baskets in transition for Clemson tonight Paul once again a trailing three and padulla snatches away the Music rebound young man from Edmund Oklahoma who has made his mark on this program more than a few miles away in blackburg Virginia spinning around on Hunter maintains that dribble so well and he finds kid inside long missed Music him heres Beetle Wiggins three is good Clemsons ninth three of the game and a couple there for Wiggins when you push and you run hard you flatten out the defense on the top of the floor you take everybody to the ball everyone goes to the level of the ball and the top of the floor is open thats why the last two possessions the trail big has had a good look from three Mulla back for kid Beetle gave him Simon away for a second there and kid missed a pretty good look has two shots at the rim back to back Virginia Tech Miss layups Hunter ball slipping off the screen Hunter takes it strong at The Rim the follow is there by Wiggins I like the note call wall up at The Rim good Follow by Clemson Chon Wiggins who was two for seven five points Saturday has a dozen and a little surge here for Clemson five straight back down to within four Gerard idoua kid inside long this time they dont miss hit the rim when youre guarding sha badulla right now youre in no help so you are keeping him from trying to catch once he gives it up thats exactly what Gerard was doing so there was no help there on that curled of the rim and but Kai long with eight points hes the third hokey to hit a season high in points Music tonight Gerard working around Collins extra pass Wiggins for Beetle bounce inside its Gerard well Joe playing a big post game at 62 every time Clemson goes side to side gets multiple sides they get a good Music look Mulls got Beetle on him this time Clemson switching the looks feed it inside to kid back out for Collins mean good dig by Chase Hunter and then recover out to the shooter Clemson can make this a onep possession game they are down 11 at the half and that three is Breck by Hunter and Wiggins couldnt get to it jayen young cleans up the rebound for Tech each team with three players ready to check in which will be at the under eight and thats an offensive foul drawn by Hall against his old teammate kid PJ Hall is still down he may have been hit in an uncomfortable area and he is going to be helped to his feet Clemson back within four PJ Hall you make the call other choice PJs pajamas so question is where does PJ Hall slot in in the PJ power rankings in the last 740 made determine that well you know what I text PJ carisimo and told him that we were doing this and he cant believe pajamas beat him he wanted to be number one I mean PJ carlesimo great I no disrespect but is anything better than a soft pair of pajamas very creative where would you put PJ Hall in those rankings is the question oh you got to put him in number one on this show all right hes taking a scene on the bench right now hes going to rest up and probably when he checks in he will be in for the rest of this game the lead is four for Virginia Tech which has led nearly the whole game Shan padulla in a late whistle as padulla got fouled in the lane RJ his secondth foul fourth foul against Clemson RJ Godfrey second padulla with a career high 28 will shoot two shooting I got to believe sha padulla feels without Hunter Couture hes got to look to carry a heavier load offensively checking in 24 here is PJ Hall with 78 to go Rex Steiner waiting to check in for padulla first 30point game of his college career well see how brief this seat is for sha padulla with a sixpoint lead Music Applause Clemsons got shefflin back on the floor Gerard Hall of the hunter Brothers Gerard closed down again Hall inside spinning away from potit shefin on the offensive glass lobs it over potit and thats part of the reason why Ian sheflin is having a great year is because the attention the double big to Big on PJ sheflin on the weak Side Glass cleaning it up hes got four offensive rebounds shefin hes tough hes a tough compliment nichel got a good screen clean look couldnt finish rebound shefin is seventh i go right back to PJ they know the doubles coming let him play through the double team hes capable trying to get it to him there it is Hall will shoot it quickly this time well off the mark and no offensive rebounder in the area Music switch Nicholl steps in nichel elevates Nicholl scores it thats a new career high with Applause 18 the UNC transfer in his first year in blackburg pushes the lead to six with six to Applause go Paul was calling for the ball more setting a screen he ended up with the ball its Gerard hes got hokei straped all over him lost it sheins right on the spot sheelin try to jump over Baron who is twisted over Gerard and throws it out to Music Collin that was awkward Nicholl cast Tyler niichel is having a Music night shoot till your arm falls off TI Applause ton he began his career at North Carolina it appears he will configured out against Tampa Bay and then UFC 297 next Saturday ESPN ABC ESPN depor ESPN plus this is a really really fun time in the sports calendar NFL playoffs coming college basketball absolutely heating up when PJ Hall is busting it in there for position and that gives Chase Hunter a driving angle Hunter tipped it out to Gerard five minutes to play thats the rule and we had it in the first half reset to the back court on an offensive rebound Clemson one for its last seven Gerard trying to go behind his back and Gerard rolls in a two hes into double figures down despite the tough shooting night one of four Clemson players in double figures badulla and nichel was 16 of Virginia Tech 2 two in the second half Pula still off the floor right now as nickel takes it in nichel is fouled and cant convert but he will shoot two number four Ian shein thats his third third foul on Ian chefin so Tyler niichel showed you earlier was the alltime leading scorer in the state of Virginia High School 299 points at East Rockingham High School in Elton was about 2 hours 15 minutes Northeast of blackburg he was pretty strongly considering Virginia Tech out of high school chose North Carolina but when he put his name in the portal visited Virginia Tech he said he loved the energy here he loved the authentic culture and there is the banner at East Rockingham as he goes one for two Baron cleans up his Miss and then throws it over here see thats the kind of break that CL needs nickel misses they dont get the offensive rebound I dont know how you dont get the offensive Rebound with shefflin and Hall on the bottom side of that that not that wont look good on film tomorrow Brad Bells going to have a few teaching points at the end of this game only been one lead change and one tie last four meetings between these teams though decided by a combined nine points all four four points or less into the Hall working on poti not a clean pass and a takeway padulla with his fourth steal good help to the block by padulla theyve been bringing big to big help on the Block to double team PJ Hall this time the help came from the top poua and nichel have combined for 52 and padulla nickel beg your pardon is fouled PJ Halls third will send us to the under four Virginia Tech looking for a signature win here at Music Castle team came into the castle it didnt go so well for them either third ranked NC State going down Elizabeth kley with a game winner as the hokes womens team won 6362 over the weekend incredible execution by Kenny Brookss team Kayla King drops a dime on kitley and kitley finishes and Virginia Tech has won five of the last six home games against AP Top 25 and NC States in there a couple of times thats become a great rivalry on the womens side Virginia Tech of course won the ACC tournament title last year went to the final four and that was a soldout environment without the students here it was crazy on Sunday in here congratulations to the Hokies on the L side this has become a pretty special basketball town the students are still not back yet not a full house today but a soldout crowd with season tickets crowds been engaged and Infused and why not with the way that Tyler nichel and Sean padulla have shot it Nicholls got the last eight for the hokes who have not trailed since 65 and lead by 10 clebson needs a heck of a late surge Halls Miss is rebounded by who else but sheflin and a chance for an oldfashioned three me and sheflin nine rebounds Hall with a great look you can see a sense of urgency right here on Clemson I thought PJ you know hurried that shot he was wide open look for a little full court pressure maybe coming off this made free throw Champlain did Meg Applause it remember no Hunter could tore down the stretch he was kicked in the head on a loose ball by RJ Godfrey in the first half out for the game pullas had to pick up more of the slack got caught in the air there passed up belong two nickel into PO with four to shoot out of the double extra pass Robbie Baron yes sir good ball Movement by the hokes they had a little mouse in the house action with Hunter caught on the inside and they moved the ball and found the open shooter Clemson was a half a pass late on all that Gerard to the basket Joe Gerard with an offensive Applause Music Applause Music Applause foul outside the restricted area who else put pulla drawing it established legal guarding position both feet on the floor before the last step of Gerard its good call heres the pressure for Clemson Virginia Tech has struggled with pressure the last two games against Wake Forest and Florida State they handle it easily here got the super length of Wiggins against padulla now who will take the air out of the clock padulla doesnt want to scream that ball kicked so put 10 more seconds on the shot clock Virginia Tech team that Joel lardi says is only under consideration they have a great nonconference win over Iowa State this would be another quad one win the Iowa State win got better last night when they knocked off Houston the last undefeated team in college basketball on the mens side HTI hked away padulla lets It Music Go I mean the hookies are going to have a lot more quad one quad two opportunities here this would be a quad one win for the moment it would keep them undefeated at home I would look for a back door cut right here something going back door to the basket by Virginia Tech cuz Clemson has amped up their energy and their over playing its been longer than a 30second possession now because of the Kickball and the reset padulla driving it on Hall a shot blocked its picked up by MJ Collins that was about a 42 second possession and it ended with a 13point Virginia Tech lead Hunter on the drive leaves it long and then nickel throws it right to Gerard who will shoot two but time is not on LS inside right now it was 7870 with sheflin at the free throw Music line he misses and Virginia Tech has done a nice job of pushing its a 156 run since Clemson had gotten within four at 6864 remember our triple header Saturday on ESPN begins with Syracuse North Carolina Kentucky AM Arkansas Florida and SEC double header after that another outstanding day of college basketball as we move into January ESPN and streaming on the ESPN app two free throws Gerard Clemson will set up pressure again Baron inbands it to padulla hes fouled by Hunter one and one for sha padulla who is six for six at the line this is uh a situation in the game where you miss Hunter Couture a 91 free throw shooter a ball handler late against pressure shoting padulla is a 76 free throw shooter he is six for six in the game and now seven for Music seven Virginia Tech buoyed by Couture one of the best free throw shooting teams in the nation theyre Ninth at 78 tonight theyre 85 11 for 13 padulla adds one more his career high number balloons to 32 when you make the extra pass 62 of your baskets are assisted you dont turn it over and you make free throws its a good recipe for winning at home Hunter Clemson needs threes and they need him quickly that wont go rebound Applause poti what a response this is going to be to a two game losing streak for Virginia Tech and a quad one win for the Hokies another big win on their resume you see Miami come into this building Saturday go to Virginia andc state next week those are all potential quad One games padulla Clemson ball at the minute 12 the flip side of this de Clemson which came coming in ACC play looked like maybe the best team in the league is about to have barring something crazy a three game losing streak to Miami North Carolina and now Virginia Tech good teams but is a very good Clemson team too this a a good Clemson team and we talked about you know some injuries that have affect of their depth and they didnt shoot the ball well Music tonight not in the second half just 38 from three 18 in the second half another Miss by Gerard is going to go back home host BC and Georgia Tech so a little bit of a lighter schedule upcoming but a one and three start in the cards for Brad brenells team and the hokei faithful Rises to its feet inside ptit punishes for the Applause punctuation the largest lead for Virginia Tech tonight Wiggins misses another three offensive rebound to Hunter back out Gerard another Miss tipped by Hall into the hands of Baron and Virginia that can take a knee sha padulla it appears will end the game with a basketball in his hands and there could be no more appropriate player to see this thing through from a scoring perspective the night of his life in college basketball 32 points for sha padulla Virginia Tech remains unbeaten at home and stop Clemson by Music 15 a career high 32 for Shawn padulla on a night where Virginia Tech did not have Hunter Couture for the second half consecutive games now sha Padulas picked up a career high Tyler nichel with a career high 24 as well it was a twoman show dep for the hokes 56 points combined between the Junior and the sophomore yeah I thought sha badulla managed the tempo with the game early he made a couple of shots thought he did a really good job of finding his own offense I thought he took care of the basketball coming off of the last couple of games where he turned it over 10 times
