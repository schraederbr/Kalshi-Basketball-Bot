nothing to start second half Care lead to seven and a foul called on the dicks at the post Beloo Yeah throwing hand Iowa his third first on wake in the half I like the idea to come trap but come under control That time he was all off balance and out of control third on Omaha Paloo will get him to the bench And Cooper Schwagger junior from Overland Park Kansas who averages about 17 minutes a game checks in He played 15 and a half in the first half and deflected away Cal Dennis how much of Wakess inconsistency lets call it is new faces new places chemistry as you get into ACC play things kind

Wilson to Basar 11th double double for Caleb on the rebound got 13 But to your point partner thats the hardest thing that college basketball is doing right now is to bring in seven or eight new guys

was a warped horse They are different style players as Phillips goes to line here But they have cheering one massive common trait They both played hard all the time All the time And free throw by Spillers is good First points of the night for Trayvon Spillers by the way from Charleston South Carolina On second and rolls in Hes only had one double figure game in the last six Dennis and shooting 41 from the floor He averages 117 Its safe to say they need more from him if they want to be successful in this conference Lead is nine Bogerbots Evans Heres Luca fall away left in the lane BS away Cold on the rebound Cow me Cooper Swiggers starting to feel it a little bit I think theres a three ball cheering Hes now got 11 in the ball game His third three of the night Wilson inside Couple of shot fakes fouled on the play And Swagger or Spillers Its the third on Trayvon Spillers See that time I thought they had Caleb Wilson perfect on the baseline The backboard was a your third defender and you smacked out the ball to bail him out Wilson scoreless so far in the second half And heres the first of two for Caleb Wilson Three of his first four tonight Free throw good Dont forget following the weird number one documentary around 900 tonight Eastern time Nothing but net breaks down the full day in the ACC Highlights analysis music and more Taylor Tannenbomb Tarhill great Joel Barry music Louisville great Luke Hancock Hell take care of you tonight 19 now for Wilson Lead is eight again cheering Deacons cant have empty possessions Correct Spillers Heres Harris Bogots is right

thats the third on Wake Forest Well good hands by MAR Lets see Spillers Ah thats a tough one They didnt really foul him but there was some contact there So Kyle Evans is just shooting by my count his ninth free throw of the year Thats it Yeah Yeah He had 15 points a couple of weeks ago in the ACC opener against Florida State thanks in part to five threes Hes only had one double figure game in the last nine And the part that brings that mention into play is last year in the Mountain West in Colorado State as he picks up his fourth point there He finished the season with 13 double figure games in their last 15 Wow Now different teams and all that but hes capable You lead nine again for Carolina after Evans got one of two and theres a turnover by Calme So Ricks had two empty possessions now Bogots through traffic and four away from Trimble Carolina gives it right back And this is the part of the Carolina game right here on their 11th turnover Dennis thats what Hubert Davis was talking to us today about Can we be consistent with who we are In that last possession that was an unforced turnover Just a bad decision 6 minutes in second half Beloo still scoreless in the ball game He comes in at 133 Schwigger with three to shoot and Wilson stole it from cookies Bogots spot up three Wilson tried to follow it and Trimble had cheering it Beloo fell on him for his fourth foul And Seth Trimble is coming off a left forearm injury And Omaha Belaloo and Trayvon Spillers now both have four in the ball game Look at this That leg got tangled up in there So with 1334 to go Belaloo will

Wilsons gone to Hubert Daviss bench Tremble on the drive knocked away Five to shoot for Carolina Last touchdown of the Wake Forest once again a little two three matchup zone to kind of slow Carolina down the last possession in the corner Dixon cut off softly from the front Rebounded by Harris Calm and Bessar stuck a hand in deflected it out of bounds and Nate Cal I dont know if he took contact on the play but whatever it is he shook it off Yes that first crossover on Bovach I thought he should have rose up and shot it Stevenson almost picked it from Sweden nearly full house I mean all the way

challenge from the weight bench Lets see applause Ah I dont know I understand previous players under review I understand why theyre going to look at it Remember call on the floor is it stays with Carolina Yes From those two angles for me looked like Jukes pinky finger hit it at some point Here we go partner Yeah Does his does Harriss left hand hit it after Wilsons right hand Correct See that pinky right there That call on the floor says its Carolinas is that enough to overturn it Yeah I think I think to your question partner Caleb did hit it first but at the very end you see that left pinky of Harris hit the ball So I think its going to stay The interesting part is usually you can tell who touches it by the way the ball moves Correct Correct In this particular case it doesnt look like the ball changes any kind of Great point Direction Great point partner Oh weve gone to the Look at this Look at this in the truck Look at this Look at our folks See that pinky Yep That pinky And wow another angle Yeah I love it Well in that case you do it looks like its off Harris Yep Yep Now so now they get the wind to go out of bounds Is the clock right Yep Challenged by Steve Forbes Bert Smith Justin Porterfield Matt Potter on the whistle here today in Chapel Hill And theyre going to look at this one more time And meanwhile Justin will come over and tell us here what we got Last to touch is wait Got it So the last to touch is weight It will stay with Carolina applause Glad I got my new glasses this morning Now laughter I that might be as much You dont have enough to overturn it So Juke Harris he was pretty convinced that Caleb Wilson had touched it last Crowd is starting to see in the arena the replays weve shown you Yep So the reaction from the partisan Tarhill faithful here and thats where its tough Heres the other part too Now this is the maintenance of the game that has to take place here with the clock Thats the part there still monitor for and Matt Potter to tell us here what we got on the clock applause Yeah Clock Okay 267 is where it is So it is Carolina ball off of Juke Harris Thats a tough break for coach Forbes because we as players in that position in the moment maybe Juke didnt feel like it touched his finger but thats one of those ones you got to be honest with yourself no coach the other way coach challenge was unsuccessful the ball is off Wake Forest cheering North Carolinas ball name so the challenge being unsuccessful yes no Timeout for Wake when you do not win your challenge for the people at home So Wake is now out of timeouts

Stevensons in Second one for Trimble applause Three of four here down the stretch for Carolina Heres the senior Calm cant burn a lot of clock here Hell take it on the drive and score What a tough shot

threepoint game with 142 left Sebastian Akens will come out 19 in the second half for Nate Calies Ah he step kind of steps on his foot Yeah Yeah caught a caught one of the photographers along the

the first time since last Saturday when he played two minutes against Virginia Tech He did not appear Wednesday night against Miami So Braxton Ziggler to work on Nate Calm and Carolina gets the ball in bounds and a prompt foul from Mason will be his fifth Mason becomes the third Deacon to foul out of the ball game and does so with 134 fourth and the score to clock ratio is going to be trouble here for the Deaks if these free throws are not count correct I think coach Forbes is buying some time for the foul line Hubert Davis is going to get his five over and weve got separate sessions at the respective benches here In a ball game that has been high tempo weve now drilled it down to a crawl in the last 13 seconds here So Calmise and Schwagger will wait at the table They will come in after the first free throw attempt from Trimble Are they going to let him in now I guess so Trimble is three of four at the line Thats all happened here in the last 40 seconds or so And now Matt Woodley and Steve Forbes talking to Justin Porterfield and Cubert Davis wants to play basketball and theyre letting No theyre not going to let in Okay the Deaks now have five on the floor And Treble whos tried to step to the line about five times finally does for the first of two and it rattles out Here comes Schwigger for Jaylen Cross cheering and screaming and Besar comes off the floor With the

Harris was shaken up He has to come off the floor with 5 seconds left He can come in after the first free throw Isaac Carr wearing number seven checks in for the first time in four ball games for the Deakons Two shots for Stevenson whos 76 First free throw attempt of the day cheering for three points applause Twopoint game again What a finish this has been huh applause Crazy Crazy Second one here
