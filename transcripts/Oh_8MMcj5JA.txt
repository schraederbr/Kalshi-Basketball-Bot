and remember this flu bug has been going around the team a little bit Dylan Hunter had to miss Wednesdays game against Syracuse with the same illness the flu games sometimes that can make it legendary exactly Clemson controls the tip at Tigers team again Elite eight last year they return a ton of talent this year 8 one in League Play winners of four straight jayen Zachary has been on a heater struggling with his shot early hes turned it around theres chony Wiggins from the outside and that one rims out starting lineups for Virginia Tech Jaden shot back in there for the hokes along with Tyler Johnson who was the high man in the loss Wednesday to Georgia Tech Toby laow really playing at a high level right now his numbers in ACC play popping off the page yeah now hes hes done great in the ACC so far hes so athletic man he uses his ath atticism to his Advantage a lot shot clock winding down shoot launches airball and a turnover for Virginia Tech they had 17 and a lot of live ball turnovers in that lost Wednesday yeah I mean theyve been struggling with turnovers all year and Clemson forces you to turn the ball over at a high rate so they really have to limit the turnovers to be successful tonight Dylan Hunter making his first start of the season the big man from Russia Victor lockin coming off a double double the in shefin second in the ACC and rebounding behind Stanfords Maxim Reno skip pass Zachary no good on the three he had been 10 of his last 21 from Deep after being below 30 prior to that stretch for the season yeah hes such an important piece to this team he gives them you know he defense every single night and offensively hes been playing really well Virginia Tech young F experien lot of talent gone from last years team dont really have a goto guy but its been seemingly a different hero every night for Virginia Tech as Ben Hammond talented freshman draws the foul hey youre never going to know what youre going to get from Virginia Tech in terms of whos going to be the leading scorer tonight Hammond missed three games with a foot injury he suffered earlier this month against Miami and and his two games back just two of 15 from the field but lightning quick its good for him to you know hes in some shooting struggles its good for him to get to the line early on see the ball go in a couple times Mike young still sitting on 399 career wins thats a lot of Dubs that is a lot of Dubs he played for a guy who had a lot of Dubs yeah he got a lot of taken away from him too add those back quick First Step Dylan Hunter the fadea away out of Big Brothers Playbook there it is there it is Big Brother you know you learned some stuff from big bro a hunter known more for his defense Migel potit second leading score for Virginia Tech 34 and white carves out space down low Catch and Release shoot no good potit couldnt Corral the rebound and thats been a problem sometimes for Virginia Tech potit doesnt really give you as much rebounding as you would hope for for a guy his size Shu can really put it up he can hes got a real quick trigger how about locking with the Nifty move that was Nifty down there little ball fake to the to the right hand floater I like it 16 points 10 rebounds in the win Wednesday against Syracuse and Clemson is so good at keeping the ball out the paint they really try to stay in front the whole time and that time they get Wiggins with a foul on low how good has low been uh you know driving driving hard left creates some contact you know uh they reach in and you know he gets an easy easy two shots at the free throw line I like this from Virginia Tech too because theyre not a team that really gets to the free throw line a lot the two possessions early on theyre getting to the line try to establish going hard to the rim um you know they if they can be more consistent with that it would help them out a lot and to answer your question low who began his career at VCU has taken the leap this year averaging 15 a half in conference play better than 60 from the field 55 from three gets one out of two with the stripe and talking to him before the game he mentioned that things starting to slow down for him he came to basketball late was a soccer player growing up in England as Zachary Banks it in he and a few teammates got banned from the soccer field so he had to find a new sport he chose correctly there it is yeah I mean he looks like a basketball player right and with those numbers and percentages and the athleticism that he has the future looks great for him his three offline and and we get a Applause foul its going to belong to Clemson and its going to be a push on potit a and theyre going to review that one maybe a little extra from potit down there were going to take a look at it we will take our first media timeout 1630 to go first quarter first half six games Virginia Tech has had a different leading score after it is just a com freshman Tyler Johnson with 14 points thats been the story for a Virginia Tech team that didnt really have any verifiable goto guys coming into the season Lew has kind of become the alpha if you will but night tonight you have no idea who its going to be yeah I mean I dont know if its a good thing or a bad thing right I mean you got guys coming in that you know play big on certain nights I do think that Toby has sort of establ established himself a little bit in that role of you know hes the guy of this team hes the leading scorer and I I love to see him keep progressing in that Music role the last foul on potit was reviewed it was a common foul nothing more and that time Dylan hunter gets pushed by low his first Brad Brownell he and Leonard Hamilton now the two longest tenard head coaches in the ACC and hes got a team that is capable of playing deep into March theyre a unicorn Michael in a lot of ways when you look at wiggin Chase Hunter sheflin Dylan Hunter those are four guys who play 20 minutes plus a game for the most part all of them have played together for three or more years yeah thats really important right to to establish that comfortability with your team teammate continuity too yeah continuity as well right I mean we see a lot of teams you know all over college basketball that dont have that continuity and I think that they use it as their advantage for Clemson Hammond aggressive and he goes back to the free throw line foul is on Wiggins and Brad Brownell yeah having words with Wiggins he was hard on Wiggins and shoot around today in a good way wanted his big fella to be more aggressive they view the 610 junr as someone who can unlock that next level for Clemson yeah I mean if you look at the Dynamics of their team um and what roles they have uh you know the if if he starts to establish himself as the player that we all know that he can be and the potential that he has um you know I think chont T Wiggins is kind the limit for him yeah 610 Junior from Grayson Georgia Hammond talented freshman 511 from Fairfax gets both free throws Virginia Tech still without a field goal Hammond with all four Music points shaplin wants it back out hiy breeder sets and hits the air force transfer the three three great ball mve if you notice something about Clemson right they always start their offense in good position right they never get pushed out on the catch theyre always in a position to score and they always get good shots too and they wear on you throughout the game we still have not seen Chase Hunter who did not start due to an illness we were told he would play in the Cal game a little while ago Victor lockin had a similar illness and did not play the first half but played the second half and theres sheflin drawing the charge on the Freshman Tyler Johnson just out smarted him there got to the spot before him put his body in a good position to draw the charge and thats what Ian shefflin does you know Ian shefflin doing Ian shefflin things right there you mentioned to me a little while ago you said you love his basketball IQ yeah I love the way he plays he always makes the right play hes always in the right position he can pass the ball really well hes unselfish and he finishes around the rim and hes a dog in there too which I love he gets physical in there now one of the top rebounders in the ACC shot clock under 10 Wiggins contested three its good over Ben Burnham thats a great shot right there I mean he if he knocks that down consistently like I said Sky the W the sky is the limit for Wiggins Clemson has made five of its last six shots up by eight on the road Hammond accelerates blocked at The Rim by by shefin and theres the 49 12 in vertical from lewow yeah when I when I first read the 49 12 in vertical I was like I dont know man but after seeing that right there that it might be confirmed now you could get pretty high in your day a little bit I dont know about 49 though depends whos measuring right exactly Dylan Hunter through the trees hi breeder sets iron sides rebound low another great look though for Clemson I mean its an open three cant ask for much more than just open shots The Freshman Dell Jones to the scores table for Clemson Johnson over his last four averaging close to a double Applause double couple of nice moves Down Low by shoot known more for his perimeter prowess that was a great that was a great move us his PB and foot reverse back and uh knock down the the little midrange jump shot this is where they want Wiggins to go to the basket he faces up comes up short shoot the rebound you know I think Wiggins it seems like you know watching him play and watching a few possessions when he feels that contact he just needs to be a little bit more patient so he can use his size Tyler Johnson just his eighth three of the season and Virginia Tech with than one thats Tyler the dog Johnson and shoot around today I said how do you define Your Role you guard multiple positions you can play multiple positions he goes Im just a dog theres Zachary down low dog at effort exactly I mean he gives it all every single night hes a hes overshadowed a lot uh just from the great players that they have on this team but hes a very very important piece Boston College transfer who struggled with his shot for the first 15 games hes found his stroke since then B wow against shefflin picked up his dribble dips under offensive rebound theres that athleticism hes got great feet from his soccer background yeah that I mean thats just pure athleticism right there not only is he super athletic but hes strong in there you can tell he was moving thean shuin right out the way after that offensive rebound lob down low and Wiggins cleans plus the foul yeah see if Wiggins keeps getting easy baskets like that it will start to reiterate in his mind like I can do this easily Clemson with a threepoint lead Techo has made four of its last five shots had an illness didnt start played in the second half so again we were told Chase Hunter will play at some point Dylan Hunter got the start chony Wiggins at the free throw line I got to mention weve got Michael Carter Willam Williams doing his first game for ESPN ACC Network weve enjoyed your fine work in the studio were glad to have you uh out in the wilderness yeah its great to be out in the wilderness and get some action and and and be front and center of a game Im Im having a great time I appreciate you guys times have changed right a little bit little bit on the other side of the fence now Burnham the Charleston transfer over to Rodney Brown the Cal transfer now Jaden young strong drive and the rebound by Miles Foster Zachary calling for it into a double team locking against wesler Soft Touch by the big russan I saw him open down there in the paint it took him a little while to get it but you know he got it there good right hand hook Rex Steiner had five turnovers last time out Zachary is the accs active leader in steals thats a matchup to Music watch brown with a Applause mismatch shot clock at five at four Brown got locking in the air puts it up and hits well thats a tough shot right there good defense just better offense he had 611 in your face Applause Dell Jones 10 and orange into the game for Clemson as well hes given this team some good minutes of late Clemson working deep into the shot clock lockin lockin doing his thing getting to that right hand six points for the Cincinnati transfer from Anapa Russia off the northern coast of the Black Sea young contested over Foster rims out rebound Zachary Ill tell you if Clemson could look for the roller off these pick and rolls they can uh they can find an opening against this hok team offensive rebound by Foster now miles Foster is a guy whos a double digit scorer at Illinois state in monit the last two years had a 2015 game a year ago against Kentucky still trying to find his foing find his role with this Clemson team yeah I mean he seems like hes out there just being patient trying to do the little things thats how you get a roll on any team offensive rebound Burnham knocked Music Applause away Brown is fouled on the drive by hide breeder Applause forson number two Hunter number iing for the h number one Applause Toby still no chase Hunter for Clemson this Virginia Tech bench has been a weapon this year averaging 25 points per game in conference GRE Steiner Applause recognizing the mismatch and you get the easy foul there on Zachary yeah that was great recognition lawall was in the post he had a mismatch down there uh they try to get him the ball ended up getting a foul its good to see lall aggressive down there like that Clemson might be in a little bit of foul TR he got five fouls pretty early skip pass to Brown Applause youre right Clemson does such a good job denying that dribble penetration but Virginia Tech shooting 39 from three in conference play and theres Jaden young yeah they can they can really shoot the ball Clemsons really got to have their hands up I mean theyre doing a good job right theyre theyre getting a Virginia Tech to uh be the last you know work in the last three 4 seconds in the shot clock and theyre limited Point paints right they only have four point paints to Clemsons 14 so theyre doing a good J job theyre just vir Virginia Texas is doing a good job of hitting shots long too good by The Freshman Dell Jones with nine points and 15 minutes Wednesday theyre letting that Virginia bench Tech uh Virginia Tech bench have it a little bit down there too on them Baseline shots I like Music it young knocks down another triple that one was a little bit too open Clemsons been very successful in the paint Zachary driving on young lot of dribbling over poti and we get an offensive foul away from the ball on sheelin Applause we see here he sets him up pulls up right in his eye three ball thats a great shot theyve been hot all night and another three going in the Hokies are hot from the Music outside tonight um it it makes the ACC not look very good you know I mean I you know them winning that game it still the North Carolina still holds some validity as a bubble team so big win by North Carolina tonight young will get two shots at the strike great take by Young drove hard with the right hand D lowered the left shoulder draw the foul Two Shots here he goes dribbled down to the paint off one foot lowers the shoulder gets the contact tries to put it up for the n one misses but gets two shots second foul on Dylan Hunter so he heads to the bench Zachary is in jayen young came into the game 14 of 17 from the line one thing to remember about this game too in watching Virginia Tech when the game is decided between one and four points Virginia Tech is in is three and0 I mean its not a huge sample size but it tells that they can stay underc composed in close games yeah you think about how far Mike young has brought this team they had the three and0 start then lost six in a row eight out of 10 and they had so many new pieces to work in they lost a lot of talent high level Talent from last years team I mean one thing Mike young knows how to do he knows how to win so hes giv them chances Wiggins with the rainbow but no pot of gold at the back Applause end its got to be a huge confidence booster for Virginia Tech too not seeing Chase Hunter right there Rex Steiner using the potit screen there it is Rex Steiner for three hes got a pretty jump shot man looks good every time he shoots the ball he backed up sha padulla last year now what can Clemson get some of its reserves thats kind of been one of the missing pieces for the Tigers Wiggins with a nice move and thats what Brad Brownell wants to see out of his 610 junor absolutely that was a great move aggressive used his body got to the rim and finished easy and easy that looked so easy for him so easy its almost like why dont you you know why dont you do that every every trip down if its if its looking like that potit with great position lockin got a piece that was a great great defensive possession by lockin both teams have shot it pretty well Clemson 60 from the field Zachary the three he is starting to make that shot with regularity like we know he can yeah I mean thats such a key if he can shoot the ball consistently this Clemson team is even better than what they are I mean he has I mean thats why theyve been so good right they have guys outside of Chase hunter that do really well almost got the steel off the double open three for brown good box out Applause Music blocking open on the screen and roll he can shoot it from the outside he backs down Applause potit he looking for that right hand lock in with eight boy hes dipping into his vast wardrobe of moves in this opening half and Ging hes feeling it a little bit hes you know its tough right guyss got to make up for Chase being out and hes taking over the offensive responsibility a little bit Rex Steiner over lock in ball is tipped Wiggins tracks it Applause down Wiggins open and connects wow he is he is talented man Applause we need to get these Subs in here these guys are sucking wind a little bit 10 points for chony wiggin he leads all Applause scores Brown wide open rebound lock it you sometimes you have a star player out like a Chase Hunter and it forces other guys to step up youre watching what chony Wiggins done in this first half this might be the kind of game where he has to do more because you dont have Chase Hunter where it could be maybe the cocktail to get him unlocked absolutely could be you know a perfect storm for them where Chase being out and you know coach Bernell you know telling Wiggins he needs to step up you know were going to need him tonight and Im sure he wants him you know for the further on during the season so this is a perfect setup for them Music Music all right Taylor appreciate you letting us steal Michael Carter Williams for uh at least a day Clemson in the midst of a 120 run both teams shoot the three well theyve done so in the first half and uh Virginia Tech getting to the free throw line early was a big help yeah it was a big help them establishing that they can get to the line and drive a little bit to the paint um is important because Clemson doesnt let up too many paint points uh so for for Virginia Tech to be aggressive is really important they need to continue that throughout the whole game Clemson shooting 67 from the field and theyve done it without their best player Chase Hunter who has yet to play with an illness here in this first half scramble they got a rugby pile up been a jump ball good Hustle by both teams you love to see that getting on the floor diving for the loose ball you know you know Ben Burnhams in that mix right there hes a hustler yeah played it Charleston last year had 19 points for the ca Champions that lost to Alabama in round one and showed well in that game against the Crimson Tide and he had one game this year he was everywhere on the floor I mean he was scoring he was getting rebounds Second Chance points oh we get another held ball this time it goes to Applause Clemson you can see the young core that Mike young will have a chance to build around guys like Hammond Tyler Johnson jayen young you know Toby Le even though hes a junior boy theres some really good basketball ahead of him intercepted by shot great recognition by shot that theyve been passing the ball Cross Court he almost anticipated that one Burnham straightway three no Del Jones Corrals Clemson has made its last five shots Applause long three hide breeder Clemsons fifth three of the half second by the former Air Force falcon yeah Mike young is isnt happy about that shot you know in The Scouting Report do not let hide breeder get any room make him put it on the floor right cuz he can do that catch and shoot long ones its a 1 15 Clemson run after Virginia Tech had taken the lead at 26 24 shoot step back three thats not the shot they wanted but Burnhams got the offensive Music Applause rebound Johnson with five and a blocking foul on Zachary his second good idea by Zachary just was a half a step Music behind tomorrow we have three womens games for you number 13 North Carolina hosting Florida State at noon then BC takes on wake and after the gymnastics meet we wrap up the day with number 20 NC State hosting Virginia Tech in Raleigh a lot of good basketball on Tobacco Road one and one for Tyler Johnson freshman from your neck of the woods Orlando Florida yeah there it is that Florida Applause ball its hot down there Im surprised he came up to this cold Music weather hey some people like the Cool Mountain Air uh its beautiful my drive up here man I I was truly amazed Ive never never been here before never been to this these parts of Virginia so it was it was eye opening for me yeah people forget when you played at Syracuse that was in the old Big East yeah that was in the old Big East I wasnt in this new ACC Music Applause age Wiggins in double figures takes it to the basket doesnt quite get the bounce but its tapped in by someone look like L might have tapped that one in there yeah that was that was that was a good play it was either uh Wilder Ian um it was it was a good play you know I think oh was oh oh thats the second Jump by to and hes able to get the foul hes so athletic I cant even I cant even get my sentences out when hes when hes jumping so lets see this look he catches it off the glass then misses the dunk but it was a Applause foul I think they try to get him for I think theyre trying to get they want to see if it was a go which would make it an and one I dont think it was a go now its a two shot foul so no goal tend second foul on locket I mean if youre Victor lockin youre sitting there thinking to yourself whats going on I I just I just came down and hes already back up in the air now lockin will get a breather with the two fouls and less than a minute to go in the half miles Foster back in now this could get interesting if they get into some foul trouble theyre already down uh chase this could you know really hurt Clemson still a chance Chase Hunter comes off the bench in that second half yeah yeah I mean tough choice for you know coach brell I think trying to get him healthy as as fast as possible as the goal here and you know obviously you need to win this game but got to be smart as well Jones using the step back left it way short Burnham is there Virginia Tech has missed its last nine from the field theyve gone more than six minutes since their last field goal Clemsons put the clamps on and a careless turnover there by Rex Steiner looks like miscommunication he and Burnham exchanging some words yeah thats good though I I you know guys need to need to communicate like that even more right you got to got to get on the same page the only way is to communicate timeout Clemson less than 24 seconds left and a half Music Clemson in the first half 64 from the field like they stole fire from Olympus and brought it to blackburg and Virginia Tech were shooting it pretty well early on well now theyre 8 for 26 theyve gone almost 6 and 12 minutes since their last made field goal yeah I mean I think whats whats really big about Clemson and why they shoot a such high percentage from the field they just get such quality shots every trip down they dont try to force it they play for each other and thats what gets them good looks and theyve done it without Chase Hunter who has yet to play one of the top scorers in the AC Applause see hiy breeder is fouled Virginia Tech had a foul to give in fact theyve got one more to give foul is on the Wild and thats two thats a guy you dont want to foul with Music Jones inbounds catch and shoot hi breeder Foster heaves it up and thats shall we go to halftime no chase Hunter impressive right and Ian Sheffield only having two points like that shows me that the the type of team that coach Brad brell has really assembled um they have a bunch of guys on this team that can score the ball and they just play very good team basketball Dylan Hunter two in Orange Chase his younger brother got the start today hes out there to begin the second half uhoh starting five for Virginia Tech La wall everything but the punctuation Virginia Tech Keeps The Possession alive if Im the wall listen I like the I like the strong attack to the rim but we got to finish that one thats an easy one to start off the half right five points in the first half for Toby lawall Hammond had the shot blocked by sheflin regains and that is a shot clock violation thats an interesting thing they started the game out with a a shot clock violation and they started the first half with a shot clock violation I mean if theres any way to establish your defense going into the first going into the game and the in the second half its a way to do it now for Virginia Tech whats the cocktail to get back into the game well I think its sticking whats been working right theyve been getting to the Lane getting to the fou line right keep being super aggressive of getting to the Lane Toby leall needs to be more aggressive use his athleticism its either a dunk or a foul and he goes to the Lane and Toby low just picked up his third foul and that comes less than a minute into the second half yeah that that hurts them really bad now they can really go at him cuz you know they he does not want to foul lockin had a big first half eight points perfect from the field he sure did and he was showing his game the lob and locking in double figures great look by Hunter off the drag took two with him and threw the lob up to Loan Hammond drives kicks low ran into lockin Johnson with an open three way short the field goal drought continues for Tech someones got to break the ice for him and potit picks up a Ticky Tac reaching foul going dribbling right Hunter sees locking down low just throws it up there for an easy two locking in great position you can see him hes open on the roll and hes pointed he throw it up to me Im open lets get it you like that as a point guard 611 big Target oh absolutely especially when you know he wants the ball those are the type of bigs that you want to play with Wiggins with 13 a game high his career high is 19 he might get there today he might get there tonight without even breaking a Music sweat Tech has missed its last 12 from the field shoot gets it but that gives you an idea of how hard theyve had to work for shots I mean if theyre hitting a turnaround jumpers from the elbow I mean thats what you want to give up a contested to uh you know CL like I said Clemson doesnt give a lot of a lot of easy looks down in the paint yeah Virginia Tech has five threes and four twopoint field goals today its what makes this team special and Dylan hunter able to draw the Applause foul I think this is great too for for Clemsons confidence you know theyre going to need their Ro guys to step up and play well you know teams are going to be focusing on Chase um you know the fact the fact that he doesnt have to come in and play in this game it means a lot for this Clemson basketball team yeah Brad Brownell and shoot around said Chase Hunter was probable uh he didnt take part and shoot around Hunter had a mask on was in sweats well now theyre going to get into a frenzy because if Dylan Hunter misses the second one its free bacon for everybody free bacon okay free swine for everyone its twine not swine twines hard thats what you call free throw defense right easily yep y making some noise Hammond tossed one up toward the rim shooting woes continue for Virginia Tech yeah you know youre not going to youre not going to beat this Clemson Team without passing the ball around and getting some movement great position burn him the block this is not a team that blocks a lot of shots they average less than one per game in conference I wonder whats that about I I how do you average less than one won a game I me from from guard play to The Bigs the athletic I feel like got to get some more blocks in there if youre Christian Reeves youre 72 he got blocked by a guy whos 67 here come the hokes buram sets his feet knocks down the triple and Burnham block on one end three on the other so backto back defensive possession Virginia Tech does the two things that hasnt really done this year thats get Steals and get a block yeah I mean when you see your defense turns into offense right and thats what you need against this Clemson team you need some opportunities to get some easy baskets see here on the roll with a great play by Ben Burnham he gets the block they get the next possession Ben Burnham spots up from the wing from three he makes some big plays for this Virginia Tech basketball team man Ive seen him make a lot of plays on the defense and come up big on the offensive end yeah they need him hes one of their key pieces off the bench in the last two games has not been as much of a factor offensively last foul was on wesler Zachary lets it Fly Christian Reeves mops up Rees the Duke transfer who played sparingly and Durham had surgeries on both ankles came to Clemson with three years of eligibility very much a project yeah I mean Hey listen Ive had ankle Ive had two ankle surgeries as well its not an easy thing to deal with so Im sure hes taken his time Burnham got Reeves in the air which gives wesler a chance to earn Applause two here we go off the Miss catches the lob and Ian catches it off the rim Reeves with a monster slam Music to know Music do has his team disciplin on keeping the ball out the paint in contested shots and it just shows you know Virginia Techs really struggling to score inside there theyve got only four points and Patrick wesler rard sophomore from outside of charlot Matthews North Carolina gets the first of two nice Soft Touch by the big fow one out of two Reeves stepped out of bounds Ben Burnham being in the mix just mucking it up thats what you got to do during games like this when you know another team has more more Talent than you and you know theyre theyre higher ranked than you and they perform better than you you got to make the game a little ugly and do little things who was the ultimate muck it up guy that you played with oo thats a great question in college or in the NBA either ultimate muck it up guy Im going to think on that Im going to get back to you on it Music Applause Clemson 60 from the field and again doing all of this without Chase Hunter who has not played tonight hes got an illness we were told he would be available but they havent needed him yet shot clock at three lockin turns to that right hook a rebound taken away by who else Burnham by Burnham to answer that question its probably got to be mo V okay hes probably the most muck it up guy Ive played with hes causes all issues out there sixth turnover for Virginia Applause Tech theyve had trouble with those dribble Drive Wing passes they dont know where theyre just not in communication doesnt seem like theyre on the same page Music chlin working on Burnham locken thought about it tried to thread it to sheflin thats a jump ball it will stay with Clemson see what coach lets see what coach Brad Rell has uh up his sleeve for this 4 seconds this out of bound what you normally do in a SP like this try to get something going towards the rim and then maybe a guy coming off the screen to the Music Applause corner two one batted in the air finally comes to Applause wesler Young had seven in the opening Music half they are helping off wesler not worried about him offensively and the strong Drive Johnson the Lefty finish there you go they theres a way to get the ball Applause inside shefflin down low Rises tried to follow his Miss numbers for the hokes Burnham and its an offensive foul great play but a sacrif spce your body there who took that hide Applause breeder hi breeder takes the charge steps in I mean when you got multiple guys want willing to do the little things out there its you know it its only so its so beneficial to your team yeah a little bit of a late call there on the charge it was they were kind of decided the referees were like do we call a block one had a block one had a charge where are we going whos going to make the call looked like a charge in my eyes though you tend to hold those calls and think about it a little more when its on the home team I dont know about that one Rush seemed like theyre letting him play a little bit or thats a makeup call or the makeup call very true Applause look these are some big possessions for Virginia Tech man theyre its a 12point game each one of these are out potit bangging down low thats what they want to see out of potit and lock in picks up foul number zero Victor L thats his third personal foul second team foul against the Applause Tigers thats a tough call right there its a tough call when theres a lot of contact going on on the other end potit looking for his first points for Ian Ian sheflin coming back in the game Ian shuin has a talented offensive game Id like to see him do a little bit more today yeah shefflin only two points today again no chase Hunter and potit gets both free throws of Virginia Techs top two scores potit has two low who picked up three fouls but his back in there only has five yeah battle the role players tonight I breeder looking for his third three not there a chance here for the hokes to cut it to single digits low theyre looking for help it was knocked out of bounds it will stay with Virginia Tech last touch sheflin thats what I like to see out of Toby right like I need I dont know how many drives he has a game or had last half but they need to be more only six points in the paint for Virginia Tech Music Applause tonight Johnson to Lal over sheflin and one thats how you take the ball strong to the rim right Music there and one uses the left Creative Body and flexes on him a little bit youre too small missed the fre free throw shefflin aboard its a 70 run for Virginia Tech Clemson now one for its last 11 yeah Clemson has gone ice Applause cold that was tipped there you go go right at him wow finishes with a strong twohanded flush the recipe isnt its not complicated right just be aggressive towards the rim go at him time out Brad Brownell the castle has come to life Virginia Tech is closed to within six Toby Lal rise and flour Music p tech starting to get some baskets inside yeah theyre attacking theyre theyre playing hard now right theyre playing Virginia Tech basketball uh Toby Le wall has had some points down there hes really been that head of charge and getting the ball into the paint and and taking it to the rim and getting to the free throw line as well Virginia Tech is clawed back into the game and Clemson brings out the Hunter Chase Hunter who has an illness he did not start has not played he checks in at the 1152 Mark uhoh they threw out the Batman symbol at the Coliseum Brad Brownell knows this is a quad three opponent a Clemson loss tonight hurts the resume theres no way around it so he brings in Chase Hunter both the hunters the hunter Brothers this is younger brother Dylan Chase first touch three no good thats got to be tough youre on the bench game its going to be interesting on the bench all game and now coming in not a bad you know not a bad idea just to get one up try to get your get your touch and your feel um you know its 12 minutes its enough time for Chase to really really get involved in the game a hunter with BandAids on both of his forearms he was getting IV after shoot around earlier today he is now back in and has entered the chat Music Music its all in partnership with coaches versus cancer and so uh great gesture there by know Virginia Tech for the local community in the childrens hospital and some fancy Footwear along the tech bench as well thats an awesome thing to do great idea Chase Hunters three no good and Dylan Hunter goes over the back for foul number Applause three its getting interesting maybe the the Clemson tide heard that uh Wake Forest and duer in a onepoint game yeah wake is awfully tough to beat at home they have not lost at the Joel this season something like 50 games over 500 over the last four years at the Joel Applause Jaden young the rims out that would have made it a one possession game can Hunter get going little shake bake and he had it knocked away looked like that may have been a turnover certainly the folks here thought Applause so I got to see the replay couldnt quite tell from from that angle if it went off him or went off the Applause hokes hunter to shefin Zachary shot fake Chase wants Applause it hell pull it back out strong defensive possession Hunter the Deep three that doesnt go so over for three and a near turnover for Chase Hunter since checking into the game yeah I mean hes hes coming in cold right now hes got to get his legs warm a lot of time in this game left though Burnham deposit slip great take by Burnham using his size using his Applause length Zachary strong denied and fouled its on Tyler Applause Johnson thats his Applause third he was moving yeah he was definitely moving A to B that is a foul I know the crowd didnt like to hear it but youre allowed to go vertical straight up the moment you get sideways theyre going to get you every time and Zachary is an 89 free throw shooter Applause our next gymnastics meet right here on accn and the ESPN app tomorrow afternoon sandwiched between some womens basketball youve got Stanford and pit at Fitzgerald Applause Fieldhouse here we go see if Clemson can put together a couple Applause stops Virginia Tech with a three makes it a one possession Applause game tough tough cant leave your feet on the pass got to stay on your feet Clemson has led by as many as Applause Music 17 Hunter 0 for three since checking in at the 1152 Mark and Wiggins stay the silencer three hes got 16 thats a big shot for Wiggins right there in the Clemson tide puts them back up Applause nine you know even having Chase back out there right hes still a threat right Virginia Tech you know they got to they got to take notice that hes on the floor that can leave Other Guys open potit with the bucket and the foul great Roll by bati got him the ball on the roll and one Id like to see Wiggins be a little more aggressive not be so in between right either come either come and step up and try to block the shot or just be straight up right you cant be in between now you give your team you know you you cant give up and ones at this point in the game second foul on Wiggins five team fouls on Clemson tigers have struggled from the field one for their last 12 here in the second half they shot 60 in the first half Dell Jones on the drive and they go back to what worked early getting inside getting inside getting to the rim being in being aggressive looking at mismatches right he saw a shoot he was you know I can take him off the dribble hes not the best defender in the world and um you know he hes he got to the rim and scored two young teardrop the rebound to Jones and thatll be a foul and that puts Clemson in the bonus its a one and one and thats on thats on Toby as well thats his fourth I believe it is for on laow thats the one guy Virginia Tech needs on the floor when youre trying to come back yeah if youre Mike young what do you do here right you try to get him out and get him back in with about five six minutes left or you just let him play it out I dont know you tell me whats the move a man 9 point yeah I mean yeah I think you I think you got to I think got to take him out and put him back in in 2 minutes a quick sub dont make it too long but 2 minutes cuz if he if he fouls out youre in Music trouble yeah the danger is you take him off the floor in that twominute stretch Clemson could pull away and this game could be over yeah you know it could go from 10 to 15 and youre in real trouble so now its on Virginia Tech to hold the fort until LW can come back into the Applause game Burnham snags the rebound Applause Music Applause eight minutes to go good defense here by Clemson young cutting over locking and he gets it to go thats a tough move getting into the body and finishing over the top Chase was a little too aggressive on that just stay home stay solid Music nine points for Jaden young Hunter still scoreless and potit picks up the foul going for the steal thats two fouls that hes picked up bad fouls on the perimeter and 33 to go second half Clemson up by Music eight Clemson out the paint oh Tech defensively on its last possession got too aggressive potit picked up a foul going for a steel on the perimeter and that gives lockin a chance at a one and one and you know those are the fouls where that adds up in The Ledger at the end of a game yeah I mean that that was a bad foul you put you put Clemson on the line when theyre struggling to score um just cant commit silly mistakes like that against them theyll make it pay one out of two for locken Burnham with another rebound his fifth at what point does Mike young bring Toby lawall back into the game I mean its got to be at the six minute Mar you got to give him enough time potit turns it over up ahead to Hunter lays it in softly hes playing for a little girl today his daughter Milani turns one and he gets a bucket for her not his little girls birthday happy birthday Milani sorry your daddys a little bit sick but I hope your birthday is going well first points for Chase Hunter averaging 18 a game good pass Burnham open rolls in thats great ball Movement by Virginia Tech a skip pass to the wing and then an extra to the corner beautiful basketball eight points five rebounds for Burnham Applause theres Applause Hunter Zachary missed the layup gets it Applause back and we get a foul uh I think it the basket counts a goal tend goal tending basket counts I mean that that stuff right there is just inex inexcusable to me right you got a sixfoot guard coming in you got bati down there hes got a hes got to make a play on that now malel potit 69 260 had the rebound taken away by Zachary whos barely 61 Jaden Youngs given Virginia Tech good Music minutes poate puts it on the floor and a blocking foul number four on Victor lockin Im sorry but that is just a bad call right there I mean how long does he have to be there for Music I mean his his his feet were set his body was straight up I mean he leaned a little bit but he I mean his feet were set for a long time I I I dont know how that isnt a charge but well it was it just wasnt called yes it yeah here we go at the six minute mark on the dot now you called it here comes Toby back in for the h one to L so L back Applause Music Applause in and they get Zachary with a foul so that puts Virginia Tech in the bonus itll be a one and one one to shooting the one and one active box score 10 players have scored for both teams spread out game L misses the front end of the one and one and Burnham knocks it out of bounds Tyler Johnson comes in for shoot giving Virginia Tech a bit more on the defensive side what do these last six minutes come down to I think it comes down to who takes care of the ball and who can execute on the offensive end I mean and hey it may come down to making a free throw both teams cant make any free throws theyre one for two 0 for one Jones pulls and gets Two Shots foul is on Rex Music Steiner and the next foul will put Clemson in the double bonus thats important at this at this time drives left pulls up on the dot Rex Steiner has his hand in there a little bit great play by Jones got to knock these free throws in Applause though I was talking to some Clemson folks earlier and they mentioned Dell Jones you know going for nine points hitting three threes earlier this month against FLA state had nine points in only 15 minutes against Syracuse they said can he do that on the road well today nine points in 18 minutes yeah and hes been real solid right its its its helpful to have guys like him on the team who arent going to try to do too much going to put an effort on the defensive end and try to make the simple plays on the offensive end you know I think that Jones isnt going to jones isnt going to come in and try to replace Hunter and be that scoring guard hes just going to come in and be solid get their team in the sets and what they need to be in so their offense can flow foul on Chase Hunter another one and one here for Virginia Tech L needs one point to make it four straight games in double figures in Applause scoring 10 plus points now in seven of his last eight back in for the h number four Rodney Brown J Rodney Brown Jr man hes got great size for him defends pretty well you know as a defensive guy I think you know Id love to see more of him you know on the defensive end Virginia Tech has left a lot at the free throw line 12 for 21 at the stripe Applause 11point Clemson Music lead Jones with the swish a careerhigh 11 points for Dell Jones hes having a a hell of a game he has moved into Brad Brownell circle of trust Burnham no good on the three Wiggins a rebound hes 610 but averages less than three rebounders a game come on Wiggins you got to get on the boards my man shefflin left alone left it short fresh 20 and Clemson will reset its a big play by Clemson see if they can capitalize off the rebound Applause Music Wiggins with 16 five to shoot Jones gets separation and hits Big Shot hes feeling it now his confidence is boosted up man my mans had the last eight putting Clemson on his back closing out the game here behind the back catches his dribble midrange tough shot my mans hot right now hes got Clemsons last eight hes doing his thing out Music there time to get up out of your seat and dance for some bacon Music Taylor thank you thank you Taylor they wake up pushing Duke at home Blue Devils right now in a class by themselves in the ACC its time now for Food Lions food for thought and uh chony Wiggins did a lot of this in the first half 10 of his 16 came in the first 20 minutes four of six from three Chase Hunter and Ian shefflin the teams top two scores have combined for four points today guys like Wiggins guys like Dell Jones have stepped it up oh yeah 100 theyve done a great job of stepping up theyve hit big shots here down the stretch um theyve just theyve been coming up big all game and its its great to see it tells you and again people can now poo poo Virginia Tech but this Virginia Tech team has played better uh over the last month compared to where they were six weeks ago theyre three and five in League Play there was a point mid December you werent sure they were going to win three games in conference when the season was over no yeah and and you know theyve done a great job at home as well oh great pass and a big finish by Ian Sheffield with a dunk great pass by the two head of the snakes on this team but no just speaking of of Virginia Tech its tough to come in here and win right and its always tough in conference games on the road you know you got your star player out like its not easy to win we learned a lot about Clemson today and again were they expected to win this game yes shefflin not a big offensive contributor Chase Hunter didnt play the first half with an illness didnt come into the game till about 12 minutes left in the second half as shefflin gets fouled by Burnham and youre looking at a team thats going to win most likely by double digits on the road in conference which as you know doesnt matter who you play you go on the road in league to win by double digits thats hard to do its very hard to do nothings easy in this confererence you youre playing teams that are so familiar with how you play and your style of play and your personnel that its a challenge coming into these games um it it its never easy to win in conference now Ill tell you this when the next polls come out early next week Clemsons got to be ranked 100 they got to be ranked no doubt about it Clemsons only conference loss is to Louisville the cards currently in the top 25 Id love to see those two teams play all year long against each other Burnham over Jones no Zachary the rebound Applause Music I mean I dont know why theyre not going back to the same play they just ran twice in a row they got easy layups on that career game for Dell Jones The Freshman Zachary the corner three and that hit the net but did not go in oh we sure that didnt hit the rim I think it hit the net okay 19point lead for Clemson the largest theyve had tonight Chase hunter gets some hugs he gets to the bench despite feeling not so well Hey listen hes scored uh a couple of points got a basket for his baby girl on her first birthday absolutely right and thats important right just shows how available he is hes a team guy hes willing to come in when hes sick its his daughters birthday um you know hes hes a great hes a big character guy so you know hes hes one of the the great players that represent this ACC uh conference on and off the floor a dozen for La hes the only hokey in double figures Applause Applause sheflin with two with one and thats another shot clock violation see in a play like that I would love to see wiggin be aggressive right you got the ball with 9 10 seconds on the shot clock make a play make something happen get to the rim get to the foul line or you know or you know make make a play though you got to Applause Duke has beaten Wake Forest so the Blue Devils remain unbeaten in ACC play Browns three no and Lal with the putb so Clemson with the win will go to 9 and one in conference play as they continue to chase Duke theyve got a date with the Blue Devils at Little John on February the 8th Clemson 49 from the field Wiggins with 16 13 from Jones lockin and Zachary 11 a piece its so funny at the end of the games when when when any player to ever play the game if youre up by this much and the shot clocks run down you always look at your coach and youre like what what should I do coach should we go should we let the shot clock run out like its never a a set thing Wiggins puts it up how how many times are you looking and kind of hoping he gives you the app oh yeah Im looking I even if he says no the first time Im like were going right were were were going and then I got to make him be real animated about the no how did beheim handle that it depends I mean beheim sometimes he says hold it out sometimes he says go who knows who knows depends depends on his mood that day depends on if the refs gave us calls if they didnt give us calls well need to get the two of you either on a game or in studio together at some point no definitely tonight it belonged to Clemson 72 57 now Virginia Tech at one point made it interesting but Clemson
