and theyre gonna have to get DJ Burns established early on the road when North Carolina state is not coming in off a stellar performance perhaps their worst of the season on Saturday they were blown out in their final home game by Clemson losing by 25 Roger Ayers Brian OConnell Kip Kissinger are our officials theyll toss it into the air heirs does the honors and Duke controls with Derrick Lively and Tyrese Proctor one of the Duke guards who was really hounded into 22 turnovers in the first meeting has really elevated his play of late Jeremy roach guarded by turquavion Smith they really didnt let Duce run anything in the first meeting and theyve got the Devils deep in the shot clock already heres Mark Mitchell from the board and thats a better start for the Blue Devils who got behind 150 in that game in Raleigh and Carolina state is starting five Debbie talking about Smith and Joyner Marcel the transfer from Virginia Greg Gantt is in there for Jack Clark and we could see Clark tonight and the big fella DJ Burns has had an outstanding season after transporting from went to the Smiths first shot is a Ryan phillippowski as the rebound Dukes starting five is a familiar one The Freshman with Jeremy roach Lively Mitchell philipowski and Proctor all in their first years in Durham and roaches to Captain and the leader who has really thrived since Proctor has emerged theyve been able to move Jeremy off the ball and Jeremy lost the ball that time and here come since he stayed on the push with dark L Joyner the transfer from Ole Miss driveway is going to have a challenge trying to keep him in front in transition thats why when NC State pushes they get the matchups they want Reese if they push the ball in transition they can take advantage of some of the defense on Duke if birds can do that too then Lively will have to come out and contest him in the thing that Lively does brilliantly is block shots he leads all freshmen in Block shots in the top 15 in America among all players both DJ Burns and Derek Lively will be in drop coverage on most ball screen defense so neither one of them like to come out of the paint both of these teams are good offensive rebounding teams you saw lies would get one for the Blue Devils one of the goals for North Carolina States Kevin Gates as we saw on the board in the pregame tonight was throughout rebound the Blue Devils by 10 well Derek Lively didnt get a whole lot of minutes the first matchup he is a much different player now as duke brings the double Smith not shy but quavion is long when the shot NC state has it back with Burns and then Burns lost it and Smith is able to Corral it its 20 on the shot clock here goes for cuevion it rattles out no red shirt in there to rebound it Duke has the easy rebound so sir quavion starts off oh for three and in the last five games hes shooting just 23 from three Applause Supreme confidence and the green light from head coach Kevin Keats North Carolina State scores with darkell Joyner theyve really played four defense in the first half of each of their last two games got away with it against Wake Forest because they scored well and they couldnt find the ranch against Clemson and down huge at halftime and never got back in it until 49 a couple of early buckets to avoid falling in that hole from the court another offensive rebound for a moment that phillipowski had it knocked away Joyner on the run right by live We Now thinks better of it with the big freshman there it is swatted away so instead hell shoot it over three you can test it shots no good and joyners on the deck holding his wide ankle that would be a big issue for NC State lets hope its not serious but he has yet to get to his feet and now the Duke goes over and back and the officials led by Kip Kissinger sending North Carolina State training staff out to check on Joyner lets take a look and see if you can see what happened to Brad transfer from Ole Miss oh he stepped underneath the scores table and sort of got his foot caught as he was trying to wheel that ball in 42 North Carolina State but a significant situation one of the star guards for the wolf pack well check on him dark Hill Joyner walked off with some assistance after really what happened Debbie as he backpedaled a little bit underneath the scores table got his right foot caught underneath there for just a minute and sort of rolled that ankle so hes down on the bench being attended to right now but the way he was walking were hopeful that um and he will be back shortly well for NC State this puts Brian pass the six foot sophomore in the lineup and this will put turquoivion Smith most likely handling most of the ball handling responsibilities Applause pass got it to Smith Lively challenging him and after quavion got in a lot of trouble now he tumbles in to the front row of photographers there well Duke was trying to trap him so he was stretching the trap to the other side of the floor and Joyner is now walked down and taken a seat around the end of the bench Blue Devils meanwhile I mentioned the slow start they got off two in Raleigh but now theyve missed their last five shots they didnt score until they were behind 15nothing is that earlier lost in wolf pack now philipowski has it on the Block freshman goes to work he misses gets his own hell try it again and Roger ears has got a foul on the inside see for philipowski its all about the quality of the catch great Gantt is defending him hes got a size Advantage he doesnt really need to counter he just needs to go right over the top and score and on the second effort he gets to the free throw line Casey morsel with the foul Music and that didnt take long it was scary Im sure it was scary for darkell join everywhere delighted to see him return to action pass will stay out there and Marcel will take a break a collective sigh across Raleigh deep breath because if theyre going to make a run in the ACC tournament or in the NCAA tournament they need both of those Dynamic guards going its what really energizes them on both ends of the floor NC State thrives off the turnovers due defensively has thrived off just pretty much choking the life out of your offense and theyve done theyve done that quite well in recent games fourgame winning streak shot clocks all the way down to four Dans not denoted to be a score but gets it up and in great Gantt has three times the number of rebounds that he has points for NC State but he plays his role very well so thats a bonus for the wolf pack for him to score and you can see Duke is bringing a double to DJ Burns Music transfer from Providence now jumps out switches now hes harassing Proctor now hes a little bit of a mismatch but they dont find him Mitchell on the Baseline Kyle gets an offensive rebound against the smaller pass has almost ties him up and now Duke will have it with 20 on the shot clock his Lively gets it now Proctor for three phillipowski again and Dukes winning the battle on the boards particularly on the offensive end where they are one of the better offensive rebounding teams in the country and the best in the ACC philipowski is going to work block to block showing tremendous toughness on the glass he goes to dunk this and from behind Greg Gantt looks like just stuffs it in the rim five offensive rebounds already for the Blue Devils and philipowski will go back to the freethrow line Applause Kyles had a sensational freshman season leads all freshmen in the nation with 12 double doubles in the last four games averaging 15 points and about seven boards per game thats a little bit better than a season average overall Duke is much more efficient Music theyre assisting on 67 percent of their baskets and theyve turned it over on an average of nine times thats the details of moving towards March John shires sent to Rick Whitehead into the game along with Jacob grandison Whitehead star freshman various injury concerns over the course of the year he can be an offensive spark and rising up and knocking one down as prion pass making the most of his opportunity State picking up some full court pressure Applause all the way so good in that middle ball screen action DJ burnson drop covers but thats way too much quickness by Roach that is equitness mismatch now Burns and see if he can use that big old Fanny impact Derek Lively down scores hell have the opportunity for a threepoint play that is DJ Burns in his game you tease him at on him with a double hes got great patience and boys tremendous IQ with a ball in his hands a willing passer it takes it right at the second best shot Blocker in the ACC Lively is going to take a break Ryan young the grand transfer from Northwestern to Dan and the soft touch by the big fell against him five and North Carolina state has an early threepoint lead DJ Burns is averaging about 23 minutes and the issue with him all season has been keeping him out of foul trouble I like the way Kevin Keats is managing him early in the game Ebenezer duana is checked in big man who started much of last season now Whitehead turns the corner and has a deflected thats a staple with a wolf pack defense disrupting your offense with deflection they have two side they go screen and roll Jack Clark tacks from the weak side and gets a deflection and we know how Kevin Keats feels about deflections theyre trying to get 40 tonight he says when they get 40 deflections they typically win Applause Music Jeremy Rhodes has such good handle and is such a good game manager in a late clock situation you saw him have a splendid performance on Saturday night his first career double nothing with 19 points in the one that says that blowoff Victory against Virginia Tech One in which it is the advantage 10 earlier loss will sell the fade away has to be really active he gets an offensive rebound so both of these clubs do a really good job getting Second Chances two teams in the ACC as you mentioned earlier theres that passthrough screen from Clark he took a tough ball missed the game against Clemson on Saturday a chance to get back in and three on pass come on Reese are you kidding me the secret weapons Greek needed that one he had made just three of his last 14 field goal with Tasman we know hes become a proficient shooter Joyner tried to answer here come the Blue Devils in a tie game and its one of the unforced errors North Carolina States going to force enough turnovers you cant help them with the unforcements I mean theyre plus four in the turnover margin to lead the ACC they lead the ACC in turnovers for us to just under 14 a game but thats the thing about Duke they havent been turning the ball over in this four game winning streak completely different feel to this club than when they played the world pack the first time really a different feel from even you know probably three weeks ago much more together juice documented very well they know their roles as the foul is called on Jack Clark and were off to a good start and Cameron we we might wind up with a barn burner in the final home game of the season for the devils ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by Progressive Insurance Daisy to bundle your home and car insurance at progressivecom and in part by Samsung Galaxy s23 series foreign House Texas Tech taking on Jalen Wilson and The Jayhawks Kansas need to win or a Texas loss to secure at least a share of yet another big 12 title with the 17th regular season title for Bill self in his 20 years at Kansas and yes it cant make you dizzy sometimes amazing its such an impressive number such consistency over time you know that big Showdown Saturday between Kansas and Texas the Longhorns still have the difficult matter of going to Fort Worth tomorrow night on ESPN2 and of course itll be no picnic against the Red Raiders team that has now become desperate to try to plan some big wins and maybe sneak it away into the tournament if these days theyll probably need to make a bit of a run and right in in a threepointer earlier and this time hell have a chance for three free throws as the foul is called on Jack Clark Applause everyone two on Jack after he missed the game on Saturday You Know Jack Clark is in his Landing space thats a foul for Whitehead you mentioned hes missing missed a lot of time this year thats only the second missed free throw of the season I like to call him the disruptor I think he elevates them on both sides of the ball to another level as we get closer to postseason because he can defend multiple positions he can score at three levels hes an incredible athlete hes got great length hes got a high motor John Shire told us today these guys are all selfmotivated I just have to spend a lot of time trying to get their their engine revved up so decide if it was two or three throws I think is what theyre looking at I was told that they were looking at them too are they going to add more seconds because uh I guess the ball didnt hit the rim so theyre straightening out the clock it was pretty clear that he was behind the line so they get that straightened up theyve disrupted to reach Rhythm got to do it got to do what you got to do I guess Music whiteheads now 15 of 17 free throw line while he was injured Chris Carroll a great article read this week about working with Tariq in consistency in the shooting State hes always been able to shoot sometimes Flex dont stay under him but he had the infected that form up top and then he was coming back carowell put him through the face just to make sure he could do it when he was tired and man as if is it paid off for him he was kind of known as a slasher and Driver coming out of high school Duke has its first lead of the night and hoping to add to it on this trip so thats a little offensive foul there as he just stuck a forearm into the side of Greg Gann three whistles on that one that was an easy one for the officials serve as the fourth turnover for the Blue Devils in the first half and thats uh lets just say thats uncharacteristic thats not the its nothing most aware foul Kyle will ever commit DJ birds made Seven baskets against Duke the first matchup six of them were against Ryan Young see Pennsy State goes right back to him because they have confidence in this matchup oneonone Applause transfers going at it and wont get the chance because young put both hands on him and hes going to recall for the foul NC States going to dial that up as long as Ryan young is on the floor because they know DJ Burns who can score against most post players oneonone but certainly knows he can win that matchup and John Shire knows it also so he gets him out and puts Lively back in scored over Lively earlier pulling him away from the basket Music has been a little quiet in the early going and he can go off at any time heres DJ spinning against live handsome friendly nighttime banking hours and usually hes got a big smile on his face after he makes a play like that he has seven of NC States 15 he is so talented Eric Lively feed to Mitchell and he was fouled on his way to the basket and Mark will shoot a couple of free throws you watch the footwork of DJ Burns hes got a Barkley you back you down back you down and then high off the glass he uses the board so well on the other end chaquavion says not Duncan in the first half no dunks Fallon Smith and Mitchell will have to get it from the free throw line hes a good freethrow shooter right on cue the footwork you mentioned for burns a big man that Nimble and I think of Oliver Miller so Oliver was a big guy when he was not quite as big he always had great feet kind of a soft touch soft hands and theres some similarities there I think in in those two aspects of their game really quick on the spin move really good with the counters reach the double team so well Joyner seems none the worst for the wearer after that ankle scare on the scores table step back top of the key in the last five games hes been their best player 23 points five assists couple of steals a game any rebounds this is a good rebounding backcourt for NC State Proctor weaving his way in hes getting hit through the lane foul is going to be called on the road is so good at using the bounce to separate such quickness you got to give him a little bit of a cushion I dont think anybody can attack a closeout in the ACC better than he can and Isaiah Wong at Miami is pretty good at it thats a couple getting it in Lively saves him Mitchell misses three and Smith with the rebound Music did a good job keeping it alive three ball no good for phillipowski lively chases down another offensive rebound for the Blue Devils at six Applause NC State doing a really good job one pass away roach has to get it out he is killing him in that middle ball screen action Jeremy roach especially late in the shot clock thats three consecutive times hes had the ball in the middle third and scored with the clock inside five now hes accounted for six points in the early going Joyner wanted that step back to kolkowski kept him from doing it Proctor was the last to touch it and Proctor as an oddball Defender and or denying his man has become a menace defensively over the last few weeks I think thats his personal development and growth alone as you see here the taquavion are getting into it a little bit Roger Andrews is going to step in turquavion was taking exception that Proctor was was in his was in his face this is going to get a little contentious before its over yeah well Proctor already has in turquoia were pushing back and forth and then they just tripped over DJ I think theyre going to take a look at it thank you theyll come over to the minor monitor Brian OConnell Roger ears having a look now lets look here you see theres the chest bump and now to playground look like a little personal space wouldnt do hands Proctor young but uh undaunted whoa cute you run into a wall like DJ Burns you you might fall its gonna happen 8 20 in the first half tied at 17 with a dead ball technical foul as a result of a little interaction with Tyrese Proctor thats the end of it there were its his second personal foul by the way now what to clavion was motioning to his teammates in the Huddle as it earlier prior to what you see is that Proctor was like putting his arms sort of around him but jaquavian had plenty of opportunities to avoid that entire situation did not and now he has two thousand is sitting and Crocker goes now that technical foul counts as a personal foul Applause Proctors first point of the night and Smith who is averaging 176 points per game third in the ACC and scoring has a number of points to match his jersey numbers so far so NC State loses possession of the ball as well I think it was their ball out of bounds prior to the cycle Proctor races past pass hes been very good and perhaps unexpected early playing time Kevin Keith a couple of shots a year were going Brooks does a good job shaking free cant find the range has had a hand on it kolpowski knocked it out of bounds NC State isnt just switching they are switching to steal they are being very aggressive in those switches and thats a great read by roach to Flair he had a great look at it combined one for 13 from behind the arc neither team shooting particularly well in the early going product of aggressive defense its a little cantankerous attitude on both sides it was reared its had great pass by Burns To Fine pass and he couldnt knock it down and now its going to get to cheapy because the officials want to get control of this after the little back and forth between Smith and Brockton two on Gantt I mean theres no reason for it cant to reach in on that and try to make that play and Breon pass has made three triples on the season so DJ Burns usually I think the percentage of scoring goes up for NC State when he passes it to you out of the double team because I think he gives you confidence when he does that dad takes a seat with the 2000 Ernest Ross has checked in North Houston scores again Duke is at nine out of 12 from behind the state has advantages nine of 13 and a threepoint lead Mitchell acting and almost was the turnover in the back court but Joyner will get it safely across the timeline for the pack Music that was a good decision the Duke limited Hunter Couture to only two threepoint attempts Virginia Tech on Saturday night and that was a part of the big Scouting Report defensive game plan and I think Mitchells doing a great job on Casey morsel right now not letting him get free from threepoint lead from live blue results in a Hell ball NC State maintains possession now the arrow flips through the bluebells Burns working double at him and I think hes going to get caught the steps its a great job by making DJ Burns hesitate because philipowski brings the double then he goes back away then he comes back again with the double team so he recovers then he comes and brings it again as soon as DJ Burns turns to the Baseline third turn over the first half for the wolf pack they Trail by three duke has the balls were inside seven minutes to play here in the first half of Cameron grease its really physical Proctor deflection from Philadelphia to steal fourth turnover for the wolf pack here come the Devils with their biggest lead and hoping to add to it philipowskys open Applause I dont get it to him Lively coming to set the ball screen for Proctor Proctor shakes a couple windows a nine Blue Devil rod and Kevin Keach needs a timeout how about the big fella does always work around the rim Debbie hes a rim Runner he plays on Dropbox and put backs and thats good and Arizona State have won games in the last few days and then Arizona on the road to take on USC Bruins have already clinched to Pac12 regular season Rick Cronus team I think its a threat to win the national championship I like tiger Campbell I like Mick cronins demeanor with his team theyre very good defensively and tiger hasnt played his best basketball played but its coming Hawkins has had a terrific season too Applause Boy Bobby Hurleys team needed that win they got over Arizona over the weekend Fade Away jumper from dark Hill Joyner that is a top two you cant play much better defense than that NC State brings a full court pressure here Joyner the transfer from Ole Miss who led the rebels in scoring last year at over 13 points per game and hes been a really good fit and largely a calming influence on Smith with the course of this season for graveyard switch on the bench a couple of fouls after getting hit with the Deadfall theyll try to weather the storm perhaps in the last five minutes without their leading scorer Joyner Road Applause strained it I mean not his confidence that was one of those bad shot wow great shot as he scores again one more time hes done that tonight how good has Jeremy roach been The Four Freshmen and Roach Applause so smart Applause foreign ly definitely asserting himself this second block of the game Reese and I updated his block shots number still 57 into their transition game not this one Duke gets to set up their d ude burn spins pass live Wing what a great job using the rim now North Carolina state is hanging around their degree of difficulty on their shots has been far higher than roachs drives to the bucket but the wolf pack inside the four minute Mark weathered a little Duke rally in there within two try to tweak Jeremy roach which means make him go to his left hand Grandersons no good Burns has his pocket pitch by Roots Mitchell goes in here how to be strong with that ball Burns was not and Duke made him pay Music ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by Wendys two for six dollars the best deal in fast food foreign terrific for Duke four field goals didnt have a field goal in the first meeting at the NC State won by 24 now Jeremy was working his way back from injury but in addition to the numbers you saw there Debbie a big deal right now is that Duke just shot its 14th freethrow theyve made 10 North Carolina state has shot one in Mayport well it went to Avion Smith with two fouls on the bench with no points when they played the first time he had 24 points no assist but he drew eight fouls on the Blue Devil defense and the Wolf Pack trying to hang in for those last three and a half despite the foul trouble not only for Smith but Jack Clark DJ Burns Greg Gantt also saddled with two fouls here in the first half Clark is on the floor number five hes playing with them at the moments without DJ burns on the floor right now John Shire can get Ryan young back on the floor to guard dewana Ebenezer Duane is the big fellow thats embryon pass has gotten good run early in the game to work with us at the beginning dark Hill Joyner Twisted an ankle had to leave for a while he was scary but darkell has been the picture of Health it seemed shot clock at five Marcel lets one fly he has a much improved threepoint shooter than he was from the days at Virginia and even better than last year that play too slow developing for NC State it took him too late and a deep forced three road splits and Defenders drops it to phillipowski who patiently put it up and had a roll off the rim the Kyle will go back to the freethrow line where hes already made five out of six tonight The Bigs are starting to wear down NC States interior theyve been doing a great job of getting points in the paint attacking the rim and NC state has struggled with that middle ball screen action in the first half Applause wolf pack had played much better defense in the first half and they had the last two games last two games both teams both Wake Forest and Clemson shot better than 60 percent in the first half both of them made double digit threes for the course of the game in fact NC State have been leading the ACC in threepoint defense prior to those last two games theyve done a much better job tonight at keeping Duke off the threepoint line having made just one nine and I think Kevin Keats as long as this stays a two or three possession game can keep turquavion Smith on the bench obviously he was frustrated picking up that dead call contact Tactical Ryan young just picked up his second foul Purdue well Step By Day and hit some high degree of difficulty Shots tonight and Jack Clark puts one down transfer from LaSalle great to see Jack Clark back getting some minutes NC State will show a lot of pressure but the one thing this does too Debbie it eats up some shots when it gets him a little closer to halftime and then Striking Distance Proctor good idea hes couldnt quite connect itll be a turnover for the Blue Devils their fifth of the first half much better Pace than when they had 22 in the meeting in Raleigh quick shot from pass wont go wed hit a couple of those earlier in the half and were inside two minutes clear out everybody to the opposite side let Ryan young get to the midline young use that footwork head Bobs around dont act like he was getting knocked around and knocked one in off the window highly skilled offensively nice counter Clark started this let one fly or cell great jump stop in there couldnt get the shot now Proctor on the Run she spins and has it blocked by dewana Applause shoot till your arm falls off you have taken so many tough shots for NC State in this first half and this Texas could be Big 12 implications they are the greatest rivalry in the sport Duke and Carolina college game day will be there 10 am eastern time until 11 45 11 45 time A Reason well talk about later on in Arizona and UCLA 10 oclock Eastern time UCLA has already wrapped up the Pac12 but those are probably the two best teams in the Pac12 the conference of Champions Bills my guy we havent seen the horn set yet in the first half and John Shire draws it up about this time out Applause to create a little space got the size advantage in that matchup Tyrese has four his first field goal of the ninth a little chatter going on between pass and Proctor a nine seconds differential Dev and the shot clock in Gamecock the Duke will have an opportunity if they can secure the rebound depending on what Wolfpack does here Id like Joiner shooter absolutely they did and couldnt get that one to go plenty of time for the Blue Devils up by four roach has been a menace driving it gets into pain and he travels with it now NC State will have a chance for the last shot Im surprised that Jeremy didnt wait for the middle ball screen because hes been so effective in that all first half now NC state has an opportunity Joe kill Joyner is going to take four dribbles and get to the paint Joyner wow 25 second foul on roach now it inbound to jointer hes going to get two dribbles Applause Joyner takes one dribble oh rattled out much of his frustration and entertaining first half between two teams that got a little aggravated with one another from time to time thats the way you like it look at the blue Devils record when theyre bleeding at the break 192 this season who Devils with a fourpoint lead we go to the studio now to keep the Blue Devils ahead here at the half by four Duke will have the ball to start the second half Debbie a big deal in the first half discrepancy at the freethrow line Duke shot 17 free throws made 12 NC State shot and made one but as you saw roach was taking the ball to the basket Kyle phillipowski was devastating on the boards he had 10 rebounds in the first half Mitchell in the corner for three and thats how the Blue Devil starts for second half Mitchell made the first basket of the first half and Richard levion Smith on the floor who went oh for four in the first half I think you run something for him early and lets see if you can get him to the line or get him an easy bucket Mitchell has a Joyner answers hes had the hot hand I think a good strategy for Kevin Keith is that dark Hill Joyner feels like shooting it say yes lets do that hes got 15 now at 21 in the first meeting the other thing to play Beyond can do is we can do other things he can get an assist he can get to the glass another offensive rebound for the Blue Devils Derek Lively never turned him faced its not really his game its now 48 of his 62 field goals Proctor drives and scores yeah everything is at the rim for lively Applause hes a rim Runner a put back in the dropoff you got to put it right in his hands at the room for him to finish right now Applause Smith standing a long way from the basket he missed much of the first half after getting his dead ball pack for which was his second personal foul is now under underground jumper and Joyner couldnt quite make the catch for the flush and itll be Duke ball NC State trying to change the rhythm of the game early by picking up full court here and I think Kevin Keats has managed a little bit of foul trouble in the first half very well with his bench Jack Clark one of the guys who had two fouls in the first half was returned for Kevin Keats four pack blind pressure in the back court you always can use Lively as a pressure reliever because DJ Burns is not going to guard 94 feet doesnt hurt either Applause in its first field goal of the night first six points have been from the freethrow line its got such great footwork and I think he flips his hips so quickly in a move like that Applause Jack has four minutes to Clemson game as we mentioned with an injury good to see him back out there break the pressure easily Proctor takes it right at Burns and draws the foul DJ Burns has got to have more defensive discipline right there I mean let him have a lane to the bucket thats three on birds you just cant resist hes not gonna block the shot just get out of the way or a defensive stunt at him and then get out of the way Ive heard our good friend Jay billis say on numerous occasions you can get a basket back you can often get a foul pass wise as much as it pains me to say Proctor three for three from the free throw line tonight and while much of it was foul trouble and Smith didnt get a lot of field goal attempts just shot four times is over four Roger has spent a good deal with time guarding him and he has been a Lockdown Defender in the Blue Devils lead is the longest of the night yeah this is a really important opportunity for NC State offensively here theyve got to get points Smith trying to shake Proctor to quavion into the lane and cant get it to fall I mean it was alive but hes cleaning up the window I mean usually finishes a play like that a floater in the in the front of the rim even though Lively was there I thought he had enough on it to get it over the shop rocker Broach uses the screen and foul on the floors Jeff Kissinger is going to get Smith and thats going to be his third foul yeah turquavion is frustrated and hes got to snap out of it if NC States going to have a chance when the loss to Clemson on Saturday scores just 10 points about seven and a half below his average was just three of 15 from the floor to throw in tonight and hes just three of his last 20 Mark Mitchell meanwhile continues to be wildly efficient on the offensive incident in to double figures and Duke has a 10point lead all right cant wait on that media timeout this ones in danger of getting away Kevin Keats calls a timeout ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by Wendy two for six dollars the best deal in fast food heels he scored 20 or more 500 record as an assistant coach he won first meeting as a head coach here in Cameron back on February 4th a splendid defensive effort and how he faces A desperate North Carolina team on Saturday night a much needed Victory against Virginia on Saturday and again in Tallahassee last night with the four Acacia was avoiding a bad loss Blue Devils the highest ranked team in the net so a big opportunity for the years and a good opportunity produced to work on its seed as DJ Burns and their foul was called on the inside Applause Duke has done such a good job of mixing up their coverages on DJ Burns sometimes its a double sometimes its oneonone they feel like Lively can handle the matchup by himself but once in a while they do bring two to the ball and everyone else spaces out youve got really good Shooters on the floor nice foul Debbie was going along Kyle phillipowski who is two points away from another DoubleDouble and ten rebounds in the first half the Kissinger is over at the stores table trying to straighten something out right heres that the gentleman in stripes are satisfied and off we go there goes Burns using that big old rear end over the leaner wildly and burns scores again he is so big and strong when he gets that deep forget about it hes going to score hes got 11 and theyre playing him with three fouls and why not if you dont play burns down you dont play Smith right now this thing could get away from you might anyway but you gotta give yourself a chance heres Roach Smith has his shot blocked by Lively but he was fouled into quavion will have a chance to get on the board for the first time tonight first foul on lively roach has made a living tonight making those but when he does it guess whos there to clean up dont you very much Duke up by 10 move into that mix as well they can get as high as the two seed though that seems unlikely they would need quite a bit of help and this um conference is pretty balanced when we think that you want to get the buys for is to help with the fatigue if you can its wayvion Smith on the board with his first two points of the night Applause NC State needs to try to Speed the game up a little bit and take advantage of their quickness in the backcourt with this lineup on the floor jack Clark at the fourth something they did extremely well in the first meeting they outscored Duke 312 and points off turnovers weve done a better job taking care of the basketball tonight Phillip housing Spain defense now 11 rebounds goes off and misses again another top for Full Pass we cant get it to go lines up on the seat of his pants and here comes Jordan yeah Smith turns the corner you have to get a field goal finds Marcel in the corner thats no good cleaning up every rebound hes got 13 and Mitchell couldnt handle the pass ahead and itll be a turnover for the Blue Devils theres seven ravion Smith and Casey Marcel combined oh for 11 from the floor Debbie Burns and Joyner our 11 of 19 everybody else 5 21 now I think after the last Miss still not getting to the freethrow line effectively attempted only three free throws tonight Duke meanwhile 14 of 19 part of that is Duke has been the more aggressive teams in terms of going to the basket Mitchell is on to travion Smith Burns is back down Lively two or three times tonight phillipowski starts to run at him now DJ Nifty pass to Marcel gives it the cost who went over the thats over Lively to get a chance for the threepoint play NC state has gotten so much better playing off DJ burns with us back to the basket Casey Marcel leaves it off that is a big time play by Jack Clark thats the kind of emotional lift that NC State might need maybe thats the third foul on Derek Lively and 14 minutes to play North Carolina State down 10 just a few moments ago theyve got a chance to cut it in half after the monitor we go Applause draw help drop it off great finish by Clark played really well tonight after I believed to be a shoulder injury after taking the spills are three out of four and the goal now completes the threepoint play seven points tonight its a fivepoint game and pressure in the backcourt from the patch three Whiteheads return for Blue Devils theres Mitchell Mark with a rebound Maybe quick on that possession long rebound oh DJ wants to go to work on Mitchell he does Clark with an offensive board a press 24 NC State NC State played in that step off step up screen right there for Clark Joyner one another three ball for darkell and theyre back to within two hes got 18 my goodness Applause well he is fun to watch and he has no conscience and I love that four of eight from behind the arc against a really good Duke threepoint defense roach trying to answer Jeremy roach does it again NC state has not defended that and Jeremy roach has taken advantage all night so quick to the bucket Road gender double figures with 10 mark feeling pretty good about life but couldnt hit the three there now the Blue Devils with an opportunity to settle the frenetic Pace a bit has done a good Johnny on Smith was at the freethrow line Road we have to change their full screen coverage they keep putting DJ Burns in that hes got to stay and drop coverage you cant play any other ball screen coverage with him with three fouls mark driving this time the floater in Lively with the rebound running ahead is right here will be a timeout full pack might need it Michelle that was not an in Rhythm or welladvised shot a sixnothing run for Duke Applause youre orchestrating the play from the side hes gonna put Lively on a ball screen right here with roach because Burns cant guard it roach comes down the screen and fired the three on Joyner in a hurry for NC State Joyner he gets to the best it gets Lively in the air and it rolls out loose ball on the floor right head first to the ground to get it and its a jump ball and now theres the Rugby scrum on the bottom no one wanting to turn loose to the ball Applause right hands under there Burns Burns trying to make sure to quavion Smith who is in danger of letting his emotions get the best of him for the second time tonight being ushered to the bench by the NC State staff its been testy all night Blue Devils with an eightpoint lead 11 and change to play played football as a kid and in fact his brothers are here played in the NFL for a while Tariq had to choose basketball but he can still recover a fumble and Ill tell you this if Mike elkos in here hes going to see if he can get a he can get Tariq out there to play a little backer for him Dave Doran might also be pleased with the scrappiness shown by Joyner interquavion Smith but the most important thing jump ball play on those technical fouls and says possession arrow belongs to NC State so they get the ball out of bounds now Young on burns BJ spins back cant get it to go up on the window Burns gets it back another opportunity misses again rebound by Mitchell Jacob grandison young with the offensive rebound he just works Ryan Young does his role so well on the boards you and I were in here a couple of weeks ago and he was getting like a rebound per minute didnt get a lot of minutes but he made him count on the board for sale inside and hell go to the free throw line with a strong move lets have a look at Ryan young the grand transfer from Northwestern playing his role I mean its a twohanded rebound and he uses the rim to get it up on the glass away from anyone that could knock it away first foul on Mark Mitchell The Freshman Youngs played Seven menacing and hes got three red rebounds and scored a couple of buckets so NC State got to the freethrow line down 10 with turquavion Smith and then they pressed they got it back to two possession game miles with dewana coming on the floor in place of burns again its the speed Factor here for NC State to speed up the game I think also maybe Debbie those last couple of Misses teach has tried to keep a lemon on burns minutes certainly in better condition than hes been but playing him extended minutes can be problematic and its maybe the last couple missions that result in a little bit of fatigue thats a good defense by Duke obviously and the steal Jack Clark by himself trying to punch thats what happened in the first he didnt try to hang on to the rim thats right and thats how he got hurt in the Clemson game all right corner all over Proctor now they switched Metro goes by and a foul is going to be called great anticipation by Clark up the line doing a great job on a lateral pass and putting it away good night that foul was called on Joyner its his first Applause the Whitehead will inbound it for the Blue Devils up by seven inside ten to play final home game of the season for Duke and final regular season game for the wolf pack they wont suit us again until the ACC tournament well have a game this weekend pass was sitting on the legs just takes up the space off the bounce Jeremy roach has a dozen without 14 check that and Oh What a Night Jeremy roaches tonight young dude a good job of pushing that cloth screen way up to Mid Court turns out Brady Kiger and I were like the first time either way hes got a bunch of clutch baskets Freddies never wrong never wrong so I need to take the blame for that one of the great stats men in the history of college basketball and institution on Tobacco Road the gentleman The Scholar great Fred tiger up here working with us tonight by himself inside to the line of the crazies a chance for a threepoint play and another big double level for Kyle for Lebowski that size on the front line just wears you out look at the extra effort by the big seven footer around the rim Kyles 13th DoubleDouble he has 13 rebounds and if you can make this free throw have 13 points so he says 13s unlucky the man who chose number 30 because thats the jersey number is head coach wore when he was a player at Duke who eats a dozen does the pack have another run in him Joyner no Burns is back in hes got the offensive board he running sweeping hook and Clark is there with a tip Jack Clark active here in the second half Applause what a good job hes done tonight and hes a stretch four who can shoot the three hes got 11 points and six rebounds well they missed him while he was out and Shire is going to take a timeout here as Duke was a little clustered by the Press 10 point lead for the Blue Devil Kevin thanks a lot to be sorted out in the ACC in terms of deceiving in tournaments Kansas trying to get at least a share of yet another big 12 title tonight theyve got the Longhorns this weekend in Texas Tech tonight coming down the stretch final day of February turn the calendar to March versions of the madness will commence Proctor from the corner and young just out front Burns in terms of getting position and gets the rebound therell be a whistle on foul its going to be called on philipowski thats his third but 7 47 to play his Blue Devils holding a 10point lead Kyles only two of ten from the four but hes done a good job at the freethrow line and hes got 13 rebounds both teams with 13 offensive rebounds which is their average one of the goals for Kevin Gates without rebound Duke by 10 minus seven at the moment and he hasnt had a good night shooting at all the tendency for pers when he catches it in the middle is hes definitely going to be a passer and its much easier to double him in the middle because you can bring the double from different places Marcel was shooting over 40 percent for three coming in hes over five behind the yard tonight no for eight overall a single point rose with a runner and saying the foul occurred on the floor jarkels Joyner whistled for the foul his second Ryan Young to go back to the benches Derek Lively returned philipowski also going to take a break Lively lobbed to the rim and the kick out to rope he couldnt get the dunk didnt want to do the floater off the lob pass Emily moving screen no call and rebound by Joyner thought about picking up and probably should have and finds it sort of kicking it out of bounds but last Touch by Blue Devils so the loss to handle probably fortunate it went off the Duke foot there Applause trying to score quickly before the D gets set trying to pick up the pace Applause roach was challenged in practice to see if he can slow down Joyner nobodys been able to do that burns created some space unlively messed with him just enough to calls to miss this is where Proctor and Roach can control the rest of the game right here for Duke and John shires terrific at it calling plays with his offenses in front of his bench theyll use some clock on each possession here tonight after 22 in the first meeting Lively gonna try one to beat the shot clock probably not a good decision to give him the ball there I didnt have much choice hes not one for 12 behind the Arkham season how about that pass and Clarks going to finish Burns a really good passer the big fella makes one come out on the floor and and she stayed hanging around just down eight Applause they break the pressure robbed to Lively is too tall and itll be a turnover just after I spoke about Duke doing a good job taking care of the ball that is an Aaron pass if you throw it higher than Derek Lively can get up the camera and crazies are upset they felt like that I think I thought DJ moved underneath Lively when he was in the air they showed the recoil the board John Shire agrees with the crazies as it is an eightpoint lead and Carolina State trying to cut into it Burns in pain do something with it with a 10 and he gets one to rental home and look at that footwork foot face ball fake pivot in the middle play on balance BJs got 13 and the chance of lets go duke Music Applause doing a good job getting multiple call reversals philipowski its a turnover and the Blue Devils are turning over in the last couple of clip thats 10 now real chance for NC State just get out of the way and let Phillip let him take philipowski to the bucket yes Joyner crossed his foot and hes on the slip Hill called for the unfortunate travel and the first turnover of the second half for NC State its a right idea you dont want to bring a boss screen there because theyll switch back you get the matchup that you know you can win hounding Proctor makes him pick up his dribble roach gets free misses the Steal Blue Devils will set an offense 12 on the shot clock Proctor for three Mitchell gets position and he goes up and hell go to the freethrow line what a great crash of the boards to the weak side its exactly where you need to go on a corner triple as to the opposite side of the rim were sort of lost and its good defensive performance from duke balance scoring theyre just two of eight teams from threepoint territory theyve been winning the free throw battle right theyre getting to the line thats why they have the lead thats their advantage in this game Mitchell makes it a seven point lead coming up next we go to the fog Texas Tech taking on number three Kansas senior night there Kansas last regular season game on the road in Austin Jayhawks need a win or a Texas loss Music Bill self 17th regular season Conference Championship in two decades and Lawrence Duke is shot 22 free throws NC State has shot six six wouldnt NC State lost to North Carolina the heels shot 39 free throws an NC State shot 12 Music Applause he cant get a whistle comes away with it because thats what hes done all night 14 rebounds for Kyle throwing her heating up Proctor right there on the ball this is what NC State needs to do they need to play discipline D and one shot still plenty of time but this is an important defensive Possession It Feels Like For NC State and Jeremy roach rolls in rules increase I think John Shire trusts Jeremy Rhodes the most in the late game thats no good one and done for the pack and Duke has it 10 point lead clocks going to go inside three minutes on this possession Applause roses didnt have a field goal in the first meeting between the pack and the Blue Devils NC State was 16 000 XFile equipment Duke to the line roach Applause thats really the only thing Duke hasnt done Applause Smith you cant get it to go its been a tough night for him just two points both coming through the freethrow line hes missed all seven of his shots for third leading scorer in the ACC ENT averaging over 17 and a half points per game time is now decidedly against the visitors from Raleigh Applause bro taking charge in winning time thats Jeremy Roach Joyner its been pretty quiet in the second halfway with a rebound and North Carolina States in a lot of trouble the Devils sense that they can finish this their largest lead to the game sending him to Crazy Town Applause ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by Progressive Insurance its easy to bundle your home and car insurance at progressivecom Music Street by a first year head coach Blue Devils already with the largest lead they can add to it with Tyrese Proctor at the line by the same token the NC States going to lose its second in a row and theyll play again in the ACC

remarkable cause and its a its a speech that moves you every time you hear it I always love the part of the speech when he talks about you may not save my life but you might save the lives of someone you love or my children which it did you know his daughter Jamie is a cancer survivor and his brother Nick ran the foundation for the longest time his brother Bobs still battling its a great family the valve Islanders national championship in 1983 and they can score quickly and dark Hill Joyner is down for the second time tonight early on he got his foot caught under the scores today we took a tough spill there and theres no quit in this team Kevin Keys youre still fighting here is philipowski just picked up his fourth stops the clock gets to the freethrow line you know the Press is coming cant get beat over the top she say its going to really have to scramble right here they got their best defensive lineup on the floor Joyner is going to be shooting for his 20th point it is still a three possession game 80 Seconds to play Kevins in a stance over there trying to help his defense roach gets Pastor quavion Smith Music Applause obviously a pretty good freethrow shooting team Proctor gets in the lane misses and NC state has the ball Here Comes Smith leaves you with Joyner for three Applause and how about that here come the pack just when you think its over theyre back in it and a fourpoint game and dark Hill Joyner with 23 points tonight weve seen some crazy finishes the last week in college basketball turquavion Smith good decision right here joiners had the hot hand all night Mr quavion has still yet to have a basket but does a good job of hes got one basket Im sorry hes got one three late jarkel Joyner scored the last five points for NC State Applause you think NC State would take their chances if they knew that sir quavion Smith would have five points in the 512 to play thatd be down just four yeah I mean thats a shocking right Im really surprised your pavion didnt play and have a big game tonight and take a look at jarkel joyners numbers 21 points in the first meeting versus Duke 23 tonight and he shot the ball 50 from the floor joiners made five triples tonight and theyve had several opportunities to sort of fade away and feel as if well we gave it a good run thats a foul trouble through quavion Smith the leading scorer was off but instead in 49 seconds they Channel their inner Iowa and go on eight nothing Rodney get right back into it UNC State doesnt have any more timeouts left so theyre gonna put the pressure on you cant get beat over the top you got to try to get a steal if you can Applause Play Good d right here plenty of time to do so especially if you can make it a OneShot situation Proctor truck in the backcourt now Mitchell has it in the front Mitchell had numbers momentarily but opted to let that clock run roach will take care of it now they do choose to foul Jack Park goes out and gets Roach NC State doesnt need a three they want to get the best shot available right here they want to push regardless of the free throws 73 freethrow shooter is on the line one and one and one thing this does Debbie when we saw it Ive mentioned Iowa jokingly a moment ago and you start trading threes for twos if you can and catching up Burns returns his dewana goes back to the bench will try to do a little offense defense here fivepoint lead theres your answer with with DJ burns on the floor about how they want to play inside 233 I think there was a question about the substitution is the only thing I can imagine that had the officials confirmed briefly now roach shooting for his 20th point of the night and he rolls it in Jeremys got 20 dukers up by six Joyner step back and hes tied his career high for threes is six in the night threepoint game Applause got to get a quick turnover shot clock Gamecock virtually the same Phillip housing almost traveled with it youre gonna have to pick a guy to foul Marcel is going to foul Tyrese Proctor theyll send the Freshman from Australia to the line John Cal Joyner are you kidding me a couple of huge triples here down the stretch playing off the DJ Burns screen uses that bounce again the step back over Lively Music Applause doctors have four of his five free throws this is a one and one still two possession games thats a big one I look for a little drag screen action again and transition see if you can get a three if not gotta score quickly Music Applause number one has the basketball what a performance from darkell Joyner tonight his backcourt made off of his game in terms of scoring deal with some foul trouble and Joyner has been more than up to the test trying to rescue the wolf pack on the road Music hes three for six from two but hes made his free throws tonight jarkel Joyner uh NC State highly likely to make the NCAA tournament with these guards and quick scoring ability quickly while theyre in timeout how dangerous the team do you think they can be in the NCAA tournament you got to figure theyre going to be in that eight to ten seed range that way theyre depending on how they play in Greensboro next week they play well in Greensboro theres some brackets that happen as a seven I think that its all about guards at March and NC States got an incredible Committee of guards that can change and take over a game were seeing what theyre doing right here this is based on their speed their versatility offensively Music Smith when theyre both together hitting thats a tough combination to have to deal with Casey Marcel didnt shoot the ball well tonight either yet NC States right here two possession game point four to go lets see how quickly Joyner can get one up they dont deny him the ball so hell bring it up himself David mcroach pulling fire cant get that one to tap back and Proctor secures it for Duke what a foul gotta get to him Joyner doesnt quickly enough so 66 to go duke with a fivepoint lead and theyll go back to the freethrow line theyll shoot a pair and if the Blue Devils do indeed hang on for the last 66 the reason will be because they got to the freethrow line and they made their free throws an NC State could have gone for a quick two and try to extend the game but they went for the three foreign Proctor controlling the game down the stretch for Duke its not always how many threes you make Reese its when you make them that allowed NC State to make a run and Proctor might have just put that one away seven point lead closing seconds to cuevion and fires one only a second field goal of the night but its going to be just a little too well as Kevin Keats wolf pack comes up short and what a toughminded win for Duke they finished their 19th undefeated season at home and John Shire starts his head coaching career with a perfect 160 record
