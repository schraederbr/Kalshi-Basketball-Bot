bright spots in the in November and Ryan Matumbo he steps in for Dorian anua was away from the team tending to a personal matter tonight but Matumbo those three years at Georgetown and made his Yellow Jacket debut on Sunday and coach stamar was asked you know what led to Ryan getting the opportunity on Sunday so he wouldnt get S to the bench All Season had to again evolved as we get little bit of

games from three and itll stay with Georgia Tech Dongo fighting for position in the paint and a lob pass was it was in the air for a while Jack dodged to turnover on that one Nate George frees himself of Ace Valentine and picks up the first basket of the night an easy one for Nate George accs leader and assists hes got the first basket that was a crafty back door he used the body and change of pace

his jumper is short the other way Bryce Johnson Pulls Up Kicks out Banks Jr threepointer for Marcus Banks junor an 880 run for UNBC Ill tell you what what Ive noticed out of the gate is how hard the retrievers play Five Guys on the floor really active theyre all about 62 to 67 um and the leading rebounder on this team only at 52 per game so its a gang rebounding team and theyre going to push Pace Jaden mustaf nearly with the throw down Dongo trying to put it up the yellow jackets cant finish from point blank Johnson no look Louis Jordan another another three yes sir that is three triples right out of the gate for the retrievers and Coach Damon statamire wants a timeout an 110 run see the three the push the shot from the corner retrievers in control Music Music a Applause Music head coach Damon Stout in his second year and way that look on his face says it all that was the biggest hurdle they had against Northwestern they got down 7 nothing in the first four minutes of the first half battled back and then the start of the second half they gave up an 110 run yeah and hes a guy with a ton of experience not going to Flinch hes been in big games as a player big games as a coach uh but its time to regroup during that timeout they theyve got to match the retrievers energy here out of the gate Luke OBrien is checked in for the jackets and Bango throws it Applause down thats a really nice play out of the dead ball timeout coach staya draws it up and perfect execution get the ball to Dongo your preseason all ACC selection Lou Jordans already hit a couple of Threes tries to get

Jayden mustaf The Freshman from Buoy Maryland making his first career start tonight and hes earned that opportunity John scored in double digits in four of his last six games dropped the 11 on the road at Northwestern uh but a guy that can help uh defensively the physicality his ability to guard multiple positions uh there you see the trends first three games to the last five certainly shooting the ball his production is up uh 44 in his last five games from the field and hes been getting to the free throw line averaging over five attempts per night again not playing starters minutes as Javon McCullum come to the scores table ready to check in Bryce Johnson pops a three three cant knock it down offensive rebound odunowo so far three for five from Beyond The Arc for UNBC odunowo trying to hammer down low and theyre going to say he walked with it theres a turn Applause over dunell with some Happy Feet on that one just dragged the pivot foot dangos presence caused a little bit of uncertainty yeah dunao spent the last last four years at Columbia University in the ivy league had 18 points against Georgetown a couple weeks ago with UNBC Terry spinning and what jelly on that layup wow the Up and Under the step through covered a lot of ground too beautiful move so an 80 Run for the yellow jackets responding to umbcs 110 Applause rice Johnson gets the switch to Terry lot of passing along the perimeter odunowo trying to get open against Dongo 3 seconds to shoot Ace Valentine throws it up and gets no iron but dongle with the rebound looking to turn it over to George he

Above the Rim knocking down the Applause triple how about Lance Terry going inside and then out look at this Up and Under The Reach scoop everything how about the finish of the left and then right there stretching the floor moves to the open area in the corner bottoms nothing but net and just jackets now on 110 run over the last 2 minutes and 18 seconds of this one they started the game down 112 So you you bat The Nest you expect the yellow jackets to sting and uh thats what we got right here exactly Im not sure what coach doar said in that timeout but they have responded and jayen mustaf feeds by Dongo Dylan Thompson there in the bench breaking up the binoculars there on Dongo Javen McCullum has come in for George attack odunowo banging and Dongo deflecting ma the transfer from Oklahoma returning from that concussion he suffered fed down low Dongo underneath lays it in a Timeout UNBC jackets dominating the last 3 minutes 15 to0 run after a slow start Yellow Jackets everyones getting in on it starting at the defensive side of the ball and the tempo and momentum is all in favor of the yellow jackets that right take a look tune in zone in on that impressive I wasnt sure if it was that or if Dylan Williams was trying to use the binoculars to see the opponent you know you get that too small so often maybe made too small you need binoculars to see it either way Jaden mustaf showing a little bit of Distributing there on that that last possession he was a big recruit for Georgia Tech chose the yellow jackets over NC State Florida State Maryland and now taking on a school from his home state UNBC standing for University of Maryland Baltimore County thats one thing the yellow jackets have uh done very successfully recently in the last year under the leadership of Coach Styers the recruiting Trail theyve really upped the level of recruit and prospect that theyre number one going out after and bringing on campus um but twoo theyve secured some great gets um veteran coach associate head coach Carl Hobbs a big part of that he was Jim Calhouns righthand man at Yukon for years and the head coach at GW Devin sap Fresh Off the Bench his threepointer wont fall he and JC Harris the first subs for the retrievers Mumbo back on the floor for Georgia Tech and Duncan pal making an appearance 31 in the far corner mustaf floats it home that really is his game yeah what I what I really like about the jackets is the aggressiveness uh theyre putting it B putting the ball on the floor after a couple passes getting in the scams of the defense and moving without the ball one and done for UNBC this is a 170 run for Georgia Tech that began after coach Damon stamar called that timeout about 3 and A2 minutes in McCollum short Corner jumper buried Applause it retriever showing Zone on that trying to switch it up break the momentum it was a tougher get but jackets cooking right now another two the top of the orc dein sap cant get it and after hitting those first quick threes UNBC has missed the last eight shots and a turnover Here Comes Bryce Johnson hes got Banks with him Terry goes up Johnson Waits good Poise there from the senior transferred from Chicago State his second year with UNBC now that snaps the 190 run Georgia Tech has hit nine consecutive shots for a team that has struggled to shoot here in the early going this year thats a great Applause sign now out and running heres JC Harris and he lays it in you know missed all last season with the torn ACL hes running strong you see right there thats the tempo the retriever like to play on get a stop pitch it out two or three guys Sprint in the lanes and they get an easy Basket in transition and that was the other big concern for Coach Damon star was the live ball turnovers that Georgia Tech committed as Duncan po you can count the basket red shirt JR out of Dallas Texas Duncan pal they call him the Shag man you can see with that haircut but hes got the moves to back it up Music Music Applause right e e e they dont call him Scary Terry for nothing Lance Terry he has been fired on all cylinders first from the corner Babel and then look at this move underneath confidence is high and here this is where he takes off look at the bounce um and the team really is playing off his momentum uh the intensity that the senior is bringing Lance Terry showing leadership a perfect three of three from the floor hes got two assists seven total points and the jackets dominating the rebounds right now 136 Advantage including six offensive rebounds um and thats really been able to get Terry going and transition and pushing Tempo pal cant finish off the threepoint play UNBC mentioned they were for their first five had an 110 run hit some early threes but since then theyve gone cold meanwhile Jordan Tech hit 10 of the last 11 shots Bryce Johnson Zips it out Valentine not trying to penate gets pow in the air no call is saying Duncan went straight up Darion Sutton onto the floor for the first time tonight for Georgia Applause Tech we got an offensive foul coming here against Dongo thats the first foul against Georgia Tech tonight have Dongo probably with the hook on the right got a chance to look at this the right arm oh yeah right at the tail end nice spin move it was just he put that arm up late and hes going to get some Revenge here look there he Applause Music goes Dongo now with eight points catch and shoot Lou Jordan Splash well this is a decided Trend were seeing develop here John unb see 12 of their 17 shots have been beyond the arc georia Tech meanwhile has attempted just one threepointer through the first 10 minutes everything else coming in the paint yeah 26 Advantage 20 to6 advantage in the paint for Georgia Tech make a 226 Georgia Tech hit 11 the last 13 shots now and the foul coming there on Nate George I think thats when this yellow jacket teams at their best when theyre playing fast uh playing intense on the defensive side of the ball and you know the harder you play defensively youre going to get better opportunities and you tend not to think as much um just Georgia Tech team has some skilled athletic basketball players and in transition early offense if theyre just playing and not thinking as much uh high percentage shots I think that was the idea behind the way they constructed the roster as well you talked to coach stamer before the season feeling like they had a more athletic group this year ability to get into some passing Lanes eight seconds to shoot Jordan Jacks a three too strong you think of length and and lateral movement the ability to cover a lot of ground with the wings span and then rebounding the basketball collectively uh those are things that you know youre recruiting to that Dongo trying to catch up to OD oo but odunowo who lost his shoe he had to go back and retrieve it its five on four Pals open in an easy bucket odunowo barely made it back to half court caught that one too while he had to retrieve his shoe Laughter ret every once in a while blind scir John under nine minutes to play BS trying to bang here on Nathan George testing the sophomores metal a battle for the loose ball cols up with Applause it find some space Darion Sutton and the Freshman from St Charles Missouris got two nice lefthanded finish in traffic that possession started on the defensive side of the ball Nate George holding his ground getting on the floor and then the jackets convert on the other end Georgia Tech shooting 60 from the floor meanwhile UNBC asking whats wrong with the rim Marcus Banks unkind but Georgia Tech is now gone 14 of 15 since starting one of 10 defensively theyve forced six turnovers and converted 12 points off those turnovers so defense is really getting them going turnover there from Nate George but defense leading the offense John when this georia Tech team is at its best Nate George creating a loose ball on the other end Darion Sutton easy two in the low block Music G Music go Music Applause she Music Music f Music Applause some Wednesday night Hoops here in mamish Pavilion by Dongo leading all scorers with 10 points and look at the change that was at the 1633 Mark John when coach Damon statar took a timeout and the script completely flipped yeah and they really turned it up a notch defensively uh unselfish play theyre sharing the basketball but scoring off the turnovers they be able to convert easy buckets by forcing turnovers getting out running the lanes and then its a momentum thing you know the confidence is high uh and everyones getting in on it Jaden mustaf hes got a couple of assists hes one of five players with an assist tonight for Georgia Applause Music Tech s and a half minutes to play its Terry knocks it Loose off Marcus Banks Jr if your coach Jim fery what do you want to see your offense get back to I think number one taking care of the basketball youve got to be able to get shots at the rim and then defensively the intensity was great early on they had five guys really swarming to the basketball it was one and done they were controlling the backboard that first few minutes and since then Georgia Tech has really dominated the glass so i say rebounding take care of the basketball and then just that Collective effort theyre going to push Tempo theyve got guys that can shoot the three and score um but really against this jackets team the retrievers have to be able to rebound the basketball so far on the glass Georgia Tech plus seven they havent had many chances for offensive rebounds because they havent missed many shots Scott trying to take on odunowo eight seconds to shoot Terry spinning trying to find Space 4 seconds to shoot George a three no and Matumbo battling for the rebound hes got it Andy look at Darion Sutton flying in he draw the foul going to go against odunowo there we see the athleticism right there the length Sutton coming from the wing just a hustle play Staying active making something out of nothing and matbo had a great move there he uses his length he got a nice jump hook uh continued to develop that so two two goodlooking plays right there by the jackets front line Sutton makes the free and not that anyone needs me to tell them this but just in case yes Ryan Matumbo the son of the great and late to kimbe Applause Matumbo and really the opportunity for Brian to come back here and play in Atlanta a city where his father is universally beloved and respected I mean thats pretty special just a giant of a human being literally and figuratively um he was Ambassador for the NBA GL globally uh he was known everywhere the community work he did building a hospital in his home town home country in the name of his mother uh just a beautiful family and a sad story uh and our thoughts and prayers go out to their entire family we know its been a tough stretch coach valent or Valentine hits the threepointer K be passing away just a few months ago Georgia Tech 10point lead as we hit the 6 and 1 half minute Mark in the first half shots beginning to fall again perhaps for UNBC Dongo B up against Lou Jordan the two are banging down low help comes George only 4 seconds to shoot Cherrys going to have to create dangos got to go up with it and with a tenth of a second the shot clock gets a turnover anyway and that gets the UNBC bench up and cheering for that defensive St well the intense was high collectively and Georgia Tech did not have the awareness there you see the skip pass and the three on the other side of the basketball but right there almost a turnover a little bit of a lazy flat pass and thats where the retrievers got to be able to take here to the basketball between Louis Jordan Ace Valentine and Marcus Banks Jr UNBC they can hit three so theyre never going to be truly out of any game oh and you said it the live ball turnovers if they can stay away from that that and and its a game of runs uh the retrievers are a team that can score the basketball again averaging 92 points in their last five games moof The Freshman getting in on it that was nothing but Applause wet Marlin short short Corner no but he gets the contact get a chance to shoot a couple free throws well take a look at the jackets previous possession a nice move out the basketball no Defender there on the catch so mustaf the Freshman calmly steps up and drops it hes got five points two of five from the field got three rebounds two assists to go with it so a nice start to the game for the freshman mustaf and he hes been coming on wildly thats why he earned his first career start tonight Marlin short shooting around 55 from the free throw line this season now hes coming up a big game against Karen University at 14 points on five of five shooting he missed them both missed opportunity for UNBC there at the free throw Applause line a cutting mop goes up and right through Valen time gets two at the left you play with Nate George and move without the basketball he will find you one of the better assist men in the entire ACC theyre going to get mustaf for a blocking foul first to revisit that layup from Jayden mustaf on the offens event movement without the ball Dongo with the post pass there the feet were not quite set must did like it might have been straddling that holding Circle as well so always a tough call it was Applause close and short rattles that one in Short from Richmond California played at the canbury school his high school coach Brian B is now an assistant at UNBC Applause and theres a second free throw for short its averaging six points per game coming off the bench second leading scorer Off the Bench for the retrievers on the season so final five minutes here the first half for Tech trying to snap their threegame losing streak back here in the friendly confines of mamish Pavilion I Terry weaves into the lane kick out George a three no batted loose and thatll be UNBC basketball went off Musta nice job by Terry strong with the basketball you can tell hes a veteran guy really protects it creates plays getting into the seams getting the paint and kicking out uh jackets unable to convert but a nice possession Jordan trying to slash inside its jabbed loose and now regim montis Tunis whos just checked in with the ball in his hands now playing in just his second game returned to action after a torn ACL at the end of last season this past Sunday against Karen University Banks and he cant hit Applause it George floats it inside to Dongo quick move goes up it wont fall great awareness High basketball IQ right there the recognition Dongo getting deep for the pain touch and again Nate George get open he will find you thats the second foul now Marcus Banks Jr just over four minutes to play here in the first half this will put Dongo at the line where hes shooting 60 this year its really been feast or famine It Feels Like For by had just four points on Sunday against Northwestern but then had a double double against North Carolina in Chapel Hill a game that George Tech lost only by three I think stylistically Northwest and a team that slows the ball down their physicality theyre banging theres fewer possessions uh an easy game where you can disappear as a post player against Carolina against an opponent like tonight where the game is going theres more possessions it really plays and favors into Dongo strength hes so athletic hes long he can run rim to rim and in a game of multiple possessions at a higher pace hes super effective and you think georia Tech as a whole more effective in a game that is played faster depends who youre playing right okay got the dookies coming up but I dont know if you want to get a track meet with them yes thats a good point thats a good point Here Comes Mumbo back on to the floor thatll be this Saturday afternoon at noon right here on kems court no I think stylistically um you can go either way you got to be able to play at both Paces the great teams can and find a way to win and tumbo against odunowo step back jumper and Johnson it wont fall Luke OBrien with the rebound Lukes ankle appearing to be a little bit better not wearing the brace tonight first time weve seen him without it some time at least three four weeks and a turnover from Lance Terry a live ball turnover Johnson kick out Jaden Stone thought about a three now down the lane odunowo a little out of control and hell have a chance to regroup here Georgia Tech with a 15point lead three and a half minutes to play in the first half well be back from Atlanta in just a moment Music how Music f Music Music free throws tomor Music Music few changes for Coach Damon statamire tonight you got Jaden mustaf starting Ryan Matumbo starting and Darion Sutton getting 10 minutes here off the bench in the first two games but tonight hes get a longer leash and four points to show for it yeah what I like about that Wy is uh the coaching staff coach St shaking it up you know we dont see whats going on in practice but thats how you get that competitive play and guys trying to make their Mark and and if youre rewarded for your effort and practice uh its good to see new guys out there Georgia Tech trying to find the Right Mix and Georgia Tech without wasy Reeves tonight still battling that foot injury and then Dorian anqua away from the team tonight tending to a personal matter and a foul coming here on Jaden Applause must yeah wayy Reeves a big part of this team uh especially on the defensive side of the ball and he was playing really good ball consistently um showing up on both sides of the floor shooting percentages were up tough break and hes a big piece for Georgia Tech not just athleticism and production but leadership as well yeah just Poise you know having a guy on the floor late in a game especially on the road uh you cant put a price tag on Applause that UNBC has left a few points at the free throw line now shooting 50 and Jen McCullum at the controls for Georgia Tech transfer from Oklahoma got his first action in nearly a month on Sunday against Northwestern coming off that injury after that physical screen and Ryan Matumbo hes been a beneficiary of some extra minutes hes got 10 points on Sunday against Northwestern now hes on the board tonight yeah I love The Vision by OBrien the ability to get rid of it quick in traffic matbo took some contact on the way up Strong Finish and hit the free throw but mooff the offensive rebound a chance for a big swing for Georgia Tech MMO goes up again and fighting through contact and Coach Jim Ferry wants a timeout for the retrievers got to love that effort by Matumbo you know just Sprints in the recognition sees the smaller opponent just buries them under the rim so Georgia Tech an 18point lead well step aside back in just a moment from a cish pavilion Music Music Applause Music well UNBC they got us to a hot start John 112 in the first three and A2 minutes but since then Georgia Tech has outscored the retrievers 42 15 to get to the final three minutes of this first half and odunowo smothered by Ryan Matumbo thought were going to get the finger wag like Laughter that um points in the paint uh Wy 32 to8 Advantage for Georgia Tech and the rebounding Advantage 22 to1 just the size and the concerted effort to get in the paint and dominate Georgia texman taking advantage of the retrievers Applause so the yellow jackets Force another turnover thats the ninth of the half for UNBC thats been a problem for them at times this year but you know under coach Ferry theyve really done a impressive job of taking care of the ball despite playing at such a fast pace kick out OBrien a three yes sir and a big toothy grin there from Luke OBrien hes had trouble getting that shot to fall recently and he pointed over to the bench Im not sure if he was looking at an assisting coach or a teammate but obviously working on that corner three stretching the D he was happy about that one and Bryce Johnson hes got some poys down there the senior good Music timing Yellow Jackets just three of five from threepoint land tonight theyve done a lot of their damage inside and thats where Matumbo goes to work now on Jordan draws the foul have two free throws here at the twominute mark but Luca OBrien struggled on Sunday from three point just hasnt really been falling for him you know he came in the night shooting 27 from theond The Arc last year he was sitting close to 40 yeah it might be the you know pressing a little bit early in the season but hes a guy that you know he has a ton of starts um played over a 100 Collegiate basketball games at division one level the only player on the Georgia Tech roster with NCA tournament experience coming from Colorado so he adds a lot of value and I think hes a guy that lets the game come to him and uh expect to see those percentages go up I dont know what he and odunowo and Valentine were talking about there but we saw a confused look Luke OBrien kind of look I had in chemistry class here at Georgia Tech oh John see your first mistake is walking into the chemistry lab thats that you can just avoid that all the way lets make a Uturn I I dont think I belong here you know a lot of people dont have the guts to try though Babel so Im proud of you somehow found a way to get that degree you you Im sure you Charmed a lot of folks OBrian knocks it out of bounds into the Yellow Jacket bench he looks a little winded but part of it too you know with that ankle injury bother me I wonder if that affected his shot at all for sure I mean its a high level game if if youre not playing at 100 its tough especially getting AC play theres no margin for error got to be at Full Tilt yeah with that in mind Jord Tech has only one more nonconference game after tonight thats against alabay AM a few days after Christmas two seconds to shoot Johnson goes up and he hits it boy they missed him last year in the second half he didnt play a single conference game for UNBC they finished 6 and 10 Ive got to think having him would have led to at least a couple more wins oh absolutely coach fer said he was coming off a 31point game and a victory against American and then he goes down with that injury it was a big loss last season its now two fouls on Ace Valentine that was tough d by Terry had the left hand high its better offense like I said this is a team that can really score the basketball they will be competitive most nights in that League uh theyre going to be in games with a chance to win coach very a veteran coach hes had some rebuilds at other schools Liu he took them in a rebuild and the end of that tenure he had a couple 20 plus win Seasons couple Conference titles at liou yeah the tough of the America East it can be challenging youve got Vermont whos run that League the last couple of years they were 15 one in the America East last year you got UMass L and Bryant they also won 20 games overall last Applause year coach f is just one of the better offensive basketball minds and his teams always play hard he won 17 games at Duan and duans a program that struggled to win in in that League they were in the 810 win 17 games in that league is is is really good at Duane a valentine hits the jumper its an 18point cushion for Georgia Tech here in the final minute of the first half OBrien trying to hand it off to McCullum theres some of that defensive intensity you were talking about here from the retrievers Dongo flashes open great ball move from the yellow jackets they whip it around the perimeter lands Terry cashes it in that was pretty jackets with 53 points in the first half and again it was a slow start uh but defense picked up theyre sharing the basketball now they have 17 assists Wy 17 assists on 21 made field goals and heres a perfect example the vision look at that ball move thats beautiful thats great basketball thats Tech basketball right there if they can bottle that heading into this ACC schedule thats how you want to play Im not sure I believe this stat but since the 16minute mark Georgia Tech is shooting 88 from the floor 20 of 24 I believe Applause it final 10 seconds Valentine goes up he lays it in will the yellow jackets get a heave off McCullum did not get it off thatll keep that shooting percentage up Georgia Tech a 5334 lead quite a turnaround for the jackets John there after a rough first three and a half minutes yeah Georgia Tech shoots Yellow Jackets four and six trying to pick up a win before welcoming number five Duke into mamish Pavilion on Saturday afternoon at noon Dongo to work down low on Valentine left it just short Georgia Tech beat Duke last year at home right that they did Lou Jordan theres a three and this has been a trend for Jordan Tech theyre trying to turn around its been these slow starts to begin halves Louis ears were burning there and just comes out makes us look great ni short Corner jumper from Jaden Musta hes got nine points now in his first career start with four rebounds and five assists pretty complete game for Musta yeah thats a solid first half by The Freshman odunowo against Matumbo how hot is Lou Jordan not that Music hot Bo off Dongo taking on a second Defender there with Bryce Johnson batted Away by Matumbo but its banks that jumps on top of it a nice job by the retriever stunting uh you know pretending theyre going to come with the double Force Dongo away from the basket shooting the fade away hook Valentine Works past Terry Dongo shuts him off Johnson off balance it wont Applause fall boof steps into a three no Applause and trying to finish there Matumbo commits the foul there on Ace Applause Valentine Ace did a nice job getting into the shot blocker watch the left shoulder right there draws the contact if he went up vertical thats a block shot all day it was a nice job burying the shop blocker under the rim and absorbing the contact for the foul Savvy move by The Freshman playing good ball as well coming into this one so Valentine hits the first free Applause throw and Ace Valentine hes got a lot of DC basketball in his DNA father played at talson mother played at Georgetown his sister Tory runs track and field B talson hes averaging 14 points in his last five outings and shooting 70 from the field 20 hit of 40 in that stretch its also second in the American East with a 23 assist a turnover ratio so solid production yeah eight points tonight after 23 on Sunday against kieren University division 3 Program Terry charging it Jordan left it short and the bad ball winds up in the head hands of Bryce Johnson little Applause hesy tough threepointer good contest from mustaf and Banks its well short Marcus Banks Jr hes shooting over 40 from three this year George feeds Matumbo charging down low he gets tied up and a jump ball well I beg your pardon theyre calling a foul there on Valentine and theyre calling it at the at the base right there when Matumbo brought the ball down so its not a shooting foul theres 21 seconds on the shot clock based on out of bound situation but that is three fouls now on Ace Valentine and a poor pass from Lance Terry he and Nate George not of the same play thats another turnover for Georgia Tech its now nine so far tonight at a season High 16 on Sunday against Wester good cut Banks kicks out to Jordan W fall thats what this Georgia Tech team needs to find just the uh competitive endurance and when I say competitive Im like mental competitiveness not you know eliminating some of those turnovers and and stringing together a full game but theres no lapses hard to do theyre hard to do but at the same time I think for Jord to get to where they want to go going to have Music to so far Tech has gotten good production offensively from Nate George and by Dongo thats a good sign those two going to be critical putting up points Lance ter a deep three rebound from Dongo a fresh shot clock for the jackets tumbo puts it on the ground and its picked up by the retrievers bks dribble on a three drilled it Banks his second triple in the game and theyll need him to get hot to close this Gap hes shooting above 40 from Beyond the arc on the season definitely do damage Matumbo on the other side of the ball hes just got to keep the ball high this is a retrievers roster that theyre going to dig from the top when that ball goes in and try to tie him up George takes it to the hole and hell get a couple of free throws an aggressive take from the sophomore Nate George hes got seven points four assists tonight hoping to find his shooting stroke as Jordan Tech ready for conference play Tech in control tonight over UNBC Music Music Music w Music came Music oh Music Music one of the themes for Coach Nathan statamire following that loss to Northwestern is they needed more scoring from their point guards well Nate George he has oig tonight hes got seven points shooting 50 from the floor hes also got the four assists for Georgia Tech to have success offensively theyre going to need a lot from Nate George and theyve gotten it so far leads the ACC and assists yeah hes a high efficient player on the offensive side of the ball uh he sees the floor tremendously 34 assists 11 turnovers in those last five games know at Carolina he digs out eight rebounds uh that was a careerhigh for him so hes a guy thats going to compete and he can add value um in numerous ways you know digging out those rebounds he really does a nice job protecting the basketball as well does not give it up often Co Damon statamire knows something about playing in the back court Pack 12 Player of the Year back in 1994 so George hits both free Music throws UNBC out of the timeout Valentine against George playing with three fouls 6 seconds to shoot odunowo going up against pal and thats going to be a travel good defense from the Yellow Jack its burning the shot clock down to two seconds there before forcing the turnover you had a play very similar in the first half just lost his footing at the end right there the shuffle think hes deep enough he just goes up and just a quick release put it on the backboard a Miss shots you take that over a turnover any day those live ball turnovers really hurt the Retrievers in the first half George a three swirls it in hes got a dozen points now Tech now 60 from the on the arc its the quality of the shot theyre six of 10 from three theyve attempted 42 shots in the game just 10 threes but the quality theyre attacking inside out under one more look at this threepointer from Nate George hes hit a couple of them now tonight its that one dribble to the paint collaps the defense and georgs ability to move away from the defense if he stands still the gaps closed he doesnt get that shot high IQ play by Nate well weve talked so much about the live turnovers for Georgia Tech being a problem and for UNBC for that matter but you know coach statamire pointed out that sometimes it was just a long rebounds off bad shots that were just as bad as a live turnover and a reverse lay in from regim mantis Tunis good to have him back if youre a retriever fan made his season debut earlier this week coming off the torn ACL at the end of the season Dongo cant handle the hot pass retrievers want to run its a five onone and all it took was Ace Valentine a little bit of jelly there with the left rice Johnson may have had hit in the year here thats two finishes at The Rim high quality offense Cooney surprise me with the athleticism at The Rim he kind of hung up there and a little English on it coming off the back side of the basket moff gets a switch on Jordan and now Dongo going up against Banks whens the help going to come it doesnt Dongo cant hit the hook collaps his hands in frustration those shots have been a little harder to come by at times this year for Bob they were a year ago thats a shot thats its high percentage you know hes in the paint hes turning over that left shoulder he can knock that down I think thats why he got frustrated s smacked his hands hes like I I take hundreds of these every day yes CH Johnson takes a hard foul got Dongo in the air and then mustaf taking him down he wanted to jump ball that would have been a tough sell John its the Hollywood of the South he might be auditioning that thats a tough sell right there I Applause dont with conviction though he he was serious like I didnt touch his arm I got it I mean I was hey it was a great foul though it was a hard foul you dont let you dont let the opponent get that one up to the rim if youre going to put contact on there prevent the threepoint play you know what to say it its its not a lie if you believe it right oh he was 100 conviction in that that he had all ball well Bryce Johnson makes the two free throws regardless land Terry Javen McCollum still trying to find his SE legs after missing that time with the head injury mustaf great take this is the Jaden mustaf we thought wed see from the jump he had that thumb injury early in the season may have given him a bit of a false start but hes looking like one of the top recruits that Jord Tech was excited to get on campas you still see that thumb that left thumb is still taped up so its not back 100 but man hes a better version than he was to start the year for sure and a foul on the floor going to go against Tunis Georgia Tech continues to push the tempo playing north to south getting to the rim causing all kinds of problems collaps on that defense Baseline inbounds coming here from JV and McCollum long pass into Jaden mustaf gets a high ball screen from poell who tries to pick and roll moff tough shot still got it to the back of the iron now Bryce Johnson wants to run ahead to Tunis and great job of running the floor that time from UNBC thats thats how the retrievers play right there get a stop get out and run find the open man again a team averaging 83 points per game coming into this one Mulla gets him on the left wrist on the way up jantis Tunis from Lithuania his third year at UNBC as we said had a late start to his season made his season debut on Sunday dealing with that knee Music Applause injury and he gets both free throws lead down to 16 still 12 minutes to play UNBC has a threepoint shooting to make a run Tech with five out right now McCullum going make pardon Powell going down low under 10 seconds to shoot McCullum a threepointer off the dribble no Tunes the rebound another solid defensive possession retriever is a team that can switch everything I mean so those dribble handoffs not going to work theyre going to switch to contain Duncan pal with the block on one and Terry inside out three wont go pal trying to run down the rebound he gets it extra pass Sutton triple team down low and hes gets the foul call thatll put him at the line Georgia Tech a 16point lead we step aside here in Midtown Music Atlanta e e e e with a name like Ace Valentine youve kind of got to be a stud right John hes got 10 points tonight yeah I sure Ace 12 games seven starts on the season hes averaging 23 minutes per game but here you see his versatility to go up the bounds to shoot the three hes athletic hes a big strong guard playing against an ACC opponent hes got 10 points four of seven from the floor and again on the season coming into this his percentages are unbelievable hes 42 of 66 from the field on the season thats 63 you see that out of your post players thats dunking at The Rim eight of nine eight of 19 from Beyond The Arc thats 42 and hes got 41 assists 18 turnovers so the ratio is there and its up I mean outstanding stats only averaging nine points per game coming in I think the argument here is he could make is coach get me the ball man Im the fourth I got the fourth most shot attempts on the floor today I need I need to be number one or two the way Im playing Sutton misses them both the lead stays at 16 Here Comes Valentine Deon sap on the floor checking in for UNBC Bryce Johnson gets a step past Terry good close out and help from Powell Valentines only a sof coach Ferry found one there and thats hes going to be a big part of the puzzle as they get into the American East play and call the Ace of Hearts maybe Javen McCullum hits the backboard bottom an opportunity for Jordan te to get a few more points at the line oh a little slow getting up sun with the no looker kind of looked off the defense threw it away from the body the big man leading the break retrievers hanging around 16point game good free throw shooter at the line yeah jav and McCollum shooting over 85 from the free throw line entering play tonight that gives him three points now and theyre going to need him to pick that scoring Pace back up like it was at the start of the Season before they suffered the injury on the hard screen Collision he took against Cincinnati a month ago oh thats money at the free throw line uh The Color of Money just like youre suting tie tonight I mean thats automatic cash it in yeah let me assure you that I picked the money suit cuz there was a discount good stop by the defensive end for the yellow jackets Applause feels like UNBC might have one more run left in them its trying to pad that lead moff gives over to McCollum trying to break down Valentine comes up empty how fast does Bryce Johnson want to go all gas no breaks Marlin short lays it in 10 minutes to go that was good basketball short his ability to Sprint and catch up to the line of the ball um that pace right there is practice coach Ferry thats what hes known for his teams always score the basketball they get out and run constant pressure one more look here on that last bucket in transition right there just get out and run the lanes easy bucket at The Rim Shorts now got four points tonight and fast break points they theyve kind of been a good barometer for Georgia Techs live turnover total theyve turned the ball over 11 times today and theyve led to some run outs like that I think Techs discipline to work some clock to get points and shots in the paint that takes away what the retrievers want to do you start jacking threes and missing this is an opponent UNBC they can get out and make you pay for that so Ive been very impressed with the discipline of Georgia Techs offensive attack tonight to go inside and take high quality shots and those threes theyve made again Yellow Jackets 50 from Beyond The Arc theyre six of 12 those have been high percentage shots Bryce Johnson with a short Corner J lead down to Music 14 Johnson now with 11 points five boards three assists with the second unit on the Floor Mate George and Bango come to the score table ready to check in mum Fade Away wont fall one and done rebound to Devin sap and the retrievers Johnson and UNBC shooting 39 from three entering tonight thats among the top 25 marks in the country and Tunis cant handle the pass theres a turnover and here come Dongo and George back in for the yellow jackets well I think thats an unforced error its no your personnel I mean what no offense to coonies hes good stretching the floor and running the lanes but an ISO situation on a post pass over the top in traffic thats not the guy were throwing to um so its you know but theyve done the job on the on the backboard this half Georgia Tech had eight offensive rebounds in the first half this half only three so if UNBC can take care of the basketball continue to get the one and duns like you just said Wy they could make that one last run to to make it Music interesting OBrian out at the logo Dongo about to lose his footing down low stumbles through Lou Jordan you can see Jordan Tech missed the last five shots three two seconds to shoot George got to go up he gets it off nearly hits it OBrien on the offensive glass goes back up and draws the foul and Coach faery animated here in front of us they played such great Defense Force the bad shot just couldnt get the rebound oh he read his lips he said we got to get that I mean theyre playing really competitive good half cour defense the dribble containment you force a shot like that you just got to finish you know the inability to finish that play with the board Georgia Tech will have a chance to stretch the lead retrievers have strung together a few possessions now where really making the yellow jackets work on the offensive side of the ball OBrien one out of Applause two Lou Jordans got four threes tonight six in black under eight minutes to play here in the second half Johnson cuts loose its a long three and he drills it down to 12 we almost had him with the spear set on in between us I mean that was deep we got a headset for you come on back two steps and youre with us long range three from the broadcast table and we got a foul away from the ball but Bryce Johnson Applause point game three of three three of their last three from the field retrievers coming back in

Jordan and Ace Valentine theyve combined to hit six threes and theyve also distributed the ball quite well 10 assists combin between them what Ive been impressed with Wy is the adjustments coming out of the half on both sides of the ball for the retrievers their ability to you know come back and have a chance on this one you know theyve addressed the rebounds theyre only negative2 on the boards and theyve only given up three offensive rebounds from a turnover perspective UNBC with only two turnovers in the second half Georgia Tech has four and then shooting the ball UNBC 43 in the second half GT just four of 16 25 thats coach Ferry just getting him going in the second half just just some adjustments to hang around and you know now theyve got a possession its a 12point game were just under 8 minutes well see how this shakes by Dongo misses the front end of a one and one he is scoreless in this second half as his Lance carry chance to cut it to single digits here if UNBC hits a three instead they feed inside theres Devin sap its down to 10 and if you look at the UNBC bench everyone up assistance managers trainers the bench high energy everyone up clapping theyre really going hard right now and a turnover Here Comes Ace Valentine lays it in its down to8 with under 7even minutes to play and Damon statamire wants a timeout a 70 run over just 61 seconds here come the Retrievers look at Ace Valentine hell play some fetch Music Music you Applause Music Applause get what e Music hes been the most consistent scorer for UNBC this year Bryce Johnson 14 points tonight hes already at a season average it continues to attack uh the entire team just persistent in their attack theyre competing they never quit Trail by 20 plus in this one and now just an eightpoint game theyve got a shot 654 to play and take a look at the shooting numbers from this second half Georgia Tech 25 from the floor and theyve settled for more threes in this second half only two points in the paint after dominating the lane in the first half yeah Georgia Tech got a 20po Advantage points in the paint in that first half and thats what they need right out of the dead ball situation mustaf again his ability to move without the basketball post it find the Gap love the post pass and the cut and fill and gets the dunk Marlin short Bryce Johnsons got the hot hand he carves in skates towards the lane and kisses it off the window great scoop a 19point lead for Georgia Tech at the half down to eight George now Lance Terry short Dongo saves it but turns it right over Johnson looking to

Finish mustaf feeds Dongo the extra pass to Lance Terry Yellow Jackets need it and they got it the senior stepping up big shots and we said it coming in this one hes the guy to watch for the jackets

contest but a foul coming on Lance Terry Bryce Johnson man look at him just head straight downhill yeah one bounce on both of those possessions from the threepoint Arc one bounce and finish at the rim and then Terry the timely bucket stops the Run stops the momentum Georgia Tech needed that they had two big buckets there they had the dunk at The Rim coming out of the dead ball situation to stop the the run and then Terrys three in the corner and Marlon short is shooting just 57 from the line entering tonight is hit three of five so far will have one more coming as regimes Tunis comes back in replacing Devin sap eightpoint game I thought this one was just about over and Georgia t almost had it put away and retrievers now seven of their last seven from the field theyre defending theyre playing with high energy and still got a chance here got a sevenpoint game three possessions lead was 22 points 10 minutes ago Dongo to the hole theres Applause two like Georgia georia te discipline

tough look he left it short and here come the retrievers theyve hit nine of their last Music 10 Bryce Johnson twirling forward oh and Dongo takes a hard fall looks to be okay so the yellow jackets get the stop well they try and kill a little clock here hold on a whistle were they checking for an injury is that do they think maybe Dongo was still down what happened Applause there 24 seconds Jordan T got to get the ball in suppose they were just stopping to see if dongle was okay inadvertent whistle something like that going to need an explanation on that nope they can take it under two minutes on this possession before they have to shoot inside Dongo jams it home huge Bucket from by Dongo and great vision from Nate George miscommunication by the retrievers I think half the team was playing manto man half in zone they left Dongo wide Applause open lead is back to eight weve got a Applause foul thats a tough call for OBrien off the ball theyre going to have him holding look at this block from by Dongo though that knocked the wind out of me that fall he broke that just I tell you it was close to he came right back though huh with that finish he sure did hes lucky his chin didnt hit the floor first thought that was about to happen hes okay and the thud when he hit the ground missing the front end of a one and one and that is Georgia Tech basketball Louie Jordan a 90 free throw shooter just missed the front end o thats a tough one retrievers put themselves in a position to cut it to a two possession game just couldnt convert at the line and Nate George brings up the Music Applause floor Yellow Jackets theyve lost three in a row theyve got number five Duke on sun or Saturday they need to close this one out Luke OBrien a three and he swirls it home hes two for two tonight both from long range Georgia Tech done a nice job finding and the open Shooters in the corner tonight Valentine from the free throw line tough shot and he sinks it and Coach Perry wants a timeout down the nine but Luke OBrien hes been selective tonight John yes he knows his role and hes again a guy that has over 100 games under his belt NCA tournament experience hell knock down that shot and then Valentine great looking sophomore in the American East hes going to be tough to stop you can put the ball in his hands he can go off the bounce uh Supreme competitor and has a lot of confidence with the ball in his hand had so much arc on that shot it left the frame lost sight drop so 8273 a minute 6 30 seconds on the shot clock are you playing this straight up if your UNBC do you you foul once they get into the half court how do you play it Im going to play extremely aggressive uh you know if you pick up the foul and they got to make free throws just know who youre fouling but Im going to make two hard traps really get after it swipe for the basketball anticipate that next pass you got to try to force a turnover um but the clock is your enemy so one or two hard traps if you cant get it I think you got to stop the clock see coach Jim Ferry began his college basketball career as a player at Keen state division three worked his way up from coaching division three Plymouth state division 2 ad Applause Deli and then number of head coaching stops including a couple of tournament teams at Lou hes coached in this building before he brought Duane down here about 10 years ago and lost in a similarly close game they had the early lead but Jordan Tech came from behind yeah he took an Liu Brooklyn team that you know 2002 to 2004 they had nine wins eight wins when he finished that run in 2010 to 2012 he had a 27 win season 25 win season so Terry gets the ball in on George they had him trapped near the Baseline but an early foul its going to be on Marlin short itll be Nate George at the line so fars in tonight n two for two hes shooting comfortably over 80 this season and it will be a one and one coming here for George at a deli coach had a sweet 16 appearance Two Elite eight appearances Liu Brooklyn two NCA tournament trips and at Duan they were in the CBI second round so hes hes LED three different programs to postseason play now facing a 10point deficit George big second free throw coming up hit them both well thats going to improve that percentage that was below 60 for those two free throws for Nate George for georia Te as a team tonight the final minute ooh tough contest Nate George swallowed up Valentine on the other end Al you moff brings the house down and Georgia Tech back in firm control Jordans three oh that was pure 10point game but Georgia Tech Nate George giv the assist and mustaf take off head at The Rim 16 points and eight boards for Nate George or Tech they could use a few more kns like that from him also got two steals only three turnovers Jaden mustaf and his first career start 15 points five boards and five assists must be a pretty good feeling for George when you got you know a guy like mustaf running the lane or Dongo or Terrys even in high flyer you just throw it near the rim those three guys got some bounce yeah wining doubt throw it Above the Rim well go up and get it heres a little reset for you UNBC out of timeouts orex got a couple more Nate George strung together a nice game here 16 points hes got eight assists in this one leads the ACC an assist per game just Applause sophomore Hoff looking for George gets it into him race at the sideline Hees it by McCollum makes the catch great play by Javen McCollum hes fouled a great free throw shooter credit UNBC the retrievers coach Ferry you know his teams play so hard and they come out they make the appropriate adjustments at the half uh and then had this down to a two possession game so team that as they go into the American east conference theyre going to be uh pretty impressive and for a team thats about to begin a fivegame road trip bringing this on the road is a really good sign for Coach Ferry colum misses the first free throw the yellow jackets this meanwhile is a start of a four game home stand theyve got Duke on Saturday weve mentioned Alabama AM a few days after Christmas then New Years Eve theyre going to battle with Notre Dame and if you know one thing when Georgia Tech and Notre Dame play here in Atlanta itll be a one possession game J McCullum hits the free second free throw hell head to the bench by Dongo comes in to protect the rim Applause Georgia Tech has enough Talent if theyre playing at home and theyre playing you know their aame they can win against any opponent so a chance to get some more momentum back that they had earlier in the year Valentine off the top of the backboard he gets it to fall you want to talk about touch and George is fouled and this one was off one of those final four banners up in the rafters Music out of the frame again he likes that high arc touch man thats Elite finish in traffic over the big seven of 10 from the field 16 points you like him huh yeah hes going to be Im not sure if well see him in a retrievers uniform next year the way college basketball is now hes a hes a great get credit the uh coaching staff to lock him up in the American East hes a goodl look player for get the free throw its back to a four possession game baring any bizarre fouls but for a valentine you know hes from Columbia Maryland thats right in umbcs backyard went to Mount St Joseph thats practically next door to the retriever campus didnt have to go far to get him Jordan another three and theres the foul on Lance Terry thatll put Jordan at the line for three fouls and look joria take up by 11 here with 22 seconds left you feel pretty good but Damon statamire you dont want to see anybody fouling in this situation absolutely not thats again I I said that competitive endurance you know your ability to compete for 40 minutes and then mentally string it together as well and thats where most teams are a work in progress uh its tough to do that for 40 minutes but thats certainly a play right there where you said Wy you dont want to foul in that situation yeah Bobby kman actually had a turn for that 40minute intemp youre talking about it was the John Babel Music Applause Factor but in all seriousness theres a long history of a lot of Jord Tech players playing those 40minute games you think of Lethal Weapon 3 Stefon Marbury can they wouldnt come off the floor that was coach kems philosophy he had the barries John Barry drewberry Matt Haring Mark Price some of the greats jump ball here only got one of the babes now and know we got a foul coming here beg your pardon its going to be on Tunis I knew coach FY years ago he was a young assistant at Bentley for Coach Jay Lawson was in my high school gym in North adabor Massachusetts recruiting well see the foul off the ball good luck ripping it away from Terry physical guard Lance a little quieter here in the second half had 10 points in the first now got four here in the final 20 Longo comes in this one just about salted away for Georgia Tech theyre going to snap their threegame losing streak and theyre going to do it putting up over 90 points here on their home floor as tunise to the hole and one and Luke OBrien hes frustrated himself didnt feel like he F like he was trying to back out of the way going to see it right there downhill hes had a nice game at The Rim finishing in traffic right now retrievers 48 points in the second half theyre plus 10 theyve defeated the jackets by 10 points in the second half and now theyre knocking on the door of their scoring average for the season at 83 George with the rebound can he break it across midcourt UNBC bench doesnt want a foul JV and mccullums going to be able to dribble it out and the three game skid is a thing of the pass for the yellow check its Georgia Tech picks up a 91
