Music yeah because its coming a couple of Wednesdays from now right back into ACC action itll be Notre Dame first on the docket with the win already against BC off we go from PNC Arena Detroit Mercy we told you 0 and 12 0 and2 already in League Play In The Horizon League theyre one of three winless teams remaining in the country along with Georgia Southern and Mississippi Valley State theyve dealt with a lot of injuries this year theyve had all different kinds of starting lineups there is some Talent on this team and thats one of the guys averaging double figures Marcus tankersley the sophomore has had a breakout here this season as we check out the wol pack starting lineup with horn and burns as we said in a fourth straight start for the only freshman on the roster Dennis Parker Jr Good Applause Start passing through the net and Jaden Taylor left it short rebound cleared by Eduardo Delia check out the starters for Detroit Mercy as well big news today no Jade in stone for a second full game he suffered an ankle injury on Monday hes the senior from Australia at 19 points per game and also know Ryan Hurst a freshman who had just debuted his first couple of games collegiately being held out today for precautionary reasons with a foot injury as MC manal scores in Rand off a 4 nothing start for the Titans Keats cant be happy with this group right now these Christmas games right you know right before the break are so difficult because guys are ready to go home you come out slugish you want to get this team and hit them in them off early and so far Detroits coming out with a bunch of energy so DJ burn starts the scoring for the pack 90 seconds in big Advantage for NC State on the inside the defensive end the floor is where they want to continue to impose their will in this game Burns commits the foul on Kyle agreer Mike Davis is the head coach of Detroit Mercy is sixth year at the helm remember he spent a long time at Indiana both as an assistant and then as a head coach who succeeded the late bob Knight went to the national championship game in 2002 but of course hes going to have to go without Jaden Stone again today as we said Randolph and this team was struggling with Jaden Stone but without him I mean its just difficult you know sleding because you dont where your offense is going to come from and I think thats going to be tanker Les got got to be the guy thats got to score well and you see that guy Ryan Hurst that freshman who came in it was just one rebound away from a double double to start his career and you loseing bodies left and right and Mike Jes Mike Davis just shaking his head he doesnt know what to do with this group right now he wants to keep everybody together and just get ready for conference play you asked him if he had experienced anything like this and he said simply no he had one really tough year he said at Texas Southern where they had a really difficult schedule a lot of injuries but he said even that didnt compare to this as horn missed the shot from the outside and the pack finds itself down by four early on first couple of minutes from Raleigh long three goes on the wing and how about this start for Detroit Mercy tankersley knocks it down and Kevin Keats needs a timeout already back in 30 after Music this in 20 years when you look at the beautiful life youve built for your family youll realize it started with the choices you made today the time is now to act on your love connect with an agent who can help you reach your financial Music goals told you this has been unprecedented as far as Seasons go for Mike Davis and that theyre one of one one of three winless teams left in the country and how about this theyve had one lead of more than two possessions this year they had a 10point lead against Ball State this is now the second game in which theyve led by more than six points but that is shortlived as DJ horn sticks a much needed three for NC State yeah I think thats one of the most remarkable stats Ive ever seen I mean this late in the season for a team you know not to be leading in a game mmel moved it underneath the hoop and then a traveling violation on the perimeter and a turnover on Jamal pink year seven for Kevin Keats he told his team eight and three he said to us look all three losses for us are against top 25 teams because ol Miss is now 25th in the country BYU of course 17th and then Tennessee who the pack just saw on Saturday eth in the nation and hes right I mean we talk about so much and then well get into the ACC and the national coverage of the ACC and ke has done a heck of a job with this group and theyve been right there in that Tennessee game that was right down to the last four minutes of the game before it got away from him Michael lonnell short but run down by cam Woods in his third game and we told you NCC getting back to the full arsenal heres horn driving on the Baseline for two weve seen this consistency from NC State and I think one of the things that that Kevin Keats wants to get out of his group is getting these guys nonconference schedule to be more dowed in and ready to play and not take opponents likly DJ horn here just getting in it off the penetration again sizes his Defender up drives No resistance at The Rim finishes and this is going to be critical because allows them to set their offense so whenever in state can attack you quickly they want to get into their full court pressure and thats what theyre best at a team that doesnt turn it over a whole lot one of the best in the country again like they were last year in that regard and we know of course NC State under Kevin Keats loves to run Eddie Delia draws a foul on the drive the grad student from Italy now Randolph what do you make of where NC State is at this point at 8 and3 coming off a win against St Louis here on Wednesday and headed back toward league play after this well I think the first thing is you got to get your break over get your guys back and get them ready and get in practice and I think one thing weve seen consistency in a nonconference schedule this group is not the Killer Instinct isnt there the entire way they and in nonconference schedule they kind of you know just like this game they slept walk early in games and then hes had to burn time out substitute jump on his guys you would want more leadership out of your guys to come out and and take advantage and of of of their talent on the team like this and enforce their will they havent done that in nonconference play but theres a lot of depth and a lot of moving part right now getting cam Woods eligible now MJ rice coming back and well get into these guys but youre implementing two big players that wasnt there to start the year with you guys and thatll take some time to get used to it woods and rice both on the floor right now for Woods his third game for Rice his fifth game as he drove it but had it blocked by Michael Oaks a freshman who just enrolled a couple of weeks ago and hes playing in his third Collegiate game 20 and blue tankersley draws another foul and hes been aggressive and assertive early on for the Titans for an 0 and2 team this Detroit team will surprise you because they play hard I mean you watch their games they are competing in their last game against Central Michigan they were down 15 in the first half they came back and took the league in the second half of that game so this team is has no quit in him and next Friday well have a mens basketball double header right here on acc Network Miami hosts North Florida at six then the 11th ranked tar Hills coming off that great win against Oklahoma they take on Charleston Southern to cap off the calendar year yeah and theyre up by five in the first four minutes despite all the struggles despite the Dozen losses for Detroit Mercy Ben Middlebrooks on the receiving end from a slick feed from Michael okono Michael okono great job coming off that ball screen find a Middlebrook unguarded underneath the rim great great ball screen called by Keats and great find there by the Stanford transfer 12 in white graduated from Stanford in 3 years with his degree in economics and hes out on the perimeter on MC man seal gave it off to Oaks on the Block banging with the physical middle Brooks back to Oaks shot clock winding down on Detroit Mercy up top Manel with two and nowhere to go and a shot clock violation nearly forced as horn pulls it Music away thats the way the wolf pack want to defend you know they want to get out spread you out fight through ball screens make you take contested jump shots there horn a deep one knocks it down continuing his hot streak from behind the threepoint line there hes feeling that T quavian Smith offensive role for this group and hes starting to settle in and you said it right in the open Randolph that hes been shooting it better and you see the note in the bottom of your screen top five of the ACC and threepoint percentage 14 of 20 three from deep and his last handful of games coming in he leads the break the pack running with rice for the lead this is the pace that Wolfpack want to play both ends of the floor pressure the ball extend their defense 94 ft when they score and get it and go and on the defensive end get through screens continue to push it seven zip is the run for NC State Oaks on the heck and pop comes up empty from Three Horns continuous hot streak as hes coming out early here knocking down shots showing you why hes been so hot from the threepoint line if you Contin on hes handing out bucket Christmas more Christmas everyone DJ horn has started to cook from three Kevin Keat said this was yesterday starting to shoot the ball well it just took some time we said why he said well first time DJs life he had to play a little defense so it just took a little time to get used to that to go along with the offense I can relate to that it takes some time you know you exhaust so much energy on the defensive end of the floor takes a while to get your legs up under you and he has figured that out now 16 of his last 23 good passing to rice from mdle Brooks now here comes the full court pressure this is what you want to do now not many teams can do this and this is the danger when you start playing mid major programs is that their Center allows them to break the Music Press Eddie Delia whos a great passer he got the rebound and then he turned it over to cam woods but being able to use Del cardio as a point point guard to break the Press its just unique and thats something that NC State would not see in the ACC play here horn on the Baseline says why not with a away and he is feeling it hes got 10 of the 18 for the Applause pack he is heating up midrange shot there from behind the line showing you hes so much more than just a threepoint shooter this is Donovan totally a guard Off the Bench who is not shy to shoot and hes got some game as well a sixthe senior whos at his fourth school now and hes missed some time this year due to both injury and coachs decisions well you also know Mike hes another one of those guys pick pick on you about those DMV guys mhm Maryland Guy totally eight in blue here he is on the drive with the left hand and it rolled off to Woods whats accelerates and got fouled by totally from behind you think about Detroit Mercy being down by four right now we told you how rare a big lead has been for him this year a season in which theyve kind of just endured everything theyve had 11 different players start at least one game this year only Eddie decadia for Mike Davis has started every single game they had a player unfortunately get in a car accident and otan yakovich is still out with concussionlike symptoms from that theyve had their bus breakdown multiple times including this week where they were stranded on their bus for two hours just hours before their game against Central Michigan its kind of how the year has gone for Mike Davis and so somewhat eye openening to be within four here against NC State it is and lets not forget Alex C cko you know to transfer from Rhode Island in previous of Alabama and he had to go back to France because of Visa issues so theres just so much that Mike Davis has had to deal with and to his credit these guys no matter who he has put in the game has continued to compet yeah he is optimistic about getting back toward full strength when they dive back into Horizon League action DJ burns on a turnaround puts the lead at a half dozen for the wolf pack message sent to DJ Burns and the starters there taken out of the game early to get back in got to compete on the defensive end of the floor off the takeway Taylor hauled it in Horn Jacks hits everything coming up DJ horn he check DJ horn with a quick 13 points here just on fire from behind the Y knocking down his third three in the first half Music here hes almost matched Detroit Mercys output of 14 horns got 13 as dadia gets the role the 24yearold whos now playing at his fifth different College we told you the only guy who started every game well thats going to be with quite a few kids welcome to the landscape of college basketball today the Cadia had a double double against Old Miss that was a onepoint loss for Detroit Mercy a good showing for them on the road against the rebels heres that point forward delaia got Stripped by burns the pack runs Taylor ho can knock it down and delaia clutches the rebound interesting to see Detroit so on a made basket theyre using their Center dadia to bring the ball ball up to alleviate the full court pressure that NC state uses with their guards and then when a Miss shot when they can run then youll see them Outlet it to their guard so great to see its a unique package that not many teams are able to do and this is why mid major programs give High major teams such a difficult time tankersley stayed patient underneath he scores again and Marcus tankersley is up to a team High 8 points with Detroit Mercy hanging around within five and doing just that against a high major team in NC State ters Le has to have a a high you know 20po game I think to to keep Detroit Mercy in this game hes the guy that has the ability to go there are these guys as in Uncharted Territory as far as offensive loads in responsibilities well after another DJ horn bucket Detroit Mercy takes the timeout horn has 15 R off another one its DJs C we say and another one from DJ H Ive always been big on having a footwork I feel like you know playing in the post is something that people have kind of shot away from and its something that Ive always embraced and um I feel like its made me different I would say I watched a lot of hakeim Elijah Juan um growing up I just happen to um end up with the Zack Randol build the always quotable DJ Burns and uh by the way speaking of hakee alijan his son Abdullah alijan is on this Detroit team and the dream of course with f slam of jamama ran into the pack famously in 1983 which is one of the best memories for NC State fans yeah you know youre good when youre known by one name I looked his name they didnt even put his dads name in a book they just said the dream when you know when you got a name called The Dream you were good and his dad is one of the alltime greats and how good is DJ Burns you you love him youve told me that hes your favorite player in all of college basketball he is he is for so many different reasons I think his personality and who and what he is I mean hes just so lovable guy but in honesty I think he plays the right way hes so unselfish and he just has great hands great feet you look at him and like he saids you think hes you dont think of him in the same breath as he claimed in thean you think Zack R and hes just a fun player to be around and and his Joy the way he plays the game is just a great thing to see how about the finish from Donovan totley totle comes in just gets to that dominant hand and gets in there and finishes and he hes really quick hes a handful he he has extra speed that many dont dont realize that until you get in front of him and he has the ability to get by guys really good floater and ability to finish in the paint be difficult task for these NC State guards of keeping him out of the paint one of the many transfers brought in by Mike Davis for a Detroit Mercy team that last year lost all five starters from that group including Antoine Davis the number two scorer in NCAA history burds going to work scoring over the top of a double there he is Mike hes going to make me put my my shades on in a second now he gets another bucket Im might have to go to the shades to rest of the game I got M as well were ready yeah we got to be ready Manel from the corner short rebound cleared by dpj Dennis Parker Jr Music Parker Jr talented freshman out of John Marshall High School in Richmond virgin bur throws a fast ball and Horn who hits another DJ horn one DJ to another and I think that going forward when you watch this NC State team is thats the difficult part of guarding DJ Burns you dont want to leave him oneonone in the post because he plays at his own pace but hes just such an elite passer he starts the break here to Horn three on two the Finish from Applause Parker this s State group gets from one end of the floor to the other as quick as any team in the country DJ Burns gets it on that post and he just fires it across to horns and he knocks down the three just another one he just continuously Pours Down threes here whats up and pass as well out of single coverage or double teams and Randolph weve asked him in the past he says yeah for sure if I were defending myself I would double team myself and Kevin Keat said the same its just a difficult task because hes an unbelievable passer and so you dont want to double him because as you saw there hes going to fire it out to an open three so you have to decide how do you want to defend this team do you and do you have the ability to have a Defender guard him oneonone I mean that thats the difficulty of guarding him and why I think he is the most important piece to this team Michael Connell pulls it up and you would do the same right just to be clear you would double and take your chance with the shooters no I would I would leave him oneonone I I would die a slow death of trying if if I had the bodies and I think thats the key because if if theres something that could bother DJ is the the length but I would have to have multiple bigs that I can throw at him the way this team play plays their Pace on the offensive end if they knocking down threes I think theyre extremely difficult to beat and theyre off to a hot start from behind the Y here in the first half of this game J Taylor Short on the first hey the all ACC holiday special Comes Your Way Christmas morning celebrate the Day in the holiday season with the ACC mascots all starts at 600 am eastern runs every hour through 400 our way of saying thanks to you our viewers stay tuned because weve got our top five Christmas movies coming up later during the game yeah you dont want to miss that I think they all like mine a lot better than yours but well see well let well let the fans vote on that okay thats enough out of chers someone mute his microphone NC State by nine seven to go first half Kyle agreer was looking for somewhere to go found M manal gives it off to ler the veteran bounces down low and a strong finish underneath nicely done by Tyre Davis the J transfer the son of the longtime NBA veteran Ricky Davis what a player was Ricky Davis was I mean he was talented such an elite athlete as well thats one of the things that NC State 2 is defensively is adjusting to is they theyre playing with four guards and one big and when Middlebrook rotated over sometimes its a smaller guard having to rotate over against a bigger Defender and there one thing they have to figure out right now which rebound against with the small with the small ball lineup Davis had done a good job defensively the last possession the other end of the floor on Middlebrooks and then turned over picked Off by Taylor and he is Elite defensively hes fun to watch on film I I mean the way he gets after it and puts pressure on the ball I think by the end of the year youll youll hear his name being mentioned in the defensive player of the year I mean he is NC States best on ball Defender no questions asked is what Kevin Keat said to us with that descriptor for Jaden Taylor good drive by Jale pink and a much needed bucket for the Titans to hang around within seven inside of six to go until halftime here in Raleigh its not a lot of Rim protection for for NC State right now so the choice just driving at The Rim getting a lot of lot of touches in the paint and putting pressure on them Second Chance bucket for Ben Middlebrooks the Clemson transfer gave good minutes Wednesday against St Louis with nine points and five rebounds and Kevin Keats was pleased with him hes such a perfect compliment to DJ Burns I mean he comes in more of a defensive mentality youll see him Hees up on that ball screen there and just great defensive he on ball there he is a guy you said will be in the discussion for ACC defensive player of the year the butler transfer Jaden Taylor just great anticipation here on the week side just gets it and you know comes down Id like to see him get up and play Above the Rim and finish that something that Mike Monaco would do one of them windmill jams or something like that but he didnt had that in his game yet Mike well get you down there and talk to him about that and then hes just dogging his man at midcourt as well forces a tie up and the arrow points to the pack he does I mean he spend so much energy and thats whats been so impressive about him hes been able to be so productive on the offensive end of the floor and and and they switch rols like horn is more of the natural score like Taven Smith was and I think Jaden Taylor is more like Jo Jon as far as his ability to score but lead on ball def roll out on Mohamed diara the mou transfer just into the game off the bench for Kevin Keats heres totally slashing and he draws a foul on diara or rather tankersley on the drive now di is different and unique and hes that other big that can provide some Rim protect so he hes able to block shot that time gave up the angle great job by tinly get using his body and shielding him off and drawing a foul but Muhammad di can protect the rim and I think thatll be a key role for him if he can provide with the pressure that they can put with their guards if he can provide protection thats just an added boost to this wolf pack team we talked about the dynamic of horn and Taylor loved what Kevin Keat said to us about Jaden Taylor they had a conversation this year where Kei told Taylor that he would have to sacrifice some offensively to become there to your point Jarel Joiner but Kevin ke said that Jaden Taylor its going to come back to you as you get the flections because he can really harass guys and it pays off then offensively well hell be rewarded also with that at last we saw the Highlight before he got the passing Lane was able to get down and get the steal but hell create pressure and then when they throw it and his teammate still hell be able to get up get a lot of layups but itll work itself out the ball rewards you when you defend like that Dis got a chance at a threepoint play thats a great job there catching it in traffic and finishing and that thats his role just set screens roll hard to the rim and if a guard rotates on you just got to finish over guards and like I said his of the three bigs that they have finishing in the paint but more importantly Rim protection is drs role with this group 6 10 red junor from France couldnt stamp it remember he had the big game against Boston College eight points and eight 18 rebounds as he commits the foul out on Delia what a what an option for Detroit Mercy to have is having the center bring the ball up against pressure you know teams just cant do that so when you when youre wondering what bothers why theyre upsets in the NCW tournament this is why because when NC State gets in the conference play no one else on this schedule have they played where they can use their Center and when you get into these mid major games in that first round this is what you face a Center a 68 guy with some ball skills thats probably more of a small forward a power forward in your power five or power six lead and this is what part of those upsets that you see youre saying because at the mid major or low major level theres less size so you have often times along with that more skill in your front Court guys your Center your power forward think about that the cuz what happens when youre Center is able to bring the ball up like this and attack the pressure that means on the back end you have a guard thats attack in your rim and and able to score so theyre able to break the press and get down and attack and score thats just a difficult thing because most teams dont have that option their guards are up taking on the responsibility to pressure great job just like this rebounding against pressure taking it up attacking in state making NC State pay for pressing them full court thats what Donovan totally did and hes got seven to go along with the Dozen for tankers Le Woods missed it tried to haul in his own misu and then back the other way its Manel pushing kicking the three off Target from deep and delaia runs down the Miss from Pink and this CCU State team isnt great rebound theyre theyre theyve been out rebounding quite a bit this year and even on average theyre just almost even for the season oh that one bounced underneath and it found the arms of Abdullah aluan the dream son and hes got the bucket to make it a fourpoint game late in the first half scouting report against NC State is you want to make these guys play in the half court and when you score you can do that foul is called on the floor here against Detroit Mercy Abdullah aluan had the bucket we got a good one going here in the first half happy holidays from Raleigh NC States up by just four on windless Detroit Mercy you know Mike Davis has had some outspoken moments this year kind of venting some frustration as you would expect with the record where it is for the Titans hes talked about being fed up and having to spend time having what hes called counseling sessions with guys theyve left players at home on certain trips including against Old Miss when he told us today they only traveled 10 guys and ended up losing that game just by one and here they are in Raleigh trying to make it a one possession game as delaia moves it pink Jacks it and comes up short from deep and okell runs it down for NC State horn wants another hes got four threes already this half and its been that kind of season Randall for Detroit Mercy he says weve had to get that mess out of the locker room at times this year well you got get it right at the end of the day in the Horizon League its a one bit league so its a about it all boils down to winning the you know your conf tournament and when youre losing like this you cant accept it and I know its frustrating youre talking to a coach thats a runnerup national champion hes won hes been very successful in his coaching career as you see here hes won 100 games in three different schools and not many coaches have done that and hes accustomed to winning so this is incredibly frustrating to him and his players and you have to hold everybody accountable I know its frustrating and thats what you got to continue to do to to make sure that your guys are not not throwing in the tow how about how hard Eddie delti is playing he lays it in after the steal and hes got seven points seven rebounds and a theft to make it a twopoint game hes been really solid right now I think the confidence of knowing that he can break the press and not much being you know resistance for him and hes comfortable doing so 70 run and he commits the foul though his first matched up with Burns a five guy who can bring it up and who can also do this yeah not many of those this is what we talked about thats an issue you know again High major level youre expecting big to kind of relay on the back and allow the ball to go inside not many centers are up in the passing Lane and again we talked about that thats the biggest advantage of what upsets occur because you got a center thats mobile like that and skill like that they did a survey and practice earlier this year and he rated as having the top motor on the team Taylor drivs got his own Miss and followed good sign ofc State again because they dont rebound they dont overpower or overwhelm you with their offensive rebounding so any type of offensive rebounds they get are just part of it this is what they got to hang the head on creating confusion and disruption on the defensive end of the floor and they do they force a turnover in the corner and get possession back with 108 to go for Kevin keatss team headed toward halftime forced Detroit Mercy into you see eight turnovers here in the first half oconnell whips one to the corner for Taylor no dice burns the offensive rebound and then threw it Music away move for Donovan totally straight on about a 20 second difference between game and shot clocks and he just coughed it up with the handle rice went up for a jam and got fouled by Tyrie Davis when you try teed up I think he just got teed up for looking down at MJ rice yeah I think theyre going to get him for that great hustle just a careless turnover you make one mistake you dont want to double down and create two and just frustration there on Davis you just you lose you have a car just turn over there then you come up and make a foul which is okay and then you double down on it and standing over top of a Applause player yeah you can see him there after the foul he kind of goes back and yells and stands over top of him there and draws the technical foul standing over and yelling is going to get you a Tech every single time yes oh I would you have to and that that your team is right here this is the kind of mistake you dont want to make you know you were down four points theres a careless turnover there and again you just want to make one mistake you dont want to double down make another one and youre okay with the foul you dont want to give the layup but then when you turn around there and get the technical foul for taunting and youre in this game so theres really no reason to be frustrated and you think about Detroit Mercy being within four of NC State and ACC team that went to the NCAA tournament of course last year and if youre Detroit Mercy you already have a onepoint loss against a power conference opponent in their building in Miss every point is crucial when youre winless on December 23rd it is and and youre talking about an 0 and2 team against an NC State team that plays with this pace and plays with this amount of pressure and theyre right there in this game with 31 seconds left before half and critical mistake there that could potentially you know obviously pushing this lead further away but theyre still right there and this Detroit Mercy team is this is the 10th Road game that theyve played so far the 13 games and thats a lot of suitcase and Luggage travel there and a lot of bus trips and that wears on you as well and they have their next two games being on the road with I UI and Purdue Fort Wayne so this team will have again 12 of their first 15 games will be on the road before they get a home game in conference play and that thats a lot well DJ horn made both now MJ rice to the line for his two Kansas transfer who of course as pack fans know as a McDonalds AllAmerican ranked 33rd in our ESPN 100 didnt play the first month of the season the first eight games rejoined the strength and conditioning staff in the last week of October and now good to go yeah he and he and DJ horn both sided it they wanted to come back home coming to NC State to play both guys are from the rally dur Mar and Coach ke is happy to have them about a two second difference between game and shot clocks here with the margin at seven for the wolf pack up on the Titans totally off the delcat a ball screen Middlebrook shows totally kicks aluan cant connect tough shot and that will sound a horn should not take us to halftime there should be about a second left or so for NC State really good job defensive possession there by NC State staying between the ball the ball man and basket and being able to take a contested shot there so great possession take it down to the end of the shot clock and thats the possession type of Defense you have to play when youre not forcing turnovers then the Brain Trust of Roger SS and Bill Covington Jr getting the situated here with a couple of all important seconds here at the end of the half well pack will take it a halftime they lead 4336 on Detroit Mercy whos been very game here in a first half in which they missing so many different guys we talked about J Stone average is 19 not being available he has to pick up and cover that I think he gets into the mid 20s and for NC State forcing turnovers and not turning a ball over is the KE their entire season because theyre not a great rebounding team and even now theyre theyre minus three against mer you know Detroit Mercy so as they contining into season theres something to keep an eye on we start the second half from PNC and tankers Le throwing up a floater hes confident with that shot normally but he left it short and morcel starts it back the other way for NC State got the 20 from horn nobody else with more than six that was from Burns Parker no and a rebound initially hauled down by MC Manel but ripped away by Taylor gets it back to the corner driveing dis for burns didnt call Casey morels name a lot in the first half and I think when that started the game I think from a leadership standpoint I I feel like Keats is putting a lot of responsibility on him and they came out flat I think Keat sending a message to him like youre the youre the senior here youve been here the most the longest take control of this this team and stop letting us come out flat like this fifth year senior didnt take a shot in the first half and only played 6 minutes remember it was 92 just over two minutes into the game Kevin Keats took a timeout and NC State from there started to work their way back after that they went on a 23 to9 run Delia driving on burns but it rolled Music off horn extra pass conell the burns on the Block and a quick four for the big fella thats the pressure they put on you set the ball screen in most teams if you dont help the ball handling he gets and they did they tried to help on the ball screen DJ Burns just rolled to the rim Little Resistance there thats his easiest to hell have all year and then tankers leag couldnt haul in the pass from belaia morcel pulls hits he loves the transition three he buries it 70 run timeout Detroit Music Mercy with a s nothing run its always a good idea to get the ball in DJ burns his hands just such nice soft touch around the rim and then Casey Morel decides to join the show knocking down a Trey Ball here in transition quick 70 start NC State but theyre doing it on the defensive end and they do it better than anyone turn the defense and the fast offense Burns now has 10 on five of five shooting and the lead is 14 just like that with Burns again in double figures delcat the offensive rebound and he will pull that out for Detroit Mercy we had those nine turnovers in the first half and theyve already cocked it up twice in the first few possessions in the first two minutes out of halftime tank moves it up top they have gone through large spells in the season like this where theyve come out and this is whats gotten them into trouble theyve gone on five and six minute dry spells of not being able to get the ball you know seeing the ball go through the basket and they open up this second half doing such same thing and thats this has been the issue I think its just that theyre wearing down too with all the injuries and not having a healthy compliment of rostet you got guys are placed in the heavy minute roles that not expected to play in those RS well Emmanuel quatch has just come come into the game for the first time this year the New Mexico transfer who theyve been trying to get ready healthwise and we were told today that he was not going to play but that he should play this weekend hes come into the game for Mike Davis six and blue he went battling on the boards there with Delia and hes high on him hes very high on Emanuel quad thinking that his ability to shoot the ball is is different and separates him from some of the other guys they struggled from knocking down three shots like that but Emanuel quat is one of those guys they feel like as they ease into conference play in Horizon lead that hell be one of those guys that get to going po nice find for Applause Parker H showing you hes so much more than just a score able to come come off the screen get in the paint find a freshman there for easy bunny lead at 16 they mentioned quat hes coming back they hope to get get stone and Hurst available when League Play picks up and they got Eddie delaia playing very well here in Raleigh DTI has been really impressive I mean hes handling the ball in the pressure knock down a three there and he got nine points and nine rebounds Burns spinning Parker went up to battle for it but Del C has got another rebound and hes approaching a double double for Detroit Mercy nearly turns it over to tankers Le now hes got some space shot fake moved it to tankersley pack recovered tankersley stripped and a turnover forced by horn had a nice find to Dennis Parker horn just gets in the paint drops it off to the Freshman showing you with the nice smooth shoes he got on walk us through what are we working with here man Im look like the Grinch I would call him the Grinch or some n l the green I mean look at that I like those those are clean I can wear those Im might have to call Coach ke and ask look at that the white too man yeah we were spying on those we were spying on those and behind the Prada thats where you find Dennis Parker Jrs grin shoes middleberg fast tipped away LJ Thomas had those second set of shoes you saw with Christmas break looming you were telling me the coaches look forward to this break more than any other anytime on the calendar I think everyone does I just think that he gets to that point of the Year gives you a chance to reevaluate reevaluate your team and just catch a breath you know you get a break where usually as a coach when you get a break youre recrui and Christmas break theres no recruiting you just get a chance to go home kind of regroup uh watch film on your team and create ways to kind of get better and I think thats what youre most excited about as a you know head coach but everybody needs just break to get home and youre youre concerned because you dont know as you saw in this game the energy that your team is going to come out with like thats a big concern you know kids have they have flights they have plane tickets the arrangements are already set theyre going home you just want them to remain in your building long enough finish a game 40 a game and didnt get out of it and regroup three goes down right in front of the bench for Donovan totley to cut it 10 yeah just one quick note from Kevin Keats hes going to bring the wolf pack back on December 26 as middle Brooks gets fouled because its really important now with MJ rice and now with Cam Woods for this team to get a lot of practice time together again if youre just joining us third game for cam Woods after the multitime transfers were now allowed immedi iate eligibility and the fifth game today for MJ rice so they just need some practice time and they got to figure out their roles and specifically for my MJ rice hes playing multiple roles I mean he has to play that that big guard that four spot Ro because the team is playing with four guard so hes going to have a lot more on his plate so you need to get him back in the build and make sure that hes not thinking about what hes supposed to do and just play the game you need him just flat out playing I think no you got he checks in here by the way fourth foul on Donovan totley whos one of three Detroit Mercy Titans in double figures 10 as middle Brooks makes both and NC State picks up after the made free throws as you said hes one of three guys in double figures and the pressure that NC State wants to play but this is what they doing to negate the pressure what I mean its like now having your Center to be able to break the Press changes everything dadia commits an offensive foul took it for all 14 seconds of that possession and it ends with his second personal middle Brook just does what he does hes a really good Defender there and he kind of bumps dardia and just stands back in front of him you cant displace him as an offensive player and hes letting him know baby giving him the charge time were going the other way Im not going to match your scoring but I can stop you from scoring lead at a dozen for the wolfb 6 minutes out of Music halftime oconnell searching finds horn sitting on those 20 from the first half driving kick okell yes sir so many guards you have to guard so many guys theyre not relying as good as waren is theres so many guys if its Morel if its Taylor now Connell comes in and they they get mg rice rice going and camwood theyre just going to be that much better Kevin Keats is as certain to have good guards as Buckingham Palace year after year totally no rebound horn he goes tumbling and gets undercut and a foul called on the rebounding action if youre a guard and you want to play Kevin Keats is your guy at NC State he will put the ball in your hands and let you go look at these guys three of these guys and I would say DJ burns when it comes to the half court he is a guard because the balls in his hand they play through him not many teams have a 69ine 200 lets say I think hes listed at 275 as their point guard in the half quarter so hes a fun player to watch hes so unselfish with the basketball and like I tell you hes one of my favorite players to watch I think hes so skilled but the joy in which he plays the game a Woods moved it and now horn gets it back mdle Brooks on the short roll battling underneath and hes got a chance at three Char signal at one end finish at the other you had to know Ben Middlebrook was going to finish this hes like Ive been playing all this defense Im taking charges Im doing all the dirty work let me get my name in the book in a scoring column trying to let you guys know I do more than just defend back to back Rock Solid performances from Ben Middlebrooks who was part of that effective trade with Jack Clark had Clon in the off Music season so far States got the better end Jack clar I think will be a wonderful addition as he gets healthy still recovering and when they get him back I think that Clemson team is as good as as good as any team in the ACC out to another good start for Brad Brown L yeah I Im happy for Brad I mean Im a big believer in that clinson team as well I think they are as good as any team in the ACC in in the country for that matter when they get healthy and get their full complimented players they have a de a identity on the defensive end of the floor and theyre always well coach and executing the offensive end and now they got options check out the ACC in the net the top 100 of the net at this point in Clemson leading the way at 12 yeah theyre going to be there all year I really do I think they got some things to figure out defensively as they continue to lock in on the defensive end the floor tough shot totally how many teams would you have in from the ACC right now and how many do you think they can get I think they can get as high as seven maybe seven or eight teams could be the max I I think the minimum would be five or six I think the key is going to be you got to avoid some of the battle loss some of the bigger difference with some of those teams in the middle of the pack is you got to play a better nonconference schedule like not everyone has played Inc state has some games that they played and some schools have just not gone outside of the the normal scheduling to schedule difficult opponents you know quad one tier one opponents and I think that hurts you from selection time Middlebrooks FS 16point lead for NC State here at home final nonconference game for the wol pack this Music season do it come on D get me of Raleigh declare today Payton Wilson day now go win this bowl game oh man best defensive player in the country fast moving tackling machine pton Wilson whos overcome so much in his career nows got his own Payton Wilson day decreed on Tuesday by mayor Baldwin you heard that you you got your own Randolph children day anywhere ever in the past no Im not that big time man and that thats a tremendous honor for him so like you said so much that pyton has gone through and heck of an honor there given to him by the official mayor even though I call DJ Burns The Unofficial mayor of Raleigh big out campus here in Raleigh tankersly another bucket the lead at 16 for NC State 11 and a half to go hes Randolph Im Mike Monaco our entire crew behind the scenes with you as well heres cam Woods off the screen up top trying to find Middlebrook turned it over he turned the corner there and got in the paint but he left his feet tried to make a decision you want to stay down and make that decision play off two go finish good interior defense from Middlebrooks on Oaks and then rice and it altered there by Tyreek Davis whos treding to bring some Rim protection for Detroit Music Mercy Davis backs it out up top with about a dozen to shoot for the Music Titans totley step back comes up empty middle Brooks another rebound n State likes this group thats on the floor now I think they like their versatility on the defensive end their ability to switch everything and Middlebrook gives them that Parker no got rice and Parker as your next biggest guys Beyond Middlebrooks on the floor for Kevin Keats you talked about that big guard type of role yeah for MJ rice earlier looks like ke is trying to use this time now hes not conceding this game I think its over hes just trying to get those guys cam woods and MJ rice minutes in there with some other guys and so they can figure their their role in this rotation what do you think rice can be for NC State I listen this hes a 33rd ranked kid in the country for a reason I mean he went to Kansas for one year hes coached by the best coach in college basketball Bill s and he decides to come back home I mean his ceiling is extremely high but theres an adjustment period of playing for Keats again you got to figure hes for guard play you got to love it but hes going to be playing with the as that bigger guard role so hes going to have to defend bigger guys for a team thats going to struggle rebounding against some big teams hey Thursday B Mania rolls on right here on acc network with Command Center broadcast of the Bad Boy Mowers Pinstripe Bowl at Yankee Stadium thats Miami and ruter and the poptarts bowl at 545 eastern time with NC State and Payton Wilson and Company Dave Doren group squaring off against Kansas State where you get multiple game angles with realtime player and team stats throughout both games 215 and 545 rice splits at the line Midway through the second half hey I got to ask you are you a Yankee are you a Yankee fan or ball or Red Sox I am a Red Sox fan I wanted to make sure that I was going to call you out on that living in you know a guy from Boston and didnt know if you was one of those Yankees fans but living in Boston man you didnt see the cro sign behind me in the open did you not see yeah I I I thought that was for TV man I didnt know just actually just to see if he were just putting it on for us there he is speaking of big Leaguers and Pros its a Quon Smith getting the about 21 a game for Delaware in the G League after his couple of Seasons here with the pack flat out bucket man he could flat out scoring coach ke was lucky to get him to come back to school for a sophomore year to the NCAA tournament forel no offense rebound Parker yeah tquan doesnt have a game till the 27th in the G leagu so a little bit of time for him as well another guy from North Carolina coming home supporting his alada you know we were talking Randolph earlier before the last commercial break about the net in the ACC yeah I know you think its absurd that NC State got an 11 seed I thought all the seedings last year was bad I thought Clemson should have been in and I thought I thought Pittsburgh should have had a higher seed the year ago and they barely got the dating to Dayton uh in the first four so um The Narrative of the ACC being down is just horrible I think in a lot of these leagues and including the Big 12 the Big East I think their top teams are strong just like the the ACC is uh but I thought last year the league was was down people spoke down upon the league just because carolo Duke maybe didnt play to the National expectations and I think that hurts the league and we got to do a better job of supporting these teams I I think of doing so and its its unfair to them and lot of good basketball left and I can honestly say and I truly believe that this league is as good as the the rest of the leagues in the country and the hype that goes with all those leagues you know sometimes I think its just it just hurts us and theyre promoting a little bit better and I think the narrative out there of people in the media pushing those those those uh conferences just bad this league is as good as any league in college basketball right now you take away some of those top schools um if you take away the top three or four teams in every League ACC I think is just as good as any league in col basketball do you think weve become too numbers oriented I mean weve been looking for kind of one patch all ranking but do you think its gone too far I think it has I think even you know I understand the net ranking but I do think some of that is flawed as well theres things that I think you could just get in the room and sit down and talk about and figure some things out you know uh and Factor some things in and were just really inconsistent with a lot of those things but the narrative just hurts us and in the ACC F and I think he do a better job of of really just talking about that and coming up with some type of concept or or you know just understanding of what it is and of the best 68 team to get into the NCAA tournament Dennis Parker had the second effort underneath andc stayed by 18 inside of eight to go until halftime and then Parker with good hands NC state has taken control of this game against Detroit Mercy couple of days from Christmas Music thats Jerica Williams an assistant coach for Detroit Mercy shes in her first year and she is the only female D1 coach in the country in the mens game with on court coaching and recruiting duties she was an outstanding High School coach shes got college experience too and shes been a part of training Steph Curry for a number of years just congratulations to Jer Williams and also Angela James is Special Assistant to Mike Mike Davis on his staff so got a Trailblazer there in Jericho whims congratulations to her Music and obviously anything Associated to Steph Curry is just flat out amazing yeah she had a college career of her own that included a stop at UCLA her group has inside of8 minutes to go in Raleigh trying to hang around delaia missed it quatch couldnt follow and his Detroit Mercy debut missed the stick Music back Taylor gives it up for Parker Burns Callin for it on the Block gets it he enjoys passing thats what Kevin Keith said this yesterday maybe a little bit too much he wants to make sure hes still scores as Taylor does there yeah I think that time Keats was a little bit upset his a little little one hand Pass lucky that wasnt a turnover there hes a little bit too unselfish at time on the Baseline Manel pulls it out Delia drives missed it back Music IR horn thought about a step back the hand off from burns the three hip one for DJ horn and is first in the second half yeah cool moved off a little bit wasnt as aggressive here early in the second half and hes picked it back up knocking down that three and next Friday well have a mens basketball double header right here on acc Network Miami hosts North Florida at 6 then North Carolina and Charleston Southern rof well have that game from the Smith Center what do you got on Carolina so far a couple of days before Christmas really impressed with the way that theyre playing I think the ball is moving around I think theres some things they want to sh up on the defensive end of the floor like everyone in the country does but they they found their identity they backed to playing at a fast Pac and I think their team is as good as anybody in country Burns wanted a foul didnt get it speaking a fast pace Detroit Mercy runs with Tyree Applause Music Davis Tyree Davis has giv him good minutes I mean he had that one careless turnover and that technical Applause foul 3j Hortons got another and hes matched a career high with 6 threes today lets hope he stays in the game long enough to break Music it totley gets the Applause roll lead at 22 with five and a half to go for the wolf pack I think ke is a little bit upset there that last possession with DJ Burns I think he could have rotated over there and prevented that layup that attempt the rim and oh good defense from Taylor he gets tagged for a blocking foul though but R move well from MC Manel all right so Ill ask you about that with DJ Burns defensively Kevin Keat said to us that teams are going to try to put him in ball screens I mean we know that but he said teams are really scratching what they do offensively to go to that how do you think NC States going to Fair defensively when we get back into ACC play well they obviously they have Middlebrook whos are probably a little bit better on the defensive end but the problem is that theyre accustomed to that they went through this last year you remember they had ducon merch who was supposed to been their Center and in 10 games into the year they thought they were going to have to play zone and not play as much and then they put DJ Burns and I think he changed the of their season a year ago and I think hes you know you have to have him on the floor hes just too important of what youre trying to do so the ball coverage is improving uh lets be honest defensive end the forward is not his superpower but I think hes a heck of a talent and hes fun to be watch and be on the floor this what its going to look like when the wol pack gets back into ACC action and that Virginia North Carolina back to back a couple of home games that jumps out at you well if you have to play those teams early in the year when your students come back you want to get him at home and PNC Center will be jumping with those guys big robberry gain with it with Caroline Music and heres the drive and the foul drawn by LJ Music Thomas foul on mmy and LJ Thomas to the line sophomore from Plant City Florida hes in the rotation last year hey the all ACC holiday special starts Christmas morning at 600 am eastern time goes every hour through 400 a thank you to our viewers here on acc Network Thomas misses both coming up on four minutes to go with NC State headed toward the holidays showed you the schedule back in a week and a half in South Bend Indiana game you

they they too have to get ready for conference play get this Christmas break and get back to campus and and continue to play with the pride that theyve shown all year 11 and seven from middle Brooks yeah Titans get back into conference play in The Horizon League next time out thats Friday less than a week away at IUPUI and again Mike Davis said to us were getting healthier theyre excited about having their full compliment or at least closer to it when theyre in League Play and in a league like that hell come out and tell you the only thing that matters is being at your best in Horizon League action and especially in the conference tournament no question totally with the drive and the Finish cuts to 20 with three to go its an exciting time when it you know when youre dealing with those one bit leagues sometimes when youre in the power six conference you got multiple bids but when youre in those one bit leagues get your conference tournament it just means so much Applause more Parkers had a good second half here as he knocks down the three hes into double figures 10 points and seven rebounds for dpj really good production from Music him dropped it off for Davis and he drivs a foul underneath between the Middlebrooks and Parker 225 to go hey are you kidding me three I think you can make a legitimate argument that Home Alone three despite not having the same actors despite not having mcau Cen dont say you can easily argue its better than Home Alone 2 its not better than Home Alone one definitively but it might be better than home alone too I dont even know what to say to you right now I dont who who are you I I thought I knew you and liked you at one point okay these are yours you got home alone one clearly not a fan of Home Alone three no do you have anything to defend here other than the fact that and weve been going through this take as a society for years about whether or not die hard is a Christmas move and obviously I think it is but if you yeah and I dont feel like re re litigating that no no no its okay but yeah Ill give you to vote on my list my list destroys your list are you kidding me open floor and a finish for Detroit Mercy and Marcus tankersley whos had a good day he has hes competed and played well and we talked about him needing to score before and hes 20 points chance at three for LJ thomasj Thomas so the thing about home alone three if I may and I guess Ive already started yeah go ahead it has legit criminals and like its a pretty cool and sophisticated plot do you do you disagree with that no I just okay if you say if you say so I Ill go with it I mean youre going to the golf course Im not Im not saying its horrible just just put it on maybe when you get home tonight Ive seen it I I dont need to revisit it I would go

tankersly have really played well today one slashing drive from Thomas and its cleared by the Music Titans he check back iron and the rebound ripped down and out to schwat Kei couldnt hit weak side offensive rebound from Michael Oaks and then underneath itll stay with Detroit Mercy last Touch by Jonathan Music Amore you get this point of the game and youre watching guys and and as a coaching perspective you know even when you guys come in you hadnt played well you got to take this last minute or two in the game you know serious and and you got to play throughout the clock you just cant go throughout there and go through the motions Oaks with the Finish trims it to 17 and NC State can take this to the Finish Line theyll improve to 9 and three again those three losses all to top 25 teams
