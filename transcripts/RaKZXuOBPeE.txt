They could not carry over the greatness that they displayed last Wednesday in Atlanta Well see how they fare on the road tonight Great to have you with us Ron Gruber Tony Henderson Kissinger are your officials Both these teams 8 and 10 Both sitting 1 and4 through five ACC games And Brandon Cummings whos come off the bench lately is in the starting lineup for Jeff Cable tonight This is Corhen on the block and he kicks it to the freshman Caleeppa who misses his first shot and Corhan shows some great hustle Smacks it off Hastings foot pit ball You know Corhan had a mismatch inside against Donald Han and the Panthers did not find him right away Now he and Hastings Corhan and Hastings are pushing at one another Friendly friendly push Yes right now but its early This is Cummings Caleppa his jersey already untucked rejected by Hastings and he got Caleppa fouled it Well both these teams struggle scoring Thats one of the biggest issue They try hard they play hard they defend as hard as they can but both teams have trouble scoring Cummings being in the starting lineup might help them get going earlier and Im sure thats what theyre thinking Hastings one of the best shot blockers in the ACC had six blocks at Clemson and what otherwise was a dud for the Eagles but Hastings has been a bright spot Both teams starting in the manto man Applause The big man Bowden Kapki has size on Roman Caleeppa takes advantage Well Capski is a big guy Caleppa is only 66 and Capsi Capki is 6 11 weighs 255 lbs So hes got 5 in and about 30 lb on C1 but thats going to be a tough matchup Barry Dunning Jr knocks in the three to put the Panthers on top Now the Panthers they like to drive the ball to the basket but thats going to be tough against a Boston College team thats big and can block shots Panthers going to have to make some threes First shot for Fred Payne Wont go Miner will try Quick shot Thats not the shot that they want to get Theyd rather get something a little bit better than that Well they can get that shot anytime they want in the shot clock You dont have to do it right right away Sometimes after a shot like that I just look over at the head coach and see their facial expression Jim you were one of my favorites for that I had a few different ones He sure did Hes going to stay here Foul on Corhen on the glass bumping into Hastings And Jeff Cable disagrees When you start agreeing with the officials you really shouldnt be coaching anymore because theyre usually wrong in our minds anyway This is a great crew You got couple final four guys here Another guy goes to Sweet 16 every year So we got a good crew Applause Payne to the basket Banks it in Pittsburgh has no rim protection And if you get near the basket youre going to be able to score Theres nobody there And Payne does what he always does When hes shooting from the outside its with the left When hes taking it to the basket its with the right Its sort of a unique style Well one thing about Earl Grans team is they always play hard defensively and theyve got some good stuff on inbounds as well Well and this was just a situation where the Pit defense did not react I mean he caught that ball with theres no resistance there Music Applause See Aleppa driving on Kapki trying to use his speed Hastings got knocked over going for the rebound Itll be Boston College ball You see Earl Grant his fifth season with the Eagles coming off the overtime win over Syracuse on Saturday Well not dwell on that one No we wont But they only had eight turnovers BC and they forced 18 And that was one of the key differences of the game Dan as you know being there They had 11 steals Forced is a how I I I think theres some prefix before the unforced I think its un they created 18 turnovers Ky overcoming Speaking of mismatches and thats a great job by Boston College If you get some movement on offense youre going to force Pit into some switches and then youre going to create real mismatches That time the 611 Capki was going up against Cumins Well both these teams come into tonight believing they can create some momentum despite the disappointments in the past Good straightup defense there from Kapki disrupting Coren Ky running the floor and missed the layup He just outran Corbin Applause Strong aggressive hedge from Hastings Corhen the former Florida State semol around and out Rebound finds Caleppa and Hastings bumped him on the way back up We talked about the fact that youve got to get some ball movement against the pit defense and when you do you create some mismatches and there thats Capki hes 611 Cumins is 63 and that switch out at the top really creates some problems but you cant take an early shot if youre going to create those situations Earl Grant did say earlier this week we need to give it to our two bigs more inside which is not something they do a ton Well they have a such a difference here And when BC and again when they get that switch now you got 62 against seven almost 7 foot Thats a hard mismatch right there Aiden Shaw is the first eagle off the bench and here comes Neyas Indritis Last Wednesday night initis erupted for 16 points against the Yellow Jackets in the big 23point win Applause pitch showing some fullcourt pressure Applause Music Luca Taves sets up Donald Han Jr Hit the game tying three the other night What a clutch shot against the Orange and we got a reachin foul Its on Barry Dunning Jr and well get ourselves a timeout 4 minutes 20 seconds gone a onepoint game at BC second half I mean but the middle one there is the important one They they stole the ball 11 times And when youre going to get steals youre going to get better opportunities And when a team struggles to score the better opportunity you can get works in your favor Season high steals season high forced turnovers Applause By the way the foul before the break was not on Dunning It was on Incitus Thats my bad Cummings unable to bank it in Katkkey grabs the rebound Pay awkward shot and apparently its still BC ball I think Cummings when he comes off the bench he seems to fit better He seems to be more comfortable as a starter Hes kind of looking for a shot Theres a layup on the island That is brutal defense for Pittsburgh I think there was some confusion about who was supposed to be guarding whom Well nobody Well I But the one guy out there you dont want to leave completely alone is their best player and thats Donald Han Jr Thats two baseline inbounds where Pit has put up very little resistance Meanwhile at this end things arent going much better Panthers havent scored in over three and a half minutes but Cummings will have a chance to change that at the line This is just he goes this Andrew Situs just lets him go You know theyre its like they decided they were going to switch that and somebody didnt get the message Well there was no cross He faked it and he went the other way And thats what you have to take the guys cutaway before you switch BC foul was on Payne It was his first Brandon Cummings has had some incredible scoring games off the bench this season 34 against Hofra He was one point shy of his third career 30point game against Syracuse Thats how he scores Getting to the basket getting to the foul line Applause Kapki with a nice pass and a nice screen and then he spots up knocks down the three Capsky can shoot it from out there Hes only in conference play hes only 15 but you give him that much time and room Hes also made a couple closer shots earlier in the game so hes feeling good Kapis three for four seven points Corhan unable to score over Kafky whos again sprinting down the floor setting the pace 611 guy with his hands up You just get in the way of a smaller guy You dont need to try to block the shot Might have been a little contact too Beautiful ball movement Sets up Taves and he misses to the right Corin the rebound And Boston College really concentrating on getting back on defense Amari Witherspoon the odd man out in the pit starting five coming off the bench tonight with Cummings in the lineup He comes in and gets a couple of free throws Well draws the defense and theres four guys around Payne You can understand Payne has been scoring a lot of points And Kapki he shot the ball much better in nonconference play from three In fact it only made two threes in five conference games coming in Guys Payne just picked up his second foul Chase Forte and Caleb Steager coming in Payne and Taves are going out And the Panthers theyre a team that likes to drive the ball to the basket but they dont shoot a lot of free throws And in conference play theyre only shooting about 60 from the line Another empty trip Yeah those 0 for two free throw nights theyre not good Applause Its over five minutes since Pitts only field goal Theyre one for nine You got to dig in defensively Defensively they were really good last Wednesday against Georgia Tech Nice layup there from Stagger on a pretty nice move Intritis on the attack Cant find the bucket Rebound Shaw And again Kapki is just getting in the way You know he went straight up in the air not trying to swat the ball Nice pass Kapki Beautiful finish Shes got nine first half points Really really great start Yeah he can catch it inside and when hes close to the basket hes got some nice little moves Applause Indraitis Strong finish Now that was a strong finish but if thats the type of shot youre going to get that was really a tough shot Its going to be hard to score snapped a nearly sixminute drought Well you have a sixminute drought and youre only down a couple Yeah Couple buckets And has hit some big shots throughout his career and hes good at doing that creating contact especially against a younger defender Weve been talking about Kapka Hes off to a really good start And part of it is defensively I mean most big guys are going to drop their arms and pick up the foul or swing their arm and get a foul but he didnt So he doesnt get the foul there And here hes just in great position Your guy drives to the basket You got to go find the open spot behind him so they can throw you the ball And thats what Kappy did Jim I know you wont be fond of me bringing up a Georgetown Hoya but I feel like Roy Hibbert pioneered that just jumping straight up defense when he was with the Pacers Yeah Well he was also about 74 so he he provided a a lot of difficult moments He just really big long guy Now youre going back in history here Thats back in before most of the viewers were even born We we got a a veteran knowledgeable audience All right Music As usual Boston College has done a great job with their defensive pressure so far Applause And no matter BCs record thats usually a hallmark of Earl Grants teams unable to finish inside Kieran Mullen a 7 foot freshman from Canada Thats a shot your big guy has to make Thats four layups that Im counting that theyve missed So you cant do that when you struggle to score and working on intrasitis That was really good defense and a smart pass not to force it up Chase Forte second chance No good Mullen the rebound As Jeff Cable said Mullen was the one bright spot against Louisville And now hes missed two consecutive layups Not tonight Dunning straight away Nope Boy thats tough I mean thats two baskets they just should have had I think Mullens just getting a little too close to the basket He just cant make the layup We got to make those shots Applause Demarco Miner sets up Indraitis And that was not a swish but it counts for three Im not sure how exactly that went in but I dont think it should have gone in but well count it Usually when you hit that part of the iron it bounces off It just died Applause Oh Capy doing work on the block again He got himself great position And Boston College again theyre looking inside And Ill tell you what when your big guy scores points in the paint right now is 12 to two Well big guy you throw the ball in and he scores youre going to keep throwing it in there Thats a travel Dan you should be a a referee Put him in there Well hes the highlight for the game so far Top left of this graphic is the low light Pittsburgh 1 for8 on layups officially Woof Now they all havent been uncontested but some of them have been One quarter gone in this game with five to shoot Its a leftwing three for Caleb Stager Well thats what they brought him in to do is to make threes And thats only his second three in conference play So that is a very encouraging sign for the Eagles Largest lead for BC Witherspoon cant slice into it but Corhen was fouled on the rebound action by Stagger Again Boston College has gotten some good ball movement Indraitus has to drop in the lane to help out after that screen And a good pass finds Steager wide open only 14 points in his first five ACC games If they could get you know seven eight points a game from him it would be a big boost off the bench Well and he has the reputation as being a pretty good threepoint shooter but as I said hes only one for six in ACC play coming in so thats a good sign for Earl Grants bunch that he can score Just a freshman You dont see a lot of true freshman these days in college basketball Of course there are some great ones but only the great ones seemingly get a chance to show what they can do Pittsburgh is now three for 16 Its a hair below 19 Cummings creates contact and Chase Forte bites on the fake Question is is it a two or three Its a two for his first Yeah I think he had to step in once he made the fake So probably inside the line but part of you can see here part of the problem for Pit Jim is they cant penetrate inside the defense Boston College doing a great job staying in front of the dribbling And when they get inside they cant make a layup So its you know when you do get there theres some contesting there but you got to make three or four out of eight from layup size Those are the things coaches just look at the stat sheet and say We missed seven layups already Whats going on Music Boy theyve missed some free throws too Now five for eight from the line The positive sign is theyve gotten to the line Theyve attempted eight free throws You got to make them They are last in the ACC in free throws attempted per game And you asked Jeff Cable about that and he didnt really know why that is in fact the case Applause Forte hit some big shots the other day Off the mark this time See Aleppa on the floor like a rugby scrum Hes comfortable there Gets it out to Cummings Numbers for the Panthers if they hurry Cummings falling down Gives it away Chase Forte the steel and he gets drilled Applause Demarco Miner looked to apologize immediately but that was still excessive contact Well Grants calling for a flagrant foul and I think that very well could have been Well yeah theyre going to look at that I mean he made I dont know what he was doing but he made no attempt to play the ball He just ran right into him I mean the question here in my mind is one or two foul number Youre absolutely correct And two is an ejection Yeah its not a two Its Its I think its a easy call to be a one Well again he he made no effort at all to play the ball And lots of times what the officials look at he sort of lined him up from a couple steps away and then hit him Well it looked like a a good downfield block to Well thats true You know which is the wrong sport Yeah I know Its going to be a one I dont think its enough to be a flag two Well you see theyre excessive andor unnecessary You know that both of those apply Its both of those And theres no legitimate attempt to play the ball After re after review the common foul number seven will be upgraded to a flagrant two He will be ejected from the game Two shots Thats itll be Boston College ball underneath the basket with 20 on the shot clock I dont know Do you agree with that one Dan I do agree with that one I mean the one of the things they look for theres adjectives that they try to use to describe excessive is one but when it rises to the exception of extreme then thats a flagrant too and thats this is a terrible blow for the pit panthers minor has been very important to them I I just think that when you dont make any All he had to do when hes running by is put his hand toward the ball and I dont think that would have been an ejection but he didnt even make a kind of an attempt at that And the guy is like on a fast break and hes about to leave his feet and so they felt the contact was extreme and it was player safety involved Thats an ejection One more look And this is what youre talking about Hes coming down the court doesnt even reach in and just as he leaves the floor he blasts it I wonder if there might have been a fight had Miner not gone over to apologize and try to help him up I dont know I it looked worse than I think it was but at least they they guarded the inbounds this time So that was Pit fans are arguing ball dont lie cuz Forte missed both free throws It doesnt work that way But Applause so Demarco Miner who averages 32 minutes per game is done after nine minutes played tonight Applause See if pit shorthanded can be a little bit different Someone else with has a new opportunity to play a little bit more a lot more on coming shoulders and hes been a wild card but hes been a little wild Well can get you an ace sometimes too He got a really nice steal there Big guy didnt take care of the basketball Thats twice know that Cummings now that Cummings has driven into the lane left his feet and just threw the ball That time he got lucky Yeah Know whos in the Super Bowl and many other things How much snow the the current storm is going to blanket across the world Heres Kapki cuz he threw that one away but he was a little bit off balance Well thats the first time theyve doubled him and he didnt really make a good pass or decision there The second BC turnover and the first of the unforced variety Cummings had the steal which was the other one Applause Music And look for Pittsburgh its not the turnovers that are killing them Theyve only turned it over three times but theyre shooting 24 Dunning sets up initis I dont think he got it off in time Rebound pinballs into the hands of Boston College Obviously he did get it off in time Thats a trip on Cummings But the Panthers are unable to get the ball inside And this is Cummins Oh at least he stuck his hand out rather than just his foot You know good heavens Weve seen an unnecessary roughness penalty and a tripping penalty so far in this game We just need offsides and false start and then well be ready for the conference championship games But Donald Hand has that hitch in his free throw so if somebody steps in the lane thatll be a false start Another missed free throw It really is hard to watch games sometimes when nobody makes a shot Its difficult The Boston College defense is just not an allowed pit Very many open shot opportunities Corham with a quick spin gets around Kathky and scores And thats Coran has that ability on the inside Guys dont look now but its a threepoint game And Pittsburgh cant be playing worse than theyre playing when theyre right in the game So thats a good sign for Pittsburgh Well this is a particular play where Coran recognizes this Hes got Kapki on one side and he goes to the other side Thats the first time hes gone the other way Hes tried to go inside power him out of there and hes too big Dunning now just picked up his first foul The Eagles are 33 from the line two for six Applause But now these teams are ranked number 17 and number 18 in the ACC in scoring So we did not expect an offensive outpost Well theyre both really good defensively and thats what were seeing Were seeing two pretty good defenses against teams that struggle on offense and theyll improve in the second half but thats not really a big statement right now I mean they got to improve Corin was reposting Mari Moore who has not played a lot did not find him Moore wild shot Second rebound for Capki But again the shot clocks running down because they cant get anything going early And I think you got to credit the Boston College defense for that You get the sense if BC can maintain its defensive focus and intensity for 40 minutes they got a really good chance to win this game cuz Pits not getting anything easy right now KFKY hes been the story of the night That would have been a nifty lefty hook if he had sent it home Seppa then a triple jump through the lane Oh it was close Coran inside Nice find from Mari Moore Thats really the first time that Pit has gotten out and pushed the ball and you may have had a triple jump on the inside but still BC slow getting back on defense With the Olympics coming up we want to mention one Olympic sport during every broadcast leading up to uh Milan Cortina They dont have triple jumps in the winter I know but you know still getting people in the spirit That was a deep three off the back rim twice and a foul is called on Jason Asamod in the rebound action Something we havent seen much of is the Panthers getting out and going and Situs does it He just takes it out on the dribble That gets him started Boy again he left his feet Then everybodys trying to react back and Asamotto just lost Corinham I dont know how you can lose him Hes the biggest guy out there from Pit Its be one and one for Caleppa Hes not a very good free throw shooter Applause He has company Applause hand in the lane for two And I Ive always thought thats the best part of Donald Ham Juniors game He gets his gets into the lane has some muscle when he can go straight up in the air and not fall back Thats a shot he makes almost all the time And last year you could count on him for 18 20 point nights Hes just hasnt played the same this year When you have the kind of year like he had last year Jim you lose the element of surprise Everybodys looking for you Indraitis over Taves See Aleppa got his hand on the rebound but Asimoto secures the loose ball Again if youre going to be forced to shoot shots like that youre not going to shoot a very high percentage Great Boston College defense Applause Caves has not scored but he has a bunch of assists Not this time for BC Indraitis kind of carrying himself like hes the trigger man of the offense with no Demarco Miner Gets a good look doesnt finish it Caleppa keeps it alive Caleppa stays with it and misses another layup Wow thats two layups missed in that sequence for the Panthers And this is an offensive foul against Donald Han Jr Its the first foul on hand whos got six points on the night including these two from the ACC logo not long ago BC by four Theyve missed multiple layups Theyre missing free throws and yet theyre still only down by four Well the other team is not making a lot of shots either so its kind of a battle of missed shots Pittsburgh has had their point guard ejected Demarco Miner for a flagrant two with 831 to go in the half and yet the Panthers are still hanging around Asoda bumped off his drive throws it behind the backboard and lands in the laps of the cheerleaders Theyll get to the free throw line This was earlier in the half This is the play grin two Its a fast break and Miner makes no attempt to play the ball He just bashes him I mean you can see him looking at him Never reached his hand Just hit him like he You made the point like he was hitting some receiver Good midair karate kick though Oh all he had to do was stick out his hand toward the ball and hit the guy and have been fine been done a flagrant one but but hed be in the game One for two at the line for Asimota after Dunning picked up his second foul Well BC now four for eight from the line I dont know whats worse that or hits four of 13 on layups Donald Han Jr missed a layup but right there for the stick back Caleb Stagger Well you get the idea that this game is going to be decided on plays like that Hustle plays Its been such a difficult task for either team to score You get an easy one and youre in business before the shot Thats the call I hate the most as a coach because you really are going to get a layup and they take it away and say you held him out here where it wasnt much So you end up penalizing the team by calling that foul The positive news for Jeff Cable is that is the second foul on Donald Han Jr One and one for Barry Dunning Jr Whoa The negative news is he had to shoot a free throw See Aleppa and one on the stick back again These are the hustle plays Uh you know they didnt have to run an offense there He just went right to the basket I mean hes 66 weighs about 230 lbs Hes very quick off his feet and he seems to know where to go to get the ball Now unfortunately hes at the free throw line and hes not a very good free throw shooter See thats what you have to do Say negative things and in your face Dan Thats what Roman just said Pitts now six of 11 from the line 54 and a half BCs four of nine leper Bonner and Beahheim with you from Connie Forum and Chestnut Hill Two minutes to play in the first half Pitch shown a 131 zone Kapy from the corner which is really a smart move because theyre not making many shots So lets try the zone a little bit Witherspoon Whoa Another missed layup And that was because he stopped if he just shoots the layup without worried about getting the shot blocked but he waits for the defense to get there and then they contest it Pittsburgh has missed 10 layups in the half Well now they have it all been uncontested but I mean when you get close that close to the basket you have to be able to score Now watch him stop He gets it in there tries to collect himself go to the basket You know you stop and you give Shaw a chance to get there and contest Youd still call that a high percentage look Absolutely Indraida stands his ground Taves tough pullup goes That was a really nice play First points for Luca Taves the sophomore from Tokyo His brother played at Wilmington His cousin has played in the NHL And for team Canada in the Olympics Andresitis kicks it out for Moore Witherspoon straightaway three Mullen got his hand on the rebound tips it out Moore acrobatic move I wouldnt classify that as a layup I dont know what that was That was a throw Yes offbalance throw at bat Thats one where you got to go at the basket and take the foul Get to the foul line because youre not making that shot 10 to shoot for BC Hand and pain are both on the bench so someone else needs to create Its poked away by Moore Its going to be a shot clock violation Great hustle play Now nobody had possession of that ball which is why the shot clock continues to run this I mean thats a great poke away right there And he never really had possession Moore didnt And so that on this on the first row every game now hes working Come on Carlos You Dukes got the midweek buy so hes putting in some time in the studio Yeah Yeah Final seconds of the half Brandon Cummings air ball Capy rebound Halftime Theyre protecting the rim Well BC never had Roy I know They dont have Daniel Abrams or uh Bill Curley either Oh but here comes Pittsburgh Brandon Cummings and one to start the second half And Im telling you when youre struggling to score you have to turn your defense into offense and they tip it away And this is what Cumins does You know he gets that ball theres no way hes waiting Theres no way hes pulling out Hes going to the basket Thats their best chance to score Get in the open field and try to get to the basket get to the foul line Their half court offense they really struggled So that was the first foul on Capki but I think it could be important and relevant in the second half that three Eagle starters had two fouls in the first half including their two leading scorers Payne and Hans Another turnover See Aleppa makes the layup and Pittsburghs within one Its just what you dont want to do to start the second half give up two layups to a team that cant make anything and now youre giving them a chance to get two layups Coaches love to make the other team call the first time out You dont usually And we got ourselves a onepoint game Boston Ko was just trying to go inside on both of their possessions Throw it inside to the post guys but they threw bad passes Another bad pass Eagles fortunate to maintain possession trying to capitalize on the Pittsburgh overplay and hand could not do it See on a play like that I think they should push the ball Theyve had success Mari Moore getting some early second half minutes in the absence of Demarco Miner Well I think Pit needs a bigger contribution from Dunning Cummings step back three gets his own rebound and swatted into the second row by Hastings Now that does not count as a missed layup No that had no chance from the beginning But they dont block him out Thats Donald Hand out Donald Han Jr out there who just simply doesnt block him out And that gives Cumins the opportunity to go and get it Didnt make it very far thanks to Hastings but Music Corins too far away Backs down Hastings and scores He heard you He heard you I was wrong And usually when a big guys got to go that far particularly on a team that doesnt have great threepoint shooters he gets double team and he loses the ball But Boston College gave no help and good heaven Pit is ahead For the first time since the score was three2 and it didnt last long Fred Payne with just his second bucket Well hes got to get going for sure He was out a long time with foul trouble one for four in the first half for Payne who scored 20 in five of his last six games Cummings kicks it Dunning misfires Rebound hand and here come the Eagles Four on three Pay in rhythm Corhan juggles it and holds on Music Pit does have a different skip to their step in the second half but it helps when the ball goes in the basket Sure does but the way theyre moving the way theyre cutting Number two on Hastings Well Corhan gets the ball and hes got to come a pretty long way and hes down there by himself Hastings alone Nobody helps him And Coran when he gets that close he is pretty good on the inside Quick correction number three on Jaden Hastings and he heads to the bench Well he missed a lot of time in the first half with foul trouble as well He only played Music Applause only played about less than five minutes Yep Who touched it last Applause Stay the same way Pittsburghs not getting out and getting something in transition They have trouble scoring in the half court two games in a row Panthers first turnover of the second half Only their fifth turnover of the night Music And turnovers have not been the issue tonight Payne Quick first step met at the rim by Dunning Music Applause Corin fires and hits Thats a rare occurrence Just his eighth threepointer of the season Its only his second in conference play Eagles could use a bucket Capki delivers Thats where they go He made a really nice lefthanded move He was stuck and he still got a good shot up Music Applause 14 points for Kapki Season high and careerhigh 17 More inside for Caleppa That is some pass right there But thats because Shaw was going for the blocked shot Akari Moore getting some minutes and making them count Luca Taves gets the bounce Were getting hot here Theres a Heath wave going Its three in a row Second half field goal percentages gentlemen 63 for Pit 50 for BC Its a shootout Mari Moore cant keep it going But on the glass its the rugby player Roman Caleeppa the Australian doing work You know he is a really good jumper He can get off the floor Everybody talks about his rugby but I mean he can get up Little zone move here OH WHAT A FOLLOW AIDEN SHAW THROWS IT DOWN HE can get up too Thats what happens when you play the zone Youre going to leave that weak side open And he took advantage of it Aiden Shaw Paris shooting in Applause Music Cummings for three and Jeff Cable takes a timeout Well it wasnt hard That Thats a pretty easy prediction Low bar but theyre making layups Theyre four for five from the layup In this first half they were four for 15 So yeah theyre playing a little better on offense Wow They scored 22 points in the entire first half We havent played five minutes in this half and they already got 17 Lets not jinx them Theres the shooting percentage disparities from one half to the next See if the Panthers can keep it going They are seven for 11 Eagles are four for eight Hastings on the bench with the three fouls Donald Han Jr from the same spot he hit the game time bug the other day comes up short this time Corhan with a mismatch and Pit is getting the ball down the court and theyre if theyre not in transition theyre starting their offensive attack early Easier shots and theyre executing BC led by as many as eight This is Pittsburghs largest lead up five Number five Fred Payne Thats really good defense Intritis pokes it away Comes up with a steal and missed the layup Contested well by BC in transition Good defense Applause But Paynes got to get involved Music Applause to the corner Payne rattles it in Heard you Thats a really good play by hand to draw the defense Well both teams are moving better Theyre getting better shots and the percentages are going to go up Theres a good timeout by Earl Grant 31 seconds in His team responded Applause Indraitis with the clock winding down Gets to a spot Missed it Second chance Scores That was a I mean a behind the back dribble in traffic Not this time for Kafky Thats too early for Capski be letting it go out there You dont want him shooting a lot of threes Pittsburgh already with six second chance points in the second half matching their first half total in that category Cummings weaves through the defense Dunning on the drive rejected Caleppa there for the stick back Much better movement much better aggressiveness and make the layup Boy and Caleeppa has really done a nice job rebounding on the offensive end here in the start of this half Yeah theyre a different team Its eight second chance points out of Pittsburghs 23 in the first eight minutes of this half Capy scores again with a left hand Better with his left I think than his right Hes very good stepping through and using his left hand And they came to double team him and he got that ball off despite the double team BC does not want to waste this career night theyre getting from Bowden Capki Is he out of bounds Yes he was BC ball when we return 1125 to play hand and therefore hes able to score easily on the inside But thats a combination of things Corhand gets off running and creates that mismatch and Kapky is caught under the basket and cant get back to defend And sometimes a mismatch at one end leads to a mismatch at the other The key to that is Caleppa blocked out and they were able to get the rebound His orange coming up in about 35 minutes from the dome Fred Payne makes it a onepoint game here in Chestnut Hill We got offense 10 points for Payne eight here in the second half Nice pass better finish Barry Dunning Jr throws it down Really good back door play off a set play This is an important point in the game for the Panthers Theyve got a couple of subs in Both Cumins and Corin are on the bench AND ONE CHASE FORTE This is where when youre not deep and you put a couple guys in you got to pull them in a little bit and all of a sudden theyre driving by and getting layups Well more that time it just I mean he couldnt stay in front and heres the back door youre talking about We talked about Dunnings Hes been relatively quiet Dunning but hes been relatively quiet Theyre even making free throws now So you can see Boston College now theyve made a couple of baskets and you can just see their defensive intensity ratchet up Applause This is our fourth tide 47 all struggling out here without their point guard Its a little bit harder for them to get their offense See Aleppa almost lost his balance almost threw it away to beat the buzzer IT GOES BACK TO open Mari Moore for three Cant make anything now Theyre making bank shots They are 12 for9 in the second half 63 as we head into the fourth quarter of this ball game Forte a little out of control gets bailed out by the foul But Mari Moore is in the game only because they lost Miner early in the game And he just launches that one because the clocks running out And this is a They lost Miner on this play He got thrown out of the game for a flagrant too Just blasting I think that was his football career He must have been a Dback in in football So if if I mean thats something you might see on the ice here at Connie Forest Is that a twominute penalty or a double minor or a fiveminute major Fred Paynes heating up Somebodys getting hot What a difference offensively with these two teams Defense In the first half the score was 2822 BC In the second half its now 3021 Pit Well and then you make a bank shot Now youve got confidence and you drive in the lane and make a really tough one Mari Moore you know hes making a contribution Mari Moore had scored 12 points all season before tonight around and out but Hastings is back in there and he missed the layup Well you just got to go dunk that Just make the layup Dont think about it Dont try to worry about it being blocked And Corans not going after that He knows hes got to stay in the game Only one foul right now for Coren Thats good news for Pit Dunning three And theyre all going down now Applause Unreal Hits four for six from three in the second half They were two for 10 in the first half Pay again HES GOT A CHANCE FOR FOUR WHO are these guys and where did they come from Well Payne this is a guy whos five of his last six games this has been Payne but he was in foul trouble in the first half See Payne is such a tough guy to guard because hell take you to the basket and so youre worried about his dribble penetration and then he can make that three Earl Grant said he recruited Fred off of his toughness Paynes AAOU and high school coach played for Earl Grant at Witchah State The coach reached out to him said I got one for you Hes been a guy thats developed but seems like hes on his way to another 20point night And hes got 16 Music See Aleppo with a great first step Creates contact Absolutely on the floor Absolutely on the floor Fouls going to be on the floor And really you have to credit the referees because when you watch the games and you you see them up close theyre very fair Theyre going to miss calls Everybody knows that But theyre very fair going down the stretch and you have the chance to win Its not like theyre going to just take the game away from you And thats a credit to you know Brian Kersy and and his his crew of officials Dan and Jim I know you both have seen a lot of basketball but Ive got a stat that might have been before your time Nothing could be before my time The lowest home winning percentage ever in ACC history was the second year of the Atlantic Coast Conference 1955 home teams went 29 and 26 You remember that Jim I dont I was 11 I dont remember that be honest with you But one thing I do remember is Cummins just missed two free throws Thats relevant Pain from the corner Thats a surprise He missed them when hes on a roll He is on a roll and he was open Yeah but Pit had been shooting so well from everywhere including the free throw line Boy and Coran is begging the referee to give him the ball This is where they can set up pressure Get it in Music Panthers tonight have now missed seven free throws and more than that layups in transition BC joins the party Donald Han Jr cant connect Caleppa hits the cunning Dunning who lays it in Boy Caleppa I mean its lucky Dunning was cutting through the lane cuz Seppa left his feet before he had a place to throw the ball Applause This is hand barreling and blocked by Dunning but a foul called contact Caleppa is handling the ball and he jumps up in the air and he jumped up before Dunning made his cut So Dunning bailed his teammate out and we said Dunning they needed more from Dunning and theyve gotten it and with just six points tonight Hes got a a severe hitch in his free throw which I havent seen I dont remember seeing that last year but once you get into that it makes it hard He kind of finishes it good but its not pretty Still making 71 10 days from now Saturday January 31st Clemson and Pit at noon North Carolina Georgia Tech at 2 Part of a quadruple header of Saturday hoops on the ACC Network Applause 10 to shoot for the Panthers Cummings throws it up Rebounded by Shaw Thats really good defense BC doing a great job pressuring the basketball Something they did early in the game What was that Forte was bumped in transition Fortunate he didnt lose the ball Well he did kind of lose it but he he bailed him out He was out of control What do you thinks going to decide this game in the last 610 Whoever can make those points That guy might have something to do with it Well we got a sixminute basketball game Were tied at 57 And the pressure Boston College has been able to put on the ball particularly Forte has been a key in slowing Pit down here the last few possessions Indraitis rebound Good rebound by Forte getting in there amongst the trees Now thats a great double team to make Corhan kick it back out Injure has had a wide open one and he just missed it Applause Hand going at Caleppa Needs some help Forte thats not his strength No Shooting the three He drives the ball to the basket Hes a really good defender Indraitis Music Applause 16 points a week ago in Atlanta and Pits lone ACC win Corhan nice dish Aleppa mauled inside No jump ball there son Thats a foul Caleppa that time cut to the basket and I think he was trying to get in rebounding position and he was a little bit surprised he got himself too far under the basket to execute this play Well Corhan had nothing to do except mass because they just came all over him and they made a good recovery to just foul him and make him go the foul line So the stats called it on Kapki It looked like it was Shaw that fouled him but its gone against Kapky in the stats his second Well Pit has now missed three consecutive free throws four Caleppa just wanted to get the offensive rebound Well you cant miss free throws in a game like this and Pit missed a bunch of them in the first half and now they its become afflicted with that disease again The miss layups in the first half or missed free throws in the second for Pit DOUBLE TEAM COMES INITUS FIRES AND BEATS THE BUZZER FOR THREE Almost didnt touch his hands Applause Double figures again for Neyas Indrasitis So in this second half now Pit has hit two tough threes at the shot clock buzzer Almost makes up for all the missed free throws Or if youre a coach nothing makes up for missed free throws That was good defense by Inditis You got to keep paying in front of you and then dont foul it Got the miss from him Were under four minutes Cummings uses the Corhand screen Yeah but Forte fought through that very well from the edge of the logo Cummings cant connect again on the offensive glass See Aleppa A couple of guys were down of the game but when he came down he landed out of bounds So its BC ball and he was charged with his first turnover of the game for getting the rebound and then stepping out of bounds Heres the zone here Zone look 131 They want to get it into the block if they can BC did work on this at shootound today Said to expect it at some point in the game Hand over Dunning for two Friendly bounce Thats very good patience by BC and they get it to Donald Han for what really is his signature move Han becomes the third Eagle in double figures with 10 Corhan over Kky with a left hand Boy thats a tough shot Really tough shot Applause Different offensive basketball in this half Well these are two teams with an exquisite offensive stature here in the second half Pits at 61 BC is an even 50 Applause Shaw gives it up Hand blocked by Caleppa You know Caleppa has done about everything Really good play This is a big defensive possession for Boston College Pit gets it inside Corhand Did he walk No he was fouled If he walked he got help Applause Number three on Kapki Now the last time down they get the ball in and unlike before they dont come to give Kapky any help And this is just a great job by Coren He keeps that pivot foot and pivots to the basket And hes pretty good with that left hand And thats not an easy shot as you pointed out Corhen old school guy inside Missed the front end Now I think thats five straight free throw misses Its hard to win tough games when they miss that many free throws And thats the front end of a oneonone So thats like missing two Two minutes to go Thats a clutch three ball from Chase Forte Wow Coming into this game in conference play he was shooting 12 from beyond the arc but thats a huge one Thats the basket of the game so far BC has gone to overtime four times this year including on Saturday Corhan cant connect and he forced that one BC with a chance to retake the lead Excellent defense by Kapi Now pit back to the manto manag Applause posting up Caleppa but hand takes it and gets it to the corner Forte with six to shoot Ky had it stolen away Caleeppa is everywhere Good defense Really good defense blocks and steals and rebounds and buckets Caleppa has been the man for Pittsburgh down the stretch and a timeout called is going to get their second ACC win either in less than a minute or in less than 6 minutes or whatever Guess who the layup What a great play and just cannot make the layup Timeout BC And you get a chance you want and you get the rebound you want to push it really hard If Pit can get a tie up the arrow does belong to the Panthers Applause See what Earl Grant and the Eagles have out of the timeout Well Forte has done a nice job off the dribble getting in the into the lane Payne leaves it for Kapi BC TAKES the lead I would not have done that That is a heck of a play A CAREER NIGHT FOR THE BIG MAN BOWDEN CAPY Theres a tie FOR THE TIE MISSED IT SHORT 85 to go That was the first of Pits TWO FOULS TO GIVE I would not have run that play from my center but it it worked And thats a heck of a play coach Well that that was great ball movement on the part of Boston College and Im not sure they were actually running the play for him I I think they might have been I think they might have been Thats just a great job by Payne to find him And weve seen Payne a couple of times now just throw that ball back behind him I mean thats just a really good basketball play not to a really good threepoint shooter but hes made one tonight And he saying but because theyre not in the penalty they get another shot Try to steal the ball here Applause Pit doesnt have time to dillydally defensively No they got they got to foul right away if they dont steal the inbounds back Yeah you try to steal it cuz thats your really Lets go Fred Probably only chance to win is to steal the ball Tie up would give it to Pit Oh you cant do that Hand fouled by Andraitis About two and a half seconds off the clock But thats only team foul number six One more They get one more Now you really only chance to win the game is to steal the ball Now you say that Jim but maybe you forget some of the missed free throws weve seen tonight Yeah I guess thats true But you still got to go the length of the court with five six seconds to go Throwing it high ITS A STEAL CALEPPA TAKES IT AWAY CUMMINGS WITH THREE FOR THE TIE NO GOOD BOSTON COLLEGE HAS WON TWO IN A ROW They got the steal They just didnt get a good Applause
