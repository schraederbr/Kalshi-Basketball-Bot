fans gets get another year these two guys and we are underway naheem McLoud wins the tip from Ryan Dunn and the orange in their traveling orange uniforms and what has once again become the common script lettering this season and Virginia and the home whites when beakman as we suspected in the manto man matched up against Mintz this is JJ Starling into the lane cant get the roll McLoud got a hand on it but it goes out of bounds to the Cavaliers but part of the problem for Virginia Doug as you look at their starting lineups is when somebody drives the ball to the basket the defense has to rotate to help and that makes it tougher to Def to rebound the ball on the defensive end and Virginia has struggled with that all year so as the game goes on well see how that develops yeah both of these teams have been outrebounded by their opponents this season which is hard to believe when youve got two teams with a combined 11 and three one loss record Jake Groves back in the starting lineup for UVA for a second straight game here he is off the pass into the corner from beakman and he is off the mark and for Syracuse Judah minz and JJ Starling in the back court along with Hometown guy Justin Taylor Whos High School is less than a mile from here and then Chris Bell and nem McLoud weve seen the Big 7 4 in transfer from Florida State he gets the lob easy to finish there when nobodys around you thats really good play by D to in I thought they had that before but he didnt recognize it and some Syracuse in their last couple games theyve been trying to go to McLoud early to get him involved pman gets a step on the defender gets it out to Dun he continues to be a work in progress with that threepoint shot well neither he done nor beakman shoot the three particularly well and I think for Virginia to be a really good team they both have to improve those numbers significantly yeah it continues to be at this end of the Court where they are as good a Dynam damic Duo as there is in the Music country Justin Taylors pass nearly stolen mince checks where his feet are kicks it back outside Taylor shot clock down to three Bell puts it up and in five nothing Syracuse off to a quick start well Bell gets a chance to set his feet he is a deadly threepoint shooter hes now 11 for 19 over his last three games up to seventh in the conference in percentage Just a Touch under 40 on the year for Bell heres Isaac mcne and of course Syracuse this is a change theyre playing manto man defense this year and its a very good manto man theyre very aggressive on the ball Starling with the bump as McNeely put it on the deck really good job by Syracuse to not panic just because the shot clocks running down and Bell is able to get his feet set you youve got to run Bell off the threepoint line make him dribble it and Dan heres what you were referencing a Adan red autri and his first Years head coach former orange point guard longtime assistant under Jim beheim who by the way is making his broadcast debut for us at 200 today on the ACC Network part of the broadcast team between Florida State and Carolina foul on the rebound going to go against Taylor as Groves crash the glass but interestingly just as we were talking about Syracuse playing manto man they play Zone on the underneath out of bounds plays and they were playing Zone that time blockout responsibilities rather undefine and nobody got a body on Groves there you can see a BandAid over that right eye he required a few stitches after getting popped in uvas last game the win over number 14 Texas AM on Wednesday head coach Tony Bennett year number 15 he has never lost an ACC opener 140 and his numbers against Syracuse headtohead have been very very good in fact UV has beaten Syracuse the last five times last time the orange beat the Cavaliers was back in January of 2020 here at jpj when buddy beheim went off in overtime here goes mince all the way to the bucket great job by Dunn to change that shot and thats a great job by Groves to get there before McLoud could get there again the defense chasing the ball but Virginias still able to claim the defensive board Ro driving dish there to finish his beatman the whoos have their first field goal of the afternoon Applause Starling thought about the back door pass mince was well defended by Music beakman Taylor spotting up and Groves the defensive rebound for UVA thats a great job by Groves he just nudged McLoud just a little bit get him out of the way thats not illegal no third rebound for Groves now for three at the other end a little bit Applause short playing the lineup That Virginia has out there theyre going to have to make threes for have that lineup to be really Applause effective into McLoud who draws a double team how does he handle it not well at the moment and hes tied up by Ryan dun the ACC season is underway here at John Paul Jones Arena back in a moment stayed in one of those rooms although I understand that he spent a lot of those nights over at coach Hollands house instead where he had a little more room to himself well he had a bathroom in his you know in the house didnt have to walk outside well heres a look at the nonconference as we start league play it doesnt mean the nonconference is over of course weve got the rest of the month of December largely dominated by nonconference games but UV VA has largely taken care of its business as you would hope and expect for The Who right Dan well thats thats exactly what they needed with a relatively young team those are three really good wins that theyve had Isaac MC challenging the big man in the lefthanded finish mcne is the guy whos noted as a threepoint shooter but he lofted that one up and he looked very comfortable doing it he sure did the Five Points from Syracuse answered by five from UVA same starting five still on the floor for the orange here is mince being hounded by beakman on second effort cant get the roll McLoud keeps it alive but its mcney with the rebound now Starling picks up beakman and gets left in his dust what a move by ree beakman well Starling had to pick up bman because minz went for the steal and missed and that created a 5 on4 situation and bman really took advantage of it seven unanswered points for the whoos you cant count on Virginia to just run a lot of time off the clock every time if they get an advantage theyre going to try to take it Starling out to Bell little bit strong McNeely with another rebound now beakman the senior from Milwaukee 63 194 lbs Road off the dribble one and done at this end for Applause Music Applause Virginia mince hasnt really been able to penetrate much so far a couple of times but hadnt done any damage Taylor sees two white shirts turns around 10 on the shot clock H caught in the corner being hounded by roie Skip patch Starling for three got it boy and thats thats a piece of news right there he came into this game as a 6 threepoint shooter only made one on the season now two for 19 on the year for the sophomore from Baldwinsville just a few miles from the Syracuse Music campus roie driving dish done extra pass McNeely puts it up and in you know Virginia they thats their first make today in four attempts and they were four for 14 from threepoint range in the second half against Texas AM so that a little bit of a cold spell for the Cavaliers and in that game they beat the agies Music 5947 Taylor traveled this is interesting a guy comes in 1 for 18 from three you can see why Virginias nowhere near him but he knocks it down thats got to give him some confidence and then mcne hes a guy you know can make a three you dont give him that much room you know if youre playing out there for Virginia and Starling makes that three you turn around to the coach who did The Scouting Report and you say what well theres our first look today at Elijah gertrud who was headed for a red shirt until the injury to Dante Harris and so this is his second Collegiate game and Tony Bennett has said they were even considering burning the red shirt for Elijah before the injury but it just solidified their decision that he would play beginning this week think yanan in a tough spot Malik Brown all over and pokes it away shot clock down to four McNeely still at midcourt doesnt Applause recognize well thats going to hurt his 50 threepoint shooting number well the interesting thing about that is Buchanan hes matched up against Malik Brown and Brown is very aggressive Buchanan just not a physical guy and that would have been a 5second violation except Brown kept knocking the ball out of his hands well its interesting how different the two Syracuse centers are as you described Malik Brown is more of a power forward at 68 whos much quicker and more athletic than the big man nem McLoud whos 7 fo4 so they come with a different look for whoever they are matching up Music Applause Music with Starling kicks it back Taylor for three nothing but net for the Charlottesville native thats a great job by Taylor to maintain his composure to get that one off but Doug Im going to tell you something if thats the kind of shot that Syracuse is going to shoot contested sort of at the end of a Scramble Play theyre not going to shoot a very high percentage well they shot a high percentage as we just saw in the graphic against LSU the last time out as brown commits the foul thatll send Gertrude to the line but four of five starters for Syracuse are now on the board the only one who hasnt scored is Judah Min after the three ball by Justin Taylor Music tomorrow well have the exclusive reveal of the college football playoffs semifinals in the Rose Bowl game and all state Sugar Bowl New Years Day on ESPN race and the guys will also unveil the New Years six bowl games and have the final top 25 rankings in this 4H hour special it all starts at noon Eastern 900 am Pacific after Sunday NFL countdown on ESPN and the app and heres whats at stake in the ACC football championship Florida State and Louisville yes no Clemson this year the seol in the midst of a magical season can they secure their spot in the cfp playoff they may be down to the third quarterback in the game it should be interesting here is Elijah Gertrude at the free throw line his first Collegiate Point young man from New Jersey who they are very high on here in Charlottesville well the reason they were thinking about taking the red shirt away anyway is he suffered a an ACL injury early in his Senior High School season and they were afraid that he wouldnt be able to come all the way back from it but he has really progressed he is so explosive well he is from Jersey City New Jersey played at Hudson Catholic but as you say he missed his senior year because of that knee injury but coming along just fine Jud Min nowhere to go ree beakman moves his feet as well as anybody five to shoot Starling able to get by his Defender weve got a foul on the rebound as brown and bu Buchan went for the ball I think they got Bond thatll be Leon Bond the third with his first indeed and again the penetration draws Buchanan and so hes not available to block out and bond doesnt get down and get in front of him comes over his back good looking stroke at the line for the sophomore from col pepper Virginia Malik Brown is from about an hour away Northeast of where we sit here at John Paul Jones Arena and hes good freee throw shooter hes also tremendous in terms of his efficiency on offense making 75 of his field goal attempts now 10 of 11 from the free throw line this year and the El team hes got 18 steals yeah so you know and again he is very much different than the starting center for Syracuse McLoud block shots Brown comes up with Applause Steels weve had six lead changes one time so far in the first nine minutes with Dan boner on Doug Sherman here in Charlottesville Virginia beatman Nice feed bond has trouble Gathering and Benny Williams ripped it away Benny Williams right place right time he rotated down Mintz still looking for his first points and as mentioned going to break four the five Syracuse starters have scored and Dan thats a good sign for Syracuse that mince isnt having to do everything so far this afternoon here comes Gert to thr go down his first UVA bucket somebody got tangled up because he was all alone thats a pretty good way to break the seal on your college basketball Applause career Williams has it rattle out beakman tracks down the rebound and then goes right around mince Applause again its pretty good decision by bakman to not force it in transition roie stepped out of bounds back to Syracuse Virginia is not noted as a transition team but at the top of your screen they just lose Gertrude hes all alone not going to get an easier basket than that that was his first basket and he should remember cuz he wont get an easier one in his entire college career 64 185lb freshman and as you talked about Dan he is explosive and getting back to where he was a couple of years ago athletically Syracuse has missed eight of its last 10 from the field no surprise against this excellent UVA Defense number two in the country in points per game allowed Benny Williams hunting his own shot able to flip it up and in and hunting is a good word that was a tough shot and interestingly enough Judah mins out of the game and because hes out of the game Reese Beakmans out of the game I think those two are going to be in the game against each other the entire day yeah no coincidence quader Copeland is coming to run the point for the orange sophomore from Southwest Philadelphia heres Copeland guarding gertrud Bond off the bounce long two off the front rim Applause Music Applause Music Starling trying to beat McNeely down the lane he did dump it off but Copeland went down Syracuse keeps possession with 10 to shoot got to be patient here you got plenty of time Starling and Copelands going to be called for the over the backat as mcne had much better position well in fact there were three Cavaliers in between Copeland and the basket Ryan Dunn replaces Leon Bond the third for Music Virginia heres McNeely the former Poca Dot from POA West Virginia yes his high school nickname was the polka dots and on Q he Nails the three eight points to lead all scores for the 64 sophomore he had a very quick start the other night I think hes got to make threes for Virginia to be really Applause effective Taylor picked up his dribble and then threw it away here comes gertrud in a Flash going end to end and defended nicely by Starling but he ger was trying to draw the foul there Copeland lost to handle Here Comes Dunn what do you know and done with three orange Defenders back pulls it out now he attacks and with 735 to go in the half UVA up two with the Applause basketball Syracuse manto man has been tough for Virginia to penetrate with the Applause dribble mcney tough Runner and its Copeland who pulls it down you know I dont count that if you get in there yeah fine but if you take a tough shot like that thats credit to the defense the Syracuse defense has been very solid on that particular point and is it safe to assume Dan that for a program that played only zone for the last decade plus Brown able to lay it in that its going to be a work in progress and that you would presume they would be better now in their manto man than they were a month ago and theyll be better a month from now AB absolutely thats a very fair statement I they do a great job pressuring the ball and as I said at least today theyre not allowing a lot of dribble penetration Rose comes up to set a screen mcde drives the other way seven to shoot heres Music Applause roie as the crowd counts down boy we just missed a highlight re dunk Ryan dun had that one lined up but a foul called on the rebound against Malik Brown his is second on acpn when we partner with the V Foundation to highlight the urgent need for cancer research this is gamechanging research that helps save lives you can join the fight against cancer by visiting vorg donate 100 of your donation goes directly to cancer research with Dan Bonner Im Doug Sherman in Charlottesville Virginia on this opening day of the ACC regular season and the whos and orange have been tight from the start again I think the Syracuse defense has played very well theyve held Virginia to 40 shooting from the field and they havent really given him any easy Music Applause Music Applause shots mince keeps the dribble goes inside to Brown sees a double team is pass deflected into the front row the orange will keep with 9 seconds to shoot Adrien ay youre number one is the head coach at his Alma moer class of 1994 a 51yearold native of Harlem New York and his recruiting ties Run Deep in and around New York City also down in the DC Maryland area which has always been such a key recruiting spot for Syracuse dating all the way back to the early days of the 60s with Dave Bing Mintz has to force it up beakman blocked it did the shot beat the buzzer did it beat the foul call did the foul call beat the buzzer Clarence Armstrong was the one on the call he and Jamie lucky now will discuss it we know where red a is leaning we know where Tony Bennett you we know Tony Bennetts opinion as well the question is did the foul occur before the shot clock expired and the officials are going to go over and take a look by the way Dan I mentioned Dave Bing great to see that he is going to be inducted into the Syracuse Ring of Honor inside the Dome coming up later this Music season well we dont have obviously T of a second H boy thats that is very close yeah looks like its still in his hands well the the question isnt the shot the question is the foul yeah so so its still in his hand but did the foul that the shot wouldnt be good it wouldnt be a threepoint play because if what you need to look at is the shot clock above the backboard but the question is did the foul occur before the shot clock went and it looked to me that the contact from Dunns hand onto the elbow of Malik Brown did come with about a second on the shot clock a tenth of a second on theot I mean a tenth of a second which I think goes right back to what we said thats very close so Copeland secures the Music Applause ball I mean we lost the shot clock at the top but you could still see the shot clock facing the other away and again it looked to me like with about a tenth of a second on the clock there was Applause contact but we shall see well the the question is you know Clarence Armstrong put his fist up but he never reported the foul to the table okay its going to be a foul on Ryan d y so the orange catch a break here on a possession that was going nowhere they will get free throws out of it you see Clarence Armstrong explaining it to Tony Bennett now Jamie lucky will come over and share it with my broadcast partner so that you can share what Mr Lucky just shared with you well Doug he theyre obviously wrong because we thought it was 01 he said it was2 on the shot clock so with point two so quader Copeland misses the front end young man out of Gettysburg High School Hes a Philly guy as mentioned always has a smile on his face plays with a little flare not a very good free throw shooter though only 57 coming in now four of nine on the year after making one out of two and heres our Premier matchup at the point Jud mins defending Reese beakman they have been joined at the hip ever since the Music start Music Applause pakman back to ro tend to shoot again the Cavaliers theyre limited to the perimeter Williams knocks it away off the leg of the Cavaliers Syracuse with the takeaway turnover committed by the whoos really good defense well in fact a very important statistic for Virginia all year long has been the points off turnover numbers and Syracuse actually has five points off turnover so far to Virginias Music two Copeland spins on mcne always looking to pass he finds Taylor and dun rips the Applause rebound mcney got the defender in the air finds some open ground and Nails the threepointer 11 points to lead all scores for mcney thats when you know a threepoint Shooters got it going when he get has to dribble that ball away does cant just catch and shoot but take that side dribble and knock down the three roie with the steel and the easy2 UVA with its largest lead of the afternoon and you talked about points off of turnovers Dan you know eventually the Cavs are going to get there well Virginia does a great job stealing the basketball and thats been very critical to their game so far uvas defense is omnipresent when mcne is making threes and the defense plays like this the whoos especially here in Charlottesville are tough to be Jones Arena UVA on a 71 run over the last 220 and well see how the orange respond against Ree beakman and Company interesting part of the schedule for UVA of course we now have early December games in conference play they wont have another Saturday home game in conference for two months Dan thats sort of an oddity of the schedule a surprising Oddity Benny Williams had it blocked by dun heres beakman again able to cross over the defender get Beyond mince and now draw the foul and a trip to the line well one of the few times Virginia particularly bman has been able to get in there and thats because it was a transition situation created by that block shots and Virginia does done in particular does a great job blocking shots and that is a significant block because it resulted in a change of Applause possession tonight on ESPN willll have the mens basketball Legends of basketball Las Vegas Invitational USC squares off against number 11 Gonzaga at 10 Eastern 7 Pacific on ESPN in the app and of course everybodys looking forward to the uh debut of bronnie James he has been cleared medically but not playing in this game yet theyre hoping that after maybe a week he can get himself into games and his father has said no matter when that debut comes if it coincides with a Lakers game dad is leaving the Lakers to go see his son well how much pressure is on that poor kid yeah well just the whole idea that for the last four years 5 years his father has said my goal is to stay in the NBA long enough to be my sons teammate just putting that sort of pressure on your boy but I guess its just naturally there when your name is bronny James regardless of what your dad says well Judah Mintz earning his first trip to the free throw line which is a place he gets to quite frequently still looking for his first points here this afternoon Music Virginia I think had him defended pretty well and I didnt see who it was I didnt see who that foul was on but whoever it was they brought their arms down and thats thats why the foul was called Jake Groves committed that foul Min gets one out of two under four minutes to go in the half UVA with the ho or with the Music ball Ro trying to penetrate on Taylor quick shot off the window for two the sophomore from Brookfield Wisconsin makes it 2819 Virginia which has picked up the pace making five of its last eight shots mints got beakman in the air hangs in the air and that is what number three does best those are the first two times hes really been able to get all the way to the basket and put some pressure on the defense briyan dun still looking for his first points this Applause Music afternoon pman inside the foul line keeps the dribble puts it up tough shot that is a very tough shot I think Adrien ay felt like there ought should have been a three 3 second call in there eight points now for reys beakman Applause Benny Williams leans in on dun and draws the foul physically thats a marvelous matchup between those two Williams and Dunn as we head to break 239 remaining in the half defense and why not Dan as usual it can be suffocating as Syracuse now has one made field goal in the last 421 certainly Virginia can do that to you the interesting thing about this as Williams misses the free throw that was the second personal foul on Ryan Dunn so hes done here in the first half but he has yet to score a basket Ryan Dunn has no points has only attempted one shot one of two at the line for Benny Williams the lead is 84 Virginia beakman is defended by Mint screen from Groves and so the switch with nahem McLoud back into the game McNeely feeling it couldnt find the range on that one the rebound goes to Syracuse Jamie luy definitively says grov was the last to touch and Groves says uhuh didnt touch it well there were three Syracuse players there but I thought that grov the guy who hit it out of bounds Virginia not a great offensive rebounding team and Groves has a point well jamy lucky had the same angle you and I did McLoud double team lets see how he handles it this time it did not go well the first time and it goes worse to Second so twice hes gotten it on lob in the post and twice hes turned it Applause over and that was something you witnessed during practice yesterday how it was going to be handled Syracuse worked on that and part of the plan was not to have McLoud walk that wasnt what they were trying to Applause do things do not always go according to play no under two minutes to go here in the half UVA trying to inch away McNeely stops on it on turns and shoots over JJ Starling 13 points for Isaac mcne his career high is 15 and he has done a really good job both inside and outside the threepoint Music Applause line and Starling turns it over and this is another thing that that Virginia Defense defense does to you you get in a hurry you just heard Seth Greenberg say that that defense can really hurt you and that thats what happens you just get in a hurry not bad huh not bad at all seven turnovers forced so far today by that Virginia Defense McNeely the cover drops it off for Bon what a beautiful set on the offensive end for Virginia Music Bell back into the game for the first time in quite a while tough Baseline shot well defended by roie thats what you want to get Bell to do is dribble the Applause Music ball Applause Music pman out to bond 38 seconds left in the half Bond gives it back to beakman mcne from near the logo thats a new career high and weve still got a half minute to go in the first half time out Syracuse well McNeely missed the Texas Southern game with an injury he certainly appears to be back to full strength and firing from downtown what confidence for the sophomore from Poco West Virginia two time Mr basketball in West Virginia Jerry West dont have to go back that far thats a great guess think Pro Football Hall of Famer Randy Moss Randy Moss okay there you go there you go so he is off to a flying start here today four M threes to match his career high mcne was a top 100 recruit a couple of years ago turned down his hometown Mountaineers to come here to Charlottesville shot clock off Syracuse with 10 seconds with which to work Bell and Taylor clear through here goes minz right to the bucket and he lays it in with two on the clock well Syracuse does a nice job coming out of that timeout to have something positive to go into the locker room with and Min went right by re beasman but McNeely the big story in the first half Virginia when they combine that tough defense with red hot on got a figure Dan going into the second half were going to see a more proactive Judah Min at the offensive end and we saw that at the end of the first half Syracuse needs something to get the offense going well mince is the only orange man to have scored more than one field goal here this afternoon and both of those came late in the first half including a buzzer breeding layup before the break got a good look from Taylor in the corner Dunn still looking for his first points has another rebound for Virginia well Dunn has only taken one shot its hard to score if you never shoot beakman mcney roie dun and once again Jake Groves in the starting lineup for UVA roie great fake terrific pass and an easy two for Jake ROV but the guy who made that all happen was McNeely they threw him the ball and immediately he gets double Music Applause team B may have gotten away with the travel under 10 seconds on the shot clock Starling tough Runner off the window for two and thats one way that you can neutralize Isaac mcne you got to attack him when hes playing defense and I dont think Starling did much of that in the first half Starling now with Five Points he made a rear threepointer in the first half thats his first twopoint bucket beatman takes advantage of Taylor on the switch how about that ball handling I dont know how he dribbled it through all those hands in there well he is among other things terrific with the ball he takes care of it his assist to turnover ratio 36 to1 which is number three in the conference McLoud will go to the line to shoot two and they get that ball out of there once McNeely gets double teamed and then when the double team comes to roie he does a great job finding the player inside and there was a lot of traffic in there that bigman got through Music theres reys beakman the ACC Defensive Player of the Year 1 all conference last year he was number two in the country in assisted turnover ratio and hes better this year statistically so far now McLoud the Florida state transfer at the free throw Applause line well he had great energy McLoud did to start the game against LSU and you felt like that was something else they were trying to establish here this afternoon hes a guy that I think Syracuse was trying to get involved early and they threw him the ball early but he traveled and I think that maybe put a little crimp in his Music confidence beakman gets a screen that leaves dun wide open and again again Dunn is not a very good threepoint shooter only 23 coming in hes missed both of them today but to me Dan his shot does not look broken I think he can be a good shooter just the numbers dont back it up yet but he has worked extensively on it its not unusual to see Ryan come out couple hours before the game to work on a shot but I think if youre the Syracuse defense youd rather have him shooting from three than driving the ball to the basket yeah hes got some pretty good dunks on his highlight reel this year be has it poked out of bounds by Taylor no foul so Virginia will keep with 14 on the timer done obviously very very talented and I know hes working on the three but if you cant make the three get closer throws to the high post pakman makes the Quick Pass to the corner good job by Bell to cut off done roie for three and Syracuse of course in the zone because it was an underneath out of bounds play and Virginia recogn eyes and got the wide open Music Applause three Taylor into McLoud that cuts the lead back to 14 16 was the largest difference so far today thats a good aggressive move by McLoud Groves just too small to handle him if he keeps the ball up in the Music Applause air Applause Groves goes down and Taylors going to be whistled for the foul well as we mentioned in the first half Virginias playing again today without Dante Harris their backup point guard who suffered an injury in practice the other day meanwhile Syracuse remains without there he is there he is the former Georgetown Hoya and then for Syracuse chance Wester made the trip we have yet to see him make his Syracuse debut hes the Auburn transfer who suffered a knee injury underwent surgery and I was told by Syracuse assistant Alan Griffin before the game that he is getting closer and that hell be back on the court in a couple of weeks starting the rehab process in terms of getting basketball ready but his season is not over JJ Starling right to the cup Starling again with the drive to the basket beats McNeely and on the other end before Virginia got the ball to Ryan D where he was able to make one of those athletic play on the inbounds pass brov got it oh when the hoos are shooting like this they are going to be tough to beat meanwhile Syracuse has not been able to stop them they are shooting better than 60 so far here today red Offrey uses a timeout as his team is falling behind by 17 points here at jpj tomorrow on ABC UVA alumni Dawn Staley and number one South Carolina square off against Duke at one Eastern and then its number 10 Texas hosting number 11 Yukon and well cap the day on ESPN with number 16 Ohio State taking on number 20 Tennessee to donate to the V foundation for cancer research go to vorg and uh here in Charlottesville she is basketball royalty as she is in Columbia South Carolina and weve had this conversation Dan Bonner over the years myself and Cory Alexander whos the best point guard in the history of Virginia basketball and he smartly always defers to Da Staley wow that you wouldnt be you wouldnt be wrong about that I mean that Virginias had some great point guards I would actually go don Staley took him to final fours was a tremendous player I think as good a player as there was in her Applause era and I encourage anybody who has not seen her if youre younger find her video the things that she did with the basketball other women at that time were not doing she was absolutely breathtaking with the basketball the Caitlyn Clark of her era if you will there you go but people werent following the womens game quite then quite the way they are now well up over our right shoulder Don Staleys retired number 24 hangs here at jpj as the mens version of the Wahoos continues to pour it on Doug they just keep backing up on these threepoint shots they missed their first three and theyve been seven of 10 cents well Virginia has made 14 of its last 18 shots Starling has it rattle out after a relatively slow start but the whoos are shooting it at better than a 60 clip today beakman missed it Dunn kept it alive still loose Dunns the one who gets on the floor and so Virginia has it to mcne well theres a cause and effect there if only one player chooses to give up his body youre going to get that reward and extending on his career high now 19 points for McNeely to lead all Applause scores a really nice job by dun to keep it alive and then he Dives on the floor to gets it kicks it out and then mcne it seems like he had missed today and you said he keeps backing up further hes going to be back near midcourt shortly hes pretty close to back to midcourt before and weve just had a turnover here because Reese beakman jumped all over Judah minz who fell down and tied him up so The Possession ER goes to Virginia eighth turnover committed by the orange and while beakman yet is yet to have a steal today hes in the middle of all of that hes the head of of the snake defensively forcing those turnovers 6 minutes into the second half heres mcney quer Copeland defending roie no that was a good job by Starling just was physical didnt allow himself to be pushed under the basket here is Starling defended by Dunn mince thought about it now puts it up and from the crowd reaction there and for the rest of the afternoon you know what was an airball Min has shot the ball better from three so far this year relatively low volume coming in at over 40 but the threepoint shot has never been the strongest part of his game well he spent countless hours this summer back in his hometown Washington DCs listed as Fort Washington Maryland but he went back to Gonzaga Catholic High Schools gym to shoot threes with his childhood friend Devin dinkin and they got three after three after three up and like you say Dan the early season numbers are better but did not keep him from that airball Starling with ahead of speed and look it done closing ground to swat it out of bounds his second block of the day so thats why you switch dun onto Starling this is very difficult to have the same kind of impact he now hes passed him but Dunn does a great job following the play and just swatting it out of bounds now interestingly enough that goes as a block shot and thats a good block shot but the possession doesnt change done averaging 29 blocks per game thats fourth in the country and jumped into the game for the first time Kyle cck Jr catches the ball and steps out of bounds also back into the game young man whos enjoying his second Collegiate game Elijah gertrud who had his first bucket on a breakaway Slam in the first half for Virginia well mince is out of the game so Beakmans out of the game and Gert comes in yanan also back into the game at the five position with the basketball for Virginia mcney the step back three he is feeling it they really ought to consider guarding him weve received word that Reese beakman has just gone back into the tunnel and is now coming back out remember he uh is playing with a sleeve on his right knee that left him as a game time decision the last time out B turns it over and so while beakman got through the Texas AM game just fine he still is playing with potentially some need discomfort so he got a quick check from the medical staff and hes over there stretching his kn flexing and you know Virginia is really playing well offensively and that just enhances their defense because Syracuse figures they got to get things going so theyre starting to press a little bit and Virginias just really turning up the defensive intensity and now with beakman on the bench gertrud able to run the point heres dun oh just rising out for two more and thats the perfect description he just jumped up over everybody mince loses his footing and a foul comes on the Scramble for the basketball who they get they got done thats three well dun ever since he arrived here on the grounds last year he does things in flashes Dan that really open your eyes and make you think boy he could be a superstar and hell take a seat with those three fouls now beakman and Dunn are both on the bench now Virginias got a big lead but beakman and Dunn are both on the bench at the same time lets see if Syracuse can take advantage the whoos are on an 11 nothing run Copeland Min Williams Brown and cuff the five on the floor in Orange Benny Williams barely niit the iron there and a foul against Syracuse sends gertrud to the floor thats a personal against Malik Applause Brown everything going Virginias way this afternoon on the opening day of the ACC season keep in mind they missed their first three and we said early in the game this small lineup Virginias playing to be really effective they have to make threes well theyre making them and everybody in a Virginia uniform is knocking down shots thats right that maybe thats the longest shot of the day although not by much well mcne has had a couple of them deep but not quite as deep as the fan who hit that during a recent timeout bond with his second flush of the game W Syracuse trying some pressure and somebody missed an Music Applause assignment but M has made six of eight of his threepoint attempts and the turnovers really begin to bount mince is fouled on his drive to the basket McNeely and bond were with him and it is on Leon Bond thei third the red shirt freshman from wossa Wisconsin I just like saying wossa from waasa East High School well bigmans coming back in the game now because I think what were going to see from Judah Min is hes going to be taking the ball at the basket every time you know who else went to Wawa toast East no I dont he just came back into the game ree beakman well there we go before moving to Baton Rouge Louisiana hes a Wisconsin native himself Music wossa cuff puts it up and in the former Kansas jhawk with his first three and here the orange with some pressure that snapped a 13 nothing Run for the Cavaliers Syracuse utilized this pressure very effectively they were down 24 to Colgate in the second half and they really turned the game around and with all due respect to Colgate they are not Virginia they are not Virginia they are regulars in the NCA tournament the best team in the Patriot League annually but still they are not Virginia and now Syracuse drops back into his Music Zone Bond inside Buchanon had it blocked by Benny Williams but then the whistle comes for a foul and talking before the game with Tony Bennett I asked him is Virginias preparation for a Syracuse game dramatically different now without coach beheim and he kind of chuckled and said yes we never used to have to work on going against manto man well theyre in a zone that time and Williams just let Buchanan cut in front of him and even as a Zone you cant do that well Blake Buchanan has certainly had his moments as a first year out of cordelan Idaho started four games now back into a reserve role for now another young man with a tremendous upside hes going to get stronger and you know hes really has a chance hes got some skills if he works at it and freshman always have ups and downs so thats not a surprise copelan gives it up to Williams strong move to the bucket missed the layup crashing was cuff out of bounds to Virginia and Virginia recovers that ball but thats part of Buchanans problem right now hes just not as strong as he needs to be to play the post in the ACC ball got knocked out of his hands that time listed at 611 225 itll be interesting over the years to see how much muscle and weight he is able to put Applause Music on her true thought about it Bond at the high post back outside to beakman you Canon double team Copeland got a hand on it knocked it out of bounds Virginia will keep it on the Baseline well that was a funny double team down there in Buchan I think if he just turned to the Baseline he could have beaten the double Applause team on the Baseline out of bounds its one thing to go Zone but you cant lose track of anybody let alone tan Murray who can also shoot Itt Virginia now has made 10 threes and that ties their season Music High cup from the other side long rebound to bond boy and that time Brown all he had to do was turn around there was nobody between him and the basket and he elected to pass it beakman for three and its raining threes in Charlottesville for the Wahoos well not a lot you can do about that if youre Syracuse pman he shoots under 30 from three on the year but just everything going Virginias way at the moment Copeland lob it up Malik Brown has to come down with it and then lays it in six for the young man out of blue the Blue Ridge School a verginia native again the Orange playing with a couple of Hometown home state guys Bond missed the dunk and T Murray with the offensive rebound spotting up Elijah gertrud missed the r Canon had it knocked out of bounds off of him and back to Syracuse well Virginia really knocking the threes down the zone defense you know just not very aggressive on that particular occasion but again if youre going to leave somebody open beakman is the guy is one of the guys you leave alone he he came into the game 6 for 22 from Beyond the AR a typical day for number two in white for Virginia 13 points eight assists and hell take another seat Applause Music roie has returned for Music Applause UVA JJ Starling has come back on for the orange quader Copeland makes things happen on both ends for Syracuse that was really good Patience by Syracuse Virginia Defense was scrambling around and they made him do it so long the defense finds it broke down which is rare for Virginia they play the shot clock to mean on both ends as well as anybody in the country bu Canon with the D well Syracuse is play in zone but when your primary defense is manto man sometimes your Zone isnt as Music Applause effective Starling back out to Copeland second Defender comes makes Copeland pick up the dribble back to Applause Music Starling and he lost it well its just its just hard to get in there those secondary Defenders come and help and theres just no room 12 turnovers now for the Music orange you Canon from the High post roie finds the open man in the corner tan buries the three tan Murray with backto back triples since coming off the bench thats how you attack his Zone side to side in and out C well short and hes out of bounds its Virginia basketball well last time out no whos against Texas AM coming off the bench scored thats not a thing today against Syracuse into the ACT is Blake Music Buchanan the Year award this just in Dan Bonner Caitlyn car Parks pretty good well Im telling you theres obviously an unprecedented interest in womens basketball its great to see and shes responsible for it as much as anybody Malik Brown having himself a nice game the followup slam thats the first time Syracuse press has produced a basket they get another steal copelan hell have a chance for Applause Music three well suddenly Now Syracuse has gotten a couple of turnovers and scored as a result of those turnovers they got a long way to go but that gude makes a mistake when youre working against depress you dont leave your feet to pass the ball well with such a big lead I would think its an opportunity for Tony Bennett to maintain the fact that Dunn and beakman are on the floor and let the younger newer guys handle this pressure into the game for the first time is the miramac transfer Jordan Miner number 22 the orange have gone back to manto man Bond catching release off the Applause Music front Taylor and even on the missed shot Syracuse is trying to apply Music pressure gerw oh wow the reverse just goes off the iron three attempts at The Rim Bon couldnt finish well Miner couldnt finish Bond couldnt Applause finish Starling off a little head fake a whistle on the shot that was Applause good count the basket and the foul against Music Virginia Min are just I mean in that situation you either get out of the way or you jump straight up in the air but you dont turn your back and go right into the guy so suddenly little flirt here for Syracuse Starling leads the orange in offense here today just over 6 minutes remaining in Applause regulation the orange on a 80 run and again its without beakman and without dun on the floor UVA having trouble getting the ball up court and having trouble getting into their offense against this pressur defense just Applause Music lately Music dangerous pass out to tame Murray and again Syracuse goes into the Zone when Virginia has the ball out of bounds underneath and Ro certainly is comfortable with the ball in his hands he played some point guard at St Thomas last year as an excellent freshman he was the summit League freshman of the year and getting more of an opportunity here with beakman out Starling no Headley on bond with a basketball now lets see if the who can run some offense they have missed their last six from the floor and Syracuses defense has had something to do with that Virginia has really struggled to get into any sort of a rhythm theyre orange now back in the zone Miner bottled up Ros bounce pass is kick so the shot clock goes to 20 boy that was that was not an well advised pass you know throwing thre a lot of legs in there very fortunate to get a kick out of that Gertrude lobs Bond couldnt come down with it here comes Starling hes got Applause numbers thats the way its gone for Syracuse they had a threeonone and they werent able to execute Music it tane Murray misses from the right corner Copeland goes up and over the Virginia player for that rebound Bel can have the slow release and gertrud was waiting for it thats thats Bell didnt have any room over there because gertrud runs right at him and thats a situation where you know Bell we said you want to make him put the ball on the deck and he elected not to do it and gerud at 64 jumps very Applause well Andrew Roy gets a nice round of applause Bond deflects the inbound pass and its a good thing he did because Taylor was running totally free this is an interesting lineup in the game for Virginia Taylor has the inbound pass go right through his fingertips it has not been a particularly memorable return to his hometown of Charlottesville for Justin Taylor he commits the 13th Syracuse turnover on the Music day out of bounds UVA turns it back over to Syracuse well Murray threw the ball to Gertrude in coffin corner over there where hes got his back to the court now hes double teamed theres very little he can do and thats not really Murrays fault hes got to get the ball in bounds Virginias got to give him another Music option Taylor with an airball Look Out Pass coming this way thanks to Leon bond for saving us but while he did that he stepped on the sideline thats a turnover I can get behind I appreciate that we appreciate that absolutely the game has suddenly gotten more than just a little bit sloppy indeed it has coach Bennett in spite of having a 25point lead Im guessing has a little bit of a slow burn going right now theres a shot fake from Bell who puts it on the deck and calmly knocks down the two and thats a good play by Bell you know that was a great job by Murray to go running at him thats what you want to do but Bell missed up that strategy by taking a dribble and making the two under four minutes remaining in regulation Gertrude in his second Collegiate game the former Albany City Rock where he played his AA Music Hoops contact on the drive just the fourth team foul against Syracuse here in the second half and it takes us to our next media timeout all UVA still to climb and Judah Mintz has been stuck on Five Points since the first half Dan he is only attempted Two Shots from the floor here in the second well and its hard to attempt him from where he is right now one of the big keys of the game uh has been the fact obviously that Virginias knocked down 123s its hard to beat somebody when they score 12 threes against you and Mintz who had such a productive game against LSU hes only one for two from the free throw line tonight and I think thats even more important than the number of shots that hes taken he got fouled 11 times in that LSU game theres a foul that goes against Syracuse and during that timeout Tony Bennett was getting after his team a little bit in the Huddle because again they have allowed 10 unanswered points to Syracuse and you know better than I do Dan coaches are always looking for something to coach up the guys and for the second unit they need to play better on today on ACCC Network as you see Florida States in Chapel Hill to take on number 17 North Carolina coming up at 2 eastern time Florida Florida state is just hoping that North Carolina will have cooled off a little bit from that unbelievable performance they gave against Tennessee my goodness but I tell you what Im happy for Coach Hamilton to see the seol being better so far this year that is a program the last couple of years along with Syracuse and Louisville that the ACC needs to play at the level that we became accustomed to and and the nolles do appear to be heading back in the right direction theyre healthy again this year well theyre healthy and you just cant count out Florida State they theyre so well coached and they usually do such a great job in terms of Team chemistry and as long as they have enough guys they should be fine and again for the Syracuse fans who may still be with us right now if you want to see Jim bims television debut with the ESPN family of networks hell be on that call along with Cory Alexander and West Durham coming up at 200 over on the ACC Network well its been a while since uh Jim beheim took over for Roy Danforth Jimmy Carter was elected president that year Apple was founded Rocky was the movie and Silly Love Songs I know you remember that Dan can you a few bars for us no well he is just the eighth head coach in the long history of Syracuse basketball and when somebody goes 47 years that will limit the total number of guys whove had the whistle and so coach ay continuing to implement his vision of this program yeah back in the mid 70s you were here about 200 yd from where we sit over at University Hall doing some coaching for both the men and the women right Dan well I its its always been exaggerated uh but I was I spent two years as the head coach of the womens basketball team and the best thing about that is I met my wife oh and I got to work with Debbie Ryan and obviously I didnt teach her anything but they made the correct decision when they decided they didnt want me to do it anymore they wanted Debbie to do it because she went to the Hall of Fame I would still say that was pretty good coaching on your part Elijah Gert getting valuable minutes and these are valuable minutes this just isnt sort of an end of the game thing because this is a an ACC team with really good athletes whos pushing you and pressing you trying to get back in the game and you have a guy like Elijah ger trying to stand up to this kind of pressure he needs to feel it and he needs to experience it and he needs to be successful against Music it the foul sends Benny Williams to the line tonight on ESPN will have the mens basketball Legends of basketball Las Vegas Invitational USC squares off against number 11 Gonzaga 10 Eastern 7 Pacific on ESPN in the app no bronny James just yet but he has been medically cleared and will debut as a Trojan in the not too distant future just not tonight boy and there is a lot of pressure Virginias guys have to be really tough with the Music Applause basketball its good to see Bryce Walker into the game hes a young man who was a threeyear practice player at Virginia who earned his jersey a few weeks ago made his debut I believe against Texas Southern and the young man from Beltsville Maryland getting an opportunity to play a couple of minutes in the ACC opener here is for 42 the Jackie Robinson number of Applause Music course the orange El to stay back in the zone Buchanan from the foul line Rises up nicely the close out by Malik Brown didnt affect him at all Buchan can shoot a little bit from that range you know weve seen even in his appearance in the last few minutes he struggles with hanging onto the ball against really physical presence against him and the big round of applause is for that man Tristan how senior walkon a recruited walkon from Virginia Beach he had division three offers out of nori Collegiate but decided to be a who and getting an opportunity to play the last minute and a half Bell and the stick back by Brown hes into double figures only two Syracuse players ERS have reached double digits JJ Starling is the Music other thats a great job by bond to come to that ball Miner lost it on the way up Copeland tries to knock it off of how and then foul against Syracuse will send Tristan how to the line for an opportunity to get himself into the scoring column well minor bringing the ball down the court is a perfect reason why coaches want to bring the ball up the Music Applause Music court well with conference play beginning today Miamis already beaten Notre d Virginia well on its way to beating Syracuse coming up at 200 on acc Network North Carolina in Florida State Duke will take on Georgia Tech and then NC State against BC and then a busy schedule tomorrow as well as most everybody gets into action as we had these early December conference games and then go back to nonconference play for the most Applause part and the games tomorrow Clemson off to a terrific start to the year Pittsburgh was in the NCA tournament a year ago Clemson just missed but thats a big early game and Clemson shows the signs Dan of being a tournament team and maybe even more than that this year well but that thats a tough road game against the Panthers because pit you know under Jason cable they uh Jeff cable Jason is the assistant so its both the cables they really did a good job turning that program around getting them not only to the NCA tournament but winning in the NCA Music tournament so theyve got it certainly headed in the right direction and there theyll be a very tough out for Clemson playing in pit no doubt well last year when those two teams met for the first time in January it was in Pittsburgh and both of them were 40 showing indications that they both had good things to Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music come okay starling Music buries it his second made three of the ball game so hes got twice as many today as he started with yeah the tear drop how about Tristan how for two The Peoples Choice brings everybody to their feet here at John Paul Jones Arena under Tony Bennett only 12 times before this year had they scored 80 points in a game and they are up to 84 in counting quader Copeland they scored 84 points and theyll be happy about that but he will not be happy that they gave up Music 62 what a performance well this is the third time this year the who have gone for more than 80 and they win their ACC opener a very very impressive performance theyre going to be up to beat when they can make threes at the pace they made him today
