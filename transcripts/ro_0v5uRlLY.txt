record They will be without Howe Fleming Jr who is out with an eye injury So a usual starter not in the lineup for the runin rebels Meanwhile for the Cardinal the typical starters for them Of course we talked about Okori and Apara but Benny Geler the hero gamewinner against St Louis and that was the exact spot that he hit that gamewinning three from Hell take the first shot and he knocks it down on a good start for the Cardinals I told him I challenged him to a shooting but not I dont know anymore I I can shoot it Jacob but I showed it but he can really fill it up I mean hes been on fire Well get back to that big shot he hit in the tournament for the championship Just a tremendous story The senior out of Palperies has waited his time as Akara intercepts the pass and Akara taking flight and is rejected by Gibbs Law Horn at the rim Boy you rarely see a 61 guard chase down a 684 forward No I you know I was just going to say the same thing You got a guard going up over the top and getting getting Okara I mean he got it and and uh I dont think he would expected that Stanford playing their seventh game at home Theyve had a really favorable schedule as Cayman draws cheering the foul Part of that though has been by design And if you talk to coach Kyle Smith understanding the gauntlet that is the ACC Well its just going to be so competitive You you you definitely want to get some some games under your belt But Stanfords got five guys that you know pretty much going double figures Uh they got some guys that score on there Raosi with a series of moves off the front rim and a great sign that Emanuel Stefen making his season debut with UNLV Hadnt played the first eight games of the season due to injuries Hurt his back in the first preseason practice of the year Hamilton on the pull up and the rebound snatched by Ger Yeah Stanford doing a good job defensively switching out Rahosi again too strong with the left And fortunately for UNLV theyve been without so many of their bigs due to injuries as Hamilton had it poked away Cory racing on the other end and draws the foul on Stefan Stephans the biggest presence theyve had in the last two weeks No its a its a big addition with three big guys out You got to come up with something But heres a Cory showing you what he does so well Hes so lethal in transition and he Why Because hes quick and he can get to the basket but he can use either hand Jonah He can finish and hes very adept at drawing fouls coaches didnt initially plan to have him be the starter in their off season but in those practices every team that the coaching staff put him on theyd win and they kept winning to the point where they had to make him the starter Yeah coaches get smart pretty quick Joe Happened to me You you know you cant argue with success and with you know guys that perform And thats what happened Thats exactly what happened And hes earned his way Just the second road game of the season for UNLV trying to snap a threegame losing streak Williamson gets dealer up in the air in the first bucket for the Rebels Big time score to the basket Hes a talented freshman Hes athletic as we know had originally committed to New Mexico but due to some coaching changes thought things over a little bit more in the recruiting process comes away with the steel and is fouled by Geler Thats actually not a bad foul by Benny Geler I mean that was going to be a layup You got to watch UNLV because they want to play fast and theyre going to get out in transition but here he is He was going to get up there He can score Then he took the foul Six straight starts for Isaac Williams Williamson freshman out of Moreno Valley Didnt play the first couple games of the year But similarly to Cororey he was just too good to keep him off the floor Yeah that happens a lot Jonah in the game of basketball You got guys that just they wont let you s them and they they earn their way on and you got to reward them knocks down both Any four0 run for the run in Rebels Just the fifth alltime meeting between these two programs as fans continue to file in Cory with a burst and induces a whistle Well this is a good game and why Because its a good game obviously for fans recognition playing UNLB And heres another look at the drive by Aorei Hes definitely fouled But both of these teams uh really want to play some you know and get some experience going into their conference And Josh Passners if you look at their schedule oh my goodness UNLB plays as tough a schedule as you can imagine And you know when Kyle Smith has a brand new team all these new players hell get his guys going But you know you want to test yourself in the preseason a little bit before you get in conference Do you like the way that Kyle Smith has scheduled the nonconference I you know I like getting your team at home early with newcomers and getting a little rhythm under you Youre going to have enough tough games in the ACC Trust me Happened when I was in the pack You you got to get a couple games You just got to get to know your team a little bit And so thats good to get some games under your belt as well I like that you called it the pack cuz I dont know how many teams were in it during your your run over there Started out as the Pack 10 as Stefan is able to get the jump hook to go and now its the pack was the Pack 12 Now it could be the Pack 14 Pack 12 Who knows But uh the college basketballs changing so much Jonah But you know tradition is tradition and the ACC and the pack were two really big uh you know tradition conferences And as is the Mountain West youre you got some uh really good teams playing Aara tiptoes the baseline Rahosi cant get it to fall All loose Scooped up by Gibbs Law Horn Jeremy Dent Smith the transfer from Cal State Dominguez Hills in the trailer dropped off to Brown contested underneath and Akara wrestles it free Yeah kind of hurried himself that thought he could have drew drawn a foul there but good defense in the end by Stanford Okorei from straightaway and Camman is fouled crashing into the back of Stephen So Josh Passner of course former member of the ACC as a head coach of Georgia Tech So much success in that run Couple of conference titles in 2021 at Georgia Tech to its first ACC championship since 1993 Coach and Memphis very successful coach who I coached against when he was at Memphis Had some very good teams and coached against him when he was a player and an assistant at Arizona So we go way back Well Coach Smith tried to recruit him when he was an assistant at San Diego as Hamiltons shot is blocked So they both grew up in Houston tried getting him to stay in Southern California and instead he plays for Arizona and wins a national championship How about that Youre right Kyle Smith and Josh and his familys from Houston was there when I was at Rice So uh you know familiarity These guys are familiar to me in during my career Jones in off the bench It started the previous five for the running Rebels Thats thrown away into the hands of Agarwal finds himself open from the wing and cashes in a three The second in the first half Yeah he can do that Gives Law Horn tied up So a good shooting start for Stanford They hit 14 threepointers in their last game Already two in the first couple They need that uh desperately And they got they got a good man Problem for them is they havent been healthy They havent played a single game with their entire roster at his at his disposal as Hamilton spins his way creatively for the bucket Well Stanfords trying to figure out how he took a step in the half and maybe another half maybe another half but he got there He got some long steps Well theyve added some leeway to the continuation now in basketball Thats NBA right there Do dribbled it off his leg but fortuitously finds its way back into him Yeah UNLV is active with their hands Theyre getting their hands on a lot of basketballs Theyll pressure you Theyll foul a lot but theyll come up with turnovers Oh Cory with three down the lane and hes looking for goalending Hes not going to get it Oscar Heel shots knocked out of bounds Well they thought that ball was on the rim Uh and thought it was touched So heres another look at it Theres the drive Heres the attempt And there is sitting on the rim It came off Thats a good call by the officials Funny how I think all these calls now by the officials are good When youre coaching Jonah you you dont ever think any of them are any good Youre trying to fight for your team You get into confrontational discussions with with referees as Agarwal lays it up No I I didnt But I I let them know what I thought I never I asked them if I can get technicals for what I thought They said no So I let them know how I thought Gives Law Horn with an open look And Brown with an offensive rebound NS Cunningham back in gives Lawhorn tries it again and the rebound to Jeremy Dent Smith Now Jeremy Dent Smiths really played well as of late for the Cardinal Hes been extremely effective coming off a 16point performance Hit five threes in Stanfords win over Portland earlier this week And he really was a a bit of number on St Louis in their championship Fall away for Oy Short and Heel Tay snags an offensive board such a physical player despite being just a freshman Oh theyve got some good size in there and they lob it underneath to him and Hamilton got caught and he will head to the line and theres the advantage that Stanford has certainly over UNLV Theyve got big guys inside But theres the shot Heres a a grab offensive rebound reook reboot But you know they theyve got size in there Theyre theyre bigger at every position especially in the post Theres just no way you can guard Hilte with his size and his range Hes been effective for Stanford this year Hamilton picks up his second personal Hes fouled out in four straight games Its been hard to keep him out on the floor Yeah You know you look at Oscar Hilt and hes a freshman and and hes really good with his footwork agile either hand Uh he gives them another look inside He hes hes done a nice job for the the Cardinal Yeah Coach Smith says he has great feel for a big too strong on the second free throw Isaac Williamson back in for the running rebels Hes got four of the teams eight in the early going On the back cut Jones earns a trip Yeah nice pass by Stephen did a nice job of wheeling and getting his teammate Thats a good looking pass and and a nice attempt But here it is He makes his move here Heres the denial back cut Great job Keman turns his head and the offense takes advantage of it Tyron Jones really special freshman born and raised in Las Vegas Its been his dream to play for the runin rebels was initially committed to the previous coaching staff under Kevin Krueger but still honored that commitment and remained to play for coach Passner Its a big get and you know hes had 18 blocks on the year so hes active Hes not you know doesnt weigh a lot Hes only a buck 90 but hell get out and block shots Hell run the floor Hell hell score and hell rebound And this is the one area hes got to work on his free throw shooting Only a 42 free throw shooter but he gets there Good news is he can get to the line And a 10sec backcourt violation Boy Stanford couldnt cross the timeline And the running rebels forced the turnover Now thats what they want to do They want to play fast and they want to pressure you to get this going up and down But uh you know when youre playing against UNLV youve got to get it across Uh and again you know theres a misnomer Sometimes you dont think you can play aggressively against aggressive teams Sometimes thats just what you have to do Yeah And you rarely see that called Most teams are able to get it pretty easily across the timeline Late clock for Stefen Raosi sticking with him Down to four Tough fall away Nearly bounced in And Geler again with a defensive board Trying to play with a little bit of tempo Agarwal in transition And the rebound to Al Green who checked in for UNLV Rebels want to play with Pace and count it and one Stefen returning with a statement in the early going of the first half You can see how valuable this young man can be to the Rebels I mean hes doing a lot of things now Hes active Hes able to spin step through get to the basket draw the foul I mean theyre down some post guys now They you know theyre playing with about three of their bigger guys So to get him in this game stepping up is a big big game Transfer from Arizona appeared in eight games last season with the Wildcats but he was actually Coach Passners first signing at UNLV Doesnt surprise me He went back to Arizona and snuck a guy out of there Got to go back to the Well hes got available right Absolutely lot of success during those years with Lud Olsson again as a player and as a coach as a gratit assistant Also a belated happy birthday to Stephan as well His birthday was last week Geler and the rebound to Green Not to mention at one point during your coaching career you were taking on Jerry Taranian with UNLV right Youve done your homework shown up and and and uh yeah we had some great games We were able to play some of his better teams Uh hes a hes a legend I could tell you stories about Tark uh in in the days I remember him watching our team practice and my assistants said What are you letting Tar watch your team practice I said He doesnt care what were doing He likes the drills were doing hes not going to change the way he plays and he didnt Hes just he was that kind of guy But boy was he a legend in the coaching world And coach Passner understands that responsibility as Geler with a walkin three His second of the first half Kenny Geler you you got to get out and guard him He is lethal from three Big time range and confidence Shooting it over 46 deep this season Thats big One of the best marks in the ACC Jones behind the back Boy bullying his way past Camman for two Yeah hes quick and he might have got fouled on that play Really quick to the basket Geler in the corner Long rebound for Williamson Rebels have numbers Nice dish underneath to a running Jones for the flush Yeah you can see the way UNLV wants to play Theyre the running Rebels and they want to get out and run and and they did a great job in transition Well coach Passner said we cant be the walking rebels No not not in Las Vegas Tied at 15 They drop it down Raosi with a quick jump hook and the Cardinal go back in front Yeah its a great move You talk about AJ Roi another really fine post guy Good moves Hes been a little under 10 a game Hes done a great job for Stanford Isacsons the step through Pokes in the hands of Okorei 0 for three is Oori Does have three points Cant get the acrobatic layup stays here and its nine over and back as it was tipped They got a little bit of a short clock here Got to get a shot up Eer Oara tes it up and he banks it in Its open on a Sunday I was going to say Joan its Sunday I dont know any banks are open but theyre open in Palo Alto right Its dead on He probably visited a religious establishment before this game And listen sometimes its better to be laughter uh a little lucky than good but you know he had presence of mind to get it up Give uh Aquafara credit He got that shot up in time Green fired underneath Jones is fouled And thats part of the adjustment by the way for Apara He played center at Harvard and now shifted to a combo of their season moving forward And with more lets send it over to Shayo Yeah thank you Stephan And I mean hes been critical here today I mean his post presence inside battling with the Stanford post Hes already have four points and three rebounds which has been helping really well with the re rebounding here And I know co coach Josh talked a lot about how important it is for them to get on the D boards and and continue to battle inside So hes been great for them today Yeah thats a great point Shay And they need all the bigs and the size that they can have especially against a tall Stanford team McCory back at the control Still looking for his first field goal Nice bounce in the corner Agur walls three in and out and Stephen grabs on the defensive board Little zone look there Gives Law Horn straight to the cup Hes tough He can get to the basket So athletic His first bucket of the game Thats something that Stanford was working on in practice yesterday was trying to go against the zone Well theres theyre in a 131 right now Make no mistake about it Thats a 131 zone A zone you dont often see Yeah they havent seen a lot of it A hop step underneath and Rahosi met at the rim Squirts out to Green He was blocked Nice lead pass up ahead Jones with the acrobatic finish and coach Smith has seen enough Jones fired up as he ties up the score at 20 Well thats just good transition Jonah What what UNLB is doing is taking advantage of some athletic players because theyve got a couple of block shots turning them into breaks If youre playing against UNLV you must get back in transition And Im talking about made or miss baskets They will run the ball down your throat and theyll get numbers on you So youve got to get back in a hurry And thats what Kyle Smith called that timeout for to instruct his team Guys we may miss a shot or get our shot blocked Thats not the harm Lets get back on defense Now for UNLV part of the slower start has been 13 newcomers This is a completely different team than they were last year Yeah One returning player I mean you talk about UNLV and Stanford its incredible Uh I mean you know todays college basketball where you lose players you got to reload But thats a significant roster rebuild if youre Josh Pastor and UNLV But you know the time to do it in your first year when youre getting the program going it theres going to be some growing pains And again he acknowledged that its going to be a work in progress Itll take time to see the results but he feels like if this team is healthy they can do something special Thats off the side of the backboard for Geler Yep theyre still playing the 131 Theyre in it Big at the wing Extremely big at the wing A par with open space in the paint Flips it up and in And thats where you got to attack it Sometimes they got their they got that that opening Uh theyre so big and wide at the wing you got to find a way to get in that the middle of the zone We mentioned it going into the last break Hes had to transition from being a a center in the Ivy League to playing more combo forward here in the ACC Stefan trying to back down Raosi high hook shot falls through Well hes just shaking his head like you cant guard me He hes feeling it right now Its amazing you can get back in the swing of things so quickly The reason he was a fourstar recruit for skill sets like that Rebels have done a good job containing Okorei so far Able to split the double in contact Count it and one That is a smart play Jonah be because the new rule as you know and our viewers probably know and should know is that if you can gather it and get it up theyre going to give you the continuation that was not in play a year ago much like the NBA So how smart is AOR He knew when he had that contact continue the motion get it up and got rewarded Plays with so much rhythm so much bounce and really under control for a freshman Yeah hes got great change of direction change of speed If youre a young guard watching basketball watch this young man play He never plays at the same speed Number one on the team in assists number one on the team in points In fact hes top 15 in the nation in that category And that was his first field goal of the game as Williamson tries to answer from the shoulder A rebound to heel tag Aara skips Jeremy Dent Smith in the corner in and out Good look He had a wide open looking three Youll live with that again He had five in their last game It was his best game as a Cardinal Gibbs Law Horn and Stefen crash into one another going to work on the block on Heel Tay inside Blocked by the freshman but itll stay with the Running Rebels with 25 So the Running Rebels have a late shot clock to work with Tyron Jones doing what he can beat the other teams post guys down there Its its uh its a its a weapon Now if youre UNLV here you got a short clock Youre not a great shoot for a three point shooting team In fact youve only taken two Youre only shooting 28 but theyre going to have to get something hopefully to the rim uh to the basket or draw a foul If youre if youre Stanford you want to play it from the inside out Absolutely And NS Cunningham out there to stretch the floor a little bit Theyve got 18 paint points and its deflected and stolen back by Stanford I didnt like that I think they got to go over the top there not sideways Stanford did a good job defensively UNLB is going to go back to the zone now and theyre going to match up out of a little different look right now Not the 131 so much Cardinal have hit four threes in the first half so far So theyre able to stretch the defense out a little bit Smith Dent with the blow by and the tip in is good for Hell take Well thats where the Sampers got their advantage on the glass Now if youre Stanford here you know that dont be surprised to see Stanford maybe go back to play some zone because UNLB has been good to the basket Have not been good from the from the perimeter Christina the freshman out of Latvia in for the seventh appearance of the season That turnaround no good for Stephen this time Stanford have an opportunity with a little bit of an unset defense No look dish to Agarwal in the corner Yeah How about a Cororey He made the dish and ran down the floor the other way He knew his teammate was going to hit that shot I love that confidence laughter I love it Thats when you know youve got swagger when you just have that much belief in your team racing to the other end Our is fouled by Stefen Yeah lets watch this I I get a kick out of this Jonah But you know here heres the heres a no look pass and he just runs down the court He knew his teammate was going to hit it How about that Theres no offensive rebounds Theres no staying in the back half court here Uh thats confidence your teammate But how about a Cororey in the transition You talk about Tyron uh going up and down the floor Tyron Jones A Cororey can really get up in transition Third assist of the game for Oy And I asked coach about Okore and what he expected from him And even coach Smith acknowledged that hes exceeded their own expectations for how immediately impactful hed be Well hes setting his own bar now Every game every as the season goes on hes he just sets the bar higher Hes trying to prove it my freshman year Thats no fluke And you Jonah hell do what it takes for his team If he need they need him to score he will If he needs to assist hell assist Hamilton back in with those two personal fouls Again is fouled out in four straight They need him out on the floor Gives Law Horn 15footer No And snatched defensively for Heelte Oh Cory was trying to dance on Cunningham Pulls up for three Hes been struggling today with his shot but again its his facilitation A lot of that has to do with UNLV too Jonah I mean that thats a 67 68 wing on a Cororey challenging and I think Josh Pastors teams done a really good job of challenging Stanford shots because theyre a good shooting team Do you think theyve been playing him any differently than other teams have so far this year Well theyre playing with some bigger guys on them and and getting some longer length on them which has been helpful Back cut gives Lawler up and under Gets enough English on it here in Stanford California for two Yeah hes so good to the basket Much like Okorei can use either hand to score but quick Coaches call him the heartbeat and the pulse of this team Plays with so much energy Agarall down to Heelte Hes got about 30 lbs on Jones Spins and works his way for two Yeah great patience Stanford Smart going inside Cunningham from straight away knocks in the three UNLV came to play today You know theyre theyre playing with a lot of aggression a lot of confidence not like a team thats been missing players Uh theyre not feeling sorry for themselves First threepoint hit of the game for UNLV The Alabama transfer red shirted all of last season with the Crimson Tide Agarwals got two threes in the first half as well for the Cardinal And the lefty lay goes down I like that theyve hes added that to his game He know he can shoot it Theyre throwing it a little bit too high for Hamilton There arent many passes he cant reach but that one overshot Well hes tapping his chest like my bad I didnt time the jump either But you know I I I like the way again that UNLV is trying to push it in transition trying to take advantage and get a basket or a look before the Stanford defense gets set up If youre Stanford now you know youve got to find find some more ways to look inside because thats where theyve had an advantage They you know has not been able to guard Stanford on in the low block To your point a great response from UNLV after losing their last three Theyre coming out trying to win this game Then Smith down the lane blocked underneath with 14 to shoot Yeah you cant again you know you cant focus on the negatives and and and you know I always felt when there was a a streak Jonah if youre on the losing end you know the odds are with you to get that win So keep fighting Um because uh you know odds go successful Good coaches find a way to win and get their teams to perform Hamilton backing down screen Fall away is pure Ah thats just a tough shot Not a lot there He just made that happen Good Pretty good defense just tougher shot Arguably the best athlete on this UNLV roster And Shay youve got a little bit more on the defensive schemes Yeah I mean they came out in zone for a little bit and then Stanford completely torched that I mean theyre shooting almost 40 from three So theyre looking to go back man hopefully to see if they can find any type of momentum to get their way back into this game and kind of close the gap Yeah its a great point And coach you talked about shifting from zone manonman just trying to change the looks for Stanford I think thats smart Cardinal hit four of their last five shots though as they rocket it underneath to Roi Nice look for from from Apar of passing the ball away from the defense Williamson with the spin Sneaks it up and in Well I didnt see any angle there He he thought differently I mean he saw he had a little bit of an angle spin cycle to the basket and off the glass Great shot Just a fantastic freshman averaging 14 points per game this season Den Smith still searching for his first shot off the back heel UNLV has done a good job keeping Cardinal on the perimeter as theres no whistle Hamilton still down on the other end That should be an open guy Well they had a little bit of a advantage They had a brief opening and Hamilton steps in the passing play Hes so quick getting around the post breaking contact Thats the key to post defense Dont lock up Williamson feeling real comfortable off the side of the rim and a tug underneath as Roi was pulled down Well he knew that was a foul A little bit of a frustration foul right there by Williamson Thought he thought he got a little contact wasnt called returned the favor but like I like that he helped his team like his opponent up but there it is He hit him inadvertently Uh and he knew he got him in the head so probably could review that but I think it was unintentional But as you know Jonah the new rule is if you get hit in the head intentional directed or not that theyre supposed to call that Um these coaching staffs do such a good job Thats Scott Garson on the sideline veteran coach came over from Santa Clara Josh Pastors guy and now with with UNLV but he does a good job And uh Stanfords also blessed with some veteran coaches Eric Revano Jim Shaw guys have been around really successful at their own levels Hamilton trying to go to work Picks up the dribble A par draws the assignment on Jones Gives Law Horn with five Geler cutting him off forced a hoist and hits a long three I dont know if he can play that any better defensively Benny Heeler played great defense Just a really better shot I mean he challenged out there ULBs fired up and theyre really you can see it now They they sense it Theyre just a possession down right now One possession gain He is absolutely on one after that shot His first three of the game Thats poked free in the hands of Cunningham Rebels have a chance to tie Well they just are so quick defensively You can you have to guard yourself against turning it over Look at that No look Dish underneath Stefen slams it down Onepoint game This is just amazing UNLB who was down double digits Theyre back in this game big time Trying to snap out of a threegame losing streak and looking like it Inside out A Cororey up top Akara and thats going to bounce over the top of the backboard and stay with the Cardinal Look at the setup from Gibbs Law Horn a ST Thats push pass reception Post guys got to get their hands ready I mean thats a good guy to have on the receiving end If youre a post guy and you playing with guards you got to have your hands up and ready Dont drop them Keep them by your side Get them up by your chest be ready for the drop off whether its an offensive rebound or a pass I mean this is a basketball game Jonah This this is a this these two teams are going at each other right now I think theyre going to review again Is that what we hear Yeah they were adjusting the game clock inside and make them make uh you know be a perimeter shooting team Yeah the running rebels have owned the paint 266 Thats the point in that department And thats the point You might might want to look at getting them to get some outside looks but then theyre hard to guard on the boards too So pick your poison Theyre on a 70 run Yeah theyre long Theyre just Look at Stanfords team Theyre long I mean look at you know B Theyre long at every position defensively Hard to go against Geler draws the foul on Cunningham And I like that Benny Gelers a tough kid He said You know what You want to play me with that much aggression Im going to drive it You know what But Im a 90 free throw shooter So keep playing me aggressively Hes a pretty cocky kid and confident I should say Not cocky but little of both Fine line right You got to have a little bit of both right To excel at this level Well we have We should come back Hopefully well get a chance to talk about that shot he did I I mean that was one of the most incredible shots Ive seen to secure the championship of the acter series You saw it And the way that he broke it down in the episode of Inside the Mine where the play wasnt even drawn for him Okori had to miss the perfect free throw for Raosi to grab a rebound and then he found him in the corner Well and Benny hadnt played I mean he he you know because Jeremy Den Smith had such a good half that he was on the bench but they put him back in and he was ready to play Thats such a good sign I told him that you know today But you know Benny gets into the game now and and smart enough Stanfords in a close game draws the foul And what is Benny Giler Hes a 91 free throw shooter Thats just a way to go get baskets and get points And uh hes getting a lot of congratulations on the sideline from his teammates as he should The leader hes hes a uh valuable to have a senior leader He gets taken off the floor for this final offensive possession here for UNLV A chance to tie going into the break Those two have been going at it Okoran gives Law Horn turns the corner The bounce underneath to Stefen and the lefty slam Boy Emanuel Stefen making a resounding statement in his UNLV debut Yeah thats just a big time uh one made field goal UNLV shot at 53 in the first half The Cardinal shot at 41 Well see how the second half shakes out A onepoint game here on this Sunday afternoon at Maples Pavilion And Shay you got a chance to c to catch up with coach Kyle Smith What did he have to say Yeah I mean he talked about how great theyre they were doing They were handling the ball really well early on but they kind of had a lab towards the end but they really want to focus on transition defense keeping the ball in front not getting blown by and forcing rotations Um and just continue to take smart shots and continue to play smart throughout the game Thank you for that Thats a great note And I got a chance to talk to Kyle Smith yesterday about what he was working on and they were trying to work on defensive situations where youre limiting your opponent to one shot Stefen is there for cleanup duty and the UNLV runin rebels have their first lead of the night Well and and they didnt get that accomplished there You you got to really you know you load up to the ball If youre loading up to the ball youre leaving the backside open for offensive tips and rebounds Those are their first second chance points of the game That three for Geler Long tracked down by Williamson Had a good first half Six points The spin The up and under No And Oy reels it in Pulls the tray and hits from downtown Yeah thats the big play uh player were talking about He just seems when his team needs him the most to step up and deliver Hes done it all season Well its not a fluke that hes been averaging over 21 points per game Hes one of just two freshman in the country along with Dukes Cameron Boozer to average over 20 a night Bounce underneath to Steph in Raosi met him at the mountaintop Thats a big time block there I thought that was a sure to denied at the rim Heres another look at it Heres the drop off and he brought the ball down a little bit and thought it was going to be an easy dunk Uhuh The eighth Raosi rejection of the season as he takes a seat Well hes Samplers got some big guys inside and youre not just going to go over the top of them that easily Agarwal had 10 points in the first half Okore tries it again and hell bobbles it to himself Theres another offensive rebound Agaral from straightaway Pulled down by Gibbs Lawhorn Yeah I think Kyle Smith doesnt like all the barrage of threes cheering No whistle Advantage for Stanford O Cory takes the bump and it lips out Stays here for a moment for Brown Tried to slap it in Stepped on the sideline or Yeah touched it last Its going back to Stanford Little bit of a frenetic sequence to start the second half UNLV is really playing with a lot of emotion right now Theres a lot of you know talking amongst the teammates They really want this game And Stampers up against a pretty aggressive opponent right here A par cant get the push shot Rebound Stephan And you mentioned something interesting coach how you felt Stanford was shooting a lot of shots on the perimeter How do they get some looks closer to the basket Well its a tough Theyre going against an athletic team You just got to stay with it Par is a guy that can get him there Hes tough They got a couple of guys that drove it earlier Boy Cunningham just clearing out space May have extended the elbow No call Knots it up at 42 Yeah again you got to be aggressive against this UNLB team They are really aggressive Its just about getting those opportunities Hilt misses the teardrop Well there you go Theres another offensive rebound because theyre attacking inside Nice pass by dealer You know its a its a marathon Its not a short sprint You got to continue to go at this UNLV team Thats easier said than done Theyve been really playing with energy Ute got a chance to play for Belgium in Euro basket this past summer Actually the assistant coaches for Stanford went to see him play as thats knocked off of the Cardinal So they knew what they were getting when they brought him in Oh good player Oh good player And theyre going to need him to step up there Stanfords big guys are going to have to step up this game try to create an edge UNLV again playing with energy playing with a lot of fire Aiden Cam picked up two quickies in the first half He has yet to enter Active hands from Hilte force the turnover Akara taking flight Met at the top Tipped around Secured by Apara Balls got some movement Hamilton with the swat Tracked down by Okori Theyve got one man advantage And the ref says play on Gelers thought he had earned a whistle Step back three is good Many Benny Giler said You know what Youre going to play physical with me I got something for you I mean thats just a toughness on toughness Third threepoint hit gives Lawler strong to the rim Yeah Waller just made a comment I think it was weight room or something along those lines I I love the competitiveness of these two teams I This is like a tournament setting type game whether its conference or postseason These teams going at each other Well hes got Big 10 blood coming over from Illinois and the fighting Alii the past two seasons Geler tripped finds Apara somehow Agarwal for three Yeah good look by Okara Benny Ger keeping the possession alive They you know Stanford can shoot it Theyve got to get some drives and dishes to get some easy ones Theyre shooting it well in this second half Stefan with a series of moves and floats it up and in And we are watching some exquisite basketball here This is like an NBA game This is like an NBA game Well there was some contact there Theyre not calling anything Cant challenge a non non call Cory thought he was tugged down did earn a whistle back Uh theres no heat checks Theres no first look looks now And thats what Kyle Smith I think was frustrated He thought earlier a couple of shots were quick but when when his team can get those shots in rhythm uh hes a hes going to let his players play and let his players shoot for good reason because they can shoot it Well they always play with a lot of confidence They hit 14 threepointers against Portland in their last game They already have eight so far today Yeah you can get a little happy with it but but I think if youre getting in as we just discussed off of those three scenarios those are good shots In fact their last two games theyve hit at least 13 Hamilton backing down Hammond who just reentered and he ties it up at 48 Yeah UNLVs been able to get into the paint And again if youre Stanford you got to make them kick it out and maybe take some threes They just havent shot many And and and when they have this year they havent made them Theyre 28 on the year If youre a UNLV fan thats why its so almost frustrating when you watch Hamilton Hes so good if he can just stay out on the floor as they cough it up Gives Law Horn down the lane Was fouled from behind and he earns a trip to the free throw line Yeah Stanford thought that there was a kick ball You dont hear a whistle You going to continue to play Uh you cant play referee out on the floor A lot of players Ive had have done that and I said Hey guys Im not blowing the whistle Whether that was the right call or not you hear a whistle you stop otherwise keep playing and they got beat in transition by a guy that knows how to beat him Coach Passner said that Dre Gibbs Law Horn kind of reminds him of Jose Alvarado whom he coached at Georgia Tech similar size and build and and they both play with a lot of energy and emotion They dont need to be high volume shooters No theyre theyre hyped I mean you know theres a lot of emotion and you know you dont want to take away that emotion from some of the players that havent because thats their thats their strength Its not an Achilles Its a strength for guys that play with high energy And by the way their coach plays with high energy Your coaches with high energy So uh you kind of take on the personality of your coach as well Its Law Horn with nine as the running Rebels go back in front Yeah theres a zone Benny Geler Eddie Giler thought he got fouled Ball was slapped out of his hands might have gone off a Bennett manyers foot but hes saying Look can you call the slap down But but UNLVs in his zone Jonas so if youre in a zone you got to get you got to really think they might want to challenge here Do you think UNLV has been more effective in a certain defensive scheme No they just theyve been very aggressive and youre playing against an aggressive team and theyre zoning right now Theyre zoning Stanford had a hard time getting looks in and around the paint Dense Smith is fouled on the pass Well theyve got veterans on the floor Jeremy Den Smith Benny Giler Aubara These are guys that have played now you know several years at collegiate basketball So theyve got some experienced guys but UNLV is going to stay in that zone it looks like Good close from Brown Geler off the front rim And theres Gibbs Law Horn tracking down his third board UNLV just matches whatever level of energy he plays with and embodies And hes the leader Pick and pop for Cunningham Tapped off the glass Stefen battling for the offensive board Rips it away finds Cunningham underneath who had a lot of contact in the tip in is back good for Brown Lot of energy again from UNLV They missed some shots but Kyle Smith Ive seen enough He calls it I think a very opportune timeout to talk about it See if they can slow down the running Rebels Largest lead of the talking about is getting stops on defense rebounding and coming up with the ball and executing on offense They keep turning it over and theyre getting a lot of points off of turnovers So they really need to take care of the ball and rebound the basketball Apara misses the three and thank you for that Shay Yeah coach you and I were talking at the break about potential changes that Stanford can make as Dent Smith Hoist in hits a three Finally gets one to go His first from the outside Thats one change Let Jeremy D Smith go to work Hes hit some huge shots He willed that team into victory against uh uh St Louis And also you know they got to keep out of the paint going oneonone to the basket and scoring So theyve got 40 points in the paint Jonah 40 Count it And if youre getting to the paint oneonone you got to get guys in there either by sagging man or zone So look for Stanford to make some adjustments there Yeah theyve had a tough time combating the aggressiveness from UNLV To your point boy 40 points in the paint Theres still 13 minutes to play Oppar with a tough catch round the horn It goes to Okorei Den Smith again Good box out from Gibbs Law Horn battle on the ground Hilts got it A par through the trees Heads to the line Big hustle play by Hiltte Gets on the floor Presence of mind to find Apara Look at this Apara keeping it alive with a tip Look at that play Doesnt get up doesnt travel and finds his teammate Those are hustle plays You need more of those Now if youre Stanford you got to solve the other end You know how do you keep this UNLV team from getting to the basket 40 points in the paint Well as much as weve talked about Stefen on UNLVs side hell got 11 rebounds so far Yeah And and and hes done a great job And and Stanford can get to the line Theyre a team that knows how to get to the line Theyre going to have to be aggressive against this aggressive UNLB team and attack the paint try to themselves to get some free throws here because theyve got some mismatches there Uh UNLV though is is just really done such a good job and theyve really willed themselves to getting to the basket Now you see Stanford going to the zone and I think thats a good move First free throws of the game for Aara and the midrange jumper goes down for Gibbs Law Horn Well I used to play and when I go to zone a team would hit a shot I change right back out of it J laughter you cant do that You got to make them do it again And now you got UNLV going back and theyre going back to the 131 where they had success Well you have to be fluid right You cant just be so stubborn to keep the same defensive scheme Well you keep your team out of the the paint The 131 will give you some shots in the corner Uh there will be some open areas against the 131 Den Smith now one for four from deep gives Law Horn blocked inside Okorei drew the assignment met the challenge and Den Smith on the other end Great job by Aorei leading his teammate Jeremy Den Smith That was a great great pass ahead on the break C Stanford back to the zone again saying lets see you score that one again Well give you one Boy for how animated as Aara initially stuffed Stefan underneath Frazz animated as Gibbs Law Horn has been Oori has just answered the call but very intricate Theyre matching up principles Theyre theyre good and and I can tell you theyre good but you might want to put 10 feet in the paint and say Okay UNLB were going to have you shoot the ball and see how good you are from out there Because they just havent The scores theyve gotten against the zone would have been inside and the foul they gave up was at the rim cheering Stephen splits a pair but tap back out Good effort by Hamilton Gives Lawhorn turn the corner and it slipped through the wickets and its going back to Stanford Stanford very fortunate there Jonah That could have been a a tap out for another reload another two or a threepointer Uh that would have been a deflator Now Stanford gets to reload and try to attack this defensive pressure by UNLV Well these are two of the best ball handling teams in the country Stanford has the second lowest or best turnover margin in the ACC And UNLV only averages 12 turnovers a game Both teams both have nine Yeah Well thats a credit to the defenses putting pressure here But its the one three zone 131 zone and there is a weakness inside They can opt it into heel but forced to throw it back out Apara Agarwal with three and it poked from behind by Brown Yeah very quick You go to the basket against UNLV you got to protect the basketball Thats turnover number 10 for Stanford Agural has got a team high 13 Three different Cardinal players in double figures Two for the running Rebels Stephen with 15 and eight on the night Tough fall away Well contested by Heil Yeah good defense Kept them on the perimeter Didnt let him get to the rim Those two are battling underneath as Helte finally induces a whistle Hed been begging for it throughout the game Finally gets it there Well theres an advantage there for Stanford Theyve got the inside sealed off and theyve got weapons in Jeremy Den Smith and Okori and Benny Giler when theyre on the floor because not only can those three shoot it but they can attack you against aggressive defense So Stanfords got some weapons too They got to take advantage of them Its not in the act of shooting though So forced to throw it from underneath Dent Smith open hit five of those gets Portland Hiltte clears some space and he draws a foul and theres the advantage Stanford again Shot goes up on the rim and Hilt is able to get the offensive rebound but there he is Thats good job You got to get to the free throw line If shots not falling find a way Kyle Smith second season here with Stanford Came just the second coach in program history to win 20 or more games in his first season And they set records last year especially in this building terms of wins 17 wins here at Maples Pavilion They took care of business at home I felt like when I coached I gave them all their wins when I was here but but Ill tell you thats just thats getting it done Cal Smith uh 17 home wins Who wouldnt want that I think I had one team in Cal that had 16 I thought that was a lot 17s really getting it done Den Smith fighting for it Last touch by UNLV Yeah its good hustle play Youre going to have to make some of those plays today Jonah Youre not going to get by UNLV if you dont make some of these hustle plays UNLV awfully aggressive team And Smith just able to get into the corner Drop down Hell tay Hes got that weight underneath on Jones for the bucket Yeah thats just what you want to do Go to your big guys underneath and theyll finish for you There were questions from the coaching staff who could replace Maxim Ray No as Hamilton is fouled Theyre hoping that hell take can become that guy Im not sure you replace them but you got to get some guys that can do some things and but youre right that those good But theres again yet another UNLV player getting to the rim all the way to the basket and and thats just you know that if youre Stanford you got to find a way to keep this UNLV team out of the paint They they just theyve been living there Jonah Theyve got uh you know how many points now in the paint Theyve got a ton They may end up getting 50 in the paint before its over So you got to try to keep them outside Force the outside shot Hamilton a transfer from High Point Played two seasons in the Big South with the Panthers Was a Lou Henson Award finalist given to the top mid major mens basketball player annually cant hit that one But hes been a great addition to this UNLV team Again one of 13 newcomers for coach Passner So you already have the fact that hes a first year coach Youve dealt with a rash of injuries and you got 13 new players Still trying to find their chemistry along this windy season Rahosi underneath Lot of contact and earned a late whistle Yeah I like that sequence right there Theyre really playing aggressively on Stanfords guards Really denying out hard on Aorei and Dent Smith and and Aora And what theyre doing is theyre giving the big guys some room inside to drive it to get to the rim Good smart play by Rahosi Rahosi of course followed Coach Smith at Washington State Was a walkon with the Cougars during his first two college basketball seasons Then last year they were trying to find a home for him Found one in Claremont Mud scripts playing with the division three stags Was an allAmerican and when coach Smith had an opportunity to bring him back made sure he did Now that was a good find And you know again the only area hes got to shore up here is in free throws Hes only shooting 29 on the year Make that about 25 Now heres a Stanford zone Stanford back to the zone Look at there Stolen away by Okori Okorei with a burst pass Williamson The euro step No Raosi there for the offensive rebound Now the zone paid some dividends there They got the steel out of it A little different look Pack in the paint 17th offensive rebound for Stanford Yeah thats thats being aggressive Theyre sting theyre staying with that zone Hamilton nearly got it to fall And that thats that shouldnt happen in the zone Stanford playing the playing out wide again They packed it tighter last time got the steel I think they go back to that theyll have some dividends And the you see Benny Geler coming back in the lineup The veteran Hamilton back at the line where he split a pair is the former Mississippi Gatorade player of the year In fact his father Tang achieved the same thing during the 9697 season They became the first fatherson duo to win the award in the state Of course his father had a great college career played a season in the NBA with the Miami Heat So runs in the family Splits a pair there Jonah youve done your work Got to come prepped coach You do your work Im impressed Listen anytime youre also affiliated with the University of Wisconsin which you were we got were Badgers Im a Badger alum so you got to do your work Absolutely Yeah we we we go back No it is interesting now at this juncture of the game Stanfords a very good free throw shooting team If they can they can get to the foul line against this tough defense by UNLV aggressive defense When you play aggressive teams I said this earlier you you have to maintain your aggressiveness not be afraid to drive the aggressive players and try to draw fouls and A of can do that Chisum Aora has done that his career Hes hes had some games where hes been at the line a ton Senior out of Bronxville New York And I asked coach about Akapara and where he challenged him this past offseason and it was really just his attitude Always has the talent but being able to play composed throughout a game Yeah And I think thats a good good play And you know Kyle Smith teams have done that Theyve got guys that that have adjusted that have improved You look at a coaching staff and you say How are these players gotten so good Youd mentioned Maxine Reo How good did he get Thats a credit not just to Maxine but thats a credit to the coaching staff and Kyle Smith to put them in a position to improve and dedicate yourself to player improvement Not to mention he is now three points shy of scoring a000 career points is Apara So keeping a close watch on that as well as Tyron Jones is back in He had a great first half six points The southpaw Al Green hits from the corner A big three for UNLV Thats a good looking shot Green knocked it down from the corner again Two guys on the ball for Stanford Want to see if he can keep one guy in the ball not two And they lost a man in the corner Wide open shot Hes got more than just love and happiness Hes got a tray ball underneath Aar had it knocked loose Scooped up by Green Rebels on the move with Williamson That was just their third three of the game Gibbs Lawler slides it down to Hamilton Green wants it way off the mark Here comes Giler Now they had a power was open on the break Cam back in for Stanford was dealing with foul trouble in the first half This is a lineup they like Two bigs Raosi blocked inside Gets it back Dropped down to Cammon and its ripped away by Hamilton Yeah a little unselfish there Probably should have brought it up himself Had a chance to get to the rim and draw a foul Stanford back in the zone Hell stay with us Shifted more though into kind of a two3 Hand off Williamson on the curl Cross quarter to Hamilton Skying up is Okori leaking out barreling right into the chest of Green Rips it away trying to draw the foul Three on two for the running Rebels Gives Lawler spins in the paint Stripped and a whistle cheering Fans disapprove Gives Law Horn stepping on the gap Got the rallying towels for the home fans cheering on their Cardinal looking to improve to 7 and one which would be their best start since 2019 2020 Taking on a tough UNLV team thats been tested so far this year Hamilton boy he moves Cam about 2 feet Missed around the rim Second tip no Third tip is good with the off hand for number two Again getting to the rim UNLB finding a way Hamilton now in double figures with 12 points four rebounds three assists Does have those three personals Again hes fouled out five times this year in four straight games Oh Cory between the legs jumper high pointed Gibbs Lawler comes out of the pack Green slammed on the brakes He dropped Octara but couldnt finish it off Yeah break there for Stanford That was looked like was going to be a sure two Came up a little short but youll be driving it to the basket And Den Smith is coming in for dealer We saw this a little bit against St Louis coach those two rotating in and out for one another Yeah and theyve you know Cory Cory being left in the game Um we got a challenge here UNLB challenging that last call They may have a point here And whats important about that is they utilized the challenge in the first half but because it was successful they were granted another one Yeah And Ive always thought in this rule if you have a chance to challenge and you think you got a chance thats good But you know what else it does for it Gives you a timeout on the floor So now you get to talk to your team but heres the heres the play Well it gives you a a timeout if its successful Yes But youre still while its being challenged youre talking to your team So you didnt you might have lost the the timeout you get next time but you got that one and youre talking to your team So thats a tough one here Remember the rule too Jonah Youve got to got to overrule it You you it cant be close Its got to be definitely uh clearcut from this angle What are you seeing Well youre asking the I got pretty good vision But thats why you get paid the big bucks Yeah Well Im You got better eyes Im But you know thats the good news is Yeah Lets go Lets get one more if we can because theres always different angles Thats what the officials are doing here They dont just look at one angle Theyre looking at two angles And theres the ball being exposed There is a hand underneath but it still looks like um Yeah thats thats still looks like it was a Stanford hand Theres a hand underneath too Is theres a theres two hands on the ball Looks from that angle like maybe Green that left hand touched it last slow it down like that See that what the officials are discussing is it cant be a maybe Its got to be yes right Its got to be a definite and and if its not they dont they uphold they they dont change it And the call on the floor whats important awarded the ball to Stanford Yeah So lets see Didnt seem like there was enough evidence from the angles that we saw Yeah Then again you and I have seen Stranger Things Yeah I cant Yeah I think theyre going to keep it here Lets see And theyre going to overturn it review The challenge by UNLV on the out of bounds is successful It will be their ball on the baseline with 20 seconds on the shot clock I think Stanford not happy about that However that is their last challenge of the game Yep So UNLV has no more challenges but theyre two for two this afternoon Coach Smith cant believe it And they give it away Okori Okari uh pardon Noi stole the inbounds pass It happened so fast Jonah I mean I got tripped up in my own words Yeah No listen That happens so quickly I mean watch this Look at the the deflection and the retention I mean thats just anticipation What do you do when youre playing defense Tony You watch your opponents eyes His eyes will tell you everything Well Cory with 10 points Thats the front end of the one Unless you play against a guy thats giving you a no look True Now that then you the eyes dont tell you everything Dual threat then Thats right But or triple threat really You know hit a couple of threes You must have played some basketball I did coach Madison Wisconsin I did Played a little club ball in Madison as well But but but now Stanford if youre them youre going to go back and youre going to play in the zone Youre going to try to keep UNLV out of the paint You got to really play the angles Get your hands active in the zone Another game coming down to the wire for the Cardinal Williamson with a burst to the rim and it ladles out Stanford very fortunate though again getting all the way to the rim but leaving it short Cardinals shooting at just 36 but its in their timely defense thats kept them in it Dent Smith slides his way for two Yeah you know Joan Im less about what Stanfords shooting offensively Its more about the defensive end here They want to win this game Theyre going to have to secure it defensively Get some stops Dive to the middle for Gibbs Law Horn met by Hilt Out to Williamson for three and it swirls around Maples Pavilion and falls out But it falls out but percentages dont lie And UNLV has not shot a great percentage on the year You can live with that shot even if it goes in Theyre 30 tonight three for 10 to your point on the season shooting at just 28 from deep Late clock Oh Cory Long two rattles in I said this earlier Jon Ill say it again He seems to hit every big shot Stanford needs He can be quiet Theres a turnover going the other way And he can be quiet but when the game is on the line this young man as a freshman has hit some huge shots for his Cardinal Coach Smiths wife Katie noticed that he was extraordinarily happy this past summer and he said Well yeah its because I got a real point guard coming in this year Hes got a real good point guard coming in this year Plays with so much poise and such a humble star Step back three Well this place would have erupted had he hit that A little little bit of heat check there Green with a stutter inside the paint No Stefen Hes battling four fouls Draws one underneath Yeah you dont want to give up You dont dont want to give up offensive rebounds Cal Smith pleading with his team Hey secure the defensive rebound We got a good one Stephins one rebound shy of Billian And Emmen Emanuel Stefen is heading to the line This is kind of foreign territory for for both teams early in the year Well you know I never felt this way when I was coaching that these were good games for you I because you were in the pressure of the game but in the end this is a good game for both of these teams to play this game before they get into the conference testing each other cheering A lot of emotion a lot of twists and turns in this game strategy guys having to step up I mean this is what you play these nonconference games for and uh theyre going to get something out of this game both teams And its pretty impressive for Stephan He started playing basketball just in 2019 Spent time at the NBA Academy in Africa prior to arriving in the US He hasnt been playing basketball very long Uh hes just going to I mean the future is bright and you can see his ability Densmith and Geler in there Hell with a clean roll to the rim I love to look for Jeremy Dmith What a veteran move to get that ball to his big fella over the top Smart play well executed He can certainly do that is Dent Smith Had 17 assists last year with the Toros Jones drives baseline Low catch for Stefen Hell take trying to match him again The floater is good on the turnaround Yeah got to play his left shoulder He likes going over that left shoulder Heres the fouls we talked about Now if youre Stanford you have the luxury of having two to three guys even put Agarwal in the mix that can really shoot free throws So thats what you want Keep the ball in your best ball handlers and free throw shooters hands Jeremy Dent Smith at the line First season with Stanford One of those guys that coach Smith calls a PhD poor hungry driven I love it Player I love that Thats I got to remember that Talked to Kyle about that later I I didnt I didnt know that I Well the first thing that coach said to him when they had a practice when they were both heading to the locker room grabbing a Cliff Bar and a Gatorade he said Did you have this at Dominguez Hills laughter but hes just super grateful Jeremy Dmith to be here No And you know what Hes hes showing you that hes hes going to take advantage of his opportunities But I mean again a luxury for Stanford You got at 90 plus You got Agar almost 90 and Jeremy Den Smith shooting you know in high 70s Theyve got guys Ocari that can knock down free throws Stanford back in that zone matching up to a guy in their area Crossover for Jones Attacks And thats thats the one and thats the one weak area that you got to play You get the ball in the high post your wings have to pinch in and your guards have to get the elbows Wings have to get down to the blocks But they fouled the right guy And its interesting coach not to cut you off but its interesting because here you have UNLV Their record is 3 and five Stanford 71 Both teams have fared pretty well in the early going Obviously the running rebels their record doesnt reflect it but theyve been in a lot of big games They played against Ruters and Maryland and Alabama and had leads And theyve had leads And then Stanford has been in some tight games pulling one out against Minnesota pulling one out against St Louis But in a matchup like this who do you think kind of has the edge in a close game down the stretch Whoevers got the ball last Okay cuz its going to be a close game Hows that for an answer Uh you know now both these teams have some big play guys and and theyre competitive I I just like the way theyre competing These teams are competing and you got to admire that as a coach or a fan Good close from Jones preventing Agarwal whos already hit three threes Dent Smith comes up short Jones trying to spin past Agural Tough floater No theres Stephen Gobbles up his 10th rebound and hes got a double double Rifle it underneath Jones blocked but a foul on heel today Yeah good call by the officials Thats Thats an impressive play by Tyron Jones keeping the ball alive They fans thought there was a travel earlier Number 15 Heres the play Here is a loose ball Theres one two Maybe fans have might know something there but that was definitely a foul on the offensive rebound Heres Stanford now You got to block out cuz Jones not a great free throw shooter cheering And just the presence of Emanuel Stefen has been able to unlock so much more for Tyron Jones Well he Yeah hes aggressive and hes 7 foot tall and he plays with a lot of aggression again Jones hits the first but you got to got to box out if youre Stanford here Cant get the second Skying forward is Hilteford holds the lead Nice defensive rebound by Hilt Stanford as you say holds the onepoint lead right here And Cam just overshot Hell take Yeah right idea by Aiden Cam The thought was there Thats where you wanted to go with the ball but you got to just you got to throw the kind of pass you would want to receive Just got a little bit excited but hell hell settle down Now what do you get to do Get to make it up on defense You get to be on the defensive end Stanford needs a stop Williamson and Stefen each nursing four personals and the skip pass intercepted by Agarwal Yeah that was a good move Ryan Agarwal didnt fool him He read the crosscourt pass Balls into Corys hand Now Cory at the controls late double able to spin away from it then lost it in the trap Flipped up ahead Gibbs Law Horn is fouled by Okori and he will head to the line Very uncharacteristic by very uncharacteristic by Ibuka Aorei to lose the ball on a turnover and a steel kind of relaxed Didnt see the other defender Saw his immediate defender Didnt see a second defender coming to the ball This aggressive this team for UNLV Jonah very aggressive You better have your wits about you Gives Law Horn number one on the team and steals Thats why cheering The saving grace for Stanford though has been the free throw woes Just 57 from the line for UNLV cheering That 85 free throw shooter You wouldnt have known it with that last miss But percentages are different when the games are on the line for both teams cheering Fans are making some noise Quick timeout called by coach Passner Yeah like the timeout by Josh Pasner Nine Agarwals got 13 Apar has got eight and hell take closing in one point shy of a double double Hes been tremendous on the glass with 14 keeping extra possessions alive If if youre UNLB you dont need to foul anybody You need to play straight up You dont want to foul Theyre going back to the manto man here Four for 15 from deep as Stanford in this second half Oara stripped by Stefen Flipped up ahead for Gibbs Law Horn whos tripped and fouled cheering That Chisum Oopar didnt see the second defender coming That was an isolation A good call by the Stanford staff to get him the ball Hes usually very good at beating his man but you cannot beat forehand slapping down on it Didnt see the second defender Thats just good helpside defense Well I got to tell you coach I know that basketball is a team but the impact that Stefan has had individually changes the entire complexion of who this UNLV team is Well hes aggressive You know you talk about a sevenfooter a lot of teams just use a sevenfooter because of his size Hes 7 foot and hes aggressive He moves his feet he moves his hands hes active Uh what a great addition to this team Hes made the difference in this game Coach has told us he would play limited minutes Hes been invaluable out there Hes played a lot Hes going to play as many minutes as I could play him I Ill tell you that And I think Josh Passer feels the same And that was a that ball just snuck in there for Gibbs Lawren And now hell get a second to see if he can extend by two Hes three for five at the line Make it four for six And NLV up by a pair And now youre Stanford You got to get a sure two or get to the foul line Guilt picks off gives Law Horn Okorei with the stiff arm No Falls back into HIS HANDS LEFT LEG COUNT IT And add one on the house cheering applause Oh the presence of mind Iuka Cory misses the first one Here it is Maybe a little push off Got away with one on the big fella but hes there on the spot And what does he do Goes to his off hand Jonah the left hand You fans out there learn to use your left He was going to get that shot off to his right but puts it in his left hand scores it and gets fouled A chance to extend the lead by one Coach spoke to him 15 minutes before his first game and told him Youre going to do really well here Theres going to be a lot of attention and were going to have to manage it together And his stardom just continues to rise in this freshman campaign And hes given Stanford a onepoint lead as coach Passner calls a timeout Hell take a full another really good timeout because you only Hamilton Stefen Williamson and gives Law Horn the five on the floor Biggest danger you have is trying to keep UNLV off the glass because theyre so good at attacking the glass offensively Williamson closed off by Dent Smith Down by one Hamilton slams on the brakes Floater is good and the Rebels retake the lead And Kyle Smith takes a seat and he will allow his freshman to play on Our drives hangs off the rim but a foul Well you said it Jonah Youre letting your even as a freshman maybe your best player make a move And that was a definite bump A definite bump Good call by the officials because I think it affected the shot And now you got a Cory here And you know I like you I like what what Stanford just did They cleared their guys They dont want an over the back foul Theyre getting their guys out of there trusting their guards to stay in there But cheering leaves the door open now for UNLV to hold for a final shot Well Percys going to make this shot Yeah not so quick Eight for 11 from the line Ties it up at 74 And coach Smith wants time Yeah Corys not have those odds that hes also able with his assist to get you know to to make an assist So I like the ball in his hands I think Stanford looks like they might now be going back to manto man and not playing their zone in this final possession Lets see to their feet here at Maples Pavilion Williamson across the timeline Rebels trying to win it on the road and pull off the stunner Hamilton a late whistle with 38 Theyre calling it against Jeremy Dent Smith And coach Smith is going to challenge this Hes on his arm And it looked like he held his arm Its on his arm Yep And thats unfortunate because you just got to go straight up and we said dont foul and check that he wont actually challenge it because I think he just saw the same replay that you and I saw Well again if youre Stanford cheering and Hamilton misses the first Youre going to have a chance here if you get a defensive rebound Theyre just 60 for this game coach and Hamilton on the season 73 applause cheering In O Corey with two across the timeline Okore gets it off in time and the running rebels come into Maples Pavilion and pull off the shocker on the road 7574
