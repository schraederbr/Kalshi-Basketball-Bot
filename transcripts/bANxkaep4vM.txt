Notre Dame is having but the attitude with which they are doing it Micah Shrewsberry and his entire staff are quick to say you go to practice you would never know that we had lost games here the attitude of the players theyre continuing to build and continuing to play hard its almost like they dont know what they dont know and uh just a great group of young men that uh that seem like at least from michah Shrewsberry seat a joy to coach wake in white Notre Dame in blue Ron Gro Tommy morresy Justin Porterfield the officials and away we go here in the second game of the day Burton the Easy Choice as the ACCC Rookie of the Year 17 points 4 and 1 half assists almost two steals per game as well good job by hildr to get out on Shrewsberry he looked like he was going to set a back screen but instead took a down screen and he could have easily gotten a shot there if not for hilford Tay Davis spins inside and has it to block by Andrew Carr Carr did a nice job of Walling up nobody stops the ball and Salis buries a three thats the kind of start that Hunter Salis needed to get off to after only scoring seven points at Notre Dame only single digit scoring game of the season nobody in the ACC has played more minutes this year than Hunter Salis and a worthy First Team all ACCC performer why would you take him out coaches are funny that way Marcus buron will not get the bouns and Fon Reed down with the rebound Fon Reed their leading rebounder per game oopy Miller wide open and what a start for the Demon Deacons boy two absolutely wide openen looks from Beyond The Arc yeah one in transition but that shot by poopy Miller right from the catch spot got to make him put it on the deck six nothing Wake Early shrew B 5 threes yesterday really shot it well in conference play better than 41 from from Beyond The Arc kned Away by Reed cam hilr is there with a hand up Miller driving on Burton a bump and a foul on Marcus Burton well that is speed on speed and Hunter Salis coming down in transition and nobody really picked him up just gets to the middle of the floor and J just a little bit slow getting a hand up and then bopy Miller youre not going to get anything easier than that you dont get that much time to shoot in a game of horse is see the best boopy in the college game today hes top 10 boopies of all time at 20 points eight or more times this year a season high of 27 against Miami top 15 in the conference who have both scoring and assist pretty good back court with him Salis and hildr so fast with the ball you saw it right there going up against another fast player in Marcus Applause buron one of two s nothing Applause Music Applause weight another important player for Notre Dames going to be Tay Davis he was excellent against Georgia Tech that defensive play he made at the end with that deflection and steel that saved the game Burton spins off the glass no good and then gets it back shot clock did not reset it didnt hit the rim Shrewsberry misses the three a great Hustle by Davis to keep it alive and Notre Dame still got the ball the Irish the five players they have on the floor right now not one of them played a minute for this team last year the roster is comprised almost entirely of freshman and transfers the one exception really would be Matt Zona we played 140 minutes last year for Notre Applause Dame Booth short on the three boy give Notre Dame credit they are battling on the offensive glass and Tay Davis weighs it in well Tay Davis gets almost two offensive rebounds per game and averages over five per game from Indianapolis a transfer from Sean Music Hall the cut by Carr and itll go with just a quick little drop step to get to that left shoulder that was a quick strong Applause move three minutes in Wake by seven cam HR looks locked in defensively Burton draws a crowd and a foul is called that will send Davis to the Applause Line Andrew Carr a senior from Pennsylvania started his career at Delaware just a really quick move to that left shoulder his footwork is really good hes hit 34 threes on the season number 1av Tay Davis at the line double figures in six consecutive games for Notre Dame averaging almost 13 points per game in that stretch and again Notre Dame played or is playing its best basketball right now theyve won six out of nine beat Virginia Tech beat Wade Forest beat Clemson this is not a team to be taken Applause lightly Notre Dame theyre not necessarily a packline defensive team but they do pack it in and this Wake Forest team is tough to pack it in on because theyve got so many good Shooters loose ball bounced right into the hands of Andrew Carr who flushed it well hes got great length doesnt he pretty nice combo up front Carr and read very different kinds of players but they complement each other well youve got cards able to stretch the floor and then Reed has that size and rebounding ability can finish around the basket he lost and a couple of guys with whistles agreed with you first sub of the game is coming for Wake Forest right now Matthew Marsh is 71 Jr from Cornwall England will take the place of Fon Reed Marsh not getting as many minutes this year because of the arrival of Reed who was granted a second time transfer back in December and shortly thereafter moved into the starting lineup Marsh not an outside shooter at all he knows exactly what he is and very efficient around the Applause rim good recovery by Davis on Salis Salis creates a little space left it short but draws the foul pretty good start here for Wake Forest and a huge game for them up early going on the season Wake Forest is 19 and 12 119 in the league their net is 38 for kenpom they are 26 they have beaten Duke Clemson Virginia Florida did lose three of their last four some winnable games there Joe lardy has them in the first four out and Steve Forbes just I mean you cant let let it consume you but this is a a team that wound up on the wrong side of the bubble last year they want to make this easy on Everybody by winning at least a couple of games here in this tournament but even if they win this one they got to play pit tomorrow well you mentioned theyve beaten Duke beat Clemson but they also beat pit split with them they beat Virginia and they had an early season win against Florida so those are other quality wins they can rely upon but youre right you dont want to leave it to the committee if you can settle it on the floor here I would imagine theres nothing longer than being a bubble team getting knocked out of your conference tourament on a Wednesday or a Thursday and Sunday must feel like its years away when youre in that kind of a situation as Burton is foul to buy car thats going to be a a tough switch out for a big guy to try to stay in front of Burton well you dont have to put your hands on him car just put both hands out and once you have two hands on the ball handler thats an easy automatic call for the official but car see theyre both hands come out easy call even though the contact was minimal you know if you can have almost violent body contact there but you put your hands on theyre going to call that right away Julet Roper the second is checked in for the Irish a transfer from Northwestern Burton behind the back picks up the dribble heres roer Burton launches and hits a deep three he is just Fearless at 31 points in the game against Wake Forest in South B he is from Mishawaka Indiana just down the street from South B like they couldnt make up their minds Milwaukee or Indiana what are they going to do Salis is wide open and hits another one and boy is he playing with a lot of confidence in two games against Duke Hunter Salis averaged 25 points he was 21 of 33 in those two games Applause heres shrewbury he does not need much time or space but missed that one well cam HR did a great job of trailing him and he was almost behind him reaching up over the top really bothered Bron Shrewsberry with that shot car tipped up by Marsh wont go Notre Dame B is a really good freshman back court for Notre Dame with Burton and Shrewsberry Shrewsberry does such a great job of moving without the ball he must run six miles in a game got to go up right away ke cant get the shot off yeah he turned it over he changed his pivot foot its a great job by Carr to wall up and stay big you watch Hunter Salis just you get caught in no mans land then trying to switch out they xed and Roper just couldnt get there just good ball movement and whos had more success in the transfer portal the last three years than Steve Forbes Alis Williams play over the year couple of years ago Ty app will be first team all League Hunter Salis First Team all League like Indiana Jones in the Last Crusade he chose wisely and Fon Reed and bopy Miller are also transfers and got a foul going against wake Notre Dame does a very good job defensively of getting hand down low in the passing Lane for those little pocket passes they do it very well in pick and roll defense and they did it very well there to get that deflection in steel Parker Frederickson a freshman from Bigby Oklahoma number 20 in white into the game for Wake he can shoot it rer into the paint cant get the shot off now he and hits the three Hunter Salis helped off and once the pass came out thats its tough to recover there when the ball comes out ballside Miller steps in pulls up at the elbow and knocks it down well done poopy Miller didnt play a lot last season but he was all freshman all ma freshman team at Central Michigan had an injury that Li lied him only to four games last year but hes had a really nice year for Steve Forbes Burton the kick and the corner three around and out for Matt Zona Zona had some really good minutes yesterday against Georgia Tech wound up with seven points but made some really positive plays in the game when he was in there and again of the returning players he has by far the most minutes its almost a brand new team wo Salis off the back of the rim I believe he certainly he got it up and over the rim but couldnt finish it he measured that one just Walts down the lane with that hesitation move Burton misses the three and Reed clearing out traffic for another rebound yeah Salis had that ball in his hands and Reeds like come on man get out of here Im not taking your assist away dont mess with my rebounds you guards are so cute now leave me alone let me do let me do my job down here Salis from the wing and look at that four Notre Dame players car comes out with it and sales converts what a great play by Andrew Carr first the rebound where he just used his length and then when he was other just thank you uh obviously the kids are involved as well when Janetta suffered the stroke Steve was in Kuwait operation hardwood this is back on August the 8 he was literally half a world away and it took a little while for the kids to not to be be able to get to him and notify him and obviously it took a while for him to come back and uh just so wonderful again to see Janetta here and to see the whole family together here with the ACC tournament well Steve Forbes youre not going to find a better guy hes just a got a huge Applause heart poopy Miller Coast to Coast a really good job defensively by Wake Forest especially Zack Keller jumping in front getting that steel and starting the break and Wake Forest has just imposed their will on both ends watch watch Zack Keller right in the middle of the lane in helps side defense and that started the break and boy Miller right down Main Street all the way to the Applause 10 and the lead grows for wake up 14 8 and 12 minutes in you expect Wake Forest to put points on the board but the defense has been impressive I mean cam hrth has done a really nice job on Bradon truberry active in switches to take things away theyre switching up to get into Notre Dame JR kesn with the ball into the game for the Irish and hell pick up an assist on Carri Boos three Carri boo had a couple of big buckets in the game against Georgia techy had 15 points against Wake Forest earlier this year keep in mind and we mentioned it a couple of times Jess mentioned it Jay mentioned it Notre Dame beat Wake Forest just a couple of weeks ago that was in South B beat him 70 to 65 a good cut by Keller and hell be rewarded with a trip to the line Notre Dame doubled the post and as soon as a double came over Keller just Dove to the basket right from the top down the middle of the lane made himself available so watch the double team comes over it was Booth coming off of Keller Keller just cut right to the basket and that means that Bren Shrewsberry has got to come over from the weak side to try to stop him and thats not a fair fight physically and an air ball in the first free throw for Keller who was a starter near the beginning of the Season his minutes have declined once Fon Reed became eligible enjoying the team Civ sophomore from Highlands Ranch Colorado Fon Reed had to sit out I cant remember the number of games just because because that twotime transfer issue finally got settled and I dont know why it was such a problem but once he got back in there hes a real presence Burton with a back door cut kicks it back out and another three for booth concentrating so much on Burton that that left has left Carri Booth open two plays in a row and hes buried both of them maybe thatll open some things up for Notre Dame a 29 threepoint shooter he has not KN down a couple already today a clear out oneonone Reed and J Reed wins once you get a back down and get into basically the restricted Arc there was no reason even to Pivot there just go straight up but a good move by Fon Reed started his career at LSU went to Gonzaga now wake 7 250 hes all of that J oo that was an elbow he took one right to the Chop and Keller gets called for the foul and the wake bench explodes and said yeah he took an elbow to the face and will the officials have a look at it or just call the common foul on him theyre theyre going to have to look at it yes they are so a common foul on the defensive player but theyre going to the monitor to look to see if theres anything flagrant on the offensive player now that was definitely a foul on Keller not saying its not but you know its just a question do you consider that incidental contact or is it rise to the level of unnecessary I dont think his nose considers it incidental I would agree with Applause that the flo lock first Ron Gro Tommy morresy Justin Porterfield the official officials and theyre having a look and you can have both right the the time and foul on the defender can stand and they could give a flagrant to the offensive player absolutely never understood why all three of them have to take a look at it they let one of them blow the whistle each time why do all three of them have to look at the replay Applause I always wonder do our ratings go up when they go to the replay when we have extra viewers on replay though it is an interesting thing I I always I always thought that anytime theres a replay we should just be able to go to break they should let us get a commercial in get the game moving later on as a result all right and now one official has left the Monitor and the other ones going in so all three of them can yeah thats what Im saying like why do they all have to three look at it and how many times does it take maybe you got to maybe three allows them to break the tie if theres a tie but we will see now a powow is turned into a football game you have to have a huddle then a play then a Music huddle usually they dont stand around talk about incidental contact so maybe theres something Music Applause here and here comes the ruling white doesnt let him land the initial play thats the initial play so Applause have so the defensive foul is on Zack Keller Zack Keller yes uh for not letting him land but and then the whistle blue so its just a technicality but instead of a flagrant one its a dead ball contact technical foul so it will be two free throws yeah and youre right about the distinction its just because of the the initial foul and what the official said was Zack Keller didnt give him the opportunity to come down and it was clearly a foul thats not a problem so Salis at the line for Wake 80 free throw shooter 11 points already averaged better than 18 a game this year buries them both and these were the right calls its just boy it takes so long to get there how many times you got to look at it before you figure it out so common foul you can see the right leg of Keller and he clearly didnt let him land yeah there theres no no argument about any of these calls but Id like to see it three more times have you look at it then have our director and our producer look at it then we can talk about it so the common foul on Keller did not come with free throws so now its weight ball up by 13 good thing we got an extra day with leap year that helped out hild into re quick double and a Music turnover and that didnt need to be that quick of a pass out if you got something great but if not just dribble out of it you dribble out of it toward the sideline and then find an open teammate but that double came really quickly and Applause aggressively Logan Imes is in the game a freshman from zionville Indiana thats him with the ball zionville Indiana is right outside of Indianapolis boy boots made a couple he was looking for another one there but now boopy Miller is flying down the court but Booth got a piece of it and guess who got another loose ball under the rim but Carr turns it over this time a lot of arms to throw throw through thats the second time the cars been trapped down there Burton Quick crossover nice kick Booth again kesn the Applause rebound Burton guarded by Salis and out of bounds still belongs to the Applause Music Irish in your Scouting Report you know you say stay down and then stay in front of Marcus Burton okay great right stay in front of them thats it I just have to stay in front of them right simple really and you could say the same thing about guarding bopy Miller thatd be a Id like to see the two of them take a basketball and go end to end see whos faster you go in any scouting report in America and you think its going to be a shutout Burton gets the bouns Irish within 11 he is a shot maker isnt he every level he can Applause Music score Miller back to Salis Reed misses the three and out of bounds back to Notre Dame Reed 7 for 27 now on the season shooting the three hes going to hes going to take a rest Steve Forbes thats that might be one where you look at your big guy and say you wide open and theres a reason you were wide open you sound like you speak from experience there I was never Applause told Kei guarded by Marsh Booth Baseline driving this time and he is fouled Curry Boo has been aggressive so far the Freshman are from Englewood Colorado averages about 6 points4 rebounds per game heard Tom Ken in the studio compare Carrie boo to sort of a Young Noah Clowny hes not quite there yet no Clowney was a little bit more advanced but you can see the comparison with the length and the ability to shoot it the athleticism scored 15 in the win over wake a couple of weeks ago had a 13 rebound game this year as well that came at Boston College so hes got a variety of skills and again another freshman weve talked a lot about the two guys in the back court but theres a really nice larger batch of freshman that michah shrewbury is hoping to grow with here yeah its kind of an old school approach Carr is fouled on his way to the Applause Music goal number marus second Oh Marcus Burton averages over 17 points per game thank you so much back here with the ACC tournament in Washington second round action little decks fan is here in the house checking out awake as they take on Notre Dame again a huge game for Wake Forest and I think with the exception of maybe a booth getting open for those two threes I think Steve Forbes has to be pleased with the way his team has played so far well theyve defended the paint very well and and of Notre Dame 17 shot attempts 13 of those have been from threepoint range so Wake Forest defense has protected the basket protected the paint very effectively to start this game at the Line Andrew Carr the 611 senior from Westchester Pennsylvania had a really nice game in the win Clemson on Saturday 6 for seven from the floor knocked out a couple of Threes scored 17 points started his career at Delaware in Newark Delaware where Mike Bray started his coaching career you know the nickname of the Delaware team uh will they be the Blue Hens the blue hands the two for two today man but kicking Applause chickens Mike Bray of course coaching Notre Dame to an ACC ACC tournament Championship that was what 2015 I believe right in Greensboro Pat conon jiren Grant and others just a great Notre Dame team or they had a couple of great years move yeah that 2015 Notre game team was just magnificent Salis got his man in the air but missed the corner three and heres Burton playing with two fouls Shrewsberry yes that was almost a logo three great find by Marcus Burton and Braden Shrewsberry has had a tough time finding openings in the half court cam hildr did a really good job on him early on maybe thatll take the lid off a little bit and Notre Dame kind of hanging around right now they are down eight biggest lead wake has had they got into double digits for several minutes and now they turn it over biggest lead wake has had was 14 Notre Dames got it down to eight in transition he just lined that thing up hes got a low release but he gets it off really quickly as does Parker Frederickson but he doesnt get the bounce Parker fredericksons played over 550 minutes this year hes got eight turnover out its incredible pass deflected and save still Notre Dame ball lots of Applause time buron into ji and he might have had a little bit easier shot than he thought he was going to have when he turned and Fa the basket car is open on the wing and the follow goes on the weak side for Frederickson Parker Frederickson just a a freshman at 10 points against Duke at 12 against Virginia Tech he averaged 30 a game in high Applause Music school rooper pushed off a little creates some space now gets doubled and gives it up Booth again his third three of the game for Notre Dame he is Tak taking advantage of the openings because Marcus Burton and Shrewsberry are drawing so much Applause attention and his threepoint shooting keeping Notre Dame in the game right now good fakes by Frederickson Carr little bounce pass to Marsh Marsh right in the dunker spot and when Carr realized he had Shrewsberry on him could just back him in that means hes going to have to have help and Mar just stepped up from that dunker spot and aply named he dunked that with two hands and hanging out in the dunker spot the reason he shoots 70 from the field everything is right around the rim Burton Blows By him but then the size bothered him and he missed it they got to make him finish near the rim good hesitation by Music Salis Miller the drive floats and hits he was looking to draw that contact from Burton and did but didnt get the call had a word for the official both Salis and Miller already into double figures in this game a big difference from the game in South Bend where Salis had only seven Applause points wake doing a good job staying in front of Notre Dame drivers but rer spins right by his man this time and lays it in another thing that Wake Forest is doing pretty well at stay down on Music fakes and that helps you stay in front youre not flying all over the place under four to go in the first half wake by nine the stack action into a ball screen but got deflected by Burton good hands Shrewsberry crosses over and draws the Applause Music foul ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by principal let our expertise round out yours a shot went through a wrist injury Midway through the season kind of knocked his numbers down for several weeks but he is all the way back the the the tape or the bandage that he had on is gone he averages better than 13 and 1 12 points per game and very few in this conference make as many tough shots as cam hildr can make yeah hes working on six straight double figure games coming into this one hes got a little bit of a Dante Deen chenzo look does he hes from Worthing England wake four has done a great job of recruiting England with hean Marsh good excuse to visit London there a recruiting trip car wont go Booth the rebound Burton back to Booth lost it and the Irish fortunate to retain it with Salis right there to pick it up a Roper beat him to Applause it chai looking for a guard to give it to finds Burton and a foul Hilder got him Hilder was looking at Ron gr the official expecting it to be called on somebody Els and that is number three on cam hildr but he got him theres no question he reached in got his arm and I think Ron grber is now at the monitor just verifying on whom the foul Ian take got another one of them yeah but no are they switching it yeah theyre switching it and they are giving it to Fon Reed very fortunate there take your pick a great story second on Reed coming up tonight at 1130 eastern time the nothing but net crew will have a complete breakdown of todays second round ACC tournament games the Florida State win over Virginia Tack and again two more games coming tonight Syracuse takes on North Carolina State and then it will be D CN Clemson Syracuse an interesting team at this theyve had some moments this year theyre the kind of team that can jump up and steal a couple of games in a in a tournament no question Adrian arre has done a terrific job this year over 20 Applause wins Jim beheim here earlier today Salis no tipped out by Reed hildr has Applause it Carr the kick hildr the drive and he lays it in a really smart play and an excellent pass out but hildr with that shot fake and drive nobody picked him up he could have easily shot that but made the better decision to drive it first points of the night J lost it here comes Miller missed it but look at car running the floor didnt give up on the play and poopy Miller made that and he reached in with both hands and took it away on that drive and started that break himself what a great steal by booby Miller watch him reach in and Boop its gone then hes gone and watch card does not quit on the play and winds up getting the stick back Bracketology and a complete breakdown as well one of the great great days on the sporting calendar not to quibble with your method of doing promos but its really you know Jay Seth reys Andrea and the guy well look at right here on my monitor it says Rees and the guys youre not Ron Burgundy you dont just have to read everything in front of you well I have to decide would I rather irritate you or Laughter Applause re what a fun matchup it is between bopy Miller and Marcus Burton lets let these two guys go oneonone at halftime for a while and see who wins its just quick on quick but there was a little body contact but I thought booby Miller did a really good job of staying in front here unless unless they thought there was arm contact he stayed in front Burton Mr basketball in the state of Indiana last year in League games led the league in steals fourth overall sixth in scoring in the league sixth in assist in the league and again those kinds of numbers that gets you ACC Rookie of the Year only freshman in the country thats averaging over 17 points over four assists and over two steals per game and Notre Dame its been a long time since theyve had a starter a freshman starter at the point guard position also said a a Notre Dame freshman scoring record right surpassing Troy Murphy its going back aways what was Chris Thomas the last freshman starter they you and I can go further about remember David rivers of course played against David Rivers hild picks up his dribble hes looking for help and finds Carr never d solid defensively which is kind of the foundation of Micah shrewsburys program right at pen State as well I mean last year he got him to the Big 10 tournament championship game got him into the NCAA tournament beat Texas got to the second round well that was a good team Jaylen picket their best player but yet Seth Lundy and Andrew Funk those guys could really spread the floor and shoot it that was a fun team if I covered up the score and said how much do you think wake is winning by does it feel more than more than seven even though its only seven right now I mean early but no Dame has been playing really well over the last 10 minutes its much more aggressive on both ends of the floor especially defensively Burton puts the brakes on and misses the shot follow no but shy is fouled yeah when Marsh came up to put pressure on that shot and you have to make Marcus Burton whos small finish at The Rim but when you help up like that it opens up the offensive glass and ji took advantage of it and you did did the game yesterday when Notre Dame be George Tech must have seemed like ja SMI all day at the free throw line he had 11 points in the game and he went nine of 10 from the line hes Miler Dames top rebounder top offensive rebounder but Tay Davis was fantastic yesterday in that game against Georgia Tech I mean it was a complete team effort and a lot of the credit because of the scoring went to to Burton and Shrewsberry but Notre Dame doesnt win that game without Tay Davis in the plays that he made you know so Georgia Tech got knocked out but theyve got interesting freshman and Damon STM starting to to build a culture and a program then and it feels like Yellow Jackets are uh going to be a very interesting program to keep an eye on in the years ahead Bayan Dongo had a great game hes an outstanding freshman and Nathan George just got better and better throughout the course of the Year wheres he from uh I dont know Ive never heard of the country nothing nothings come out of there really Notre Dame with the ball down only six now in the final minute of the first half favorable match up to drive boy did car some credit hes doing everything he can do here goes Burton again and its turned over just lost the handle on it Burton told Im just hey man get out of here get your help Defender out let me take Carr and he just lost the ball and Steve Forbes will take a timeout to set up what he hopes as a productive last possession of the Music half Washington pits fun Blake hinsons fun big game for them tomorrow no matter who they play pit can really shoot it I mean they spread the floor so well and knock get so 3s theyre a little its kind of like the guys were talking about at in the studio watching BYU was fun to watch weit can hold for the last shot 8 seconds to go here goes Miller the pull up no Carr got it back and thatll be that in the first half as wake got out to a lead of as many as 14 points in the opening minutes but Notre Dame stuck with it and they are back within six both Salis and Miller are in double just thank you what a nice win this would be for Notre Dame they got a good one Over Georgia Tech the winner advances into the quarterfinals to play pit tomorrow at 230 Eastern here on ESPN Andrew Carr had a nice first half had nine rebounds and eight points three blocks as well and hes into double fig now as he slams it home Fon Reed with the assist Fon Reed knew he was going to get double team and that was all set up you had Carr in the opposite corner and he just made a cut right to the basket and made himself available how about four assists now for Fon Reed the third he knows hes going to get doubled and remember in the first half he didnt handle a double team W up turning it over and Notre Dame took it the other way that was exactly how you want to handle double BR shrewbury gets doubled Burton with about a 26footer comes up a little short but Booth hustling all over the place to run it down Burton good defense there by Reed thats your textbook principle of verticality right there yeah the vertical contest and making Burton finish over the top he couldnt do it he was just trying to body seek Salis around and out and its Notre Dame ball now take a look at the left corner thats where Carr is and as as the ball goes in you got a a double team and then that means Tay Davis has to crack down from the top he didnt get there in time really well handled by Aton Applause Reed good throwback Davis driving on Carr and Carr called for the foul and looked like the arms came down just enough it wasnt just the arms in my view he he kind of threw his chest into him and so that wasnt offense initiated contact now watch his chest here he just throws it right back into him see well he knocked him back a little bit but youre right his arms definitely were a little bit down but there there he threw his chest into him there at the very end so Steve Forbes perhaps with the decision made and hes made it clearly because thats three on car and at least at the moment who we spoke too soon here comes Zack Keller whyd you say we I didnt say anything dont drag me into your speaking too soon so Carr is out and this will be interesting to see how long Steve Forbes keeps him on the bench you talked about a great first half that he had he is a player of vital importance to the deeps especially on the Music Applause glass Salis to Reed no double yet here comes and hell score anyways it looked like they were trying to bring the double after he put it on the deck but he just turned away from the double team carry boo brought it from the high side and Reed just turned to the Baseline over that left shoulder hes handled two double teams really really well but those were different doubles than we saw in the first half they were more aggressive hild trying to defend Burton Applause J back to Burton five to shoot looks it up off the side of the backboard and it belongs to wake really good defense by hild he making everything difficult for Marcus Burton he can score off difficult too but they dont want to give him anything easy well how about Salis just turned around kept that pivot foot down and took the three but he couldnt hit it Im not sure that was the shot that Applause L Forest wanted there was sort of as an afterthought shrewbury gets out of trouble and a foul committed by Keller to send Tay Davis to the line but Wake Forest had him pinned in and then they just allowed Shrewsberry to split that trap good job to turn away from the double team over that left shoulder thought he might go off the glass but really well handled by Fon Reed number 13 Davis the line shooting two you know you look at the the size that Notre Dame has on the front line Davis is 69 Booth is kind of a long lanky 610 and then Jai is 610 as well Michel shrewsburys got some size up front y they look kind of small going up against against Reed hes 7even fet and Reed doesnt look like hes been walking past the weight room he looks like hes been going in a starter at LSU 2 years ago a zag last year as a reserve and now back as a starter at wake his third School in his many years and if they give him credit for another assist thatll be his fifth as bopy Miller knocks it down that was a horn set they got it to read and he just pivoted and wound up essentially setting a screen with the ball to allow bopy Miller to come off Applause it boy Burton constantly moving you Davis Scoops it up no but another foul on Keller really good job to Pivot around now take a look take a look at Fon Reed on the right block this tracker isnt working so on the right block hes going to catch the ball and then he pivots and then he picks off Marcus Burton just by pivoting so he wound up being having the ball and being a screener at the same time and that freed up boopy Miller to get around you know on the surface you can say Fon Reed always got four points and three rebounds but hes had a much much bigger impact in the game than that five assists as we mentioned and you know protecting the lane hes done a lot of really good things for Wake today yeah what you call him as a presence when hes been on the floor hes been a presence at both ends Miller with the rebound smart play by Miller yep smart play just had ji sort of in jail on his backside and put on the brakes and let him roll right over him number two on J and the referees will let that initial kind that theyre not calling that but when you knock the guy down you know they got to call Applause that sixpoint lead at the half sevenpoint lead now for Wake Salis had a huge start to this game fairly quiet since then Reed banging with ji and then oh it wont go down everything but the Finish as he spun to the left hand well that was a good cut by Keller to open up that space foron Reed just didnt finish it Shrewsberry gets it back finds Music Burton Big Forest switched that good pass boof no good and another rebound for Reed well they could have called a foul there Reed was not straight up and down there Applause Keller got two in the air and well be heading to the free throw line just an open side pick and roll theres nobody there to come from the corner to tag and pick up that roll weit by seven second half here in Washington cage has your back for real absolutely were they made by when the mails delivered thats pretty cool always like every day and theyre delicious I dont even give it to my dog do you know his name not your dog the dog no not not the dog lets start with the dog I dont know my neighbors names Zack Keller at the line in the first half airball the first made the second before today the last time he had have been at the free throw line in a game was Applause November knew he well thought he missed it but it went in he probably shot free throw in practice though last was November thats about the hes had two of the most interesting split a pair of free throws as you can have really trying to run Bren Shrewsberry off a lot of screens what a rebound great rebound by Kev G he throws it out of bounds off of Applause Reed Kev ja is a really good offensive rebounder averages two a game that was a big time rebound the hand off to Burton they are giving a lot of attention as and rightfully so to Marcus Burton and again he had 31 against wake a couple of weeks ago in an Notre Dame win good defense and then shy throws it out of bounds off Eon Reeds head Reed was like the first one was a little lower that this getting out of hand hes like shaking his head saying okay were done this is getting out of hand were done here shot clock under four oh great play by hver he just read the eyes of shrewbury I think knew the ball was coming to him and lays it in have yourself a trip down the court cam HRI boy he read it but he had his that was like a defensive back he had both arms up cuz he couldnt even see it and then takes it the other way in this he really looks like Dante dento finishing at The Rim just a really smart play just to thats why coaches always say have high hands high hands the ball just hit his hands cuz he put his hands in the way bounces it in for a threepoint play the lead up to 11 the foul on Braden Shrewsberry is Music third a seam for Tay Davis Reed gets over to slow him down and Keller just helping off because hes not worried about J hitting that shot when the throwback is Music Applause made buron for three and thats wake basketball Fon Reed was glad it went out of bounds so didnt get thrown off his Noggin Applause again I wouldnt want to annoy Fon Reed by continually throwing the ball off so you just annoy me Laughter Applause yeah hel getting minutes with Carr on the bench with three fouls hild he loves to post the double comes and he kicks it crosscourt to Miller spins and gets it to go what a nice play because Marcus Burton was right there to try to take the ball away if he had changed hands in spinning there I think Burton might have been able to knock that away good play by poopy Miller and a bigger margin now for the deakes up by 13 so much fun to say boopy good pass Davis up and in good body control in midair by Tay Davis just a sophomore transferred in from Sean Hall hes had some really good moments in the two games that Notre Dames played here in Washington Applause Music DC Salis Baseline good defense well done by Julian rooper and Reed turns it over Shrewsberry a transition free and michah shrewbury is saying you had a man run into the corner hit him for the corner three Im about to tell you your mom that was a bad decision coaches kids had a pretty good freshman year and he has gotten better and better over the course of the season now hes a really good player you think about the future of this back court at Notre Dame with Burton and Shrewsberry it is a bright one and you had Carri boo in there whos had a terrific first half but taking advantage of the openings that were provided by all the attention on Burton and shury H with no Irish Ball RI Forest really had a chance to stretch this lead out how did he get through there Burton just kept driving and found himself at the rim back down to single Applause digits car back in the game with that foul trouble hild with no and Carr keeps it alive and lays it in thats exactly what he was doing the whole first half and as had the ball and Carr just took it away from him Carr now with 12 points and 10 rebounds make it 11 a good Pursuit by hildr that ball was going up quickly but he put late pressure on it had to affect the shot a little bit at least and a foul on ji trying to defend car down in the paint wake for is in a monumentally important game for them up 11 she was thrown out of BS office head cam hildr has been more involved in the second half Andrew Carrs been great Salis and Miller have done their share and its out to an 11point lead a lot of it due to some good defense by wake wakes defense has really been to me the story of the game Marcus Burton and Braden Shrewsberry are combined 4 for9 two of 11 from three and you hold those scorers down they combined for what 44 points yesterday they combined for 16 but theyve taken 19 shots to get those 16 points and a few of them been free throws noted Dame shooting just 31 from the floor wake just under 50 Notre Dame though six threes to wakes three and four more points at the line a couple of the reasons why theyre still within Striking Distance here down 11 boo hit three threes in the first half not there and over half of Notre Dame shots have been threes and Wake Forest is dominating the paint Second Chance points and points off turnovers all in favor of the deacons and Notre D not really a big threepoint shooting team just 32 as a team of the season hild is working hard Balls not falling for him right now Burton the spin in the kick knocked Away by Frederickson and he lays get in the other end what a play by The Freshman from Bixby Oklahoma let the defense just fly by hes a smart player that turnover thing eight turnovers and 550 Plus minutes on the season thats remarkable shrewbury has it swatted out of bounds by Applause Salis just active hands by frickson taking it the other way and then you can see just tucked the ball away to his right as Braden truberry flew Music by and esny into the game launches the three a little bit short March the rebound good block out by March on tay Davis what another big body as your backup center 71 240 two seven Footers on this wake roster and cars not far behind screen rescreen then into a ball screen tried the yoop and a foul on the Irish that Marcus Burton just trying to throw his body in there a little bit of an undercut situation number four on Marcus Burton he had some foul trouble yesterday toward the end of the game and Micah Shrewsberry had to make some offense defense substitutions and and right now nobody going to the scores table he is indispensable for them hildred the corner three good pass by Carr as the defense was contracted just looked out to the perimeter and HFF has been much better offensively in the second half his defense still been good all eight points that hes got today have come here in the second half Hunter Salis now called for a foul a little screen roll caught him on the short roll and then as Booth comes up hes surrounded by three that means somebodys open and he found hildr in the corner in the game yesterday against Georgia Tech after Burton picked up his fourth foul Nathan George they were just targeting Marcus Burton and that thats really what Wake Forest needs to do just go after Music him Music L of dribbling out Beyond The Arc for the Irish shot clock is running out and a foul was called before the shot clock expired will they look at it I think theyre going to go to the Monitor and say what happened first the foul call or the shot clock Applause violation Applause oo the contact occurred yeah before it went to 0 if its right its Marsh there yeah I dont know whether they call they called on Marsh or Carr cuz Carr brought his arms down yeah so theres no question that should be a foul Y and it looked like it was 01 Music yep 02 and it is the foul that will stand and a couple of free throws coming for Music Burton and the foul was called on Marsh not Carr Marsh was the one more straight up and at the line for number three Marcus Burton shooting Burton a good free throw shooter 81 on the season the free throw line in the second half is the only place Notre Dames really scoring Applause Music trying to take the ball out of Sals hands misses the lefthanded layup IMS now with a Applause Music rebound car guarding him out on the perimeter and into the hands of Burton he initiates everything offensively for this team whether its looking for himself or somebody else that time Mak himself and its down to 12 so quick with the ball hes got another Applause gear car Frederickson short Music and itll be Notre Dame ball as Steve Forbes is going to bring Fon Reed the third and boy Miller back into the Applause game Notre Dame has made only three field goals in the second half seven points coming to the line and theyre still in it Applause tipped away and a foul thats the second good defensive play made by Frederickson and give credit to poopy Miller because he really did a great job denying the ball back out to Marcus Burton and that meant you had to throw more of a diagonal pass and Frederickson read it really well but watch watch poopy Miller he denied it back out so Booth had to try to get it to hims and frickson just shot the gap Applause double on Reed car cuts good pass Miller for three and Notre Dame ball well they did everything right there though yeah he didnt get the shot to go down but really good decision by Carr tough catch by ji and a foul on car I dont know why he did that he stopped the initial action that just threw his right arm out shot him back and its number four on him wake by a dozen I dont think theres any tougher player in the country than Jamal shed he may be the best on ball defender in the country and hes right up there to be the best leader in the country Purdue Yukon Houston locks for a one seed does it come down to Tennessee in Carolina for the last one in your mind Arizonas still in there if they win the Pack 12 tournament its possible their numbers are and theyre really good but if Carolina runs the table here in Washington DC theyre going to make a great great case Carolina will play Florida state will have it for you new Eastern tomorrow here on ESPN hild lost it good defense there by ji to swat it Applause Music away Burton hildr kept it alive and booy Millers got it for weight and he tried to bait ji into another foul or was it Davis last time I cant remember but he uh he tried that same play again yeah it was ji that didnt last Music time what a screen by Keller and Frederickson wide open 41 from Beyond the arc on the season you tend to get wide open when a teammate just lays out your Defender thats exactly what Zach Keller did there Music Applause Shrewsberry now to Burton T to shoot Wake Forest has done a great job on Burton k a little too aggressive with his body picking up the foul hed already sent him to the sideline thats good enough lets check in with Jess in the last wake huddle coach forb said make some stops man its time so when Notre Dame shoots its got to be one and done no offensive boards he brought up the fact that they do have nine so far he said lets put them away 624 away from putting them away up 15 hit awaits the winner tomorrow defensively I think Steve Forbes has to be pretty happy with the way his team has competed this is a Notre Dame team that put up 84 points yesterday Jason capable brother and assistant coach to Jeff capable at pit and theyve been able to get over that whole Duke Carolina thing Jeff went to Duke and Jason went to start at North Carolina hit the four seed so one of the four schools that earned a double Applause buy Carolina the one Duke the two Virginia the three and then Applause Music pit Music Applause Sal well they want to make him give it up he does so Reed catches it and then miss the Applause dunk a good saving block there by Applause Keller well you cant have an easier shot than Fon Reed just had Marcus Burton having to guard him then recover out to the threepoint line left him all alone K getting some minutes because cars had some foul trouble and hes played well Off the Bench harrs had a great game despite his minutes being limited a bit wakes really done a good job on F and trwy Davis punched off the rim and now yeah now a go CH will be called theyre going to look at it or are they just going to count it theyre going to count it and they can look at it at the next timeout thats the rule until you get into the last four so that is called basket interference in a basket and they will look at it at the next timeout just coming off that might have still been up there looks like it still was in the cylinder it might have been T I think it was more out than in but any part of it still touching the rim you have to leave it alone 11point lead for Wake Hunter Salis a dozen in the game hasnt scored in the second half will three rattles out for Applause Keller Notre Dame trying to get it under Applause Music 10 knocked away boy fredericksons really been in the passing Lanes hasnt he Salis at the other end another great play by Parker frickson he and poy Miller communicated very well on that switching action making sure they contain Marcus Burton and his active hands led to a run out recovering keeping his hands up and all of a sudden Wake Forest out in transition for an easy one Z Keller stepping in front to get that steal and then hildr with his hands up getting a deflection that led to a bucket and a foul and Parker Frederickson has done a terrific job all game long of having his hands active and that has led to a couple of different run outs for Wake Forest turning defense into offense only 10 Notre Dame turnovers that doesnt sound like a lot but Wake Forest has turned that into 15 points and you com that with what theyve done in the paint theyve dominated the paint in this game 322 in paint points under 5 minutes to go 13point lead for the Demon Deacons and Notre Dame generally not an explosive offensive team only averaging 64 a game and you got to believe they got to get some quick scores and knock down some threes if theyre going to have a chance to get back into this another good job by cam hildr of putting pressure on Shrewsberry when he trying to get a shot up they have really limited the Freshman guards for Notre Dame in this game nice look five to shoot wake using some clock on this possession Miller the Miss and a whistle and a foul going against the Irish just a push in the back of Zack Keller as he was about to get out that offensive rebound seven foul seventh team foul so Keller going to the line theres the push by Shrewsberry number four on Applause him missed the front Applause end Carr has come back to the table to check back in for Wake Bon hes foul boy can anybody stop on a dime quicker than Marcus Burton if they can its a short list number three on Reed you got Mishawaka you got Miss Saga well done number 11 Keller out Carr in boy Burton has to work so hard too he has to do so many different things for this Notre Dame team he never seems to get tired I know we said that in the first game about Virginia Tech sha padulla I wonder how many miles Marcus Burton runs in a game its significant or kilometers thank you bring you into the ation and kesn I think theyll get him for the foul trying to defend the drive from Salis Timeout on the floor Wake
