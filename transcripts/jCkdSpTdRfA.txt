lot more than 3 minutes today well I think he needs to just manage the game and let it come to him then kid takes care of business in the opening tip and here we go its great to have you with us ACC court side Saturdays on the CW beginning here in blackburg Hook he six and three and inside immediately kid gets on the board quick and we talked about this in the open as the fact that L kid has been shown that he is a guy that you can throw that ball to and they go and get him going early they get him the ball good spots too he leads the ACC and field goal percentage just about 70 Jackson Edwards from the wing Cashes in the three now this is a young blepo team but what they will do is that theyre going to play with energy theyre going to be pretty and theyre going to do a good job of moving that ball East to West Fifth straight game with a three for Edwards the sophomore from Indianapolis transfer from Murray State Hunter Couture alltime leading threepoint shooter in program history here at Virginia Virginia Tech and nice pass from RE Steiner Couture unable to finish inside trer pulls down the rebound point guard for the beacons Darius Dio averaging five assists per game this is pal inside and Kid RS down the board you want to make sure that you come out and play this game with offensive discipline because again Virginia Tech theyre going to play hard defense and theyre going to want to try to turn those Mis qes into easy bask you see Tyler Nichol good start off for him knocking down the three we know he can really shoot already scored more points this year than he did all of last year obviously the opportunity here had a whole lot to do with that too out po play Wednesday at Central Michigan they were down 22 in the second half cut back deficit to three with about 9 seconds left before falling 7167 Edwards not this time and kid grabs another Music rebound as Mike young what kind of personality re Steiner has he said hes Ultra confident a little too confident there going into the trees and we talked about with him is that hes got to be a game manager make sure you get yourself into the offense and then take the take advantage of the opportunities when they present itself you like how coach young said it you be basic cable today I said coach I dont know if Brandon knows what basic means this day and age clock at seven step back Stafford then kid with his third Rebound in the opening three minutes B doing a good job of understanding that once they dont get that rebound theyve got to get back in transition because Virginia Tech will try to push the ball whenever they get a chance and again another thing theyre going to go Ahad and give their bigs an opport opportunity to eat today Tyler Nicholl not this time time rebound taken by Jackson Edwards Darius Dio Jr from Ottawa his dad a college basketball coach in Canada Edwards on the drive tough contested shot goes a nice Runner by Edward again we talk about this VP team and theyre young and inexperienced but theyre gritty uh Roger Powell team is going to compete thats one of the things that youve seen right now Edwards has come out you see a little change up a little matchup zone for valo P from the corner connects alltime threepoint making shooter for Virginia Tech again we talk a lot about Shan padulla and then L kid but its Hunter Couture that actually makes this Virginia Tech Team go on offensive end 2763 resetting the record with every make more distance between him and a Deo who also could really stroke it Dio bumped on the way to the bucket and the foul is going to be on the Freshman Rex Steiner as we get our first time out of the day when I got we want to talk about his Hunter Couture leav him wide open you got to read the shot report baby Virginia Tech off to a nice start 8 to5 this is a very young team and he went out and got some guys that hes trying to mold and create a culture but heres the I remember when he played with the Ali in 2005 a gritty Defender a guy that plays hard you see that with this V especially early in first halfa into the game sets up Edwards in the corner and nichel brings down the Applause rebound still out there with Rex Robbie Baron who started the first nine games coming off the bench today for Mike young hes out there now after the first time out only change for for the hookies last Touch by valo you mentioned players taking the personality of their coach how did you take the personality of Bobby kremens back in the day and heres the thing is that if anyone remember watching Bobby back in the day Bobby never sat down he was energetic was full of energy and the way he coached he was always you know really gritty and Grimmy and I think that was one of the things that we had success you see the Vero come up with that steal and hes hammered by Baron who denies the easy two will force him to earn it from the line and one of the things with Valpo is that you see Dio come up with that steal and then challenge it so Darius Dio at the line Junior from Kata Ottawa suburb of Canadian Music Capital again we talked about the fact that uh Roger Powell Jr was able to go in go into the portal and basically get a lot of different players and you look at this team you know hes got a lot of freshman and sophomore going into that P portal could be a blessing in the court curse because sometimes you can get good players but being able to get them the mesh is always not the easiest thing well this is a v program that has typically had continuity I mean before this year they had nine consecutive years with at least two returning starters from the year before but new coach new group coming in only three returning scholarship players from last year none who had huge roles oh beautiful and its Mal quickly converting off the Ben good flash by Baron playing fou playing that zone again you try to get into the teeth of that defense and then they converge you see a nice little dump off the potit potit is one of those guys that is not petite at try any stand he looks the part see what you did there t to shoot for valo good hedge by potit to the corner its Applause Scher Baron feeds the big man again dis back give and go beautifully done you see po saying you know what you hook me up on the first Im going to go ahead and look out for you Baron bti doing a little bit of Switcheroo there nice little dump inside loose ball nickel on the floor first turnover for valo thats what valo cannot do you do not want to turn the ball over but theyre doing a good job of get back in transition giving Virginia Tech a lot of different looks because again were giving them this Zone and trying to give a mixture of different defensive looks Baron open burries it see Robbie Baron has come in off the bench has ignited this Virginia Tech Team right now a little bit of everything dropping dims and being able to knock and down shots as well timeout Valpo hoki on a quick 70 run and you see the ball the ball movement here and see watch Robbie Baron again you see poti on the up side with that zone Baron does a good job forces them to come over and then drops it over to petite to being able to finish and then the other thing again you see bti we talk about this guys more like a linebacker being able to finish at the rim and then again Baron has come in you see you have to honor Hunter Couture leaves him wide open is able to square up and then nothing but the net knocking down that three one thing I know you appreciate about Mike Youngs coaching style his team plays with great purpose at the offense defensive end of the floor yeah when you watch how they play and especially on the offensive end theyre going to make sure that the ball doesnt stick you have a lot of movement they play and they shift the defense a lot of times when you watch them youre going to see guys coming off screens a little pick and roll action a lot of times the digs are either popping or theyre theyre making that quick dive and when it does it puts a lot of pressure on the defense to have to adjust now po doesnt have a field goal in the last three Applause minutes see what coach pal up out of the timeout passar Seth freshman from Estonia KS it back out this is isaia Stafford their leading scorer rebound Pro and thats the guy thats got to get going for them if they were to have a chance at winning this game Stafford has been their leading scorer a guy that can put the ball on the floor they got to find a way to get him roll that ball didnt go out of bounds knocked Away by Stafford and his caress pass intercepted andj Collins his first shot of the day wont go jayen young with the steel freshman from brbor North Carolina into the game early today aab Bo cant connect Here Comes MJ Collins 20 points on Sunday against Louisville close competitive game with Kenny Paynes team Hs ultimately winning 7568 game that had nine lead changes Music young lost it Stafford the other way wide open Edwards Baron closed on him quick sets up sep at the elbow and now Edwards SPS up missed it short and heres are doing a great job on the defensive boards and thats one of the things that they do is for Mike young theyre going to make sure that they defend and they limit you to one shot and theyre going to try to run theyre not going to force sit down your throat but theyre going to take advantage of the opportunities we talk about the ball Applause movement its either the cheddar or the caramel which side do you go on cheddar youre okay youre okay how I was terrified of answering the incor thing coin toss its a coin toss I like both but yeah its its uh its a cool piece of forzo history Bs got to get some type of offense right now theyre two for 11 18 again you got to get Stafford going he he is the guy again that can give them points but again Virginia TCH has come out and made a concerted effort to make pay a lot of attention to Music him Isaiah Stafford his first bucket of the day is a three and Dio did a good job again youre going to have to move the guards from Virginia Tech you cant stay stagnant that last time little penetration shifted the defense and got Stafford a wide open three particularly without sea padulla whos got a foot injuries out today Mike young does not think its a longterm thing he expects him to be back next week but were probably going to see a bunch of lineups that the hokes have not utilized so far this year its a chance for Mike young to experiment with his personnel and see what fits and what doesnt well you see the shot of sha padul on the bench and this is an opportunity especially during a nonconference season you already got one ACC win under your belt you want to make different experiments because again the whole idea is you want to win these games F but you want to be playing your best basketball when it comes to league play and so what better time is when you have one of your better players out to try to TW tweak your lineups and see what combinations work best feel like every time Ive looked over at Chan badou hes had a smile on his face so hes certainly not too demoralized by the situation and we did not practice yesterday but he was out that practice part of the time of the boot part of the time of the sneaker K long walked good helps side defense by set that last time you saw long going the penetration they were able to come on that back side and again this valvep team we talked theyre gritty theyre grimy um they have had multiple chances throughout the season where theyve been down and they fought their way back against against a good Illinois team they were up at the half against good great ball movement right there bending count the two for pass SP SE sep is coming to the game and then put his inut on both ends of the floor now he got to valo his national team coach in Estonia former teammates with valo assistant AJ moer another guy thats played in a national championship game with Indiana we tell you its not always what you know my guys who you know Couture coming off the screen back out side long Couture nice dish kid through the contact and well get two at the line nice di by Hunter Couture again we always talk about his threepoint shooting ability I like the fact that uh does more than that that back cut set up an opportunity for ly kid to get fouled and go to the Music line so Lin kit will shoot free throws where hes been excellent this year 85 from the line right around 70 from the field really has been a phenomenal start to the season for Lynn transfer from Clemson every Friday is magical on the CW with an all new episode of pen and Teller fool us starring pen Gillette teller and new house Brook BG Fridays at 87 Central only on the CW kid didnt get a lot of burn when he was at K at Clemson but his development from last year to this year I mean we talked to Mike H he talked about he spent the time in the in the gym worked on his body but just his ability to give them a low pul threat down low man he has shown great strides early in the season nice ball movement Dio threes in and out itser had two hands on the rebound but could not haral it the other thing about kid Bryan he had glimpses last year he had some great games along the way but now hes doing it more consistently we see great defense from Stafford swatting the shot from Collins Virginia tchas steel K all the way how about the big fella being able to show his handles and say you know what I dont need a guard so that I let me go ahead and show my skills one of the things Ive worked on I said instead of low post being able to go Coast to Coast six points three rebounds and six minutes for kid now watch this deal and you see L kid get ahead and then again realize hes got a little guard hes like you too little able to finish what the big F being able to finish at The Rim a lot of times those big guys say he you know what I dont need a guard to be able to feed me you know get me the Rock and let me go for mine very well be on his way to his third double double of the year a good quick start through the first 10 and2 minutes today another careless pass nichel intercepts long unable to handle the pass and hell be going back valpos way and heres one of the things that alzo has to be careful especially as a young team you have to keep it against this Virginia Tech Team theyre going to try to push you to get out of source and pick up your Tempo and what youre seeing a couple of turnovers going to lead to Fast Break opportunities for Virginia Tech well the hokes have had some mistakes passing the ball as well theres seven turnovers in 11 minutes here like youre starting point guard that can happen and thats always one of the things is that when your floor General is on the is not playing how is the Rhythm and the pace of your game you see offensive foul great defense by Mai long good defense by long being able to move his feet 14 I feel like if for Mike young if youre going to play you have to be able to play defense especially your guards because so much of what they do is the individual on ball defense and you know as far as the team as well but you got to be able to move your feet looking forward to Charlotte and Duke at 215 both those teams five and three and another terrible pass Collins throws it away and Stafford lays it in and Collins telegraphed that pass you saw his Stafford literally watching him and baiting him and again for a guy like Stafford that wants to get going those easy buckets can make it a lot easier for you to get on a nice little offensive Guru majority of valpos points have come off Pokey turnovers Tyler Nicholls thats cash weve seen multiple occasions when Virginia T Flash the guy right there in the middle of that zone the defense has to converge you go to weak side you get Tyler nichel a wide open three into the back court deflected six points for nickel two for three from Applause deep under eight to play in the first half Stafford off the dribble Here Comes MJ Collins the other way MJ hit three of his threepoint tries last week missed his first shot today my goodness Mike young is not going to be a happy guy thats nine turnovers for Virginia Tech in less than 13 minutes of basketball and Financial Security for more than 150 years and one of the things we talk about a typical Mike young team is that theyre going to shoot the three of and again already shooting the ball from the down line from four for six from The Arc and its how theyre getting these contest uncontested shots the fact that theyre going to have ball movement theyre going to break you down and again if youre going to play for Mike young there are two things youre going to play defense and youre going to be able to shoot the B The Rock from behind the arm and when theyve gotten a shot off theyve been very productive theyre shooting 67 overall but the nine turnovers and and thats one of the things again you cant be happy and theyve had their problems earlier playing against a very good uh FAU team on the road and then in Auburn those are some of the things that if you can turn them over is going to be one of those things is going to be ailles Hill later on oh what a take by Jackson Edwards off the dribbles and heres the thing if you going to challenge a big and Link kid you go to finish and then you saw a able to go and you put that Bas and put it caught a body no fear Jackson 65 sophomore fpo back within six and a foul on the neate what looked like the 10th hokei turnover you see the penetration by Edwards and you see L kid a little late basically looks at him and heres the thing is that back in the day when I had a little bounce you get off the floor before you can and dont give him a chance at it Edwards de size he steady long steady wrong it is a little surprising to see 610 ly kid playing the minutes hes playing got three Block chots in nine games and again we highlighted the fact that they give him the ball down low and his ability to score but hes also done a lot better being able to block shot you see the kick out and how about Tyler nichel too in his production you know shooting the ball really well had his struggles earlier on the season but this is the guy that is the Virginia High School all scoring champion with 2900 points thats a lot of buckets just one of 11 from three in his last couple games but three for four at the outset today hes found his stroke and you saw isah Isaiah Stafford gets uh basically fell asleep thats a guy that you read The Scouting Report you understand you got to stay with him but good kick out by ly kid on the double made just six threes last year in 25 games limited minutes for the Tar Heels 13 threes already this season open look Rex Steiner buries it but the play was you saw Robbie Baron on the Block and as he was blocking basically working in the block the off pin down to allow Ste steimer to get that wide open three triger cannot answer hokes with their largest lead looking to expand it already six threepointers nichel passes it up and the pass to kid deflected and Scher unable to save it near the Valpo bench now watch Rex Steyr on this play coming back you get the ball inside and you see the little bit of a stagger Music and basically defense is committed Rex Steiner comes off knocks down that three thats got to be great for his confidence again hes done a good job of being able to run the team but Virginia Tech doing a good job of being able to knock down threes and in balance it inside out Couture tough shot oh what a save by Baron leaping across the line re in the big man and he cant knock down the Music three outo shooting just 33 at this end of the floor Stafford for two nice flash by Steph again this FP team is not going to go away youve seen throughout the early part of the Season theyve had multiple occasions where theyve been down theyre going to stay gritty and theyre going to continue to fight T just has to stick with what they doing balance Inside Out did had it knocked away recovered the only question is will this be free throws or a foul on the floor going to be free Music throws D just picked up his second personal so kid looking at add to his Ledger six points already this coming Tuesday night on inside the NFL nobody breaks down games like our crew with highlights and Analysis you wont find anywhere else this week the guys take a look back at the mammoth Sunday night battle between the Eagles and Cowboys inside the NFL Tuesday 87 Central only on the CW Billy or Dallas Sunday night Brian you know what man I spent some time playing in Philly with the Sixers I know that they struggled in the last game against the 49ers but Im going to go with them I think jayen herdz is going to have a masterful game although Dak Prescott knows is having an MVP type year but Im going go with the E to get you on the set of inside the NFL Stafford travel heres one of the things we dont talk a lot about Hunter Couture with his ability to make shots defense defensively hes normally taking on the best Wing player and then his defense right now isah Stafford is is is amazing because Stafford has not been able to establish any type of Rhythm in this first half I think its a great point one of the reasons Couture has been such a valuable player through his time here Baron fouled by Weatherspoon from behind one of another things I like about kids game too is that not only is he developed as a low pulse threat on the defens his passing out of the de out of the double team youve seen valarezo understand that theyve got to send another Defender that last time Robbie Baron on the cut ly kid does an exceptional job of finding the wide open guy six points for Baron the Northwestern transfer played in the NCAA tournament last year for the wild cats Chris Collins done a great job with that program of course we got Duke coming up the second game of our double header Tom wormy and the legendary Mike jinsky getting set from Cameron indor little over four minutes left to go in this first half you Val perzo you got to continue to run your offense and you got to make shots I mean right there I want Q This is the team again theyre going to continue to fight you got to try to cut this thing at least under five going into the half because Virginia Tech normally they will not turn the ball over you already got nine turnovers but they will continue to run their offense long pass tip byp stolen away opportunity here for the beacons Nao the Crusaders for a long time this is their third year rebranding as the beacons Shining Light On The World Stafford on the drive SP and Away by Baron great defense by Robbie Baron again Robbie says hey not only can I could score but you know what again Im going to play the little defense you see the penetration by Stafford Robbie Baron comes over and says no pop count for you Asia Stafford get four from behind the AR has pretty much mixed it up Evan leeler again for this Virginia Tech team that PR himself in good defense and shooting from behind the hard Tyler nickel has been that guy has been very hot in the first half three for four for nine points matches his season high in three pointers he also made three threes against wford and against Iowa Music State think about where this Hoke team fits in the AC hierarchy right now obviously theyre in first place St with big Ambitions and he will get a couple of free throws out of it but you look the ACC right now is really interesting and I obviously Clemsons the only remaining undefeated team Carolina has had some impressive wins Duke has a lot of talent coming off backto back losses trying to write the ship and I feel like theres 10 other teams that could finish anywhere between you know fourth and 13th in the league in the Virginia Tech is in that mix and you got to throw Miami in the mix too and I think when you look at just right now there are a ton of teams that are sitting right around six and three and I think that this seems like a typical Mike young young team that you know theyve got some new pieces theyve got to go ahead and try to get some continuity but thats what a lot of these teams use the nonconference season to get right so to speak and I think when you look at them theyve got bigs that can score youve got great play making theyre always going to play defense and theyre going to shoot the lights out of it and so this is one of those teams I think that when were getting into February youre going to see this Virginia Tech right there in the upper eon of the ACC Aon double pure extra pass Collins apparently did not beat the Buzzard did not hit the rim that was a good defensive possession by B pzo seem like theyve committed to doubling in the post you had Robbie Baron that last time kicking the ball out you see Swing Swing and good recovery forcing them into that shot shot clock violation working on Collins finds his face comes up short Baron with another rebound valo has not been able to find some consistent offense but this game feels like its much more than a 10point game for Virginia Tech theyre still very much in it would be without the 11 turnovers that theyve had in the first half puts it in h shooting north of 60 from the floor and if not for the turnovers theyd be up 20 absolutely and talking about a mismatch you had SE there doing all he could to try to stop potit you see Trigger right there knocking down that shot and again it seems as like you talked about with Virginia Tech if it wasnt for the turnovers you know this would be a much bigger lead but this is allowing Val perzo to stay in this game now watching Cooper schweer play its surprising that this 69 freshman was available as late as valos signed him cuz hes got size he can clearly step out and shoot had a solid prep year in Missouri Im intrigued by this kid kooper schwier second foul on Sherman weather spoon the fourth and Couture to the line coming up on the Subaru halftime report we will take you around the ACC all the latest news and notes well hear from Tom and Mike and Durham the preview the 49ers and the Blue Devils of course first half highlights and all the numbers here from the castle time out hoky time out 204 remaining in this first half and a 12 point Music game Five Points in the half now for Hunter Kor after he knocks down a couple of free throws well its all coming down to the final episode you wont want to miss the dramatic season finale of Sullivans Crossing this Wednesday at 8 Eastern only on the sew you you got a chance to check out Solan cross Im saving for the end of the season I knew you going to say I I am I am intrigued to check it out but I dont want to watch the season finale when I havt watched all season long okay Im a binge Watcher type of guy so Im going to go ahead and DVR and just go and run it back to back I have been watching Whos Line and Pen tell seriously Music okay big big big news in the golf world yesterday with uh CW ramifications John R joing the L tour yeah I wish best player in the world yeah my golf game is is much to be a Desir you dont have to play it you just got to watch it on the CER missed it left offensive rebound though Al would love to create some Second Chance points theyve not done that much in this first half theyre hanging around that would be a big shot if it went it did not to weather spoon again the hes without Chan padulla foot injury not expected to be longterm but Mike young doesnt want to be a nagging thing so thought they could sit him today hope hes dont play again till next Saturday against ront Couture thats tough thats tough again for H Couture thats one of the the game parts of his game I think is really improved is his ability to be able to put the ball on the deck and play through contact Edwards pressured by long back out to Dio final minute of the first half here at Castle Coliseum to the corner weather spoon rebound Rex Steiner good close out by Tyler nichel I thought re Rex Steiner has done a really good job in the first half and I thought Mikes done a good job of being able to balance his time in where its not overwhelming him with too much Couture sets his feet off the ground long Crees another chance deep three Rex Steiner shot clock now off here for valo beacons turned it over 11 times in their first half on Wednesday at Central Michigan theyve given it away only seven times in the half today to compared to pokeys 11 but 14point game nickel the steel half court to the Buzzard no that would have been sweet but uh second half lets go Ive always thought the first five minutes is critical for both teams for Val perzo they got to try to capitalize on the turnovers and take care of the Rock and for Virginia Tech keep doing what youre doing inside out balance and do a better job of with those turnovers more of the great defense that you were referring to from Hunter pure right there justs absolutely pick Stafford pocket deflected out of bounds by Stafford and if youre Roger pow Junior what you want for your team you you want to come out of the half with a little bit more energy you want to get in those passing Lanes you want to try to get some early bucket you know they were able to turn Virginia take over you want to see what you can get some early offense and three more for Hunter Couture he does such an exceptional job of being able to come and off those screens and square his body I mean you look at the distance that hes able to shoot the ball and I like that hes balancing not trying to do too much r that felt like such a critical possession if they dont score and then Virginia Tech comes down and scores all of a sudden its 19 or 20 and it feels very different and heres the thing for Edwards Hes been really impressive for valo again we talked about Stafford in the open but its been efforts that pretty much has made some really big plays for them reer start of the first half out there again to begin the second niichel feeds the post kid doubled lost his dribble kicks it out nichel contested three bed by long and it finds ly kid and those are the balls you have to come up if youre a Val you play solid defense you got to come up with that rebound you cant give Virginia Tech another crack at it 1er picks up his second personal foul kid the senior from Gainesville listed as a senior but he does have another year of Eligibility after this one were getting closer to the end of the co era but were not there yet terms of Eligibility Miner Shan padulla wearing that boot on his right foot unavailable to play today wait hes a high energy kid imagine its hard for him to sit on the bench absolutely and its one of those things too as a pre you want to make sure this something that goes away thats not nagging because especially with the foot this is your point guard you do not want to have this be one of those things thats going with you and your bothering once you get to ACC conference L kid now double figures for the eighth time in 10 games this year for the hokes look at the defense by two shooting the Gap tough tear drop cire sep and seps one of those guys too for Roger pal team thats coming in off the bench has done well opting to go with him in the second Applause Music half theres no way Mike Youngs happy about 11 turnovers in the first half what what do you think his message was to his team and what number like would he be okay with 14 15 turnovers at the end of the game well I think that when you look at the fact that Val a lot of his VPO and the fact that theyre getting in passing lanes and theyre active theyve got guys that can put their hands on the ball if Im Mike young you say hey stay with yourself dont try to do too much you know make sure that the ball goes left to right understand that this is a team thats going to try thats going to mix up their coverages but I think he also understands that not having Shan fadoua put you in a position where you dont have your best playmaker and there going to be some slight Growing Pains throughout the game Edwards and Couture really getting to know each other out there well both of them are and again when you look at you got to basically stay with Hunter Couture because you know The Scouting Report says you cant give this guy any daylight theyre going to run him off a lot of screens re pops free Stafford the rebound Stafford one on five wa for his teammate to get down there then he finds himself wide open rebound batted to Couture he misses that shot because he has not been able to get any kind of Rhythm established and a lot of that want to say is because hunter in the defense he played on him so far youre right Stafford two of seven kid comes up short kid first Miss from the field great recovery by long saw kids shoot out the Gap and a lot of times you see that defense a lot of times your bigs cant get out on the point guards like that to stop theyre momentum Stafford great help defense from Couture he smacked it off the leg of the valo cutter and you asked me in the first half how I saw this Virginia Tech Team and one of the things about is that when you see right now how they play defense its not just so much the oneonone defense as how theyre active in the passing lanes and how well they defend the perimeter I was just getting ready to say Ive been impressed with their defensive connectivity today theyre moving to together and that that comes from Mike young and what he has and a lot of times coaches will type get the type of players that fit their system you see great mve down by poti just good to finish at the ri everything but the bucket then they get poti going over the back but theyre theyre theyre constants with Mike Youngs team this is a team thats going to play great in a half court as far as defense theyre going to share the ball theyre going to be gener typically a low turnover team and theyre going to have uh an inside outside presence and shoot the three if anything the threepoint shooting has been a little below average by what youre used to from Virginia Tech early this year but Tyler n trying to change that but thats the guy that I think is going to get better you see and if youre Roger pow J you have to be frustrated because you play really good defense but yet you dont come up with that rebound and the best time to shoot a three is on the kick out and thats the last guy you want to give an opportunity to be to shoot the three under Couture third of the day 278th of his Hoke career cout is now a leading score with 13 Edwards dishes set short threepoint struggles continue for valo theyre two of 17 12 not going to get it done on the road against an ACC opponent Music this is Rex Steiner not enough Loft on that pass intended for poti but good defense recovering in transition he saw ster trying to go one on Three obviously thats not what you want to do especially on the row for a guy thats struggling to score Dios pass deflected Nicholls steals it up ahead for l Tyler nichel for me is the wild card for this team because again with his length his ability to make shots and in the fact of how he is as far as Defender you see right now Roger power a little little frustrated with his team right now you see Virginia Tech basically years so we got a slew time outs out of the way lets play some basketball here at Castle Coliseum 1435 to go and valo look they came back from 22 down to cut it to three on Wednesday at Central Michigan against Tony Barbs chipa was B trying to snap a threegame losing streak Virginia Tech got their first ACC win of the year on Sunday Over Louisville Mike young 4 one in ACC openers as coach of the hokes after been three decades leading the wford program down South Carolina what a great fit he has been here at Virginia te and you could tell by just uh the way that the style of play and and for those who did not get a chance to see with T at wford you see that the talent pool obviously is a lot better now uh but its a lot of what he did before you watch this Mike young team theyre going to play with grit theyre going to move the ball play defense and theres a lot of consistency thats turned into a lot of success while hes been in Virginia Tech Daren too strong I mean you think about Hunter coutur made a lot of Threes how many more threes would he have made if he was playing against the Southern Conference all these years and heres the thing is that I dont know if he would stuck around for four years in this probably not and in this day and age probably not jumper for good brings valo back within 16 and off in the second half has been all Virginia Tech but bzo state is stuck around in order for them to get back in this game EV that they got to continue to you know play hard they got to get into the passing lanes and they got to try to limit Virginia Tech and what they want to do virin Tech has done a good job of recognizing the double teams and the ball moving getting these wide open shots Pro tips the rebound all the way to Mid court and its the second chance opportunities too they got to limit they got to get those rebounds and lock them up and not give Virginia Tech second and third opportunities Poes are up 16 tough to complain too much without your starting point guard but MJ Collins still looking to find his rhythm so for four and 11 minutes has not scored theres some theres something that when you dont shoot the ball well and then you come out and have a great a great game what happens you elevate on The Scouting Report okay people start saying hey you know what this guy just came off from the 20point game shooting the ball and you get a little bit more attention versus the guy thats 04 Couture to re Steiner my goodness he absorbs the contact no whistle this would be incredible but its an air ball should have been called a foul thats all the pass X kind of goes through it and you see Mike young over there encouraging his freshman and thats one of the thing this is great for him is sometimes that that baptism by fire and having minutes to play and work through your mistakes is always key when he committed to Virginia Tech he said that he sees himself in a similar vein as a storm Murphy or Shan padulla a shop maker a passer a facilitator guy that can play hard and run the team but we were talking to Mike young about that earlier because if you remember when storm Murphy was here sha padulla was coming off the bench in the same same role as Rex Diner because again youve got a veteran presence where you can come in and play and right now when you look at his lower base he reminds me of a younger sha padulla y weather SP for three offensive rebound Jerome palm and then tried to get it out for aabo and valo cannot control Music it AA Bo had a homecoming game on Wednesday played at Central Michigan last year part of a Chipawa team that won enan Arbor beat the Michigan Wolverines last season re Steiner being badgered by Dio I know H fans would love to see MJ Collins get off the snide here xer inside from and heres the thing R Steiner came off with that he hugged that Pi where forced the defender to have to Trail once he touched the paint that forced the big to have to come over and then he was able to get the ball over and you saw nice little dump off thats a great play by Rick Applause Steiner Tom couldnt catch the entry pass Collins comes up with a steal Couture to Baron beautiful and heres the thing we talk about this with and take when you get out of transition you see the guards run to their spots Collins realized that hes going to have Couture over there and Couture realized one more pass pass him a good shot for a better shot to give Baron a wide open three in the corner nine points for Robbie Baron new season high as a hokei the AO circles the wagons gets it back in the corner three to shoot pal banging with poke win for potit man thats banging against the wall I mean pal tried his best but potit didnt even move at all hes a sturdy fellow Couture off the curl on the drive through the contact and Hunter looking out from whats above to make sure he doesnt get drilled you watch the the Finish By poti off of a pass by re Steiner and again you getting out ahead of everyone and its been that type of afternoon for Virginia Tech and Link H has had a steady game see only two for three but 10 10 points and four rebounds an efficient game for him and the hes surprising that hes only taken three official field goal attempts I think a lot of it is that he was able to get started earlier and then Val perzo made a concerted effort to double the low post and open up the perimeter and it opened up the perimeter and thats why its really its essential you play inside out and I think thats whats basically opened this game up is that the guards have been able to get to catch fire Couture at the line out of the timeout fou was on pal before the break look in the last three games hogis have struggled shooting the ball they made 13 of their 57 threes over the past three games thats 23 today 43 nine made threes but heres when you throw Robbie Baron in there hes knocked down some threes Ty Nicholas knocked down some threes you know what youre going to get from Hunter Couture those are the guys that I think that as you play more games you see Robbie Baron moving his feet those guys are going to knock shots theyre not going to have they shoot the ball well too way too well you can tell about their form and and again getting in the gym having those reps and playing these nonconference games will get those guys straight and this Virginia Tech team will be a better threepoint shooting team come conference play is another guy whos been struggling from the perimeter lately but a guy that that can really get hot as we know weve seen it kads replacement today was Rex Steiner The Freshman kid again double beautiful pass Baron blocked from behind by Stafford but I like the recognition by ly kid you realize your double team and you know where the double is coming from that last time Baron was able to get there but just a better play defensively wager going at Baron excellent defense Again by Robbie and the whole thing is the been without fouling you saw that last time he stayed straight he didnt reach and he just used his link kid knocks it down Hunter could to create so many opportunities for everyone else when he comes off of that little Stager that curl you have to honor him because the defense understands that hes going to score and he opts the pass up to Lyn kid talk about kid not getting a lot of shots but very unselfish play by Couture SE gets it back to to a 23point game snaps the 90 Run Virginia Tech has methodically created separation here pretty light December for the hes conference opener last Sunday couple more nonconference games Vermont and American after today and then back in ACC play for good December 30th at Wake Forest theres no case that the Spencer sisters cant solve together catch the season finale of the Spencer sisters starring Leah Thompson and Stacy Farber this Wednesday at 98 Central only on the CW and spoiler alert theyre not actually sisters the plot thickens doesnt it Rex Steiner one for five both from from the floor and from Music three pal defended well by kid back outside Stafford de arrows open nice penetration by Stafford drove drew two Defenders gets the ball out to Stafford Stafford knocking down that shot and again excuse me Dio knocking down that shot Music with a defender on his back dises for kid rare Miss for Lyn and I said a minute ago that re stard is one for five despite that I feel like hes done a pretty solid job of quarterback in the team yeah and heres the thing you thats not what you needed from him today you needed him to be able to stay solid you talked about the basic cable and in fact you wanted him to run offense and stay uh steady on defense and take it the opportunities when they come to you and I feel like right now hes done what Mike young needed him to do for this ball Club under eight minutes to play here in a Saturday in blackburg kid takes it step pulls it down crowd chanting airball at Isaiah Stafford Dio from the elbow rattles it in and that was a nice place by Dio he saw Baron step out a lot of times when bigs just show he want to drag them out to make sure that theyre going to be committed and it was just a quick flash by Baron Theo realizes that he can get further into the lane nice little pull up I got a question Brown I dont want you to be insulted by it did anybody ever cant airball at you when you were playing and did you hear it first of all man how dare you do airball and Brian Oliver are not associated at all ever I I I was hoping youd extrapolate on just what it might feel like can you imagine maybe in Papa shot mean if I shot an air ball and thats even highly unlikely Stafford knocks down the jumper did you hear the crowd when you played oh yeah absolutely and I was one of those players that actually uh I I pride at myself in being able to try to silence the crowd so a lot of times you playing on the road um you want to not engage but you want to take advantage of trying to to play off of the Applause crowd Brent Cy had a fantastic season here in blackburg certainly making great strides from year one to year two taking over this Hoke program last year Hokes getting ready for a bowl game they throttled their Rivals from Charlottesville in their season finale so theyre still still basking in the glory of that we talked earlier about ACC teams going bowling and forgive me I was so caught up in my yellow jackets finally going bowling after about five or six years your Demon Deacons going bowling I know it was a tough year for the deak sna snapped a sevenyear B streak for Dave CL I was just so locked in on the yellow jackets this year it wasnt a shot at at you and your of course it wasnt it was not just happened to be after I mentioned the possibility that you might have had an airball you do know him I am ready Hunter Couture drawing contact great penetration by Hunter Couture and we talk about his ability to shoot the three and obviously you have to chase him off the three but I feel like over the years he has been much better putting the ball on the floor and low key is really athletic too for his size and his ability to get to the basket and absorb contact Mike young said its been a pleasure and a privilege to coach Hunter Couture he was asked by the local media when you brought him here when you recruited him to waer do you think he could be the alltime leading threepoint shooter and Mike young kind of laughed and said I I was just hoping hed be able to play I thought it very interesting too he he he he aspires to be a coach and then I thought I read it in the notes where he said that Mike young rarely does this but he allowed him to be able to throw up a plate y during one of the gamees so that says an awful lot hokes by 20 550 Music remaining SE had a solid game off the Ben he has Im sorry go ahead man nice dime by Dio and again you talked about set but I thought that you know if youre Roger Po and you go back and you look at positive obviously the facts that your team still fighting in this game with a little more than 5 minutes but there theres been individual play out here that I think that you can go in is good for tap because again we talked about this is a very young team and you know youre trying to establish something and a lot of times when teams like Val perzo go on the road and youre playing against the the Illinois and the Drakes and the Virginia techs uh you got to have a Herculean effort to win but youre trying to develop something that you can carry over into conference play Stafford on the drive with the left hand we highlighted when we talk to Roger how J this is a gritty team but they normally celebrate how gritty they play 134 run last 4 and A2 Music minutes another couple stops another couple scores get a little interesting here cout FES it takes ites it heres the thing you saw the defender realized you got an honor coming out at Hunter all you basically do is give him a a little bit of a ball F you see a nice Blow by by Stafford bending against long Stafford into double figures for the ninth time in 10 Valpo games this year Music best thats why I feel like this Virginia Tech team is is going to be a team to reckon with because again uh the offensive discipline that they show have um and they force you to play for at least the first 15 seconds of the shot clock and you have to be a disciplined defensive team to be able to endure that and thats why I think that theyre going to continue to get better throughout the season jayen young getting some minutes today sets up nichel for Applause three hes only going to get better I feel like with his length shot making ability and hes a very good defender on the perimeter hes the wild card from me for this Virginia Tech Team in his play four for seven from three for nickel today Edwards rebound pinballs around last touched by Valpo pookys ball with four minutes to go and we will step aside Virginia Tech has made 10 threes today got a 19point lead when youre great your game does the talk in the ACC our speaks Vol Couture was not even the guy thats leading the pack pretty much has been Tyler nickel for four for seven but will balance if youre Mike young you have to be happy with the way you shot the Rock today onor three of six just two of his previous 17 over the past three games coming into today Hokies have made five of their last six shots and have created the separation again after valo crept a little bit Applause closer Barren Cross Lane pass intercepted stolen by Sherman weather spoon the forth weather scw another interesting freshman from Buoy Maryland he played for gatha Coach Mike Jones before Jones came to Virginia Tech last couple Applause years ask Roger Powell which of the coaches that hes played for are worked under does he most resemble a style to and he mentioned three guys Bill self who recruited in to to Illinois the early 2000s Bryce Drew who he coached under and obviously the valo legend one of the great shots in NCAA basketball history in the tournament in the late 90s and then we talked about markager thats thats an amazing pedigree when you talk about those coach and the success that theyve had in the college basketball landscape and I thought it interesting too is that he had plenty of jobs that he had turned down yeah and a man that talks about being huge in his face this was the right time you see long come up the challenge that shot by Stafford coming up next Kyle filipowski and the Duke Blue Devils will take on the Charlotte 49ers some news from just about 15 minutes ago Duke tweeting out that tyres Proctor will not play today after suffering the ankle injury in Atlanta last Saturday yeah Proctors one of those guys and is an amazing player and back to Philip palski you know was a guy that could have put his name in the NBA draft but opted to come back and a lot of what the D Blue Devils are going to do to see was going to ride on him but theyre a very talented team I know they took an L to my yellow jackets but they theyve got a great Applause balance I mean obviously do coming off backto back losses falling in Arkansas and George Tech theyre back home today they play very very well only lost once under John sh against Arizona inside Cameron indor what do you think of this Duke team no I like them and I think that if youre Charlotte you do not want to come off for this team because again U theyve got a good mixture in young players and in the the veterans and again going back to Philip palski I think that hes definitely on the front runner for ACC player of the year but theyve got some talented freshman too um I think Shy has done an amazing job obviously them coming off with winning the ACCC Championship uh but he is um done a great job filling in for the Hall of Fame of Mesi filipowski was voted the preseason player of the year hes currently sixth in the league in scoring Pittsburghs Blake Hinson is currently leading the league and scoring right now uncs RJ Davis number two and the other guy who I think is in the player of the year mix early Clemsons PJ Hall third in the league 202 points per game tigers have not lost this year yet and thats another team too obviously we talk about Carolina and Miami and Duke that Clemson team uh PJ Hall I think that the the key for him is staying healthy because he is one of those guys that if he can well challenge is probably the best beig in the AC with his ability to shoot the ball inside and out hes a load on the on the block how about the game Ian sheflin had against South Carolina grabbing rebounds the other day sheflin and Hall inside good experienced backourt Joe Gerard coming over from Syracuse Chase Hunter and thats the thing when you throw in Joe Gerard and Chase Hunter I mean this is a team that shown that they can beat anyone and they know that 0 interesting to see how they can they can keep it going going to the confence play well Camden cant connect on the prayer but maai long with the easiest offensive rebound stickback hell probably ever have 6748 Virginia Tech by 19 under two minutes here at Music Castle Camden making his fifth appearance of the Season hes got a streak on the line hes had limited minutes but hes made a three in previous four games hes played this year so see if he can keep that going here comes Patrick wesler the big S foot red Shir freshman from Matthews North Carolina making his third appearance of the season for Mike Youngs Music hokes outside shot just has not been a consistent weapon today for Valpo theyre now 3 for 21 Beyond The Arc as a team 14 BPO gets to go back home to play at the ark next Saturday theyll host Chicago State and three days later theyll play Samford three more nonconference games for the beacons before back into the Missouri Valley a lot of good teams in the valley Drake Indiana State obviously Belmonts had some really great teams recent years tough league and they have branded their conference tournament one of the best monikers in college basketball its not March Madness Arch Madness baby youre already talking March man we havent even gotten out of December the march to Arch Madness just gets me Applause going Charlotte Duke just after the top of the hour with Tom wormy and Mike jinsky is in his 30th year calling college basketball games here G man a bit westler with a rebound his third of the Year virgia Tech can improve to seven and three Brian with Vermont and American the other two upcoming tuneups here at Castle before the ACC season continues SL tries to score cant finish gets it back minut to play K for young long another rebound the crowd really wants to see Wesley score but they applaud Youngs hustle maai long with another bucket six points for maai quick whistle to bring in the rest of the WalkOns Here Comes Michael Ward and Connor Venable I always thought it was funny at the end of the game you know the crowds always chanting for the guys to shoot the ball and and heres the thing for WalkOns is that its an opportunity because those are the guys that are practicing a in and day out and you imagine the first couple of times you know the adrenaline is adrenaline is flowing Music and you pray for those guys to be able to make a basket theres a 7c difference between the game and shot clock here so theres certainly a license for one of these WalkOns to throw up a shot Jaden young not one of the WalkOns talented freshman out of Greensboro Day where he played for legendary Freddy Johnson first action of the year for Ward and Venable and its young looking for his offense Venable has a chance and hes unable to lay it in amongst the trees final six seconds Isaiah Stafford over wesler comes up short and that will do it today
