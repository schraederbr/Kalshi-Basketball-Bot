different Theyre playing different offensively So you theyre showing that you can play sound quality defense and still pay play fast pace on the offensive end of the floor And we are underway as Virginia wins the opening tip And a tiptoe save by the point guard Don Hall Yeah theyre getting about 85 points a game Louisville just 7 and 24 all time against Virginia That sticks a little bit for Cardinals fans The swing here for Hall Not a big scoreer but a really good passer The offbalance shot that wont fall for Derritter So his first miss tonight And thats the one of the things were going to have to keep an eye on throughout this game How many times the Cards can keep the Whos to one and done when it comes to shot attempts Virginia 14 offensive rebounds a game as the Cards come up with their own offensive rebound However Conwell unable to finish Yeah missed both of those shots Hes coming back from a bit of a knee injury Cost him one game against Boston College bang knees with a teammate on Thursday at practice So a bone bruise there Heres Ditter lining up a long one Got a great look Rebound is going to be tipped out Back over to Louisville it goes cheering And scoreless inside the first minute Both head coaches know each other very very well Ryan ODM for Virginia Pat Kelsey in year number two at the Bill A lot of similarities between these two coaches and they talked to us about it earlier today about coming into the business right around the same time and how much time they spent in the gyms together Pat Kelsey a great admirer of Ryan ODM and particularly his hair He said you know Im losing mind Hes got a great head of hair Another back down in the lane Blocked away and a good defensive stop by Don Hall He came out of nowhere to deflect that in transition Long run Grunlow up top and nice touch by the big fella from Germany the 7footer But you see immediately on a made field goal youll find everyone from Virginia picking up 94 ft especially Derritter whos got a really a tough matchup having to play against a smaller guard guard than Javon Ridley shot and Grunlo got a hand on that one Hes an elite rim protector and something Virginia you were talking about this practice today they do so well They block a lot of shots Yeah When you consider you know Onenso as well as Gruno these two guys together number two and number three respectively in the ACC and block shots per game Hadley got a look off the back iron The high rebound triggers the fast break here for Virginia Pounding his way in Lewis and hell drop it in Sam Lewis the junior out of Chicago gets about 10 points a game and Virginia with a five nothing start And one of the things you see once again is IMAC lines up one unable to get it to go Virginia doing a great job on the boards as well These are the two best rebounding teams in the ACC OB Thomas with a kick He got airborne The long ones going to be drilled in by Lewis who had a terrific game against NC State in which he made five threes and scored 23 And this is a great start for Virginia especially in this building to this point Theyve been able to keep the crowd out of it and keeping this crowd thats normally very rockless quiet Conwell rather ill advised right into the trees Heres Woolly that wont drop Sophomore is also off to a very hot start and hes broken into the starting lineup the last six seven games Bruno again straight on will bury the three and the excellent start for Virginia gets even better And Ryan ODM encourages his bigs to shoot the three especially in the trail position when theres no one there to pick them up And Virginia doing the job on both ends of the floor defensively Grundo coming up with the block shot and it gets out into the offensive end Gruno at the top of the key able to knock down his second threepoint field goal of the game Malik Thomas just picked up the foul for Virginia But an 11 to nothing start for the Cavaliers Theyre a good shooting team 48 37 beyond the threepoint line But theyre the kind of team that when they get hot they can get red hot And theyve done that here in the early minutes 1654 to go in the first half and a lot of the fans are just getting into their seats here at the Young Alvin Hall trying to get the bench to challenge this out of bounds call He felt like that basketball went off of Conwell and I believe the officials have changed it The balls been overturned They have overturned it without a challenge Theyve overturned it and given the basketball back to Virginia Bert Smith Matt Potter Marcus Pedigrew the officials tonight So everything in the early minutes breaking Virginias way Up top Thomas Lewis looking inside will take a long one He nails it But go back to the point He encourages coach ODM encourages everyone on the roster to shoot the three and to shoot it with confidence And youve seen the two centers the five men have already accounted for nine points beyond the threepoint line Obie Virginia off to the best possible start they could have Last thing that Pat Kelsey wanted to do is call a timeout that fast but he was forced into it He couldnt wait till the media timeout after Virginia gets off to a 140 run So Banks went in for three So what do you do You go unconventional and knock down the three off the glass But Im sure the Card Faithful dont care how it went in as long as they got the points on the board Hes a top score at 20 points a game A reach and a foul against Louisville here for Virginia coming in 142 They beat Stanford on Saturday by 15 to make a clean sweep for the California ACC teams Their only losses so far to Butler and in three overtimes at Virginia Tech on New Years Eve But that was a wakeup call the Virginia Tech game because going on the road and Brian ODM tried to prepare his team for what they were going to see going into that game and Sam Lewis is unable to get it going stoppage of play here and a foul off the ball with 1550 to go And Ta Ritter looks like he took a little friendly fire on that one in for Virginia number 11 Tillis and shaken up Take a look Yeah thats just inadvertent Conwell getting involved and really trying to brace his fall cuz hes going to the ground Catches the Ritter in the face No harm no foul Easy for me to say over here with the shirt and tie on 143 Virginia So Louisville looking to recover Ali Khalifa in the game The 7 foot senior from Egypt Hell get one downstairs Hes an outstanding passer Shot clock inside 10 and McNeely will launch this one and knock it down So here come the Cardinals quickly from Re Yeah backto back threepoint field goals made on the last two possessions for the Cards to get this crowd right back into the game Mallerie on the drive the onehander No and a whistle cheering applause with 1511 to go in the first half This is just great action by the Cards Isaac McNeely one of the best in the business coming off of screens and that time in motion steps right into the three and able to knock it down But Obie now we get an opportunity to see Virginias best threepoint shooter from a year ago versus Virginias best threepoint shooter this year Jakari White checking into the game for Virginia now the first time since December the 20th Thats when he broke his left wrist He is righthanded but on a spectacular dunk against Maryland Now they played exceptionally well without him but he was hitting 50 beyond the threepoint line when he went down and a real offensive force Six to get off a shot McNeely trying to drive past Tillis and Tillis will hold him up and commit the foul 11 So Jakari 63 grad out of Orlando Hes had some big games at 25 against Dayton A game that saw him go seven for seven from threepoint land And Obi had a stretch where he made 12 straight threepoint field goals throughout this season And you mentioned it 50 from three Was leading the ACC in field goal percentage until this game where he didnt qualify Khalipo with the turnover Heres Tillis And heres White wearing a wrap on that injured wrist And another hold and a foul Khalifa this time But I love the consistency Its the exact same foul that was called on Tillis on the prior possession trying to guard Isaac McNeely away from the basket And thats all you ever ask of officials Be consistent on both end We got a really good crew here this evening And weve seen the consistency early Well this one of the biggest games in the early part of the ACC schedule No question about that two nationally ranked teams Thats something you probably wouldnt have seen in January a couple of years ago in the ACC but times have changed dramatically in this conference Down on his back and a good job to keep that one alive by Mallalerie The long one is off the back of the iron by Thomas Big scrap of the rebound and picked up by the Cardinals And then they come cheering A little cut in the back door by Woolly and they take it away A block shot Another one for Virginia We talked about the tandem of rim protection they have up front Phillis got an excellent look A foul on the floor in the rebounding action A nice find by Khalifa but Oniansu once again there to deny an music opportunity So now Grundo and onto both already in the block category in this game as Gruno checks back in after knocking down two threes in his first in So one 7 foot rim protector for another Not many teams can say that theyve combined for 81 block shots coming into play tonight And you really have to give Ryan ODM and his staff a tremendous amount of credit for the roster they put together especially based upon the way they want to play out there Rebound tipped out high and a nice save by Conwell Heres Hadley calling it tight cheering And Thomas will pick up the foul actually on Deon Tillis And another Super Tuesday matchup coming your way Undefeated number two Iowa State taking on freshman phenom Darren Peterson in Kansas at Allen Fieldhouse Coverage getting underway at 9 Eastern on ESPN and the ESPN app How interesting is that to look at that promo and seen no number beside Kansas name Theres very few times that weve done that in our extended careers OB where you dont have a ranked Kansas team For sure Woolly nice job to reverse field but cant get it to go and a whistle It was with five on the shot clock Adrien Woolly who started the last six games had 21 against Cal on December 30th And Woolly attacking the basket but once again that rim protection Bruno does a nice job of staying vertical but give the Cards credit crashing the glass Both these teams do a tremendous job of going after offensive rebounds And the crowd here not happy about the fact that theyre not shooting not shooting free throws on this possession Wow Im as surprised as they are Conwell going the other way with a left hand Spins it up for two How about the patience of Conwell in the painted area playing off two feet and able to pivot around not only his defender but his teammate as well cheering Now Pat Kelseys got his crowd riled up after that was not called a shooting foul and should have been Der pounding his way inside and thats going to be stripped by Hadley Virginia got off to a 14 to nothing start They havent scored since 80 run now for the Cards looking to add to it on this possession Long distance Thatll be a round and out off target by Hadley One and done Malik Thomas 13 points a game Airborne And heres Derritter has been really quiet so far Back out for Lewis in an open shot and suddenly theyre not falling and the block by Conwell Had a whistle in the lane How about Conwell giving Grunlow a bit of his own medicine Two offensive rebounds for Grunlow on that possession But the second one well you on the other end of the floor you see Conwell pivoting on the interior able to finish around the defense But how about this play by Ron Conwell denying the big fella but still gets in there for the foul Three opportunities for Virginia on one possession Will he just picked up his first foul Lewis at the line Sam Lewis 70 there back in for the Cards replacing Kobe Rogers Transfer from Toledo where he averaged 16 points a game last season And he was a guy that Ryan ODM really wanted to acquire a bonafide shooter and he is coming through with some big performances as of late But how about this Virginia scores They want to make sure they push everyone into the front court defending Even Derritter at 69 guarding 94 ft Woolly Heres F to kick it out and a bad pass picked off by Lewis Thomas stopped at the foul line Will he came back to protect the lane cheering Thomas Bruno up to set a screen Midrange jumper His shots were falling right away particularly from long range for Virginia Another foul and they tighten it up with the whistles here the last five or six minutes and another foul 168 Virginia they got off cancers What a start for Virginia but they have cooled off since then for their last nine The cars have found a little offense for themselves Virginia making two free throws after getting off to that 140 run The Cards have done the job defensively Derritter right into a double flings it out for Grunlow off the back of the iron They miss another one and itll be tapped out back over to the Cardinals And a nice job on that possession by Fu attacking the Ritter once he turned his back not allowing him to have good vision out of the trap Conwell a 64 senior Hes attempted 213 shots 150 of them beyond the threepoint line and he has made the most threes of anyone in the ACC this season averaging close to 37 threes made per game Kicks out McNeely short former Virginia Cavalier up to Chile Stark against his old team first game against him after three years on the campus in Charlottesville And heres White from the corner heaving that one up Itll be tipped out And theyll keep it on this end B Smith is about to send it the other way but he got it right That was off of Hadley last trying to control that rebound So Mallerie to put it in in for White Hell try another Another rebound tipped right to McNeely Pat Kelsey told us earlier every shot that goes up for Virginia you got to make sure you get a body on everyone as even their guards crash the offensive glass And Ryan told us hey every now and then they may give up a transition opportunity by trying to get offensive rebound but they feel the analytics tell them its worth it Tester averaging 16 points eight rebounds a game straight on here And so far hes having a hard time getting involved in the Virginia offense Lewis for White his third shot And that one around and out but also a foul on the play 15 foul So itll be foul number two on Adrien Woolly And its going to be three shots coming for Jakari White And this is if youre Jakari White this is a great opportunity for you to see the ball go through the basket in game action Weve talked about how much time hes missed And so opportunity now hes 0 for two from beyond the arc but has a chance now to see the ball go through the basket Misses the first free throw And this has been a struggle for Virginia on the season Theyre only shooting 688 8 from the free throw line as a team which is rare for a team that shoots it so well from three And conversely if it comes down to a foul shooting contest Louisville has an edge there An excellent foul shooting team 77 Should it come down to that another one coming for White who typically is really good at the line 80 cheering And his third and go back So Virginia on top by 10 and White will take a seat Hes trying to find his way back into the flow and after missing five games with that broken wrist Pat Kelsey going to put the ball in the hands of Javon Havley a lot because you alleviate the pressure with the Ritter trying to guard him 94 ft Hadley getting 10 points again Good rebound or two The swing for McNeely Couldnt get by Thomas Conwell back to the shooter Shot clock down to three Conwell almost lost it Bigs got to shoot it now up near the logo and he switches that one in So maybe not exactly as you draw it off but it was nothing but net Well a lot of guys touch the basketball constant motion and ends up with a 40 career threepoint shoot knocking down the three Pat Kelsey will take it cheering Derritter trying to spin on the baseline out of the double Heres Thomas He buries a three Thomas for three That puts you in a tough position when you allow a player like Derritter to see where the trap is coming from and he can make a clean pass to Thomas whos no one around him as he steps into the three ball again Rebound tipped on the baseline and tipped out with 840 to go in the half Virginia will bring Don Hall their point guard back on Obi after that possession Isaac McNeely looked over to the bench patted his chest as to say my music bad on that shot But this is as aggressive as Ive seen Isaac McNeely this season really throughout his career You can tell hes playing with a little extra juice in this game I would think that was absolutely going to happen Another shot from him here Hes not lighting it up early Thomas with a bounce feed Heres Lewis from the corner and swishes it in Right now Virginia is out tripling the Louisville Cardinals That is not easy to do Yeah Louisville comes in averaging 118 threepoint field goal makes per game which is tops in the ACC But Virginia right now has a shooting touch on Louisvilles home floor crew tied up underneath and another block Onenso got up there again Keep track of those tonight Virginia has over a hundred as a team coming in Nearly tied up Conwell will launch and a foul over the back applause Monso will get him Senior from Nigeria with number one First Isaac McNeely as the shot clock trickles down to zero able to knock down the three Important and thats one of the things I mean again absolutely you have the resources here in Louisville as well as Conwells unable to get the three to go But when you think about that thats the commitment that universities are having to make to be successful at this level Look at Thomas for the offensive there 746 to go in the half And some might say Well yeah sure Theyre paying the head coach No this is his NIL budget that has gone soaring They wanted to do that They wanted to get back to being an elite team in the ACC Theyve done it And to be completely honest Ryan ODM before he left BCU had to know that this was something that the Virginia athletic department and the donors the fans were willing to do in order to build a winner because its necessary in college basketball today Khalifa turns and fires left open and rattles a threepointer Khalifa had a similar performance against Duke where he made five threes and the Blue Devils allowed him to shoot from the top of the key I dont think its in the scout report for Ryan ODM to allow him to have those wide open looks Senior from Egypt whos 24 years old by the way Ger to travel So Devin Tillis will give it away and Louisville cutting it back to 10 Khalifa so dangerous with his passing but when you play this far off of him he can knock these down Theres a guy that you cannot I mean you definitely cant allow him to have easy Those are practice shots with no one even in the picture Again Louisville attempting 34 threepoint shots per game And thatll go the other way Whistles really piling up here though going Ryan Conwell Often times we may see the officials set the tone early I believe the players actually set the tone in this one OB we saw guys diving on the floor We saw the physicality as to how this game was going to be played the officials responding to that making sure they keep everything under control knowing the stakes at hand here in a highly you know rated matchup Two top 20s Virginia coming in number 16 Louisville number 20 so far Tester Ritter with the ball now has been really quiet for Virginia It hasnt made a big difference They got off to an amazing start leading 14 to nothing Mallerie on the spin in the paint Heres Ditter Short range Got it Chance Mallerie making the play once again Touching the paint and then doing the job defensively Kelsey wanted a foul there Could have gone either way It looked like Kifu with a hand off McNeely again wants to get closer this time Turns and lot of iron go But OB IC thought about Onensu in the painted area He thought about going with the first opportunity and recognized you got to at least shot blocker He had to spin reather and then found a way to get a bucket Yeah smart kid They went to Virginia laughter right So as you tell me dribble down to Ritter Got to keep on rolling in Tied up on the play and the possession arrow will take it the other way So thatll be Louisville ball Then coming up Thursday ESPN 2 in the ESPN app Madison Booker and number four Texas taking on Joyce Edwards and number two South Carolina in Columbia Our coverage tipping at 700 Eastern time That is a heavyweight bout when you consider those two teams going at it Obie had a chance to go to SEC media day They had the men and the women there Coaches were raving about Madison Booker and her talent what she can do on the court going up against of course Don Staley who may be the best doing it in college basketball You saw a great piece on Don Staley and her upbringing in Philadelphia Terrific Watch Theres McNeely on target as he will drain a triple cheering McNeely did the easy part That was a beautiful find from Ali Khalifa from the block all the way out into the shooting pocket of IMAC Its the loudest they have been tonight inside the young center White back in the game for Ryan ODM Ditter deep in the corner cheering working on Hadley going oneonone Lost it for a second Shoves it up Rebound tipped around on the baseline Conwell Nice save cheering Conwells a trailer Khalifa will swing it Woollys open and a rebound comes right to Virginia 2619 Cardinals have certainly grabbed the momentum here the last couple of minutes cheering All slamming on the brakes Long distance Mallerie shot clangs there On the endo shot right on top of the 10 wont go Mallerie again That one glances off the iron Conwell Heres another one Rebounded by Hall One and done for the Cardinals Virginia with two offensive rebounds on their last possession As you mentioned Louisville only one attempt Virginias winning the battle of the two best rebounding teams in the league White Fight will catch and fire and hits the three And again he came in hitting 50 for the season The long layup with the broken wrist but he can really shoot LB but think about the fact before he checked out he saw two free throws go down So got to see the basketball go through which only builds the confidence of a shooter getting back into action was a great point McNeely lays it off Khif has made a big difference as he checked into the game Theres another great pass for him laid in by Willie but another terrific find and a whistle as well And when you can play through your big guy who has the ability to not only handle the basketball on the perimeter but drops the way Ali Khalifa does you music have a different element to your offense Khalifa off the bounce finds Willie who changes in midair music The contact the hoop the harm Khalifa also finding IMAC music from three knocking down a big one as the Cards had to right So Seth Greenberg gave Ryan ODM his first job Really Out of out of college Ryan first went to work for Seth Greenberg And I take that back I dont know if they live together Seth actually stayed with Dave ODM Ryan wasnt born at that time when Seth was a coach at the University music of Virginia So there are a lot of ties between Ryan ODM and Seth Greenberg And not only did Ryan work for Seth in his first job he also went back and worked for him at Virginia Tech when Seth was the head coach there So Ryan ODM speaks very highly of Seth Greenberg He doesnt care what the rest of us say about him I have to say his roommates they didnt go broke on hair products thats for sure laughter But you know although this guy has a great head of hair and we love our coach all will hand it off for Malik Thomas And a great great run here for Louisville to cut this thing down to 2922 Thats going to be a traveling violation And back over the Cardinals it goes with 310 left in the half Impact Kelsey both pregame about are these your dream jobs and both of them to te simply said there this this is beyond a dream I never imagined having this job but both of them are extremely fortunate and gracious to be in the positions theyre in now Yeah Pat Kelsey ticked off a couple of schools he said But Louisville that was like the city on the hill There was no way I was ever going to get there cheering Jason Prior will turn and fire The 610 sixth year grad who blew out his knee a year ago after a strong start has been trying to find his way back into it here He makes a tough shot This is now a fivepoint game Case Prior getting an early opportunity cheering as Der picks up the offensive foul Kobe Rogers fighting over the screen and his effort gets him the possession back trying to get over that screen Takes the hit but Case Prior getting in the game earlier with the no canai roofs playing in this evening out with the flu And so Pat Kelsece recognizing theyve got to get a little more help up front Case Prior coming in making a big play for his team as soon as he checks in the game Can I root out as you mentioned hes 6 610 wont see him tonight You wont see Mike Elbrron Jr tonight or London Johnson the NBA GLeager Long one from downtown by Khalifa Johnson a former NBA GLeager whos not played a single minute after playing a few seasons in the GLeague Very controversially added to the Louisville team whether or not hell play Thats over the top Grunlo couldnt finish it And now the Cardinals can get a little bit closer Conwell on the drive spins it up He was harassed underneath the iron and could not get that one to roll in Paul will step back and launch No Up Ditter and theyre going to wade that off but took the hit and fouled on the play with a minute 31 to go in half number one So the foul will go on McNeely Number one on Isaac McNeely Im shocked theyre waving that off With the new rules with continuous motion this will be a one and one for Ditter but I honestly thought that that would be one that you would consider as a and one It wasnt as though he took a dribble He music didnt do anything other than catch the basketball and go straight up with it Seen it a lot in the early part of the schedule Emphasis on the NBA rules on continuation So as he comes down with the offensive rebound on the way up was the foul on Prior or McNeely McNeely Okay so maybe theyre calling it on the rebound So Ditter another one coming 64 at the line for the freshman from Belgium cheering A veteran of Spains Liga ACB Pro League Hes going to be 23 years old this month So which is why I call him a first year I do not include him in the freshman category even though hes listed as such And to your point he only has two years of eligibility Correct And so at the University of Virginia we go by years First year second year third year fourth year So he truly is a first year with only two years of eligibility I believe Mr Jefferson came up with that He absolutely did Heres Hadley into the paint Nowhere to go Tapped away Nice stop there by Grimmo from behind Ditter jumping in the paint lays it in Nice play by Derritter recognizing Hatley was going to go after the basketball and able to maneuver around for the bucket Conwell way downtown Yes he can make those all day He absolutely can He can light it up The ACCs leader in threepoint field goals made and per game sees another one go through to make it a sixpoint game Well thats the game Louisville wants They want it to be a threepoint shooting contest Nobody takes more than they do Lewis bounces out high for Derritter cheering Shot clock sitting at seven from the corner The jumper around and up by Thomas And this is where the lack of a point guard often comes into play Having to look over to the side Pat Kelsey making sure they understand time and score You want the last shot of the half He was able to get Conwells attention to make sure they got it across Well they cheering were down 14 to nothing They can go into the locker room at halftime trailing by only three And a whistle with four seconds left Once again consistent whistle If you put two hands on a ball handler that far away from the basket its going to get called against St Louis Well weve seen the officials with that call on both ends of the floor You appreciate the consistency Put Conwell to the line where hes 84 Hes coming back from that relatively minor knee injury Its always a relatively minor injury when its somebody else He was in pretty good pain after knocking these with a teammate in practice on Thursday And Virginia will take a timeout 4 seconds on the clock Were going to take a break as well Back in 30 seconds here to the UMP Center 3327 Virginia Awesome Thats two words but they are laughter that and he makes the second one Conwell on the money Chance for a heave here for Virginia All will get it off on the run and off the back of the backboard by Mallerie And thats how the first half comes to an end Our star stories on a Tuesday night here at the Yump Center Virginia with the basketball to begin the second 20 and a quick whistle He had a lot of fouls in the first half As you mentioned both teams decided they were coming at each other with everything they had Hadley will pick up a foul An important game for Lur especially considering they lost their first ranked matchup against Duke in conference play here on their home floor So now an opportunity to redeem that win against another one of the top teams in the league Now they were down nine The Duke Blue Devils were at halftime when they came back And now Louisville trying to do that here to Virginia on their home floor Don Hall gives it up in the corner Its Thomas and thatll rattle in from threepoint territory But Thomas makes the three and immediately turns to find his man picking up This is Ryan ODM style of play Score so that you can set up your pressure Heres Conwell Three for 10 shooting in the first half Cardinals need him to heat up McNeely straight on in and outs Rebound taken away by Louisville Has really got it underneath And a nice pass for the Fu points Hes coming up 19 against Boston College Put up a donut in the first half Yeah Fu has had a lot of success in every game outside of that Duke game Only have four points in that one but is averaging close to 16 points per game in the three other ACC contests Well Hallog got a good clean look Cant cash in cheering and a whistle right along the baseline inside the opening seconds of the second half And a sixpoint lead here for Virginia And so they will check it in on the baseline You look at Sand Fru outside of that Duke game has been spectacular for the Cards averaging a double double 157 117 in the three other ACC games Thomas trying to get it over the top to the sevenfooter It never got to Griml Hadley penetrates and lays it in on a smooth drive And a nice play aggressively by Hadley attacking the shot blocker but going with the inside hand to finish around the outstretched arm So down to a fourpoint game Jer who is really locked up in the first half came in as one of the top players in the ACC Fr will pick up his second foul An attempted high low but youve got a guard right there Thats a pass that has to just be thrown up to where only your teammate can catch it That should have been an easy bucket for Virginia with Brumlow having such a mismatch cheering with Conwell trying to keep him away from the basketball Conwell does a great job fighting and comes away with the turnover Tester Ritter with a miss Another one coming cheering Obie we talked about Virginias free throw shooting struggles 688 eight on the season as Ditter goes 50 there in games as such on the road tight games these are where you have to make your free throws they cost Virginia in their triple overtime loss at Virginia Tech earlier this season the game of the year so far in the ACC off to Conwell comes in averaging 20 a game trying to operate in the baseline moving Groom low and draws the foul Great patience by Fruit He knows hes dealing with a shot blocker and is able to beat Gruno to the basket but often times great shot blockers are able to recover with their length This time Fu takes that away from Grunlow as he goes past him and then gets to his spot is patient Then the pump fake gets the big fella in the air and then forces him to foul These scuffles have been at the line only 64 Drew from Germany Played professionally in Germany for four seasons before coming to Louisville Making 79 of his field goals Well the foul lines been a different story Had a huge rebounding game against Cal Had 14 So hes had some moments Misses both Thomas A bounce here for Lewis He cant hit it Rebounds going to be tipped out But thats another just great play by Onenso getting in there forcing music two Louisville defenders to try to keep him off of the offensive glass Eventually Louisville has to knock it out of bounds just to keep it away from 33 and blue Virginia the number one offensive rebounding team in the conference Ryan ODM said We absolutely made that a focus coming into this season We wanted to dominate on the offensive glass Theyve done it Big reason theyre 14 and two Yeah Getting extra possessions Coaches and Ryan ODM a believer in analytics has that extra possession ends up being a threepoint field goal by Malik Thomas But getting more shots at the goal than your opponent is a key for Ryan Oden Right now theyre up three on the cards Eightpoint advantage for the Cavaliers FU up top This is a mismatch Conwell doesnt need to involve anyone else in that mix He probably hurt himself by trying to use the screen instead of attacking the Ritter off the bounce Gets tied up in the lane Shot clock to seven Conwell launches and too strong Hall up with the rebound Thomas just hit one a moment ago Hits another one One of the things about this Virginia team they will look for threes early in the shot clock Ryan ODM feels as though thats the best time to get them when teams are trying to retreat back defensively You can find quality looks and theyve been able to knock down two of them to push the lead 15 threepoint field goals against Memphis What he does he puts everyone in the right place He allows Ryan Conwell to go off the basketball and be a true scorer that he is He gets open opportunities for Isaac McNeely Hes able to touch the paint and create plays for the bigs on the interior to go along with the 17 points per game and five assists that he kicks out So when you look at this Louisville team he was the first player on the scouting report that you concerned yourself with which opened up opportunities for everyone else Conwell jumping in the paint slashing in for another bucket So a lot of pressure even more pressure on him Conwell the senior cheering And and Pat Kelsey told us earlier today that he wanted to make sure as Thomas knocked down another three And the Virginias now gotten hot from beyond the arc Well hes made five That equals a careerhigh which you did twice with San Francisco Hadley baseline Thats a tough drive for two Difficult to stop that It really is And thats one of the areas where the Cards could truly use Hadleys experience and his ability Hes played in big games and played alongside and against a lot of pros Lewis quick to the paint flips it up and draws a foul This big crowd inside the up center they are dying to roar But every time they inch a little closer Virginia hits a big three and now theyre up by 10 again 4636 this game but showing those flashes of why Virginia went after him so so aggressively to bring him to be a part of this lineup Five of six from beyond threepoint range tonight and having a stellar performance 26 points against Virginia Tech had 24 in their loss to Butler so he can be very explosive Lewis at the line Obie this Virginia team has had eight separate players that have had a game where 16 or more points Theyve had seven different leading scores And when you consider that thats the depth that Virginia truly brings to the table because again we come in talking about Derritter He has had pretty much a pedestrian game Louisvilles done a really good job on him but everyone else has hurt them Yep Thats why I love this time of the year you know these early conference matchups big matchups like this youre really getting a feel for whos who Youre seeing the depth of Virginia They got a lot of good players They really do And they learned their lesson at Virginia Tech about not needing the aggressiveness of the opponent Virginia Tech took it to Virginia Brian ODM was not happy with the way that they responded They gave up too many points They were destroyed on their own defensive boards They corrected things and have been back to their winning ways ever since and playing the best defense that they played throughout the season Yeah he was really happy with their defense their performance the total performance over the weekend as they beat Stanford handily McNeely the former Virginia Cavaliier at the line Excellent foul shooter 89 Back to 10 cheering Bruno handing off for White to Ritter That pass got away Had a reach and a foul So Ditter I guess the word you could use right now is discombobulated and and you got to give Javon Hadley a lot of credit Hes done the job defensively against Ditter where normally Derritter would have a advantage with a smaller guy because of his strength but Hadleys been able to stand the test but Hadley may be the only one of the cards thats won their defensive matchup throughout this game cuz everyone else from Virginia has been able to get going on the offensive end Khalifa they really turned to him to handle the ball and pass it in their comeback when they were 14 down in the first half Hadley with five to get off a shot Gives it up for Khalifa Straight on to Grant the triple Its a completely different offensive team when Khalifas on the floor in comparison to Fruit Im not saying better but you play a five out where you got a great passer on the perimeter which opens up so many opportunities for the perimeter players One of the best arenas youre going to find anywhere in college basketball Theyre ready to explode Bruno got tied up Heres Thomas to drive it Got tied up on the play Got the shot in the air Hell draw a foul here Crowd wanted the basketball back Thats going to go against Kobe Rogers though The foul Javon Hatley finding Khalifa at the top of the key Shot clock going down Khalifa shooting the basketball very confident as Mike Brown cheers on his teammate And again without the talented freshman Louisville a pedestrian three and three coming into play tonight Conwell back on McNeely off now for the Cardinals and Thomas Another one coming The Memphis game here in mid December I walked away from this building thinking to myself this Louisville team is a national championship caliber team They were that good that evening on both ends of the floor And Marel Brown didnt have a huge scoring game like he did against Kentucky But at the same time he was able to run the show get everyone in their places and allow Conwell McNeely everyone else to do their jobs Now everyone has to shift over and take on different responsibilities without Brown on the floor Khalipa again a three Cant hit this time Mallerie with the bounce speed Run low flipped that one up and a whistle on the play Thats on Khalifa Number two Khalifa So one 7footer fouling another 4941 The CFP National Championship game presented by ATT Monday 730 on ESPN pregame coverage Well thats all day long Got you covered for the game on every platform TV radios digital everything So many ways to watch and listen to the biggest game of the year Who you got Im going with the U Im in the Im in the home of the Louisville lip the greatest of all time And he made it clear Im going to shake up the world We going to shock the world Thats whats going to happen The U is going to shock the world I know what Indiana is capable of They have been annihilating their opponents on their way to the national championship game Im going with the U Going with the U And bringing up the great Muhammad Ali in his hometown Conwell No too strong Bruno has the rebound knocked away Khalifa may have picked up another one here He going to get Hadley on this one Virginia ball Javon Hadley with number two B said it would have been number four by Khalifa And again a 10point lead for Virginia Not looking like they mean to give it away today after a great start but we shall see Mallerie stays in the red and flips it up and in and draws a whistle too This young man is amazing about absorbing contact getting to the free throw line Shoots over four free throws per game and stays in attack mode at 510 able to get to the basket and really the patience and the poise for a firstear player to be able to recognize everyones covered on the outside Now its time for me to go to work Chance Mallerie is a superstar in the making You look at his numbers 108 points per game with zero starts Fourth most fourth among D1 freshman coming off the bench with no starts but third in the ACC in steals Obi imagine if hes playing 30 plus minutes which is not his role on this team but that will be his role in the future Charlottesville kid eventually decided to stay home Hand off here for Conwell Cardinals need another hot stretch Khalifa with a spin on the baseline and a whistle before the shot 1239 to go The foul on Grunlow will be number two So those two sevenfooters going toetotoe Thomas back in Virginia and Mallerie will hit the bench Heres McNeely Catches fires too strong So now you sense for Louisville theyre in a danger zone as Hall will draw the foul on Woolly And thats number three on him They really are Obie And the reason for that is Virginia is also very good handling the basketball Don Hall who going to the free throw line is second in the ACC in assist to turnover ratio So one of the things that Virginia has is a number of great ball handlers and the way that theyve been defending This is music a Louisville team that comes in averaging 85 points per game They are down to 41 right now You have to give Virginia a tremendous amount of credit for what theyve done on the defensive end of the floor coming into this building Missing the front end of the one and one and Ditter will spin it up and that looked like interference underneath the basket But who was the who grabbed the net Derritter runs away as though thats a good basket Kelsey saying these are times that try mens souls It gets him going and its an opportunity Thats what hes preaching to his team Its been a successful but not a smooth first half of the season for the Bills It really has not been Theyve dealt with a lot of injuries They dealt with a lot of missed games So the officials are trying to determine goending is the call Who actually grabbed the net here Thats the thing Who grabs the rim And thats Conwell which means that should have been a good bucket It is a good bucket right there Thats goending But that was Ditter running Thats what he was running away saying that basket should count So this is the biggest lead tonight for Virginia who started 14 zip And you have to remember that the Cards cut it to five at halftime Woolly has it knocked right back in his face by Ditter trying to take the baseline That shot is blocked cleanly on the run Thomas and a save there by McNeely They got a twoon one for Conwell Well hell lay it off the window That wont go Out it goes The crowd howling for a foul but no whistle on that 1147 to go Dvin Hall down So 5641 just under 12 minutes 69 Virginia forced six shot clock violations against Stanford Of course that in Charlottesville is gold The shot clock violation Theres no place in college basketball that appreciates that more than fans at JPJ Always true under Tony Bennett with some great teams Kick out from McNeely Well he got everything he wanted Couldnt hit it After surrendering a number of offensive rebounds in the first half Virginias really tightened up on their defensive glass On the baseline Thomas gives it up Derritters midrange shot is around He just cant get going Woolly Prior will give it up for Conwell who loves the threepoint shot Both teams do Khalifa in the lane The onehander for two Nice touch by Khalifa but more importantly relocating to give Conwell an outlet once he got stuck along the baseline Eight points for Ali Khalifa cheering Don Hall gives up the dribble Mh Thomas has been scorching hot in the second half Derritter again Shot clock a factor sitting at five 69 big will give it up Conwell races out Conwell missed an opportunity He had McNeely running open from three and it ends up being another block shot So yes their bigs are so tough around the iron on the run Here comes Woolly Woolly to drive it Kind of a wild shot Khalifa draws the foul and hell be headed to the line 1006 to go But Louisville with a very disjointed offense Thomass third foul But give the Cards credit Theyve continued to fight on the defensive end of the floor Nice play by Conwell taking the basketball away from Derritter Even though theyre unable to finish they get an opportunity to get out in transition get to the free throw line and if able to make them set up some pressure to see if they can make Virginia uncomfortable Now Louisville with wins over top 25 Kentucky and Indiana but losses to Arkansas Tennessee and Duke among ranked opponents But if you just count that and you throw the Arkansas game you mention Arkansas thats five ranked opponents they play This is Virginias first ranked opponent on the season And so you talk about the difference in the scheduling which was one of the reasons why many people question how good Virginia really is I believe this performance has shown all the naysayers that they are right on par with their rank The crowd wanted to travel They may have been right on Groomlow Hadley another loose ball Sloppy play here really both sides the last couple of minutes But a great job defensively by Chance Mallerie just stripping the basketball away Grumo getting on the floor unable to get it to Mallerie But that is still a stop for Virginia The Cards will get the shot clock reset to 20 because its a new possession but in the front court Sander Fu back on for the Cardinals 611 junior They also have Kase Prior in getting some minutes at 610 and Deon Tillis to check in for Ryan ODM and Virginia And for Derritter who will get another rest Hes coming off a very strong game over the weekend 22 points just one turnover in 31 minutes Been a different story tonight here at the although his team has played particularly well Prior on the dribble pass back batted away and then he chases that into the crowd Itll go over to Virginia So nothing very fluid here for the Cardinals on the offensive side Its been a struggle offensively You got to give Virginia a lot of credit for what theyve done defensively And again only seven turnovers for Louisville Its just Virginias gotten stops Theyve been able to stand up on the defensive end in the half court Yeah A lot of deflections The swing here for Mallerie Coming up on nine minutes to go here at Louisville Thats going to be tipped out by the Cardinals 5644 Virginia And Lewis will put it in from the side Thomas with a carry I tell you who called that Obie Pat Kelsey Pat Kelsey sprinted about 20 ft to make sure he got in the vision of Matt Potter to make the carry symbol on that one I have never seen a more animated practice than the one that Pat Kelsey runs in Louisville I Im telling you it I have this the one place I show up I think on time Big deal Lee Yes I mean he wears a microphone in practice He runs and works on defense more than any of his kids do And and OB he made it clear to us today that it was going to be a short and sweet day So that was like what you were able to see this morning from Pat Kelsey Its normally much more intense but this coach is the perfect fit for this university His energy is absolutely infectious and every one of his coaches his players his staff are bought in to what the goal is each and every time they step on the floor He said light and they went about two and a half laughter 840 to go Conwell with a foul incidentally to put Mallerie at the line where he makes 82 Yeah PK also gave us a lesson in eyewear today And and again hes he is famous for wearing the dark frame glasses but he doesnt wear them in games because he says that he cant because he hasnt hung a banner here because he is following legendary coaches Denny Crumb Rick Patino He cant have a thing yet You know he he wont allow himself to have a thing He feels like the glass will be a thing for him and he hasnt earned it to this point Hes right about that Hadley wriggling inside draws the foul too Now the Cardinals need a shot of life and it might come from the sixyear man from St Paul and he has really been the voice the leader of this group You consider he was on the team a season ago and a factor that went 182 in conference play and made it to the ACC champion tournament championship game Javon Hadley has tremendous experience He got tremendous experience at Colorado before coming here playing alongside lottery picks like Cody Williams pros and so now he brings that experience here with a lot of younger players and is truly the leader of this bunch playing for his third school cant get the threepoint play 5849 The Cardinals making a little more noise again trying to get back into this thing But Virginia has been slamming the door time and time again All directing traffic Kunlow 10 to shoot Hall with the kick Mallerie Shot clock to three Hall heaves it gets it Hall who went down at the last time out holding on to that right wrist Wrist looks pretty good Knocking down the three Sure did Under eight to play Holy over the shoulder Conwell barely got to the iron Going to tie up here Possession will keep it on this end So Louisville have the ball We come back 743 music to go going to make the West Coast trip will play at screaming Hadley with a big bucket on the interior when his team needed it most Opportunity to complete the threepoint play and get this game back into single digits Exactly what PK needed out of the timeout to give his team some energy going to the post up against a larger Derritter but still the ability to score over the top Threepoint play number three under Ritter North Carolina has never played at Stanford or Cal They had never played at SMU and now this will be the second and third place theyve never played It didnt go well for the Tar Hills at SMU by the way cheering and a timeout with seven and a half to go and the pressure from the Cards forcing the timeout some of the history of the game and I know of course there are issues that have come into play but when it comes to Xs and Os development recruiting everything that goes into the job Rick Patino is one of the best to ever do it Jakari White with it here back up top for Hall has nine rebounds by the way a careerhigh on the drive and kick Ditter can he get going hes still chilly another tie up for the rebound possession arrow will keep it right here Virginia continues to flex his muscle on the offensive glass even though theyre unable to get the bucket to go Don Hall with a nice wraparound baseline drive baseline drift The Ritter unable to get it to go but Grumbbo once again on the offensive glass maintains possession for Virginia Crew will tip that out of play Itll be Virginia to retain That puts this inbounder in a tough spot in that corner Misfortune in front of his bench but a coffin corner Thomas cheering Sam Lewis will give it away back for Thomas Hes going to heave it up there and drain it Nobody bothered to pick him up The miscommunication OB F was pointing to McNeely He wanted to take the cutter Wanted McNeely to go out However it gave Thomas way too much time to knock down his sixth three of the evening 19 and rejected by Grunlow Another block shot by Virginia as they lead at 6452 Obie look at the miscommunication Fruit is pointing to McNeely to take Thomas but its too late to communicate that That has to be yelled out before the screen even gets there Malik Thomas recognizes it knocks down a huge three Getting 19 for him Woolly trying to answer Cant Nice rebound by Ditter He just out battled everybody And again every time it looks like Louisvilles going to make a run in the second half certainly its been Malik Thomas to answer and tell them no And thats the thing about this Virginia team Its someone different each and every night But Tom Thomas now feeling good Little bit of a heat check on that one Unable to get it to go McNeely 16point game for him against his old school Conwell making a move there Draws a foul Under six to play Derritters fourth personal Foul and a ninth team foul 559 left Cards Itll be Ali Khalifa back on for the Louisville Cardinals Phillis and for Virginia Hes in for and Ditter playing with four fouls will now hit the bench The one and one So its Brian Conwell to the line 84 playing for his fourth school in four years Too strong Rebound comes on the baseline to Hadley crosscourt Dangerous pass but Woolly got to it and hes on the line The most common turnover in the game catching it in that corner that retreat step which takes your foot out of bounds Work on it all summer long Side step in comparison to retreat step But you see on the catch that right foot goes backwards steps out of bounds You see the turnover at least once in each and every game Tipped out of play by Louisville 6452 Virginia Virginia Cavaliers trying to pick up their 15th win against two losses trying to go to 4 one in the conference And a much improved conference a conference with eight teams in the top 35 of the net all try to go downstairs and a shove in the paint and a foul against the Cardinals Khalifas third Thats his third team And still to come on Super Tuesday number two Iowa State against unranked Kansas Thats tonight at 9 on ESPN And a great guard matchup Tamman cheering Tamman Lipy going up against one of the best defenders in college basketball when you start talking about Tam Lipy but then going up against one of the best offensive players in college basketball and Darren Peterson great matchup and regardless as to the number beside Kansas name whatever you playing at Allen Fieldhouse thats going to be a batter sure is 32 points for him Peterson last time out and a great performance as we approach the fiveinut Minute mark on the spin Woolly Thomas reaching in Virginias number one So Malik Thomas with his fourth Fouls starting to pile up for Virginia here down the stretch But thats the kicker for Virginia They have so much depth Malik Thomas as great as hes played throughout this evening He picks up the foul and immediately Sam Lewis who was the offense for Virginia in the first half of this game was in double figures Hes the guy that comes in will come in for Thomas Willy 82 at the at the foul line here Itll be Thomas taking a seat and Lewis back on now for Ryan Odum ODM has a full roster of players that he can trust When you consider he has a tremendous amount of trust in the first year Chance Mallerie and outside of that everyone else playing are veterans So he has a number of guys that he can trust in any different situation and theyve all had points to where they show up and make plays for their team in big stretches Lewis gives it up back for Hall cheering Paul had a coach from behind Stolen away by Hley Conwell needs some help McNeels open FROM THREEPOINT LAND AND NOTHING BUT NET And they got a foul away from the ball if they get how if they get hauled for that Hadley will have a free throw that can make this a fourpoint possession Theyre going to go with a double foul on both Hadley and Hall away from the basketball You see it over on the left side but the three from McNeely is good So thatll make it a eightpoint game And the foul So Hadley at the line 64 has another one coming So its really all to do about nothing because Virginia was going to get the basketball anyway because Louisville scored So Hadley gets two free throws now Makes it a fivepoint possession and the lead is down to six But the pressure now is on Hall to make the free throws cheering to push the lead back up as Virginia will get the basketball back And of the two he is a better foul shooter 83 And of course theyll get the ball back as well after this foul shot So they can have this this could be a five possession point I mean fivepoint possession for Virginia just as it was for Louisville on the other end Paul second makes the pair cheering and the basketball leading 6759 cheering So Mallalerie of Virginia to put it in play Virginia has led all night cheering Bruno Hands off for Mallerie Mallerie trying to penetrate Gives it to the sevenfooter for two Nice play by chance Mallerie attacking the paint but having the wherewithal to know where his teammate was to bail him out Conwell denied McNeely penetrates scoops it in Thats the progression of IMAs game His ability to drive the ball to the rim More importantly looking to score not looking to pass He has 21 a season high against his former team applause and cheering So back to eight applause and cheering Four minutes to play in Louisville cheering applause Lewis Lewis on the spin and gets the big bucket We talked about Malik Thomas picking up that fourth foul having to go sit down You bring in Sam Lewis Ryan ODM has a plethora of players he can trust in big spots Javon Hadley Tillis on him out of a double Hell swing for Conwell Yes a threepointer Nice one more from Woolly to find Conwell in the corner Sevenpoint game but at this point 320 remaining The Cards have to find a way to get some stops And a timeout Virginia Conwell looking as though hes either exhausted or cramping but PK not going to give it So 7164 Virginia with the ball cheering all drives and dishes here for Grunlow Hell kick it back out Lewis cant hit a long distance shot Conwell with the rebound pushing the tempo Hes denied on the baseline and a nice save right there on the line by Don Hall But how about Virginia getting back defensively in transition stopping another attempt from Conwell which should have been an easy two points 240 to go And its really been the Cavaliier defense has been the star tonight Derritters back on out of the double GRUN LOW BURIES A THREE Grunlo finishing the game the way he started it Knocking down his third triple of the evening and pushing the game back to double figures PK wants to talk it over as the Wahoos celebrate in a bigtime ACC clash in January Cardinals with the basketball and in for Conwell Woolly the sophomore coming off 21 Well bounce it here Hadley Shot clock to nine Hadley will turn Shot clock to five Woolly will drive getting it downstairs for the slam by Fruit But just great presence of mind by Woolly to attack even with the shot clock going down Knew he had more than enough time to make a play at the rim Lot of time came off on that possession However 7466 All again Mer will swing it Lewis can be a very dangerous threepoint man Shot clock to five Valerie gives it up Heres Lewiss shot off the back of the iron Tipped out high McNeely beat them to the basketball and hell heave it up there as he gets hit around the threepoint line That move That move Isaac McNeely knows that Chance Mallerie is going to continue his pursuit defensively The pump fake gets Mallerie to fly past him You dont want to give McNeely a good look And then as he steps across thats going to be two free throws however as hes got his foot across the line So 119 to go Theyre saying hes going to shoot three Yeah they theyve got that They absolutely have that one And Ryan ODM and his staff all up talking to the officials This has to be a two free throws This cant be three You see McNeely with the pump fake and then watch that right foot as its down well across the line and the officials have come back corrected it They want to get the teams back out on the floor not giving them a timeout making it two shots The crowd doesnt like it but they didnt get a look at that very obvious replay we showed you with a minute 19 to go Itll be McNeely to shoot two where he makes 89 Hobie how about this We talked about the compliment of of talent that Ryan ODM has on his roster A minute 19 remaining You bring back your two leading scorers who have been watching for about the last 3 to four minutes of game action both with four fouls in Derritter and Malik Thomas because he trusts Sam Lewis He trusts Chance Mali who stays on the floor Tillis all these different guys to be able to finish the game Thomas has had a terrific game Ditter not so much but looking for that leadership down the stretch here 7468 applause Some pressure here McNeely will knock it out of play And and right now theyre looking McNeely looking over to Pat Kelsey about seeing if this should be challenged Fortunately players cant call the challenge It has to be the coach Yeah Prior was laughter the guy calling for it and PK was saying no So Conwell will put it in with 20 to get off a shot and 116 to play Virginia leading 7468 Louisville trailing the entire ball game Conwell McNeely fires it up there Rebounds going to be saved along the baseline by Rogers Conwell wants one around and outs with a triple Two great looks for the Cards from the guys you want shooting the basketball in this moment McNeely got a great look Conwell got a great look And a foul here on the Cardinals on Fu Itll be his fourth So well march to the other end with exactly a minute to go You couldnt be more right These are the guys they want shooting And we watch the Cards go over this and shoot around today McNeely gets a good look at it Offensive rebound And then Ryan Conwell the ACCs leader in threepoint makes has it go around and out through over the back of Grumbbo Picks up the foul Bruno cheering only 45 at the line but gets the first one to go And the important free throw is that makes it a threepossession game Now a sevenpoint lead for Virginia with a minute remaining Tonight hes been good at the lane and makes the pair That bounce was exactly like the first three he made that went off the back of the rim touched the top of the backboard coming back down and is good Contact no whistle The tip is up and good by Pu 50 seconds to go Sixpoint game Paul the point guard They get it across for Thomas Back for Mallerie Lewis wouldnt shoot it 38 seconds to go and a foul And I like the way I like the way Louisville played that They try to get the turnover unable to h make it happen But they dont foul Hall They dont foul Chance Mallerie their best free throw shooters They foul Lewis who has been in this spot in this game Again you cant spot a team this good 14 points Regardless as to where you are good foul as Lewis misses the first free throw but you cant spot a team as good as Virginia 14 points to start the game out on your home floor Lewis with another one makes one of two So back to a sevenpoint screaming lead Ryan Conwell banging bodies with Hall out for Khalifa Cant hit that So theyve missed some big threepoint attempts here down the stretch And another whistle with 23 seconds to go And the Louisville Cardinal fans heading for the exits and heading for the parking lot When Louisville will go to three and four without Mikel Brown and now two losses here on their home floor to two of the best teams in the ACC You consider a home loss here last week to Duke and now Virginia most likely walks away with a win here And but when you consider playing without Mikel Brown thats taking a lot out of your lineup and a completely different team when from what I saw with Brown in the lineup in mid December The numbers bear that out and the biggest one that you mentioned theyre about to go to three and four without him and they were an outstanding team with him trying to find their identity particularly at the guard position Get somebody to really command the basketball Heres Woolly That shot is blocked Bruno Lllo again got a hand on it Thats been a big factor too Virginia with that shot blocking ability Theyve had a bunch of them in the game They have nine 108 seconds left Ninepoint game Woolly off the fake and Khalifa again with a misfire Final seconds here and thatll do it 7970 the final A big road win for Virginia as Ryan ODMs team knocks off a top 25 under him for the first time Certainly hope you enjoyed it tonight here in Louisville Kentucky for my partner Cory Alexander and
