clockery Georgia Tech in the home whites and Notre Dame in the visiting Blues in the Irish control the opening tip not Dame winners of three straight they have done it all without their best player Marcus Burton who remains out the reigning ACC freshman of the year and turned away at The Rim is Tay Davis Big Time defensive possession to start it out how about Mr Matumbo son of the Hall of Famer Ryan Matumbo starting at Center for Georgia Tech we take a look at starting lineups for the yellow jackets Matumbo making his fourth straight start mustaf the Freshman has really come on of late and Nate George leading the ACC in assists terrific playmaker a big point guard plays with terrific Pace exhibit a George misses the leaner its knocked out of bounds by Applause Matumbo playing in that middle area youre coming off a ball screen Notre Dames forcing you sideline youre going to have to use the glass and make one of those happen starting lineups for Notre Dame Tate Davis coming off backto back 20point games and then Matt Alo the Princeton transf for his last two games 11 assists no turnovers Brayden shrewbury coachs son Falling Away tipped into the air the rebound to Applause Terry Terry missed all of last season had a calf injury and then made the conscious choice to red shirt preserve the extra ear of Eligibility Catch and Release its good very simple release does Lance Terry have goes up the wrong side of his body but the follow through is true and he doesnt take much time to get that shot off an excellent player playing beside Nathan George hes one of the reason for all those assists leaner by Shrewsberry not there Davis a three well off the mark and Matumbo snags the Applause caram this is the Georgia Tech Team early lost to North Florida theyve been close a couple of times pushed UNCC to the brink held their own against Oklahoma but fell short in both of those Applause games tumbo setting the screen gets it back from George and the soft touch at The Rim hey really like that short roll how are you able bble to operate when that extra Defender comes over nice move by Matumbo one quick dribble and finish over the top not something hes had in his bag his entire college career Davis to Alo who draws the foul I love this Ryan Matumbo hasnt always been an offensive threat you see him here short roll strong with the basketball one dribble and up this is something they worked on about an hour and a half before tip and youre seeing his gradual Improvement went to high school here in Atlanta at the love it school now really coming into his own dad in Atlanta Hawks stand out when he played in town passed away in September at the age of 58 Damon statamire in his second season what does it mean when you have a head coach with his resume on the sideline well I think you your ears perk up right away in the fact that you have a guy like Nathan George who comes over leading the league and assists what better person to learn from at the point guard spot then Damon STM Mighty mous himself George was thrown into the fire as a freshman last year and had a number of big moments for Georgia Tech lot of dribbling by Terry George is open thats one area hes still working on that outside shot thats exactly right and if hes able to open up that part of his game its going to space the floor even more and allow him to do what hes comfortable at getting in the paint and finding teammates Notre Dame nine days before this game they practiced had a chance to really reset and adjust the life without Marcus bur yeah absolutely and this guy right here with the ball Matt alako kind of that piece that makes everything work theyve moved the ball really well but this is where Georgia Tech go George in transition flip it reverse it and an early timeout by Micah Shrewsberry whose team is 0 for five from the field how about Nate George take off in transition different part of his game athletic up and down Georgia Tech off to a 71 lead playing Music well or of course right now hes already started to do that and looked comfortable doing and if youre Georgia Tech make sure you cut off Notre Dames driving angles not one guy on the floor for the Irish spectacular in oneonone situations they play by moving the ball and finding ways to attack off the catch make sure youre disciplined throughout the course of The Possession Davis picked up by Dongo Alo the corner three first field goal for the Irish the utility guy Alo Princeton transfer so you know hes smart right out of the gate able to knock down shot will throw that one in there and I think that ones very flattering but just a jack of all trade Shrewsberry raved about his ability in the locker room but now added responsibility with Burton out hes had to be that guy they rely on nice pass mustaf Falling Away left it short Dango grabs the offensive rebound and somehow puts it in Falling Away little bit of contact doesnt matter Bay and Dongo such such an a Mah Shrewsberry the head coach for Notre Dame telling us without Burton more of the offense goes through Tay Davis and Shrewsberry but its vital for a third guy to step up and when Burton comes back that third guy is going to be the fourth guy and hes going to be just as important to the success of this team yeah and all these guys are developing that kind of confidence but Ill say this right now Anish Georgia Tech is guarding big time playing the defensive end we were at shoot around this morning big point of emphasis for Damon stalam to cut off those angles as you talked about tech with a fivepoint lead Music early his third straight with a foot injury its been tough sledding and then youve got J and McCollum whos already missed four games rolled his ankle on Saturday we expect to see him though in action today he did practice and he was playing really well against Alabama AM when it happened so a little discouraging there but its so difficult whenever youre able whenever youre not able to get any continuity playing but McCullum now in the game hes parked in the near Corner two in Applause white Dongo backs down Davis lost it small part of indongo development whenever he catches the ball in the mid post hes not putting the ball on the deck right away youll see him observe where the help side is at and hes made that skip pass already once uh thats just a small part that you have to learn going into your sophomore conference play that you have to know those Applause things punched into the back court and that is going to be over and back as JR kesn retrieved Notre Dames big injury is their best player Marcus Burt ACC Rookie of the Year first in Notre Dame history a season ago led the team in points and assists a year ago and with all that Notre Dame had coming back there was a lot of excitement for what this team could do in the ACC of this year and it started with Marcus Burton absolutely but at the same time something like that happens nice pass pick and roll management aums three knot there the rebound by Nikita constantini hes on his fourth school was at Monmouth last year Alo for kesn driving on George this is when you miss Burton too you need somebody to be able to create with the ball in his hands create something when theres nothing 8 seconds to go in the clock Alo can do it but Burtons a lead at it nice pass kesn not there and the rebound by Ibrahim Suarez play a careerhigh 19 minutes Saturday played well against Alabama AM carals the tough pass and then Way Off the Mark odre Dame will push that was terrific defense by Davis plays right in the middle dangerous off that shot fake now its Davis off the window plus one such an impressive athlete is Tay Davis talked about him a little bit with coach rurry before the game hes always had this Talent the ability to put on the deck look at the strong playing off two feet under control Tay Davis able to finish fire the boys up a little bit Sean Hall transfer in his second season with Notre Dame and he has been playing at an all conference level since Marcus Burton went down absolutely and he had all those tools coming into college now its about refining a lot of these skills and Shrewsbury was very complimentary of Shaheen Holloway at seeden Hall talking about he he needed a little bit more of an edge and now he has that throw in the fact you have all these skills and now hes really starting to figure out his game averaging more than 15 points a game on the season up from nine a game last year and like as Shrewsberry telling us before the game he tried to recruit Davis twice out of high school when Shrewsbury was at Purdue then when he went to the transfer portal shrewbury was at Penn State finally was able to get him when he was at Notre Applause Dame say this if Im Damon STM I love my offensive possessions the balls changing sides of the floor youre finding open looks eventually you got to knock some of those shots down Logan Imes in there for Notre Dame constantini nice little touch put that on his Tik Tock the big Ukrainian hes Tik Tok famous thats what you told me before the game thats what he told me no Im just kidding no obviously hes been at so many different places you wonder what youre getting but hes a big strong fiveman thats a bit of a curveball compared to the rest of the league rest of the league filled with jumping jacks konstantinovski is not that and you see it with his inability to contest shots but hes somebody thats going to be a little bit more for bound bit of a Bruiser especially when down screens you look at him there nice screen and good shot kesn answers the George layup and Notre Dame with its first lead Irish have hit three straights in starting one of eight McCollum Oklahomas leading scorer last year the midrange Jay analytics says thats a bad shot do you agree with the midrange Jimmy Im a little bit in the middle because youve got to have guys that can knock them down obviously but I think Im willing to play play with some twos with this JB McCullum Davis got his man in the air michah shrewbury wanted a foul no call Dongo pushing mustaf the LA Dango the Finish Georgia Tech has been at their best today when theyre in transition and Dongo you understand he can play Above the Rim terrific pass lot of contact didnt matter Hees looking for help through the trees it comes to George they want to push again Notre Dame able to get back Georgia Tech front Court defensively has been a problem so far for the Irish so athletic even when going to the Music bench this one coming our way Micah Shrewsberry stepped in front of it you had that though certainly do but both teams starting to go back and forth find some offensive Rhythm kesn off the down screen forget about it 67 I can knock him down and then going down in transition great defense by the front Court you push it you throw it up Dongo knows what to do Georgia Tech of and running playing well Music Applause Notre Dame and Georgia Tech met three times last year with the Irish sweeping all three in the last win for Notre Dame came in the ACC tournament where they ended Georgia Tech season but all three games were close one went to overtime the other two decided by three and four respectively yeah two programs two first year head coaches last year I mean heres the deal you look at both squads in their current form theyre both building incrementally so you look at what Georgia Tech has Nate George uh be Dango those guys now sophomores you look at Notre Dame Bron Shrewsbury Marcus Burton theyre being allowed to develop the way that coaches would like to do it the problem is sure that model is harder and harder to sustain in college basketball right now oh theres no question but you that also says you better be good to your guys and you better keep your promises Imes the drive the dish chuar right back to IMS guarded by McCollum Applause wow the defensive pressure for the yellow jackets have been impressive shot clock winding down Imes has to force it no good tried to go over Duncan Powell it is going the other way youre a big fan of 31 in white Duncan Powell for a number of reasons including uh follicular reasons what Im talking about what do you call that what what is that called it slips my mind the its the Shag and its a Dallas thing and hes given people like me hope that there is a future however I dont think my wife would be all that happy if I pulled off a shag with the bottom Im Im considering it though but hes one of my favorite players to watch you want to talk about an endless motor started at ncn Sacramento State last year plays just ridiculously hard McCollum takes it away here he is Duncan Powell and two shots coming that means another chance at a closeup of the Shag how do you not love that give that man every piece of camera time we can give him and well give him a little more look at the activity though defensively Georgia teack this is where theyve been at their best so far today out in transition and give the Shag his time to shine look at that Masterpiece now if you wanted to could you I mean I I have enough in the back there its on the top that Im worried about no really nice player tough as Nails does all the little things screens hard rebounds harder uh he pops off the tape whenever you watch him play hes in the mix on every possession and he plays exceedingly physical he was the leading scorer and a rebounder for Sacramento State last year a little more than 6 and a half per game off the bench for Georgia Tech Applause IMS the sophomore shot clock at three Ropers got to put it up back to IMS beats the shot clock and the rebound snagged by Matumbo Here Comes Powell acrobatic finish the defensive discipline for Georgia Tech a full 30 seconds and they get off in transition theyre able to finish again Notre Dames got to make Georgia Tech play in the half court because Georgia Tech getting whatever they want I thought you were going to say its got to be the hair its got to be constantini underneath lays it in plays on the ground lot of shot fakes relies on those broad shoulders creates space nice finish big 610 Ukrainian mum the fade and a pretty finish the man is a tough shot maker been that ever since he was at Sienna transfers to Oklahoma was terrific there under Porter Moser things havent changed all that much under DAV STM 13 a game to lead the Sooners last year Shrewsberry has been quiet found constantini missed the bunny comes back to Shrewsberry Terry poked it away pow the loose ball ahead to Terry the rambling wreck out and running come on Georgia Tech just wants it more at this point Anish Big Time hustle Lance Terry and hes rewarded with the slam love when that happens Duncan Powell has come into the game and its been a shot of Red Bull for this Georgia Tech Applause offense shrewbury from the Baseline raised the rim offensive rebound by rer thats a shot clock violation but that ball hit the rim and Micah Shrewsberry is pleading that case and it looks like theyre going to solve that that ball grazed the rim clearly the shot clock never reset it michah shrewbury pleads his case hes going to be upset after watching a film of this one you got to get on the floor Lance Terry sure did and watch this one quick right hand slam got Georgia Tech up nine Ill take two looks at it why not Music Music me Music Music over Applause Music n Roa myself back here in Atlanta and Micah Shrewsberry beside himself as his son Bron Shrewsberry is able to get to the Baseline take a peek at the shot clock in your bottom right hand corner Fade Away ball hits the rim it did hit the rim needs to reset to 15 shrewbury beside himself because he has an advantage situation the clock doesnt the clock goes off everything stop reset to 15 seconds and then youre taking away a twopoint bucket during the break or the opportunity for a twopoint bucket sorry and during the break the officials did get the call correct so it is Notre Dame ball they added 15 seconds on the shot Music clock remember it resets to 20 after a miss so they have adjusted to 15 and alako will inbound kesn catch and shoot and it comes to mustaf open look from mcau yes Im not even sure I would consider that open semi contested doesnt matter McCullum that ankle looks fine to me hes got seven it is a 152 George Tech run and theyve made seven straight baskets Roper constantini puts it up overp Music power and Matumbo limps off the court boy Georgia Tech just cannot afford any more injuries and now its the 72 Matumbo needing help to get to the sideline I didnt see anything did you see anything sometimes those are the scariest ones not contact as we told you the showing up the late Hall of Famer to kbe Matumbo winner of three Defensive Player of the Year Awards Dango in the painted area down goes Dongo doesnt matter ball goes in and he he does that with consistency Fades away on a hook shot falls on the ground hes been pretty consistent with it but the speed and how Georgia Tech oper ating has been noticeable their aggression has been awesome Davis ripped the rebound away from Dongo second chance here for Notre Dame Davis just one for four Shrewsberry has been quiet to Alo kesn from the corner that doesnt go georia Techs Collective defensive discipline has been off the charts Applause Dango and George leads to a turnover kesn the other way looking to push and rolls out offensive rebound rer rer off the alako feed a rebound to George and every time Georgia Tech with its eyes up looking for ear offense thats exactly right you dont have to execute in a half quarter if youre not playing against five players and thats whats happened so far Notre Dame struggling to get anything offensively and theyre going to have to start making shots because thats when they can set their defense George to Powell front rim Davis the board Irish just two of 10 from Beyond The Arc Davis back iron on the three make it two of 11 Shrewsberry and Davis are combined one of eight and with Burton out they need those two to play well absolutely right you know who is playing well jav and McCullum not able to make that one happen but nothing has been easy every cut has been met with physicality theyre fighting through ball screens and theyre communicating really well Alo through the Applause contact good defense here constantini picks up his bounce shot clock is down to five alako over Dango George Taps it away and comes up with the loose ball George the ACC leader and assists oh finds Dongo who crashes to the floor but hell get rewarded with two free throws hopefully d goes okay might need to check the wood on the Applause floor but playing with such Pace right I finds position this is much to do about nothing unless there is contact to the head or neck thats the only way nothing intentional here but could qualify flagrant one and it will be so a flagrant one on the 61 Nikita constantini after further review the common foul has been upgraded to a flavor one foul on Blue 25 not D will get two shots in possession of the ball and I think its important that people realize intent isnt a part of the flagrant one or flagrant 2 process so or or excuse me flagrant one process obviously flagrant 2 intent is a big portion of it but with a flagrant one foul contact to the head or neck and 10 is not part of the problem he didnt mean to do that hes 6 10 he has long limbs hes a heavy Music 61 so Dongo 60 free throw shooter at the line he added some weight in the off season about 2530 lbs really for Damon statamire year one he and Nate George their emergence through the course of the season gave hope to what things can be now again you got to recruit your own players and you have to keep them its a different age of college basketball where just because you have two freshman doesnt guarantee you anything but those were two foundational blocks and again you go back to you know some of Josh pastners best teams for example when they had Alvarado and dvo and uh guys like Moses Wright early in their career those guys all stayed and ended up being a part part of an ACC Championship team going back even further Ben Lamers guys that hung around for an extended period of time thats when Georgia Tech has been at their best recently now obviously different coaching staff different way of doing things but I mean being able to have your point guard and your best player thats a five or four certainly helps it was a young team last year that beat Duke Carolina and Clemson all three teams got to the Sweet 16 or Beyond they showed flashes it was against everybody else that they struggled but but heres the thing thats a part of the growth of some of these young players you got to get up for those other games too they certainly have the talent something to watch here just now Dongo picked up his second foul George green lights it no good offensive rebound Dongo through a double team yes come on feels a double team coming from the top side ball fate spin Baseline forget about it n 144 Run for the rambling wreck Notre Dames missed its last six shots and nine of its last 10 and the ji hands off to Alo kzne finally hits somebody take the lid off JR kesn from South Bend needs to help this team from South Bend find some offense hes a red shirt Jr at 15 in the win against Syracuse earlier this month Dongo can knock it down from there instead hands off to George from the elbow Nate Georges ability to navigate a pick and roll and find options quickly has really stood out not just today but over the past two seasons I mean a bigger guard 63 and 1 12ish Id give him a couple more inches because of the hair but I mean really Talent sounded jealous when you said that I am extremely jealous as he backing down the sophomore George the acity shot clock down to three they got to put it up they do and the shot is good by Sir Muhammad who had knee surgery and had been out since November so his first action about a month and a half Charlotte ARA Native Son of Nazi Muhammad longtime NBA player played at Myers Park High School one of the better public schools in the Charlotte area nice pass thats part of town too come on that was a pass Anish thats an assist give it to him Sor Suare will get the two its 3422 Georgia Tech when it rains it pours and the yellow jackets playing well at home thats for sure Dereck Whittingham on line one says it was a pass Music Applause Ki turns it over AUM the other way hits the gas Fades Suare had position and draws the foul on a loo George attack has pushed the pace theyve controlled the tempo theyre shooting almost 60 from the field in the opening half trying to make it popular because that might be the only haircut I can pull off but I Ill say this about you save a lot of money though trust me thats true good point that but you talk about the front Court toughness on his part toughness Ryan Matumbo coming in blocking shots Suare coming in playing some good minutes Notre Dame is going to have to have somebody pull a Luke Hancock and knock down some threes because youre setting guys up youre finding some of these looks havent been able to knock them down and as a result some of these rebounds have ended up being longer and Georgia Techs been able to find some easy looks in transition oh wowo fell down and then commits his second foul three shots for Javen McCullum Shrewsberry beside himself I he thought it was a moving screen and Im not going to argue all that much alako trying to battle through not a very smart play look moving screen right there and then you just have to get off to the side you cannot foul a threepoint shooter especially one as good as Javen McCullum last year at Oklahoma a 94 free throw shooter 90 for his career is that good its not bad how impressive has he been in the early G I mean through the the course of this first half step back shots attacking the rim knocking down threes played well against Alabama AM last game before spraining his ankle doesnt seem to be bothering him that much right now that game got him unlocked a little bit he got off to a great start this year was averaging close to 15 a game suffered a concussion first three games back from the concussion after missing four only scored 14 total points and then went for 18 over the weekend and hes had a nice little first half here for Georgia Tech double figures in scoring from m Applause Shrewsberry from the Baseline rainbow shot no pot of gold at the end Powell has the rebound tied up jump off there were three Irish players around that basketball and Duncan Pals the one who comes up with it tough shot BR Shrewsberry on the Baseline nice defense there were three players right there youve got to get that basketball youre on the road to open up conference play or let not open up but third game in conference play you have to get that rebound if youre going to compete and come back from down 15 yeah the problem for Notre Dame Their Stars Shrewsberry and Tay Davis have one field goal combined and three points total in the first half and without Marcus Burton those two have to show up mum almost travel finds an open George Who splashes it through how is this Notre Dame team six and seven or no excuse me Georgia Tech Team six and seven the way theyre playing right now their intent their purpose on offense their physicality defensively impressive showing for the yellow jackets up by 18 Davis trying to get going off the bounce offensive rebound and theres a putback hes got five shuberry who had been averaging 18 a game in the six games Burton was out geg and the opening half and forcing him to play uncomfortably heavy press out to half court and then whenever hes able to beat the first man Georgia Techs doing such a nice job of switching aggressive first half on all accounts oh wow pass Powell and assist by George whos the ACC Applause leader Alo lets it Fly J the rebound time expires and on New Years Eve oh Georgia Tech George the sophomore nine points four rebounds four assists only one turn over Georgia Tech get a lot of easy looks in transition Shrewsberry still looking for his first points was scoreless in the opening 20 Irish only shot 28 shuberry still without a basket but a foul on the floor that is three on by Dango and thats big because he has been a menace in the front Court hes complaining he thinks that Davis got up Underneath Him and hooked his arm but I like the aggressiveness Shrewsberry coming out trying to find one coming off a down screen at the same time you got to make sure its a good look heres another one Dongo remains in the game remember Ryan Matumbo left in the first half nipped off the floor Shrewsberry finally enters the chat with a three I love it little Baseline out of bounds he comes off a stagger screen to the corner cant leave the ball George thought his guy was back not enough communication ends up with a wide open Terry the floater hes got seven just so composed when looking to score doesnt overexert himself doesnt force the issue just a Bonafide score and theyre going to get George with a reach in his first foul on a Music lock see Lance bar coming off a ball screen or not even a ball screen just good Pace Matumbo holds his guy off tough little finish and how about this Notre Dame theyre awake took them a half but theyre here Dongo with a chance for a threepoint Music play Im sorry Dongo picks up the foul Tay Davis to the free throw line thats four now on by Dongo thats a big loss you got Matumbo out there who again remember like he either cramped up did something but hes back out on the floor now Dongo whos been an impact player tonight on the bench all of a sudden Notre Dame within 15 and the Pendulum starting to swing hey you see two possessions three foul calls a three and an and one quick sixpoint swing Notre Dame not left for dead playing really well here ear in the second half Terrys three offensive rebound Mumbo up with Davis we have a jump ball and possession arrow to Georgia Tech hey Ryan Matumbo number 12 George te had a hard time finding his way at Georgetown comes down here hes found a roll for the yellow jackets made his impact today with his size ability to block shots and on the offensive glass was a tough go for him early to playing the first nine games dealing with the loss of his dad owl cans in the three Duncan the Shag pow bad man left corner he loves that spot and Nate George knows exactly where hes going to be anytime he comes off a ball screen hes shag mat Loos nickname is mush got a Music sh his dad started calling him mush when he was little he liked to talk hes going a mile a minute and mush from Fat Albert not the one from a bron tail mum leans into one boy hes got a smooth game when hes on he sure does hes so composed when hes on too and just creates just enough space theyre going to get a foul against Duncan Powell his first McCullum complaining about an ankle Duncan pow fouled in order to make sure that they can play five on five defense f for him he needs to be careful cant let fouls become a part of this game thats only his first remember McCollum rolled his ankle Saturday against Alabama AM left that game did not come back he didnt practice yesterday took part in shoot around and guys looked pretty good Applause today Alo kicks it back out kesn shot clock at five Shrewsberry got there offensive rebound Davis fouled by Matumbo I like it if youre not hitting shots you better crash the offensive class Tay Davis so far here in this second half extremely active so impressed with his development over the course of his career averag just under three points a game at Sean Hall comes to Notre Dame nine a little over nine points a game last year and you see the tools how hes continuously been able to develop his game throughout the course during colum last season in his first with the Irish Davis averaged nine a game 16 a game this year we remind you Virginia Tech and Duke coming up next here on accn we get to see Cooper flag and the number four team of the country at Cameron endure we wish you all an early happy New Year in ishh Terence Oglesby mamish Pavilion here in Atlanta Georgia turnover Alo blocked by Powell kzne gets it Applause back shuberry trying to shake McCollum using the screen from ji Davis strong to the Baseline how talented is that kid covers so much ground off one bounce ball finally moves this Notre Dame team playing with serious intent in the early going of this second half Damon stoutamire sees that too he wants a timeout Georgia Tech still up by 14 Tay Davis being aggressive getting downhill finishing among the trees Tay Davis super talented and they need him to be if theyre going to crawl back into this Music one I say this Anish Tay Davis has brought a different sense of physicality and assertiveness here in this second half attacking the offensive class really tough off the bounce creating contact finishing among the trees and really doing a nice job of getting his initial first step past the defense so good hes opened up with a flurry here in the second yeah more points already in the second half and something to watch by Dongo has picked up four fouls for Georgia Tech hes out Notre Dame has drawn five fouls in the first 3 minutes of this half already against Georgia Tech you want a dent to 14 Point deficit get to the free throw line do it with no time going off the clock and its been in large part because of Tay Davis and you see his improvement from seen Hall 2 to 9 to 15 uh continues to develop his game but you see the natural Tools in raw athleticism he has now hes been able to refine some of it and weve gotten a glimpse of it over the first three minutes of this second half George against al plenty of time to Applause shoot mccollums got a a dozen to lead Georgia Tech Powell steps into it short knocked out of bounds itll stay with Georgia Tech last touch J I tell you what my man dunking the Shag pal hes the extra effort player he ends up with the shot at the end of the clock goes short he knows it he makes that extra effort and now jorg Tech got the ball 20 seconds on the clock they can redo their offense the headband really ties it all together it does right there at the line too if the ACC will have me Ill wear a headband and then grow that back part of my hair out Id love to see it if theyll have me for the turn well Music see Ill say defensively too Notre Dame it its been a different sense of urgency as you see them staying in front shot clock it two and thats a shot clock violation great defensive possession Bron Shrewsberry staying in front of JV McCullum not an easy Applause Tas what is the path back into this game for Notre Dame continue playing with offensive Force thats been the biggest difference here oh grenade Action Moving screen thats tough a shury had a great look off the foul is on Kei its his first and the first team foul on Notre Dame under 16 media timeout Tech still leads by Music 14 e p Music Notre Dame looking to start 20 in ACC play for the first time in Seven Seasons Georgia Tech trying to get to 500 looking for its first Conference win and well the Irish dug themselves in an early hole you talked about offensive toughness for Notre Dame what does that entail I mean just being strong with the basketball and taking your angles when theyre given it felt like in the first half Notre Dame a little bit trying to let the game come to them a little bit too much whenever youre playing offensively you have to take it to the defense sometimes too and that doesnt necessarily mean forcing a shot up that means being strong with the ball sweeping through and if youre going to give up a moving screen sometimes like youre going to live with those things because you need to set an example of whats to come the rest of the half because after that physical first half for Georgia tag Notre Dame needed to show something Applause Music Applause column lines it up and knocks it down hes got 15 tough shot Applause Music maker they sag off ji Ibrahim Suare into the game Dongo on the bench with the four fouls and Jai goes right at Suare rebound snatched by m its one you have to have ji right over the top you got to be able to finish one of those youre trying to crawl back in in a ball Applause game George Falling Away how do you like the home cooking I love it banks open on New Years Eve might as well be but man Nate George got to be able to score it sometimes too I think sometimes assist guys they a little too unselfish if you dont shoot that basketball makes it difficult to make those guys draw in thats as a result he makes one next time the helps going to stay a little bit longer and the lead back up to 19 Alo the floater he gets the bounce as well I love it go around that screen little side ball screen get the defender on your back you can control him little trap dribble keep the guy behind float game is good Michel Shrewsbury prays Doo is lead leadership how hes helped team chemistry itll stay with Georgia Tech this Notre aame team oh they returned more scoring than any other ACC team 86 of their scoring four starters back its really unheard of these days in college basketball then you bring in a grad transfer like AO and hes fit in seamlessly Princeton Guy high IQ pass the ball gives you some outside shooting as well and hes needed to be that guy George kicks Powell beats the shot clock Miss fired to rebound kesn the physicality on the glass is night and day different for Notre D Davis has a mismatch George got into the body and we get a foul its onte Davis Ill say this I thought there was a lot of contact on the defensive and you see him swing arm around its close but good rip of the ball Nate George you have to be pesky whenever youre Switched Off Tay Davis with another one its close for me its close for Applause me Georgia Tech led by 19 at the half Music collums had a strong game step back three got there Davis the rebound I dont love it a little bit too much dribbling for Georgia te Notre Dame really Walling off any offensive set that Georgia Techs trying to run right now oh nice spit and the Cyclones inside another and one chance for Tay Davis whos put this game on his back in the second half that man is really really talented a whirling dervish if you will going back to the right little Up and Under J Willis would be proud of that thats one of his pet peeves right up and under is not a reverse layup its a ball fake step through Big Time finish here in this second half Tate Davis has been electric and he has brought the physicality to Georgia Tech or in the first half that wasnt the case 10 points here in this early going in the second half hes got 14 and now 15 with the free throw for the ball game six rebounds looking for a third straight 20 point game Irish within 14 see that ball needs to change sides of the floor heres the Freshman mustaf over kesn forced that one up rebound Notre Dame okay so Georgia Tech stroke that play off if you push that ball ahead Nate George got one Bron Shrewsberry hes got one too how about that in the three and the Irish with an 11 they have brought the heat here in this early going pull up by George doesnt go Suarez saved it right to Notre Dame Shrewsberry a three got it for a dollar two for a dollar Braden Shrewsberry gets Georgia attack to take a timeout are you kidding me how about this the physicality is different the running offense with purpose and you cannot let this man Bron Shrewsberry get open and in transition you better communicate that man coachs kid will make you pay Notre Dame it within single digits this is a Music game page out of Georgia text playbook in the first half getting stops getting out and running and knocking down shots Bron Shrewsberry nine points in this second half after an oer in half one he has come alive as has Tate DAV yeah those two have 19 of Notre Dames 23 points in the second half and in 110 run has all of a sudden made this a game in single digits 19point halftime lead is down to eight for Georgia Tech you get Shrewsberry and Davis activated its a different Notre Dame team and this run coincided with Bango going out of the game with his fourth foul that was huge and it happened in the first minute and a half of this second half but what it comes down to Notre Dame continues to get stops on this end of the floor Georgia Techs taken some hard ones thats not one of them they need it pow has been feasting in that Applause corner lead back to 11 dve is strong and again without Dongo down there Notre Dame in attack mode in the half court offense I love what Shrewsberry did offensively on that set you get out you get Tay Davis the basketball and then you have somewhat of a pistol action dribble handoff on the right side of the floor hes able to fake it because his versatility and ability to handle the ball gets down there big time athlete we know and thats seven fouls for Georgia Tech on the half now in the bonus for a duration yeah so Notre Dame will have a one and one from here on out this was a shooting foul its three fouls on mustaf Dongo has four George checks in for Matumbo small lineup out there for Georgia Tech small lineup for both teams you look at Tay Davis hes going to be at the five spot for n Dame look for a lot of quick ball screen actions with Duncan pal some pick and pop Tribble handoffs Georgia Tas got to find some offense here in this second half Powells been a big contributor today 13 points that matches a season High which he set against Duke Here Comes George looking for Powell has to kick it out shot clock down to six mum from an impossible angle you got to be kidding me how do you defend Applause that hey what JB mccullins on theres not many better hes on today 17 points Alo looking for rer instead Davis windmills down the lane for two I love it goes down initiates the contact really sought out Dwight Pals body or Duncan Pals body excuse me really strong finish 18 for Tay DAV as he leads all scores oh my gosh were going to a foul called as Terry elevated second foul on tay Davis I love this you get Baseline Drive pass it up to the top look how he initiates contact and his body has continued to mature throughout the course of his college career seeking out that contact creating just enough space for that left hand womens college basketball takes over the ACC Network every Thursday you knew this starting this week we have a double header that starts at 6 Virginia Tech hosting Florida State and then a classic ACC match up at 8 Stanford and SMU the all Coast Conference all Coast Conference indeed Stanford SMU and Cal the newcomers to the ACC this season Music theres your mismatch Alo kzne using the shot fake alako so good off the shot fake Beats the horn its tipped around rer the follow we raved and raved and raved about the front Court of Georgia teing that first half theyre toughness in physicality inside the painted area second halfs been a story The Irish have owned everything inside of 8 ft and thats why theyre back in this ball game mustaf almost walked puts it up over a locko for two Jaden mustos going to score a lot of points in a yellow jacket Jersey big physical leted the eyb Len scoring for bu Williams but this guy can score too my goodness you got to be get it now shrews has come to play in the second half all of his scoring since halftime hes got a Applause Music dozen eightpoint game Powell against too got into the body and now rer commits the Applause Music foul Bron Shrewsberry were going to take a look at that last three Micah beside himself with that foul call the scowl is noticeable how about this though coming around curling just enough BR Shrewsberry thats a bucket and then coming down on the other end of the floor I will say Notre Dame I thought that was a lot of ball Shore but at the same time their movement offensively Georgia Tech has stagnated some La in the first half they were passing cutting with purpose cutting to score twice meaning cutting through the lane and then getting out quickly second half been a lot of passing and holding a couple of extra dribbles theyre going to have to clean that up cuz Notre Dames come to play 10point game were past the halfway mark of the second half sky clear and Alo Rises and finishes from Princeton with love Im not sure the guy used to live on 112 Mercer Street saw that one Music Applause coming George wow its tipped numbers for Notre Music name Shrewsberry settles he and Davis have been the catalysts for the comeback Davis against Powell and rewarded with two more shots Music how about Notre Dame Im not going to say young legs but how about parting like the Red Sea Mr alako mush he mushed that one in Duncan pal got to come over a little sooner sir Princeton transfer hes kind of stepped into the number one point guard roll with Marcus Burton Applause out I think he was as surprised as anybody hes been telling his teammates he could do this for probably better part of eight months now he actually did it talk about that dun for the next 50 years its a twopossession game it was a 19point game at Halftime Davis has 20 how the feathery Music touch I like to I like his aggressiveness off the bounce saw the mismatch knew he had the physical Advantage hes got 17 Powell does a season High aos got 10 to go along with six helpers hes got a mismatch hell shoot over Powell he hits Matt Alo has been unlocked in this second half Notre Dame within five and well get a block him Applause foul Duncan foul has been the guy offensively for Georgia Tech season High 17 points I like this Little Euro Step and a lefty why not for the big fella and then Matt alako has been that third guy and hes got him within five coming over and bothering Tay Davis when you go small you have Duncan pal guarding him as the bigger player and the guy coming over to help as a guard so it puts you in a bit of a pickle michah Shrewsberry going small has opened this game up for Tay Davis and for some of his Shooters on the perimeter yeah Davis with 20 points for third straight game mum able to draw the foul on the drive boy when theyve needed a big basket theyve called his number hes just so good at getting the defender on his hip and then when you get on his hip he has to be productive so quick shimmy thats a lot of ball right there wow I take everything I said back bad call they get kesn with his first mcum career 90 free throw shooter good to have a closer of that sort but I mean hes been one of the guys really Anish where hes dribbled a little bit too much in this second half and whenever you have Nate Jorge and Javen McCullum theyre both going to be able to do that now I just noticed Kev ji coming into the game Ryan Matumbo Subs in as well now you have a two big lineup I think that plays more into Georgia Techs hands than it does Notre Dames hand why well the reason being is because you bring over that help Defender being a bigger player and I think Notre Dame has done a nice job when the games been played with one true big of really opening up this game 19 points for JB McCullum a season High extended two3 pressure the bottom Wings will come up for Damon stmy to try to make some of these passing Lanes difficult and that is textbook sir textbook how you attack a Zone went Zone and Notre Dame picked it apart back to cut off the feed from Tay Davis to ji fivepoint game Notre Dames last lead was at 121 Powell forced one up aos Been Applause Everywhere lost it out of bounds how about breaking a Zone you couldnt draw it up any better than what just happened with Georgia Tech you throw it right in the middle Tay Davis short Corner Kenny kevi excuse me he knows what to do thats about as easy as a two points as youll see all conference season in About Time by and Dongo back in the ball game with four fouls after sitting for the better part of the second half Dongo eight points five rebounds Music Powell theres that corner three Terry offensive rebound Powell rra rebound Shrewsberry and I think you expect Notre Dame right now to come after 11 and Applause Music white now Micah Shrewsberry pointing at Dongo Dongo was on he backs off need to get downhill alako hits the jumper and again you saw Dongo he hesitated didnt want to pick up that fifth foul thats exactly right nice job alako being that older player playing off two feet understanding he has the leverage easy fade away from about 8 ft and he knew Dongo would probably be a little tentative its a threepoint game Georgia Tech led by 19 at the break George out to Powell off the shot fake Powell throws it toward the rim and he will get rewarded with two shots but again this is a little bit different here the balls changing sides of the floor and whenever Georgia Techs been able to do that they found some of these driving Lanes off the pass thats where Duncan Powells seen some success last year in the Big Sky Powell at Sacramento State in scoring and rebounding and misses the free throw Thursday at 10 Easter after hour womens basketball double header the nothing but net crew breaks down the night in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every womens game both free throws no good for Powell theyll also look ahead to the best matchups on the schedule for the weekend whatever Kelly gramlick says just take it as gospel just throwing that out there you Clemson folks stick together thats right Dongo inside Terry and two shots coming for Lance Music Terry I I I would like to see Dongo a little little bit more aggressive hes looking to pass a little bit too much now you look at what Lance Terrys able to do nice job cutting to the rim when his guy when his Defender turns his head so you end up with the free throw uh but Dongo hes got to find a way to reassert himself be aggressive without being overly so so you dont get caught for that fit one out of two for Terry and Notre aame with another chance here to get closer down four Applause the Irish have outscored Georgia Tech by 15 in the second half kesn stolen away numbers for Georgia Tech Terry puts it in with the Up and Under shades of the first half there turnover transition easy bucket two possession game Davis over Dongo who did not commit the fifth backed away at the very last moment its 7268 less than 4 and 1 half to play Georgia Tech has yet to beat a power Conference team this season Notre Dame started 40 lost five straight lost their best player Marcus Burt but theyve won three in a row since theyve had nine days off prior to this one and Terry with the clutch three for Georgia Tech they needed it theyve struggled in the half court they needed somebody to take the lid off here in the second half it might be that Rim down there but big time shot from the top of the key Shrewsberry passed on the Applause answer Davis kick ball Applause time out on the Flor Timeout on the floor sevenpoint lead we go down the home stretch you got to attack a mismatch and Tate Davis does that right here against a smaller player nice finish but heres another thing Lance Terry big shot in the half court trying to keep this Georgia Tech Yellow Jacket steam afloat talented as they come Tay Davis big fan of what hes capable of not just now but in the future and that young fell Javen McCullum so quick so crafty capable shooter from three excellent foul shooter you cant foul him I I mean this has been back and forth all day and Georgia Tech after a great first half hoping to hang on both teams have battled both teams have dealt with injuries to key players no today still without their best player Marcus Burton Georgia Tech still without kaasi Reeves Eko Luke OBrien rebound Dongo what do these final three and A2 minutes come down to for both teams I think it comes down to who controls the backboard because if you get a couple of extra possessions during these last three minutes and change it can make all the Music Applause difference that Balls got to go in quicker Dongo shot fake and he will shoot two but you notice that possession from beginning to end the ball moved it popped there was some offensive quickness away from the ball so theyre able to get open faster and I thought the recognition for Dongo being open was a little bit late but you see it here quick dribble handoff ball moves ahead Quick Pass to the corner and then you have a mismatch down low if Im Dongo right there Im going up trying to dunk that ball you got to get an extra one especially after sitting for so long try to find some power for your team free throw is good that was the ninth team foul on Notre Dame so the Georgia Tech in the double bonus from here on out kabaji in for roer gongo career 64 free throw shooter gets them both two for four today its a npoint lead for Georgia Tech five players in double figures Alo navigating the Baseline and he stepped out of bounds hey you want to talk about conference ball you better be tougher with the basketball if youre matako youre an older player play off two feet uh that cant happen at the end of the game youre trying to battle your way back in inside of three Music minutes Terry George McCollum Dongo and Powell on the for Georgia Tech Powell to flush its got to be the Music hair theres no doubt its the ha his best game as a yellow jacket 19 for Duncan Powell timeout Micah Shrewsberry 241 left in regulation Music the Shag is in full effect knocking down shots attacking the rim and I like this pass it across the floor that left corner has been all him and right before we went to break a little Duncan for Duncan just a silly finish in traffic holiday season Duncans toy chest weve seen it all 19 points three rebounds a couple of assists and the energy and the inspiration for for all of us bald guys maybe the most important part absolutely does Notre Dame have another push but look look look at how a dunk in a Timeout transforms the energy defensively wow it doesnt matter Davis with another chance at a threepoint play boy he has been Hercules since halftime he absolutely has and its that first step youre always in Retreat mode whenever you play a guy as quick and ath atic a t Davis downright impressive has he been 24 points on the day and just does so getting to the cup and playing off two feet 19 of his 24 since Applause halftime 7971 both teams now with nine fouls so double bonus for all involved here on out little pressure Dead Mans Corner cant go there it when you go up against pressure in the full court you do not cross half court right there because now you effectively have three Defenders the midline and two guys coming to trap cant do that and Powell was stuck and that is a bailout with the foul call yeah t Davis got arm this games been physical but you rake across the arms right in front of the official 20 points for Powell which matches his career high he leads all scores for Georgia Tech what a what a nice find for this Georgia Tech coaching staff get him from Sacramento State hes been outstanding its a 10point game we come up on two to play urgency now for the Irish AO from 15 chai fouled on the follow and if that is Dongo hes done Im willing to take it 10point deficit or or 10point lead youre willing to take one of those you cant give up easy buckets but you have to finish possessions first and foremost Kev ji good physicality tough Dongo after a good first half this second halfs been a killer so Dongo is done he is fouled out and Jai a career 71 free throw shooter who followed Micah Shrewsberry from State College to South Bend at the free throw line for the first time tonight Music so you got Jai at the free throw line lets say he makes both or at least he hits the second one then youve got to set up your defense sure and heres the thing too now you look at Georgia Techs lineup in the game Jaden mustaf Duncan Powell Lance Terry Nate George and McCullum small really smallers exactly right so you look to find something early within the first 10 seconds of the clock at least touch the painted area to where you can spray out to one of your Applause shoers 8173 so offense defense substitutions rer comes in pressure by the Irish George picked up the dribble Terry across the timeline and now Georgia Tech will bleed clock nice job I I think Jaden mustaf you have a freshman sees a little bit of daylight mature play to get the ball back out to J McCullum mullum splits the d off the window 21 for the Oklahoma transfer my goodness he he uses your own body against you to score so good with leverage despite his size down 10 Applause they got to go quickly lot of wasted seconds Roper against McCollum onehanded Runner offensive rebound rims out Tracked Down By The Freshman mustaf and did he get the timeout he did before stepping out of Applause bounds they had opportunities and here you got to get down try to force turnovers and you see the full court pressure coming out and heres what Georgia Tech has to close the game McCollum a career 90 free throw shooter Terry 81 this season George 88 21 out of 24 this season so youve got some really talented free throw shooters out on the floor who can seal the game with a minute to go into 10point lead certainly helps but difficult spot to inbound the ball wow McCollum throws it away so Notre Dame forces the turnover but notot but not only do you turn the ball over you throw it out of bounds you need to fake a pass make a pass this is when you return to your fundamentals now the clock stops Notre Dame has the ball on the side thats something that cant happen Alo will inat look for Shrewsberry number 11 maybe to screen acrossing then come up Shrewsberry four for six from three all four threes this half here he is good switch Shrewsberry on the handoff from ji and were going to get a moving screen on Kev ji thats off kevi doing his best to create some space and I dont really know if I should blame ji as much as Shrewsberry I thought Shrewsberry jumped the gun a little bit and sometimes its the big man that gets thrown under the bus a little bit nice pass up ahead mustaf brings it in and he is fouled so two shots for the Freshman out of Maryland dad was a great player at Maryland former Nicks first round pick passed away in October its a nice player I saw him play for the first time played for bu Williams aaou in the ebl circuit at peach jam that young man can score the basketball and today I mean you obviously didnt score it like he usually does only two points on one of five shooting but lot of tools does this young man have one out of two its an 11point game Alo picks up his dribble a column all over him Davis on the inside it rims out mustaf the rebound and now the foul on Notre Dame and two more free throws for the freshman and Georgia Tech less than 30 seconds from an ACC win and the Yellow Jackets first win against a power team this season well they earned it and it all came from the first half that physicality getting that big lead and then in the second half I Notre Dame showed a lot of resolve Crawling Back In cutting the lead down to four points but Duncan pal I mean talk about McCullum sha talk about Lance Terry Shore Duncan pal today uh both on the glass making the extra effort plays knocking down that corner three that he loved so much I thought he was outstanding after Dongo goes out with foul trouble early in the second half a loo against Terry Terry got a piece Davis drops it in and Micah Shrewsberry calling off the dogs Georgia Tech in front of its home crowd the fourth game on a fivegame homeand and the yellow jackets get their biggest win of the season season and its a conference win absolutely and it all came from the physicality in the first half of their front court that Mak
