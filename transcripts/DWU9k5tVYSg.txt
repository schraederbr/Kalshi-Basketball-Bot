Yeah theyre going to miss his scoring You know theyre theyre going to need some production from some guys that you know maybe they typically dont get it from this guy at the point Luca Taves Donald giving them about 12 points a game So Chase Forte is into the starting lineup for Earl Grants team at 9 and 16 overall 210 in the ACC and trying to snap a sixgame losing streak Most recently at home Saturday against Cal when Chris Bell made six threes Early turnover and here come the NLES and a look at their starting lineup Tomas Bongs been so great defensively Rob McCrae the point guard is the leading scoreer at 15 a game And then Chanty Wiggins second leading scorer and a threat from the outside Steen for Wiggins and a kick is on Jaden Hastings Know Alex Steen the one guy out there who cant shoot But Florida State theyre going to play fast over half of their shots 52 of their shots on the year are threes That number a little down in conference play Their shot selection has gotten a lot better especially over the last seven games but they want to play fast Big part of today for BC is controlling the tempo And you do that by not turning it over which they did on the first possession Thats something Earl Grant was talking about with us this morning He said Florida State probably wants 80 possessions We want more like 68 Wiggins in the midrange starts the score Hes really playing his best basketball of his career frankly You know was really hot going into their Virginia game Did not play well in that Got back to himself against Virginia Tech See the starters for the Eagles And this is Fred Payne with it Leading scorer for Boston College at 15 a game So much on his plate especially without Donald Han Had the mismatch on Steam Took the fall away over the length and missed it And Leger Jones cleared it for Florida State Rob McCrae driving kick and now Wiggins loves to shoot it from deep Pay the rebound Well see what Boston College can muster up offensively They have rated as the worst offensive team in the ACC in terms of efficiency according to Ken Pom Theyve struggled to shoot it all season Taves kicked it for Payne Knocks it down Long two for Fred Payne You cant leave him And and thats one of the for Florida State Theyre going to be in the gaps Its one of the adjustments theyve made to their half court defense but you cannot leave Fred Payne He is the one guy who will get a bucket for BC Jones a guy you really like And then they attack the offensive glass with Mong Get Jones another look over the top of Cap No Weak side offensive rebound again from Steen And thats what he does MCCRAE HOIST AND HITS That offensive rebounding is such a weapon And and as you said Mike that is what Alex Steen does Almost three offensive rebounds a game Just never stops playing How hard he plays is his skill set DC gave Florida State three looks at it Payne on target from long range at a fast start for Fred Payne whos had a great third season for the Eagles Has not shot it well in in really their last six games I think hes maybe wearing down a little bit Hes had a lot on his shoulders but he will stay aggressive First year starter has taken a real step forward this year We enjoyed our conversation with him earlier today Back it out for Jones around the screen from Bong got caught in the air Now Wiggins at the end of the horn Thats what Chanty Wiggins can do 35 from three for his career and he will throw up a ton of them Hastings gets bailed out by Katy underneath Carved out some space and missed it over Bong A you got to be able to finish that if youre Captain Key You got size in there Youre right at the basket You got to use that glass and finish Now Jones turned the corner HAD IT PINNED BY HASTINGS Payne pushes Taves triggers and knocks it down And Taves can really shoot Hes actually much better off of the ball cuz he really wants to score Thats what he really wants to do 45 on the year from three Hes coming off two of his three best scoring games of the season in ACC play And many are saying the game against Stanford he was in his bag Many many are saying this Im definitely saying it Rescued on the baseline by Payne for Capki And here is Taves See the confidence building for him those last couple of games He wants another off target this time And McCrae the rebound Up and down action the first four and a half minutes from the tuck Steen the post up Hes got the mismatch Kane digs Steen moved it Wiggins swirls one out and a battle on the boards and another offensive rebound That is three already for Florida State McCrae musling Taves No And this time the rebound down to Hastings Pain without numbers Has that blocked by Bong and Jones Coffee which was I didnt see that coming Illuminating I did not either He didnt see it coming He had to change his coffee source this morning and use it as a teaching point with his team You got to bring energy good energy BC trying to grab a win We showed you how many close games they have played in this year He said to us so many one and two possession games trying to solve this Florida State defense heavy in the gaps Pain on the baseline floater over length for two Tough And it was you know he gets his first shot to go in this game He starts to feel it Nice little drive there and you see the touch in the midrange right over the top of the defender Seven of the Boston College 10 have come from Fred Payne from Gramling Louisiana Hes matched up with Wiggins Craig took a tumble Wiggins gets a switch with Hastings Late shot clock and the skips coughed up to Forte The Steen out of the game This is where Wiggins moves to the five And I dont know what he was seeing That was not open And now post for Hastings The double cane He passes out of it And Taves hits another Third three for Boston College And two from Luca Taves This is a team BC that has not shot it well on the year from three Its been one of you know one of their issues offensively Making only six threes a game They are smoking hot to start this one and only 30 from three for the season Wiggins on pain follow No BC with the basketball up by five early A lot of standing around Not a lot of movement there Everybody watching Chanty Wiggins play Shaw from Hastings and its a 100 run and Luke LS needs a timeout matching up at home against a team thats two and 10 in conference a BC team that has not played well How do you talk to your team in the leadup to this He felt like theyd be ready They do not have the same energy especially on that defensive end And Luke L like you were was on it from the start of shoot around today He said to his team If we take BC lightly its going to be a long night Forte in transition nearly followed there by Hastings Leger Jones Offensive foul Cassell thought about it and called against Lee Jones in the end Well and thats another turnover I mean these turnovers are pretty careless I like that call I I think thats a nice job sliding his feet over there by Luca Taves taking it And we talked about defensive energy Its also been really sloppy here on the offensive end Careless turnovers And I dont know where youre going there if if youre Jones Turnovers on three straight possessions for Florida State Taves initiating with Hastings Payne Late shot clock Gets a switch Moves it for Taves Deep one spins out Offensive rebound Forte Fresh 20 for the Eagles Taves working on Steen Forte rises and buries 43 for Boston College Thats a good sign for Chase Forte who hasnt shot it great this year Well as penetration you know gets into that gap Again Florida State coming way off to be in that gap Theyre leaving shooters though And Jones missed it from deep BC back with it The way BC has shot it I think you got to stay home a little bit more Force some finishes in the paint and at the basket Youre Luke Laps You probably thought you could sit in the gaps and force BC to prove they could make threes like this Theyve opened up four of six from deep Taves Nice pass Shaw moves it Forte drills it Theyve got another This is ridiculous shooting I mean just ridiculous on BCs part I mean you just said an average of six made threes per game Theyve got five as Steen draws a foul on his way to the cup And this is a 160 run for Boston College here in the first half Theyre taking what the defense has given them And like you said Mike thats the scout A team that has not shot it well for three on the year Were going to be in the gaps Were going to force these threes And BC music says We are wet A good start to this game Better than Earl Grant probably could have hoped in terms of shooting here in the first nine minutes Hey Wednesday night mens basketball double header for you Clemson and Wake Forest started at 7 Eastern Then 14th ranked Virginia squares off with Georgia Tech at McCamish Pavilion 9 Eastern here on ACCN and the app Virginia on a sixgame winning streak got to win Saturday against Ohio State out of conference in Nashville And now after the made free throws Florida State will extend some pressure which they do Little 221 threearter court you assume theyll come back in man Well back in the two3 zone and with way the way BC has shot it you can find some clean looks Theyve been 15 zone this year Payne baseline shot that same floater Le Jones the rebound See if Florida State can get into some sort of rhythm Luke Laps was saying to us earlier today as you mentioned they wanted to avoid what he called that a setup game a let down game here against Boston College but not known for his shooting And then Shaw went soaring for the rebound Taves Payne Forte Shawn Capy the five on the floor for Earl Grant Taves got to his spot in the midrange missed it short Shaw tried to run it down but right to McCrae in transition Steen joins spinning on Forte Tough two and a foul from Alex Dean Well we saw the defensive adjustment on the other end guys stayed home so they werent helping as much as they were starting the game And then this is all Alex Ste running the floor again He just never stops playing hard Nice job taking that contact If youre going to take the charge there Chase Forte take it But a good job using that pivot foot being under control And how about the start for Steam You know just hard work blue collar types of plays 69 senior transfer from the D2 ranks Florida Southern hasnt scored a whole lot the last few games That was the first bucket for the nullles in six and a half minutes Now a trap on Stager the freshman got it away and Capki got fouled I dont understand why Capki is refusing to use the glass I mean its twice hes been right there at the rim and hes tried to fit it in But nonetheless I mean how about breaking the pressure getting out of the trap and having the twoonone down back Good find And thats where you got to go glass there man Guys like me we would jam it too Thats dunk it right You wouldnt know Uh by the way second foul on Leger Jones but Luke LS is one of the most lenient in the country if you pick up two in the first half cheering So Bowden Kapki 611 Butler transfer 106 rebounds per game after he moved into the starting lineup in early January Heres Jones Told you off the top how good Leger Jones has been recently Super productive for this Florida State squad McCrae off the bounce on Steer just muscles the freshman to the cup You know he shoots lefty but hes actually naturally righthanded He does everything else with his right hand outside of shooting the basketball So hes really good going to that right side I know youve seen him throw some great righthanded passes His dad was his high school coach and his dad we were trying to get it out of him today Like why would he force you to be a lefty It was his dad who said you know kind of taught him how to shoot it with THAT LEFT HAND FORTE wrapped it around for Shaw Thats how you go to finish The athlete Aiden Shaw transfer from Missouri and a foul here on the screening action And theyre going to give that to Steer BC Theres Robert McCrae the fifth finishing with that right hand And then Aiden Shaw the start of the year in that starting lineup I think they were hoping for a little bit more for him Hasnt quite given them the offense Maybe they were hoping but he is really athletic and an outstanding finisher as you can see around the rim By the way I said second foul Its actually on Capki not Stagger So Bowden Capki goes to the bench with two here in the first McCrae musling in and using that hand Down to seven for Florida State So now Capi off the floor Hastings and Shaw play together for Boston College Heres Forte found Payne banks one in Everything going Boston College his way from D It was a heck of a pass from Chase Forte Had a couple just wrapping them around to find open teammates cheering Heres Martin Somerville coming off maybe his best game of the season McCrae let it fly No And the rebound down to Jaden Hastings Boston College six of eight from beyond the ark PAYNE WANTS ANOTHER HES GOT another just lazy defense there from Chanty Wiggins I mean you have got to when you switch on that which Florida States going to do you have got to switch up and into that shot A contest and a foul at the rim from Aiden Shaw on Steam I mean Fred Payne is their best player Hes their best scorer and he is cooking in this game What a beautiful pass there Helps to stay hot when youre banking him in And then theres Chanty Wiggins What are you doing man I mean its an automatic switch and you have got to switch up into Fred Payne into that shot You think this feels good for Fred Payne By the way you had mentioned everything on his plate maybe some signs of fatigue His last three games coming into today three made threes on 24 attempts And so sure enough he comes out three for three from deep Hes a great story I mean you know hes hes a guy in his third year you know in this era of the transfer portal In his third year at BC he hurt his knee as a freshman so he took a red shirt and hes just stuck with Earl Grant in in this process You know we were talking to him earlier today about staying at BC He said I love Earl Grant Im loyal to the soil And I think hes you know hes struggled a little bit I think you know again I think hes wearing down Hes had a lot on his shoulders Hes only 61 about 180 lbs Defenses have been geared to stop him So I think hes wearing down a little bit but this is the Fred Payne who we saw a lot early in the year And again what the shooting had been like for the season was not what it had been like the last half dozen games coming in Good lift for BC up by 11 inside of eight to go in this first half A Boston College team on a sixgame losing streak trying to make sure they get into the top 15 among the 18 teams in the ACC to get to Charlotte And a drive and a foul as well for Aiden Shaw Thats a senior against a sophomore and Aiden Shaw You know you get a dunk you feel good about yourself you start to think you can conquer the world especially a sophomore Going right into the chest of So what does BC do They put their head down and they drive And theyre getting those oneonone matchups music like you just saw there with Aiden Shaw going right into the chest of AJ Swinton with no help Can BC sustain this Seven threepoint field goals in this first half so far Can they sustain this offensive explosion that we have seen here You mentioned the way theyve shared it to Tennessee to just one turnover for Boston College Florida State can they wake up into this first half down by 13 here at home And they had won four of five five of seven They have played like one of the better five teams or so in the ACC over the course of the last three weeks Shaw picked it from McCrae Drops it off for Payne AND ITS BLOCKED BY MCCRAE McCrae moves it for Somerville Thats blocked by Shaw Had blocks all over the place Jolts off the shot fake Gets fouled on the drive Its a heck of a steal I mean thats your your fourman picking the pocket of Robert McCrae the fifth But McCrae doesnt sulk gets back into play and then how about that close out by Shaw So two great defensive plays by him and that shot wasnt open just a step slow Florida State just a little sluggish not reading it just a step behind BC in this first half So Jones to the line Hes scoreless Guy who averages 12 a game And a great story He was telling us today his only offer out of high school was Tarlton State He was the only freshman in his class there Told us tons of DNPs a year at junior college Last year at St Bonaventure he told us it was a partial breakout And then this year hes been really good in the ACC He has Hes like that combination of shooter and dog He leads him in blocks shots Just really a tough tough dude and become much better defensively as the year has has gone on The BC lead is a dozen Jason Asamotto former blue chip recruit to Baylor and off the bench 55 in the maroon Taves to the midrange No And a battle on the boards and it belongs to Florida State So what do you want to see from them offensively I mean obviously theyve had defensive struggles How about the offensive end Id love to see the ball move a little bit You know I I think theres theyre spacing shooters Theyre do watching a lot of the ball handler dribble Theres not a lot of movement You know one pass and a shot Its its just not offense Theyre not making DC work So whats at stake BC hasnt won an ACC road game in two years Theyve lost 16 straight SHAW the slip and got it from Hastings And thats the counter to a team that switches one through five Those slips are there especially if the switch doesnt come together Wiggins underneath has that blocked by Shaw and Aiden Shaws got his fingerprints all over this game Theres that slip again You know no communication Bad switch by Florida State Shaw slipping right to the basket and theres the athleticism Aiden Shaw you said he was expected to be a big ad Missouri transfer Spent time as a backup there He hasnt scored in double figures all year Hes got eight points here in the first half Kobe McGee hiding behind the screen though and Asamot for the rebound Tough shot early in the shot clock with a hand in the face A lot of tough tested deep shots from Florida State in this first half Theyre two of 12 from deep Forte backs it out and directs Sixth year senior South Dakota transfer Forte wrapped it around for Taves Shot clock winding down Taves Runner short Rebound cleared by Wiggins And then a foul goes against Jaden Hastings Again this was the fear for Luke LS He said to his team at the end of shoot around as well reminding them guys you got to play with an edge You have to play with competitive spirit He told him he said Thats why youve had this success recently They changed things defensively They slowed down their pace offensively over the course of the season but a lot of its just come down to effort and urgency Jones into the paint has that blocked by Hastings Jones got it back and he scores in a foul And they have been the more physical team Like even in that loss to Virginia Florida State is the more physical team They are bigger than Florida State They have more positional size across the board Nice job by Jones staying with it And thats the dog that I was talking about You know again a guy who will take and make threes but he has shown a physicality to his game especially over the last handful of games Got six stitches above his eye a few games ago You know stitches you know what itll do Yeah Little toughness of course He told us today they just got tired of running before practice We said Well how much He said there was one practice before it began They ran 61 down and back sprints because of poor play in their previous game Thatll do IT TOO FORTE BLOCKED BY BASSONG Tomomas Bong to Jones in transition and hes fouled Yeah Running 61 times I had visions of Kurt Russell her as Her Brooks again Again What a block by the freshman You know 66 but got about a 74 wingspan put into the starting lineup for his defense Hes got a really good instinct for it That was a heck of a play from behind Little kind of a LeBron duck block there Freshman from Paris Yeah big part of this turnaround He is very sinnowy Hey Thursday night 10 Eastern after our womens basketball double header than nothing But Net Crew breaks it all down In the ACC they look at every womens game right here on ACC Network and the app Ill be honest that one wasnt on the game I was going to say how how would you lean and muscular Is that sineuy Yeah Wheres not flexible though Uh that applies too for Tomas Basog led the points at the other end Florida State back within nine on this great first half for Boston College Inside of five to go until the break Kathy playing with his two fouls for Earl Grant Wanted to get it to him on the block Couldnt And now Taves Shot clock below 10 cheering Taves against Jones Moved it for Payne Shot off by Somerville Post entry Capi and hes fouled Steen thought he got it clean instead cat to the line I thought Steam get it did get it clean Yeah thats a good block And that was a really good job by BC executing Yeah thats a good block Bad call About two seconds on the shot clock so they didnt panic BC did a nice job finding Kapki late and got bailed out by the call Luke LS was hot about it cheering And so Capi at the line 70 free throw shooter Hes averaged a dozen per game over his last seven And he splits out Dogging Somerville was looking for the sudden theft Somerville coming off 23 on Saturday Part of a huge second half for Florida State against Virginia Tech Bon got his own miss and he gets fouled Tomas Bang to the free throw line Theres the Athne Tomas Bang picked up Boopy Miller 94 feet in that game against SMU I mean he just was dogging him in the full court Starting to feel himself a little bit offensively Couple couple three attempts in this game You see there the drive and the just a quick second jump to gather the offensive board Many are buying stock in Tomas Bong Hes been in the starting lineup the last month plus ever since that disaster against NC State And he makes both Nolles extend the pressure again on Boston College Trouble on the inbounds and it stays with BC Last touch by Steam The lead has been as large as 14 for Boston College A trap in the corner on Taves He handled that with Forte Got to get it over the timeline here and Forte saved it And then not on the same page timing wise with Shaw Florida States got some momentum Theyve got it down to eight inside of four to go in this first half at Tallahassee news all things considered music on Donald Han Hes going to have one MRI tomorrow just to confirm what they suspect is hopefully a return pretty quickly back to play That would be welcome for Boston College Again a guy who gets 13 points per game Florida State has cut into this margin here in the first half BC still by eight approaching three and a half to go from the tuck Mike Monaco Chris Pollah our entire crew with you McGee turned the corner He left it short Its two of 13 from three for the Nolles You feel better about that possession though You know you got a couple ball reversals You move the defense Ball saw a lot of different hands Fred Payne driving kick for Taves Summons the ball screen Got a switch from Steen Taves Tough pass to make Yeah McGee took it away Really hard defensive play to make without fouling And then McGee couldnt pay it off from three Chicagos climbing over Bassong for the rebound Quickly ahead for Forte Wide open for three I mean nobody picked him up I think thats Somervilles guy who just kind of stayed underneath to harass Aiden Shaw And nobody picked up Chase Forte Its now his third three of this first half Eight made threes tied for the most in any half this season for Boston College McGee wants another Couldnt knock it down Hes been cold from deep off the bench Senior guard Drexel will transfer for Luke LS Capy calling for it instead Taves for pain left it short Rebounds steong off the bounce and a held ball will keep it at this end of the floor Yeah you know somebodys got to pick that up I mean that thats just poor transition defense for a guy whos already got two threes in a half Thats what Skip Proer used to call a puntum three Hes so wide open He could pump the ball in Pinpoint We want that coffin corner off the rim and then it belongs to Boston College and FSU is not going to stop shooting I mean this is what music they do Again they over half of their shots on the year are threes Its a fraction that Earl Grant knew exactly said to us today 51 52 of their shots come from three He said if you take 40 youre going to make them when youre firing up that many Forte off the bounce for Capki musling in on Wiggins for two Strong move Thats with Steen out of the game again Wiggins is at the five and he just got muscled by Cap First made bucket for CapKey And then a push on Boston College on the baseline I mean Wiggins had nothing for this Two bumps and Kappy able to get himself closer Capy at 255 lbs against Wiggins 30 lbs lighter So Martin Somerville to the line 82 free throw shooter transfer from UMass LOL 234 and six in Blackburg Saturday Thursday night ACC Network womens basketball double header Courtney Bangharts number 22 Tarheelss coming off a loss against Duke on Sunday They square off with Megan Duffys Virginia Tech team at 6 Eastern Then its Stanford and Miami at 8 Eastern Both games available on the app Somerville misses both Told you hes been a great free throw shooter this year and for his career Pay in transition Shaw couldnt finish Florida State can run Rob McCrae has been quiet in this first half Gets to the bucket easily and scores it How about that turnaround Fourpoint swing You got an alleyoop that you cant complete on one end to go up 15 and then you give up a transition layup on the other Final minute Steer shut off by Bong McCrae is denying Payne Taves off the bounce Wiggins with the switch Taves into the lane Gets it to go Its too easy This has not been the Florida State team guarding the ball oneonone that we have seen over the last five games It has allowed BC to put up its most first half points this year Somerville contested three Someville Boston College could hold for the final shot in this first half Fred Payne comes to get it Hes got 13 in the half And Florida State with fouls to give Well those teams are playing Amen 53 seconds for Boston College for the end of the first half Get it into Taves Final 3 seconds Luca Taves around the corner Got to get it up Well defended music by Florida State on the final possession of the first half Its amazing how hard they played in the first half given that fact two wins in the league and how much confidence theyre playing with A really good first half for Earl Grants team that has still brought it down the stretch in your five for Earl Grants Chase Forte had nine on three threes as you said in the first half and an early turnover Taz for Capki to begin just a pass and catch there Of course they started the game with a turnover on their first possession but well see You know that were going to learn a lot about the body language and and learn a lot about Florida State You know how much they actually have in there in terms of character with how they start this half First five minutes become big They only made nine shots from the floor the first half Steam nearly walked with it Bong saved it Florida State still possesses Rob McCrae made four of the shots The rest of the team made five buckets in the first half McCrae off the bounce right hand No cheering And you see those first half threepoint shooting numbers we mentioned Taves for Payne He rises and he swirls one home again Le Jones thats overhelp Youve got your back turn to Fred Payne Just watching Taves with that Steve Nash along the baseline And so youre late on the closeout Bang kicked it out Wiggins knocks it down Second three for Chanty Wiggins These things and Shaw supplied good minutes for BC in that first half music They combined for five blocks and two steals Nice slip Taves moved it for Capki and he buries one Excellent offense A great slip again the counter to a switching team Really nice pass and then Taves finding Kapki who was able to balance his feet get his feet set to knock that in 30 from three this year FOR BOWDEN KAPI JONES HAD BAD INTENTIONS RISING UP He couldnt stop it Pain back the other way That was nearly the highlight of the night in sports Paynes got Jones on him Step back Toe on the line Short Tipped out though for Capki Cant hit And the rebound down to Steam What does Florida State have in these first five minutes like you said in the second half Backs against the wall Theyve been playing so well coming in Wiggins kicked it Bong working on Forte He got underneath and he gets fouled They start the game you know making threes And again look at Leah Jones just kind of watching the play over helping You get a wideopen Fred Payne and then thats where these threes for Florida State has to come from You know driving the paint paint touch kind of like that You know two feet in the paint you draw help and you kick to a spot shooter Fred Paynes been great 16 points no turnovers This is as good an offensive game as BC has played all year The team we told you 15 straight ACC road losses Sixgame losing streak this past week against Stanford and Cal at home The losing streak followed their two ACC wins back to back mid January at home at overtime against Syracuse and at home by three against Pit and Bone Capki had a big shot in that game at Connie Forum leads 11 here Taves being denied by Bong now Pay off the side ball screen A double comes on Kapki Shot clock winding down at four or a skip for Forte off the shot fake A three wont go Capki the offensive rebound and he backs it out Taves with the hesy ON JONES FOUND SHAW ILL TELL YOU WHAT LUCA Taves is a good player I mean he is a good player Shows you tonight he can shoot it and he is just breaking down this Florida State defense off of the dribble and making some wonderful passes told you coming off his two best scoring games in league play He has done so much recently He really has and he hes really reliable Hes got a three to one assist to turnover on the year Thats two dimes to start this half The one to Capki for the three and then that one right there He looks quick really confident and comfortable with the ball I know you were a big fan coming in Thats what Im trying to love Love him Thank you for the support You said Steve Nash earlier and my heart was fluttering By the way shot clock issue here They they had it at nine Its back up to 27 Fred Payne said to us today about Luca Taves He throws passes nobody else does Right Right And he gets away with them Theyre great passes Your scout once again Mike Monaco on the money Turn the corner Bong Another one of my personal favorites If youre sharing those hell go to the line I tell you what man Theyre making these dunks look pretty Theyre just not making them I mean they go down as missed field goals The Le Jones beauty And then that one right there Tomas Dont call him Thomas Nope Thats Tomas Bassan He drew the third foul by the way on Bowden Capki Got tagged with two but did continue to play some after that in the first half Bang You said it earlier 7 foot3 wingspan When they signed him they knew the jump shot was still developing Jones got the offensive rebound and that is a bas taken by Forte Its a great take by a veteran player a graduate in Chase Forte up against a freshman who just you know and you mentioned the shooting This is the other thing Hes a driver in a straight line He he he doesnt have the shift to his game yet and he just wanted to go through for so back to BC up by a dozen Luca Taves has eight points eight assists already Taves driving on Somerville Why not Off the window Also Nashes Youre blushing Monaco I mean we got you to blush Incredible A block from Shaw on McCrae and Shaws given huge minutes as well Hes got four blocks Taves initiating working on McCrae Turns it over And that little bump there for McCrae got him off balance Good start to this second half for Boston Luca Taves has played well Chase Fortes been better tonight than he has been in a long time And and Fred Payne has been really really good a guy who hadnt been shooting the ball well coming into this game McCrae missed another dunk Theres a foul called and Rob McCrae was looking to bring down the rim Just havent been able to you know been able to finish They get the foul on Payne They say second on Boston Colleges leading score So Rob McCrae to the line Top score for Florida State at 15 a game Started his career of course at Wake Forest then to Jacksonville snorts Hey Wednesday night mens basketball double header for you Clemson squares off with Wake Forest Clemson trying to come back from backtoback losses to Virginia Tech and Duke Then its Virginia and Georgia Tech 9 Eastern here on ACC Network and the app McCrae good on both deficit down to a dozen and fullourt pressure again from Seminals Taves breaks it with Forte Pay around the corner on Swinton Attacks and gets fouled Well get to at the line Just a nice job breaking pressure I mean a oneman press break from Luca Taves early in this and then theyre not getting it over and pulling it out They are attacking and get to the foul line An area where Florida State thats the one area where they have really dominated the night is at the foul line Its been a big day for Fred Payne Told you we enjoyed chatting with him earlier He was telling us how in the offseason he was in at 6 am cheering regularly getting his work said to us to better himself and he said he learned it from Donald Han He said Donald Han is a worker He said Ive never seen anyone work like him So he pushed me to get in the gym more Prepay spent a lot of time watching film this off season Something he hadnt done as much of going into his first two years at BC And its paid off Comes up empty though at the stripe BC two of six on free throws tonight Somerville around the screen back for McCrae Switch from Shaw Rob McCrae the fifth working on Shaw all the way and it rolled off and a late foul called will send Rob McCrae to the line Having to do a lot in isolation Rob McCrae trying to take over here going up against Shaw and like you said the late call there You know its one of those where I think the official that goes in Maybe they beg off the call instead McCrae at the line Rob McCrae in the fifth Dont dont confuse it with the fourth I got a I got something to clarify when when you have something like this or a junior or a third If youre only saying the last name I think you dont need to say the junior or the fifth because its not really part of the last name Its part of the first name Yeah I I Rob the fifth I dont know if I die on that wall with you but I kind of agree with what youre saying If were just saying last name you can just use McCrae Yeah fair enough Griffy not Griffy Jr A trap that Taves gets out of Really important stuff here in Tallahassee BC by 10 5 minutes into the second half at the tuck cheering Some energy in the building trying to spur on the Seinals Kapkey with the shot clock winding down Left hand though followed up by Shaw Couldnt secure it cheering See rebounding Florida State just plus three in this game Theyve got eight offensive rebounds Florida States gone four minutes without a make from the floor Steam the hand off for Somerville No Steen Hes fouled on the rebounding action by Forte Number n Three fouls on Forte So he goes to the bench replaced by the true freshman from Dallas Caleb Steager So three BC players with three each Forte Capki and Hastings Mccra drives off Payne Good hands to take it away What a play by Payne Just pride it free from Rob McCrae Hand off for Taves Got a switch from the athletic AJ Swinton Taves to the elbow Knocks it down We dont even look at the rim until hes ready to shoot it Like hes going to a spot so that he can pull up and take that shot Sophomore from Japan Son of a coach in Japan Hes had a big SECOND SEASON cheering STE PLUS ONE Turnover here for Florida State And a really nice defensive play by Fred Payne to pry that out of the the really strong hands of Robert McCrae the fifth And thats where Taves hes looking right at the spot hes going to so that he can rise up and take that shot And theres Steam on the other end You know Luca Taves a guy mentioned from Japan spent the summer playing with the Japanese national team an experience I think going into his sophomore year when you can play with that level of talent and and be able to play at that level I think really helps him Taves moved into the starting lineup in early December Its been important for the Eagles here the last two weeks Ninepoint game First time its back to single digits since there was 407 to go in the first half A foul comes away from the basketball and goes on I believe Martin Somerville You know the other thing BCs done well tonight Mike is theyve handled this fullcourt pressure I mean there there has not been a lot forced really anything forced in terms of turnovers off of this fullcourt pressure that Florida States tried to throw at BC Its one thing BCs done pretty well under Earl Grant He calls it ball care Theyve limited turnovers Steager the rookie whipped one underneath and a foul here is on the floor drawn by Hastings Its been a pretty good recipe for Grant You know youre always going to get defense pressure and intensity on that end of the floor You make some shots and you protect the basketball Yeah Well you got multiple ball handlers You know Taves has been the primary one but but certainly Fred Payne can bring it up Weve seen Chase Forte do it So youve got three ball handling guards out there Cap Keys on the bench right now with four fouls DC trying to manage that foul trouble See Forte next to him with his three And you do lose the spacing with Capki on the bench cuz Shaw and Hastings are are not shooters Taves into Payne off that baseline out of bounds for Boston College Taves for Payne He rises Couldnt stick it Somerville secures it Bong in transition and a block is called on Luca Tes Its a highspeed collision Well again straight line The song is in a straight line And when you hit that outside shoulder thats going to be a block every time We havent seen a lot though of Florida State a team that you know theyre playing about 78 possess possessions a game Sixth in the country They want to run They have not gotten a lot And what a big missed free throw there Free throws the rest of the way for Florida State BC You see bottom left at 17 fouls with 13 to go Florida State has made a living at the free throw line tonight Taves against pressure from Bong Commits the foul Two on Tomas Bong Swear if youre Florida State though youre now in the bonus Youve got to live driving the ball to the basket Put the pressure on Boston College to have to play you without fouling And like you said Florida State on the year has been a good free throw shooting team A trap on Taves Handled it to Aiden Shaw Taves directing Swinting the switch Now Hastings back cut Payne jump stop jumper No Florida State trying to inch closer Bang walks with it on the tumble and a seventh Florida State turnover Just trying to do too much Just move it You know just move it Hit the open guy You dont hit singles When theyve gotten rotating you ball reversal Theyve been able to get BC in rotation and thats when those drives will come Forte attacks moved it for Steer known for his shot and the freshman knocks it down Get nothing out of this fullcourt pressure and its leading to either layups down back or there a kick out three Somerville dished it for Bong Might have got away with a walk McGee slips like Bong just did He was looking down at the floor Bong does walk with it this time His third turnover Florida State has inched back to single figures but BC got it back up to a dozen before It was sometime in the music second half He called the timeout He said to his staff Im not doing this blank anymore So he kept the staff there till 400 am They watched back the film of the game for 4 hours broke out a few bottles of wine and just threw everything on the table as to what could change with this team Theyve played so much better since but Boston College has been great here on the road tonight Taves off the bounce Good hands from Swinton Five to shoot Taves still WITH IT TOUGH SHOT KNOCKS IT DOWN WOW Just cooking He is cooking right now 14 points eight assists a careerhigh for Luca Taves McCrae wanted it Couldnt get it from Leger Jones McCrae driving on Forte Very sturdy defensively Chase Forte last year at South Dakota Summit League defensive player of the year Super athletic Here he is around the ball screen Steager still on the floor with BC dealing with foul trouble Taves summons Hastings Taves step back short rebound down to Swinton McCrae thought about a deep one Swinton wanted Wiggins Hes got the mismatch with Forte McCrae pulls and sticks They had the matchup You thought he was going to drive him and Hastings did the right thing Just kind of backed off give him an arm and a half and McCrae said Ill Ill take that space 16 from Rob McCrae Florida States only made 12 buckets McCraes got five of them This comes down to stops Mike This comes down to stringing together stops Fort is a guy you want shooting it but how about the effort from Aiden Shaw Hes played one of his best games in a long time A lot of effort dirty work stuff Aiden Shaw with a season high 10 points Hes got six rebounds three blocks at a steel Steager laid shot clock winding down Steager had it blocked by Wiggins Bulls have not had much doing in transition Swint the step through and he gets bodied by Aiden Shaw Second on Chawy Swinton is all right after the hard ball Not a super hard foul The fall looked looked rough though Swinton trying to shake it off sophomore from Maryland 66 7 foot2 wingspan Guy who like Bong has helped turn things around defensively for the Seinals Thursday night 10 Eastern after our womens basketball double header Weve got the Nothing But Net Crew breaks down the night in the ACC Theyve got highlights theyve got analysis and they look ahead to the best matchups for the weekend and early next week right here on ACC Network Its a steely look from Luke LS This team has been down double figures for much of this game and hes looking at a team that he just doesnt recognize from who theyve been And youre trying to figure I think thats part of the reason they have pressed like youre youre trying to pull something out of this team and it it just hasnt come as quickly as I think youre hoping for Boston College only turned it over three times in the first half two here in the second Nice handoff indeed from Forte to Hastings And another breakdown of the defense by these Boston College guards getting into the paint and creating offense for others Season high 17 assists for Boston College Somerville got the switch on the drive for two Second bucket for Martin Somerville who averages nine a game off the bench Still nine minutes to go in Tallahassee Forte underneath and Hastings foul And there again I dont know what Leger Jones is doing Youre youre just like indiscriminately running a trap which BCs easily able to get out of and then theres a breakdown of the defense and youve got a numbers advantage down back I I just theres plenty of time in this game to sit down in your halfcourt defense that has been very good over the last month and get stops And I think theyre just you know creating offense for BC by just being a little bit overaggressive The style of defense tonight from Florida State Is it what it looked like early in the season before they were sitting back and more conservative Its not what it looked like for example against Virginia Okay They came out they were inside that threepoint line or right on that line They were in the gaps They were physical and they were together They look a little bit strung out tonight Mike Hastings misses Bolt So BC two of nine at the free throw line tonight Lets left the door open some for Florida State Somerville cant hit Rebound Forte Forte Hastings Shaw Kane and Steager The five for Earl Grant Heres Steager left alone cant hit and last touched by Hastings Belongs to the Seinals McCrae to the corner Bong He hits First three for the freshman Big shot obviously and a shot that BC is willing to give up Thats a guy you want taking that corner three cheering He had only been hitting 28 from three in this freshman season Hes got Florida State within seven Shaw underneath for Hastings Good catch SOMERVILLE HELPS JONES BLOCKS AND then fouls Hastings And Luke LS Look at the two of them together I mean this is amazing In all seriousness Oh they want me to take my headset off so you can get a pull Lets America rejoices Look at this fade They call this a bald fade Mike usually goes a little higher than most Unbelievable job Greg Dearble Thank you He has cut hair for not just Luke LS since Luke was a player in college by the way Jameus Winston and EJ Emanuel too among many others More missed free throws from DC and Rob McCrae makes it count Florida State as close as it has been since the first seven minutes of the ball game And you could tell Rob McCrae the fifth is feeling this moment Like he is is in this kind of takeover mode That is a heck of a play I mean what what dexterity what spin body control and then to get that up to the basket What a play Last time Florida State was this close it was 138 at the 1330 mark Fresh cut and all Luke Ls team has it down to four with 7 and 12 to go on a 122 run cheering Forte driving hard and he scores it on Steam cheering BCs just getting the match up They they are they know that Florida State is switching one through five So once Forte got Steen on him his eyes lit up and just goes right into the chest and Steen is not a shot blocker even though hes got a little bit of size Nice use of the body to create the angle and a great touch and finish You see back to the left Two of 11 there today They miss another Thats how you lose games Boston College playing with fire in Tallahassee McCrae off that high ball screen Nice find for Steen through the contact Great patience Just stayed with it Capki you know stayed with McCrae a little too long and Steen kept rolling to the front of the rim That was against Capki Back into the game with four fouls cheering Forte around the screen Got the switch from Steen Shaw for pain cheering Shot clock below 10 Forte off the bounce Spinning on Steen Lost the handle and a turnover Somerville nearly bodied Cell Florida State trying to make it a onepossession game McCrae pulls and he buries it Same action That high ball screen Defender went under cheering McQuay said I got you cheering Payne down the lane for two Big answer Big time answer Fred Paynes got 18 to lead four in double figures for Boston College Steen fouled after another high ball screen Robert McCrae the fifth in takeover mode And theres that you know again Capki having to kind of switch and then here the defender goes under McCrae uses the space and right up over the top and then this kind of stops the bleeding Big time answer there by Fred Payne whos had a big big night And you talked about it with Rob McCrae Hes in so many high ball screens Hes involved in the fourth most pick and roll of anyone in the ACC Well and he shows you his his ability to drive it and then his ability to shoot behind it In time Alex Des had a big day as well 12 points eight rebounds Hes drawn seven fouls in this game Florida State 21 of 28 at the free throw line compared to the BC struggles weve mentioned Twopoint game Now they go small defensively you know to try to I think counter what BC has been doing getting Alex Dean in those ball screens and then trying to drive him cheering Five and a half to go in Tallahassee Taves has McCrae on him off the Capi screen Got a switch cheering Capki wanted it Hes got the mismatch with McCrae They couldnt get it to him Taves goes off the bounce Tough shot over the length of Jones Capy tried to save it and finds Somerville MCCRAE IN TRANSITION WIGGINS FOR THE LEAD Long rebound secured by Forte And he is a blur in the open court PLUS THE FOUL WOW Rob McCrae the fifth made a mistake He tried to go after the ball He was the lone guy back Watch Rob McCrae at the top here Tries to go for the steal and like you said a blur right by him Chase Forte to the basket And if youre going to foul him here you cant allow him to get that ball up to the basket if youre Martin Somerville Saw the grimace from McCrae He knew it too when he went for that ball Forte 59 at the line this year Stamps a threepoint play when Florida State had a chance to take the lead What a response Fred Payne And then that play right there by Forte And thats a shot Chanty Wiggins That three in the corner just into the game Thats a shot Hes got a hit So its back to five for Boston College with five minutes to go BC trying to keep pace with the likes of Notre Dame toward the bottom of the ACC to get to the league tournament with a few weeks to go McCrae off the BOUNCE MUSLING ON FORTE SHOT YES Dolen on its way down cheering And he could ch Earl Grant could challenge this if he wants live This thing looked obvious Yeah the Boston College bench is pouring over the iPad I I I think thats a great I agree Doesnt diminish that That was a pogo stick from Aiden Shaw No question And to just kind of palm it Fullourt pressure again from Florida State Theyll kind of back off with some token pressure here Theyre not tra Yeah not trapping out of it If youre just joining us its been a good one in the ACC 14 The largest lead for BC a few different times on one of their best offensive days of the season 11 made threes for the Eagles Late shot clock Luca Taves for Fred Payne Too strong Rob McCrae has led Florida State Hes got 24 points five rebounds four assists and only two turnovers Wiggins The mismatch on Taves cheering Wiggins on the baseline Kicks it out for Swinton YES SIR cheering best against teams that youre supposed to beat as well as BC has played tonight Thats the flip side of it for BC and for Eagles fans This is all too familiar You you make a run you have great moments Youve been in so many close games Got to get the job done cheering Fred Payne talked to us today about finishing How that is the key for this team Taves tried to get it Hes being denied by McCrae Shot clocks at five for Forte off the bounce Cant hit Offensive rebound Taves And a fresh 20 Long shot long rebound guards opportunity for an offensive board Payne with 18 leads the Eagles Hes knocked down four threes Taves has been awesome Captain couldnt finish with the left hand Quiet day for him Hes been mired in foul trouble Florida State has not led since it was 85 in the first three plus minutes of this game Wiggins got it matched up with Shaw Good hands from Shaw Wiggins got it back McCrae for the lead NO OFFENSIVE REBOUND JONES GOT IT TO go with 233 to go Florida States got the lead capping pressure You said it best during break Just theyve allowed the game to come back to them and theyve taken control of it Youve been calling for it that they didnt need to be in it There was so much time to go They finally backed off and now they have the lead What does BC have for an answer A team craving a win like this Its been 2 years since they had an ACC road win Shot clock below 10 Luca Taves on Somerville who didnt bite Payne against Jones Got to get IT UP PAY A FALL AWAY YES screaming WOW Tough shot Fred Payne How about the ability to create the space Wiggins pick and pop Knocks it down Thats his bread and butter Loves the pick and pop And thats what hes in there to do Catch and shoot threes cheering 90 seconds to go from the tuck Pay comes up to get it He and Taves have been the best for BC offensively Taves shot fake STEP THROUGH SCOOPED IT UP AND HAD IT BLOCKED BY JONES GOT TO shoot it You had a shot Too unselfish One too many moves from Luca Taves Thats too unselfish The first shot fake You had a shot Luke L says to get moving in the hands of Rob McCrae Mismatch with Capi CROSSED HIM UP MCCRAE SCORES IT AT THE RIM took his TIME USING THAT CLOCK Knew he had the matchup Knew he was going to go Smooth operator cheering Boston College down five Capi hoist Cant hit McCrae the rebound and a foul on the baseline on Shaw cheering What a comeback by Florida State And in closing time who else but Rob McCrae And how else but out of the pick and roll I mean hes just lived in the pick and roll And theyre just getting his switch And look at this I mean just dealing on Bowden Capsky who has no shot to stay in front and theres no help behind And its been Rob McCrae show Well you think of it from two ways For BC how crushing it would be to lose this game And for Florida State what it would say that on a night you didnt have anything close to your best that you could come back from 14 and withstand 11 made threes when you learn a valuable lesson like youve been playing well Florida State coming off a dominant win in the second half over Virginia Tech but youre not that good where you can just show up no matter who youre playing and and win games you you have got to be theres a certain mindset that Florida State has had and needs to have Rob McCrae at 70 this season Splits sixpoint game Still 37 seconds to go and a couple of timeouts for Boston College Forte into the front court cheering Whatever it is has got to be quick CAPI THE FOLLOW NOT THERE EITHER FOR SHAW cheering Bowden Capki commits the foul and he fouls out of this game with 233 to go cheering Luke LS at one point during shootout today he stopped practice He killed the music that had been playing and he said to his team Lock the heck in We got a game tonight He was coaching the mental as much as anything today And he used the word with us psychology We we are managing the psychology cheering of the game And thats why in conference play especially so much of these games is when you play a team BC only two wins on the season in the league desperate And Florida State feeling good about themselves How do you show up tonight And they did not play well especially in the first half and to start the second half Its two games in a row Florida State puts together a monster second half like they did Saturday in Blackburg Fred Payne runner yes Cuts it to six with 163 to go Earl Grant uses one of his two remaining timeouts What an effort by Florida State today We welcome Swinton runs the baseline got it into Somerville who gets fouled Martin Somerville an 82 free throw shooter for his career Well go to the line You know I I always think in terms Mike too of like what do you do with the tape from this game if youre Luke Laos Theres a lot to learn Like you can learn from losing certainly but if youre Florida State you cant be losing games at this point in the years Theres a lot to learn from this win and and I think Luke Lax is going to take advantage of that because this was again this was a lot about energy about defensive energy to start this game that they just did not have By the way quick programming note If youre looking for Virginia Tech at Miami that has begun on the ESPN app you can watch it there And then we will get you to Coral Gables right when we go final here from the tuck Somerville makes both 15 seconds to go BC down by eight Payne against Wiggins Payne kicks it out for Taves A deep three Comes up short and that will do it in Tallahassee Biggest comeback win of the season for Florida State is complete And another win
