how does he know we dont need that OB BT Smith and Tommy morresy along with the very versatile Ron grber we are underway as North Carolina wins the opening tip and coming off an impressive win against Virginia in which they shot out in front 212 at Chapel Hill on Saturday kiddo gives it up first jumper on the way and thatll be offt Target by Powell whos been in the starting line his last handful of gains for Hubert Davis and back in his natural position on the wing at that small forward position but going up against a Florida State team thats gotten much better here at home starting lives by CDW for the seminal they are actually the second tallest team in America behind the Duke Blue Devils and this guy right here is getting the job done Lee Ying drops a dime recognizing that there will be a double team coming shooting 90 5 in his last two games johnmy Watkins the 67 junr offt Target on that one BEC comes an averaging about 18 points a game look for him if the SS are going to Spring one tonight k and a nice drive will lay it in the sophomore for the first basket and with Florida State we know they switch everything defensively one through five that means its a tough task for you to have to keep k out of the paint Jackson getting Airborne off the 10 and it wont drop in Jaylen Withers with the rebound and he has been the Difference Maker thrown away and a quick turnover Davis running the point tquan Davis just a freshman and thatll be down for Watkins not necessarily a great threepoint shooter 33 but nails that one and hes coming off of a 23point effort at Louisville last time out so starting to play his best offensive basketball as we see a kick ball there but Elliot kadoo with the nice little heesy gets to the rim the easy layup but turns it over on the next possession which leads to the jir wat forgive me jair Watkins Tanya is watching mom is watching my apologies and she made sure I knew to pronounce it jair long jumper on the way and swished in by with his man is he shooting the three these days he really is May four against Virginia on Saturday and hes shooting with a great touch right now seeing a big basket and you see the confidence from him letting it Fly early in possession his last 49 threes the attempts hes hit 32 of them on the Run Carolina po will race sand lay it in and thats North Carolina basketball misses or makes they like to push it in transition an uncharacteristic Miss by Yuan right there leads to an easy bucket for the Tar Hill yeah you want to say Ying but its Yuan as you pointed out the 611 Junior from lawrencville Georgia B bowling into the lane keeps on driving keeps on moving and a foul as well hes 610 the sopore from pront and not a lot of 610 players that can play off the bounce like Taylor Bowen but he reads the miscommunication defensively by the tar Hills no one stepping over and taking and speaking no one stepping over theres not enough space taken away there from Jaylen Withers hes able to knock down the three right over top of you so B Bowen plays excellent defense good shot blocker can hit the three he can do a lot of things Leonard Hamilton says I love his attitude threepoint play and you love his versatility as well makes the free throw but now you see him right at the front of the press and this is where Florida State really is able to dominate games they can turn you over and turn those turnovers into points on the other end of the floor funny how coaches noticed these things Leonard Hamilton was talking about North Carolina and the change as this ones backed up and in they get it inside for Luben the change in the energy and how well theyre playing together he watched some of their game on television the game against Virginia and was very impressed yes he made it very clear to us earlier he said listen i Ive heard a lot of talk about this North Carolina team but its not the team that I saw po after the turnover kdo has issues with turnovers hes turned it over 93 times this season but when hes attacking aggressively and looking to score hes a different player even though he doesnt make that shot most of the time when Ellie kadoo is in the paint hes looking to pass the basketball which forces some of those turnovers when he attacks and scores not only does he give himself a chance but he also gives his teammates an opportunity to offensive rebound P did a great job getting in front of the point guard Davis who wanted that lane very badly its another thing the heels are doing much better defensive intensity on the Baseline and a foul here as Withers went up trying to swwa that away and committed the foul and a 96 lead here for the tar Hills in the opening moments but this is the calling car for Florida State you look at the Steals and the blocks aka the stocks first in the ACC in both categories first and turnovers Force per game and when you look at the way that theyre playing this has happened in the ACC although theyre seven and N theyve been much better if they were playing the same way in November and December we will be talking completely different about this Florida State team this season might say the same thing about North Carolina thats very true of course they had an absolutely brutal schedule with a lot of close losses Watkins at the line 74 and certainly on his way to earning a spot on an all ACC team was all ACC a season to go and even better this year has found a great career at Florida State over a th000 points in his two seasons here in tah remember last year in the ACC tournament got buried a little bit but he had a 34point game against Virginia Tech yes I mean he can he can get hot quickly and especially here on this floor hes had tremendous success fou across Court youngster Jackson into the game backs it out he has been really hot beond the threepoint line shot clock is down to eight here for the tar Hills Davis wants to drive it gives it up Jackson down to one in the shot clock K did not see it and thats going to be a shot clock violation that is an awesome display of defensive principles and effort when this game came up there was no way I was going to miss our last big Monday with j Leonard Hamilton playing against the North Carolina Tar Hills the team that he grew up watching growing up in Gastonia North Carolina growing up watching the Carolina blue no way would I miss this opportunity to hang out with you of course our great producer Kim belt Michael Griffin our great director no way Im missing this one OB just glad you made it my man its amazing with a travel schedule which by the way is really nothing new no for you during basketball season youre going to call over a 100 games heres Davis get look at the shot clock hell drive it and off the iron and a whistle too and a foul will go against Florida State 156 to go here in the first half and a onepoint edge here for Carolina big 12s top team number four Houston taking on number 10 Texas Tech tonight and we cap the night with Kansas and Colorado in Boulder at 1100 Eastern time in the top 25 today for the first time in about four years you did not see Kansas they were outside the top 25 that one drilled home out of the corner by Seth Trimble we saw that a couple of seasons ago the preseason number one North Carolina Tar Hills not in the top 25 now we see that with Kansas two years later and the difference is the competition that theyre playing against everyone is caught up nil as we see dant Davis knocked down the three ball nil has bounced the playing field Obi and so when you look at the parody amongst teams in all the major conferences whether its the ACC this the Big 12 even the SEC theres so much parody because nil has leveled of playing field not all the talents going to the Blue Bloods anymore guys are finding whats the best fit for them and as sad as it is to say often times where theyre going to make the most money yeah when you say theyre not all going to the Blue Bloods anymore Hubert Davis would be the first guy to tell you thats true yes yeah and part of the reason why Hubert Davis has made it very clear they need a general manager to help with their roster management and find the right players to where the Carolina blue I dont understand why every single major School in the country doesnt have one its coming Powell up top tremble got shut down kicks it out shot clock to 11 for the heels Jackson number two score for North Carolina with eight on the shot clock and a whistle and a foul here with 1419 to go Leonard Hamilton 76 years old the alltime winning as coach at FSU number five all time of the ACC 199 regular season ACC wins going into play tonight Tribble gave up the dribble pass just got to PO barley and heres Davis been pretty quiet the last couple of games hell draw the foul B bow and the 610 sophomore hit him and hell pick up the personal so a bit of a bail out there with that shot clock winding down yeah B Bowen really just crowding the space did not want RJ Davis to be able to reject the screen and beats him tries to get his body in position but RJ so quick makes it difficult to beat him to the spot so shot clock resets to 20 and this is a lineup weve seen much more of as of late RJ Davis with the ball in his hands at the point guard position with Elliot kadoo out of the game to be able to get the Freshman Drake Powell and Ian Jackson on the floor together Pow with some great dribble action there almost made the shot he takes the foul he is just a marvelous marvelous athlete he really is and his ability to be able to play on the perimeter is now starting to be showcased you see he has the AB ility to go off the bounce showing off the TW TW the nice cross the HEI the left hand to the rim unable to get it to go but gets the free throws gets the foul but more importantly hes playing against like sized players hes been playing against much bigger players the majority of the Season at the four spot now moving him back to his natural three has allowed him to be successful freshman from Pittsboro North Carolina grew up wanting to play in this Carolina blue and is living out his dream being able to play for the North Carolina Tar Hills hes on the draft boards OB but I would love to see him come back and do it again next year could be a very very exciting thing if he does he will step off the floor here and Withers back on the 69ine grd from Charlotte and this is what North Carolinas been doing much more of as well pressing after free throws and trying to speed up their opponent into a quick shot AJ SW Quinton into the game Big drive here by Watkins in a foul coming off 23 as Cory mentioned on Saturday the transfer from VCU he can pile up points and one things for certain Leonard Hamilton absolutely is in it to win it he wants to win every game and hes not taking this you know this opportunity for granted he continues to talk to us about how blessed he is to have been put in every situation hes been whether its you know being the first black player at University of Tennessee Martin wherever it may be he talks about how gracious he is to be in the position but hes made it very clear he wants to win out he wants to win every game he wants the season to go on as long as it possibly can I said what are you going to do when its over as far as a coach when you retired what are you going to do he said Im going to take lessons I want to learn how to play the guitar I want to learn how to play the piano I I want to learn how to sing and he came over over and he was singing to us I said Leonard you can already sing he said no no I I need someone to teach me how to really sing cuz hes been hes been singing in church since he was like three four years old yeah well even earlier than that we got a picture of him hes on his way to church I dont think hes even two but when you talk about Coach ham he owns a gospel recording label and when you think about that music is part of his life and so he now wants to be a musician after of course what I think is a Hall of Fame coaching career he has his team tied 13 with the tar Hills Trimble wants to drive it stepping through the lane and Scoops it in this is the SE Trimble we watched early in the season he was their best player without RJ Davis he had 33 against Memphis in the exhibition and he was their best player in Maui hes starting to get back in that Rhythm after missing games du the injur strong 63 guard Applause Music Austin H over the top and the slam Dro down by maluk the seven foot freshman out of Baldwin Pennsylvania but the nice find from hul getting into the paint and just throwing it up allowing his teammate to be able to go finish it off easily great vision by hul hold to 60e man Davis has it knocked away hul got a hand on it shot clock to 10 Davis very quiet game against Virginia 3 for 14 shooting tough drive there as he goes down and takes the foul that was with four on the shot clock set tremble off the bounce crafty he got the match up against a much taller player but you see the Euro with the nice kiss off the glass but on the other end of the floor Boston H throwing it up to where only his teammate is able to finish Above the Rim tying the the game at 15 so Davis to the line at 88 RJ a graduate from weight Plains New Applause York just about automatic at the stripe V Allen Luben 68 Jr now on for Hubert Davis and Jaylen Washington will take a seat Davis just 12 points against Virginia the average is 17 and he hits the pair and kdo back on to run the point and Davis will take a rest and once again North Carolina after the free throw picking up with that diamond pressure one two one1 you got Withers on the ball its 69 great size theyll look to get a trap see if they can force a turn over but thats the one place you cant now the ball to go is right into the middle of the floor Jackson out of the double got that three to Swinton Jackson with a pull up from 15 and nothing but net I love the growth of Chandler Jackson has been here his entire career nows a junior at Florida State and continues to get a bigger and bigger role each and every time hes their most experienced player Ian Jackson stepping back back off the fake he drives the lane oh beautifully done but it was great ball movement after Jackson gets his defender in the air passing it and getting it right back from kadu gives up the dribble back for Jerry D whos 69 69 610 7 ft all over the place for FSU swin with a turnaround thats a sweet shot oh Id love to see that going his mom Danielle is locked in watching the game she already let me know say say hi to my baby for me and Im telling her make sure your baby does something nice as he just did double way downtown cant hit it tied at 19 so the seminal trying to grab the lead here on their home floor on a big Monday Obie think about the big Mondays weve had in this building the matchups weve seen with Coach Ham on the side line and now hes looking for his 200th ACC win here on big Monday but he talks about his being a man of Faith hes been about it for a very even more so today theyre up and positive because theyre coming off of three straight wins and they love the way theyre playing as a team right now now those wins against Syracuse NY State and Virginia talking the bottom third of the conference but with this style of play and this one will stay on this end with 10 51 to go the officials actually Ron Grover and Tommy morsey looking at each other not certain as to who that went off of but its Carina yeah its going to be off Carolina ends up being Florida State ball doing the job defensively in the full core pressure Watkins great fake and inside up and in by you and we havent called his name very much hes 14 and eight so hes a Difference Maker yeah but OB look at this pressure as soon as they score this is the Florida State team were used to seeing theyre up on the basketball playing at least 10 guys everyone pressuring 94 ft and of course the ability to be able to switch defensively on the other end trible deep in the corner Kad with lifts its been an issue this season when he gets an open look like that teams can sag off of him and thats what people are trying to do is force him to shoot the ball from the outside a beautiful find from Ying as John M Walkins is unable to catch that upset with himself because he was already thinking about how he was going to dunk in OB not if but how yeah however this Carolina season has explained the threepoint issues something that until recently had become a giant problem for them have they corrected those well this guy has done a much better job shooting and although hes unable to get that one going Jaylen Withers helps them and and Jackson shooting the basketball much better as of late as well Watkins did not turn it over Yan uhoh slamming that one nobody bothered to pick him up and its 61 he flushed it and but you see Yan has a lot of ability being able to handam the basketball is kadoo is able to use two Florida State players as their own screen to be able to get the easy one miscommunication defensively in the painted area the You by two and the ball Le you on the dribble and Watkins has to give him space when you got a guy shooting 95 oh beautiful F and a great hook pass downstairs for D but thats what coach was talking about his passing ability and you love the way that his teammates are moving they know theyll get the basketball Ying is a willing pass Jackson flips the pass K again and round and out and itll be slammed in by Luben and thats one of the areas where Luben has been able to help this Carolina team on the offensive glass and having get Second Chance points Watkins weaving his way in and a strong move to the hole so he is starting to pick up his scoring Pace tonight again 18 points a game coming in Jackson will knocked out one back from the corner no hesitation at all but Ian Jackson OB he is ready to fire as soon as he catches the basketball and when you shoot as well as he does I understand Carolina now dropping back into a Zone defensively Jackson had hit 10 of his previous 15 threes before that so hes been absolutely cooking get it in deep and now outside for D got it nothing but net We Know Dan can shoot the basketball and right now its a flow going offensively the Simo have made their last five field goals and North Carolina operating very well offensively as wello that one clangs away they leave him wide open once again hes missed three of the and K with that much space he can still penetrate he doesnt have to stay on the perimeter hes got a running start to be able to attack misses again inside and its Withers for two and a whistle so theyre able to clean it up a couple of times after the long Miss and get the offensive board as a year goes along you got so many new pieces new faces and new places and now you see the potential of these two teams unfortunately the fact that its so late now it makes it difficult for them to be able to get into the NCAA tournament and when you want to talk about when you want to talk about Elite of the elite thats a Heisman sweatshirt I mean again very few people have those especially NBA players that have Heisman sweatshirts and Heisman Trophies now that might be the height of cool to be able to pull that off on the Baseline FSU with a strike they continue to make shots theyve hit 10 of their last 11 and Florida State right now getting to job done on the offensive end of the floor and its you can tell how they pick up their defensive pressure when things are going well for them offensively Davis with the Kick K Tyson into the game to do exactly that try and make three pointers a whistle and a foul on the deck as Ron Gro Blows the Whistle and our super Tuesday mens basketball lineup coming your way Cooper flag and number two Duke in Miami at 7 Eastern on ESPN Baylor Cincinnati on ESPN 2 at n Mark Sears and number six Alabama taking on number 24 Mississippi State Duke moving up to the number two spot in todays poll Auburn remaining the number one team of the country and as mentioned Kansas tumbling out of the top 25 and Cooper flag this season had that freshman record against Notre Dame 11 times the ACC rookie of the week I believe thats the record now that is the record now pass Applause was it Kenny Anderson or Tyler hansboro who was at 10 but of course as shoe in for ACC rookie of the year the question is will he be the ACC Player of the Year as a number of Duke freshman have been in the past as we said just renamed the award after him after Cooper flag at this point Davis b b great fate drives it can hit the shot and here comes Jackson on a dribble and blocked out of the sky by Watkins I tell you what that was two athletic plays the athleticism by Ian Jackson to get there and then johir Watkins cleaning it off the glass never gave up on the play Ian Jackson showcasing his speed watch how hes able to get through traffic through all the white jerseys however jir Watkins cleaning it up not allowing the bucket showing off Elite athleticism from both players but Watkins winning that battle great hustle play and itll be Davis at the line the Freshman from Baltimore who will sink number one he makes 82 at a 10 assist game against Miami he can really dish it he absolutely can he and AJ switon were actually teammates at Team Takeover for their 16 newu year these guys were Elite playing against each other that team ended up winning peach jam and then went on to Win It 17 peach jam as well under my God aill Jones Davis pretty good rebounder too yes he is very good rebounding for a guard and thats one of the areas you know coach ham doesnt normally take small guards but when you rebound the way Davis does that means you can play a smaller guard because he plays much bigger than the statue several years I didnt think he took a player under 610 heres Tyson 0 for two coming off the bench itll be tipped out of play with 550 to go and FSU leading by three Hubert Davis quite a battle on his hands tonight yes he does and he knew that was going to be the case coming in here and weve got a late arriving crowd but theyre starting to fill in as the fans here of Florida State basketball starting to celebrate each and every time theyre going to see Jay Leonard Hamilton on this court Davis with a long one and a threepointer for RJ Davis they kind of needed that and ties the game at 34 they really do and Carolina staying in the zone defensively having a hard time dealing with the simol manto man Davis again got a look that wont drop for him rebound fell right into the hands of Jaylen Washington Davis wants to run kicks it back out Jacksons open he doesnt miss many of those Tyson big board right back up for two and nice production from Tyson getting into the game off the bench missed the three in the corner because I its going to be tough for anybody to beat the Blue Devils in Charlotte lets start with that so even if youre in the 89 match up when you win its going to be difficult going up against the number one seed Blue Devils if they go on to win the ACC title I forgive you for missing me on that one because it was like your seventh game in seven days downstairs Jackson nice little onehander and great passing against the Zone by the semal theyve settled for a number of Threes but the way theyre shooting the basketball you dont have a problem with that just like Huber Davis has no problem with Jaylen Washington knocking down the trail three he wants him to take more he really does and he talked about when he came in how great of a shooter he was and he felt as though he would be able to add that punch hasnt worked out well for him throughout his career but a big one on the last possession fou with 418 left here in the first half of Tallahassee the art of sharing the basketball well you want to be able to get the basketball into those tight spots against the zone as you move around the outside the drop down into that short corner and the nice touch by Chandler Jackson they say this the hardest shot in the game Im not sure because this right here may be a little more difficult but no problem for Jaylen Washington at the top of the key foul went against RJ Davis to put Jackson at the line at 74 former Tennessee Mr basketball out of Memphis and another one coming for Chandler hey who got new I always tip my hat to the guys who stayed the course again Chandler Jackson now in his third year at Florida state has stayed here throughout you know turmoil they havent been their best over the last two seasons but I love the way that hes committed to this program and to coach Hamilton and staying and giving his all each and every time Ill play through injuries whatever it may be and now finding success in the starting lineup for Coach extend of course these days is two years right yes it is Washington picks up the dribble he needs help back off for Jackson shot clock to nine Jackson on the Baseline with a kick and was it touched its going to go the other way he just threw it out of play the officials did look at each other for a bit but it will be different versatile players for the semal they getting that short Corner coach you know its difficult to cover up that spot Carolina by three Florida state with the ball Watkins 18 points five rebounds game hes going to play in the NBA he will play in the NBA this young man was in the NBA Combine last season as he knocks down to three he knew you were talking about him but was that the combine last year decided to come back to school and I think it was a great decision as many of the NBA Scouts in the building tonight will see that you got a complete player in jir Watkins with great size and ability Davis sh running to D and a great job to stop him FSU able to collapse defensively Jamir finding his spot on the perimeter no hesitation and this is one of the things the scouts wanted to see from him could he shoot the basketball and part of the reason why Florida State leads the ACC and blocks is because they have so many different players contributing nice hesitation there by Kate Tyson whos made a couple of shots in close yes very good minutes from K Tyson as Watkins lines up another three unable to get that one to go but I love the confidence of jir Watkins shooting the basketball he didnt do that a season ago tyon off the fake wont shoot it now Davis calling out a play here for North Carolina trying to pick up their 18th win their fourth in a row Davis stops fires and a miss rebound tapped out and saved by Applause Jackson and 15 to get off a shot now he will bounce it outside here for Tyson off the fake long one he drills it a twopointer we watched Tyson miss the first one but then we saw him get the layup and after he gets a layup now that confidence kicks in easy to knock down that three on the next opportunity we had a two a twopointer they call the toe on the Applause line Davis as we approach the twominute mark Jackson with the feed and it will miss that shot inside and tipped out off of Applause FSU seals coming in 16 and 11 they took a loss against Louisville on Saturday and coming up we continue to recognize the iconic status of Leonard Hamilton 76y old head coach stepping down at the end of the season season hell be honored with a huge ceremony on March 8th which will become Leonard Hamilton day here in tallah Davis on the spin and nail it but a whistle as he got hit hell take the foul thats with a minute 40 all the time but I used to come out before the games of like you remember the days of the great Larry Rose dick paparo Lenny ws and I would go to them before the game and say hey guys just so you know if I miss a shot it was a fact dont worry about blowing the whistle everyone will understand it didnt work for me but at least I tried it didnt work but its a pretty good argument at least to lay the groundwork anyway Davis at the line makes it 4539 North Carolina with a 6 nothing run look at the alltime scorers inside the ACC number two alltime RJ Davis continues to move up that list here number five for him Washington with the catch will lay it in and a beautifully Run Drive by North Carolina absolutely OB Drake Powell dropping the dime I didnt even see that one coming normally I can spot where theyre going with the basketball but Drake pal even fooled me with that no look bad so all of a sudden North Carolina getting a little bit of wiggle room Watkins trying to fight past Davis Davis picks up the foul Drake pal showing off his skill in transition OB he knew where he was going with that basket ball probably 10 steps prior however allow Jaylen Washington to get in the right spot and then admires his work on the way back down the floor Carolina an8 nothing run now and piling up points here right before the break and Watkins to the line transfer from VCU at a 30point game against rice 29 against Tain 26 against pit he can really score he can absolutely fill it up and again rarely do you see guys get the type of minutes that he gets in a Leonard Hamilton system so it shows you how great conditioned athlete Watkins is to be able to play this style of play but for long stretches as coach ham is trusted him with more Applause minutes coach ham got the scowl going right now asked him earlier today can anyone take over the scy he said maybe its my former for player Hubert Davis who played for me with the Washington Wizards back in the 2201 season could be he might be a little too nice I dont know you think too nice with the Scout but coach ams really nice he is too yes doesnt always look it on the sidelines but you know hes actually a delightful guy oh yes both of them are but Hubert Huberts thing is to pull off the glasses and then go all bbies on you thats Hubers thing you know thats about as bad as going to get for Huber but once he brings off the glasses and nicely sits them down hes upset I love the story Hubert was talking about today when he got to play for Coach ham in the NBA the oneyear lonard coached in the NBA he got traded from Dallas to Washington walked into the locker room and the first thing that Leonard Hamilton said was can you play point guard because youre starting tonight oh wow that was quick was your was a great shooting guard and Washington will nail that North Carolina on top 49 to 41 and 44 seconds before halftime dang outside up top for Watkins Watkins around the screen airborne and hits it tough shot yes roin continues to show his scoring prowess and that strong body to be able to get into the interior finish through contact and the clock didnt stop theyre going to have to go back and look at that but well be back at 30 seconds with the Tar Heels a sixpoint lead looking to get the last shot for the half the whistle to make sure so this great officiating staff that we have except for Burke Smith even though he is a great official I just like to give him a hard time so I got to say that all right anything rarely weird happens I dont think Berts going to come over and say hello he already knows I tell him before every game tell your family not to watch today Im going to say bad things about you last seconds before halftime in Tallahassee ellot kadoo on the drive got tripled up and thatll do it as they turn it over right before the break nearly turn it over 11 seconds still on the clock here 4943 in a turnover and a second shot clock violation defensively for the simol but this is something Obi we know everyone practices Chandler Jackson has too much space you give him this space we know they work on this at the end of shoo round dont ex we could very well see Jackson knocked down this half court shot now you see hu D was pushing up his team not allowing him to get that look theyre going to back Withers off to give dang a little more room to get it in still time for a heave here do get it in s with a long one but its going to be well short and thats how the first half finally comes to an end with North Carolina on top 4943 against Leonard Hamilton and the seminal wasnt played because of Co just to see how deep they I mean that team could have won a national title and that was a team that was coming off of sweet 16 and Elite 8 in the previous year so definitely a team that was capable of winning a national championship underway here in the second half Watkins leading away with 18 for FSU in the first 20 minutes lben will commit the foul as we are underway here in the second half North Carolina dominating on the glass cut into the lead yeah you missing a pair Applause nice feed P of the stuff something Carolina has turned up a notch their passing game theyve turned up their passing game but also Drake pal dunking that home if he lays that up its another block for the seal he understands his assignment you got to dunk it on the drive Bowen will be fouled on the play 5143 heres our slam cam great execution by the tar Hills jayen Withers It Was Made Easy by the great cut of Drake pal going to the rim doesnt Fade to the corner and pal finishing strong to avoid the shot blocking of the S Taylor ball Bing at the line 610 sophomore number three in the conference in blocks you can see why as he drops in number 1 76 at the line had four blocks against pit he can be a defensive Menace Leonard has always had a couple of guys like that those Rim protectors yeah absolutely but again when youre able to guard on the perimeter play on the wing and still be a rim protector that makes you even more versatile and those are the type of players that coach ham has been able to build this program with this team gave up a lot of points though in the first half to North Carolina 49 yeah both teams shooting over 55 in the first half rarely do you see that in the college game right now we had great offense and many May contribute that to the defense wasnt as good but it was not a lot of very good shot making from both these teams in the first half pow in for Kad K over the top and a slam Luben will stuff it down that was too easy it was very easy not much resistance at The Rim but both Defenders had to take away Elliot Kad making the opportunity to find Luen up top very simple heres Watkins Watkins on the Move midrange jumper short fisu and a man down pile to the other end of the floor a quick strike and Yan down in the back court Tommy morsy blowing the whistle after the bucket as Yuan limps over to the sideline man hes in pain the 611 Jor in real agony and thats a big loss for the seminal thats 14 points8 rebounds a game one of their best players at 24 against Miami take a look as you see turns that right ankle trying to roll to the rim gets caught up with Drake pow stepping on the foot look at the right ankle right there turns stays down behind the play and then tries to get up limps over to the bench on one foot but once he gets there insignificant pain and just stays on the floor mentioned at Miami game where had 24 he was 10 for 10 from the floor in that game the first SEMO ever to do that in an ACC game and then backed it up going nine of 10 the next game against Louisville so 95 from the field in two games combined Im Im not sure how many times thats happened in the history of college basketball someone to shoot that well over a two game stretch youre talking L alender Bill Walt UCLA stuff yeah all right he needs a lot of help just to get off the floor well get you an update on Malik Yuan as soon as we can very talented player and a big loss for FSU tonight as they already Trail here by 10 and he is off to the locker room 1831 to go in the game 19 points against Louisville the 24 against Miami as you mentioned that is 19 out of 20 and we see the scowl once again from coach ham and and I wont say his name but a good friend of mine gave me another name that could take over the scy one Dennis Gates who was under the coach Hamilton coaching tree and doing a tremendous job at Missouri right now has a very good scowl on the sideline our ESPN Thursday Prime Time womens basketball double header gets underway at 7 Eastern number eight North Carolina number 16 Duke and then its sixth rank South Carolina theyre in Oxford to take an Old Miss should be a great ACC sec double header getting very close to tournament time for the women as we see dcoin Davis inside able to get into the paint and finish with the soft touch but it will be March Madness soon for the ladies on ESPN and I think its going to be a great NCAA tournament theyre lot of schools that could win it the flip over the top that wont drop people tend forget about UCLA Im not not exactly sure why but they continue to pick up great wins that one knocked down by RJ Davis and RJ Davis now with multiple threepointers which weve seen from him for the majority of the past two seasons and RJ Davis starting to shoot the basketball heating up here on the road largest lead of the ball game and Carolina has it 58 47 stolen away by CAU kdo on the Move hell drive it back out for Davis and he will wisely set it up shocked to see Kad not get that one all the way to the rim and Lay It Applause Up Kad left open again this one he Nails the threepointer and you have to imagine there was a conversation from Hubert Davis to ellot kadoo at halftime shoot the ball with confidence if youre going to shoot it step up and shoot it with confidence took a couple shots in the first half that didnt look confident at all but you see the difference in the conversation at halftime and what it looks like the Blue Devils at home and were still waiting to hear word on the health of Malik Brown because we know Duke is great as they are theyre not the same without Malik Brown and so when you see that coming in and the guar Hills are a different team going into that game than they were going into Cameron Indoor a couple of weeks ago Watkins takes the bump and so is 1641 remaining in his contest tempis UT Trail 6147 and Watkins will head to the foul line where he hits 74 as mentioned the seals are the second tallest team in the country behind only Duke they have 10 players who are 67 or taller five who stand 610 or taller by the way right behind him Elon that size has not meant a rebounding Advantage though the seminal are about even with their opponents on the glass this year yeah and that and thats been one of the things Florida state has always been a better offensive rebounding team than they have been a defensive rebounding team thats one of the things thats hurt them over the tenure but a lot of it has to do with they switch so much defensively often times youve got your best rebounders on the perimeter trying to guard guys and so when youre having your smaller guys even though theyre only theyre still 65 but your smaller guys trying to keep the big guys off the glass thats hurt them a little bit on the defensive rebounding on the offensive rebounding and the second chance Point starting to wear down FSU in a big way in Carolinas favor Davis looking to heat up here in the second half steps back now moves forward what a great dig cant convert that underneath but a whistle and a foul against FSU but you love the play by RJ Davis of course hes one onone hes in his bag maluk is doing a very good job defensively in front of him but its not be selfish take a shot its make the best play for your team you give my Luke a lot of credit for staying in front of one of the toughest guards in the ACC but RJ still dropping the dime and hes done a very good job of that Distributing the basketball five assists for RJ Davis and we talked about Coach Hams time with the Washington Wizards of course the president at the time was the guy on the right shoulder happy birthday the goat turned 62 a couple of weeks ago and talking of course of the greatest of all time Michael Jordan who is that possible that he is 62 he is 62 yes look looks like hes about 37 you know he probably could still get a bucket yeah I would not bit against that ever Davis cant sink it rebound tipped twice comes right to Powell he wants to drive it right downhill and SWOT it away andu said no no no but the best part about it OB Chandler Jackson doesnt foul because he knows help is on the way he gets back we hear from RJ Davis in our wooden watch brought to you by Music principal my contribution to team success makes me a perfect candidate for the Winward because Im all about the model we over me I believe in you cant really reach all your individual goals and achievements without putting the team first um and that allows you to be the great person the great teammate uh for the better success so Im all for the team and vote for me for the winning Awards look back at his career we mentioned this the other day during the Virginia game just outstanding I mean player of the year hes won the West award as best shooting guard hes doing a lot more Distributing here recently looks like a pure point guard yeah what I loved about the clip was it showed him passing the basketball more and practice more so than his scoring but of course right now the fourth leading score in the history of the ACC will become third is right on the hills of dicki HR in second all time at University of North Carolina I dont know if he gets there to Psycho T Im not sure he catches psycho but when you think about RJ Davis you know his jersey will hang in the Raptors will go down as one of the greatest North Carolina basketball players of all time which says that a lot when you consider the tradition of that program I think you and I have had you know four or five of the best games he has ever had in a Carolina uniform including the 42 against Miami the Smith Center record when he pulled that off and just couldnt miss yes he absolutely has had a number of Great Performances in front of us but maybe his best was in the NCAA tournament when he goes for 30 to help get a team to the final four and of course losing a barn burner to Kansas in a national championship game in 2022 Davis off the weave cant hit it follows his own Miss back up he goes hell draw the foul but thats what you were talking about before his rebounding ability for a small guard you you dont see many point guards going in getting offensive rebounds but Davis understands where its coming off the rim is able to go chase it amongst the trees and be able to try to get finish it off get to the free throw line but you see Davis with the pull up they say whoever misses the shot normally knows where its coming off I was normally trying to run back the other way I felt like all of them were going in OB yes Shooters shoot man Yan coming back on I this is a great sign he turned the right ankle and the fans very appreciative of him getting back on the floor yes tremendous Ovation here to see him back on the court after turning that ankle of course recognizing how important he is to the success of the S Squad yeah you said when he went down even though it looked bad he said Ive seen far worse and you thought he was likely to return yeah then we saw him back in the tunnel working on it and you could tell how important it was for him to get back on the court and again we know how these this team is playing for Coach H each and every game becomes extremely important for them right now especially on their home floor to try to walk away with the win theyve given great effort been difficult to stop North Carolina on the defensive end of the floor however conversely theyre all critical for North Carolina trying to get back into the NCAA tournament picture going to work it deep inside for Washington and after you switch defensively theres always going to be an opportunity to look for the big guy that time jayen Washington keeps it high and is able to finish off with the easy layup Watkins Slams on the brakes Thomas will swing it Jackson beyond the threepoint line where hes just 6 for 35 shot clock down to 11 Chandler Jackson lost the handle but he was hit two that was with eight on the shot clock Drake Powell watching the big screen up top on the Jumbotron and saying thats not a foul it did look pretty clean from Drake pow but of course were blocked off by a number of big guys in our way OB we didnt have a great look at it aier Booka another sevenfooter will hit the floor out of ball in Pennsylvania for FSU and and Yuan goes back to the bench is being talked to by his coaching staff and frustrated Im not sure if the ankle felt good enough for him to continue playing and theres a fine line between trying to you know gut it out but also hurting your team if you cant do the job youve got to allow your teammates to be able to come in its Chandler Jackson Sprints to the bathroom as we watch Yan and how he turned the ankle as Yan now is headed to the locker room as well oh what a drive by Trimble he took on the whole team he can do that OB his athleticism hes going to be able to compete with anybody anytime he steps on the court coming in with 12 points six rebounds a game Seth tremble well Luke tried to hand it off but barely did get to Thomas shot clock inside 10 and itll roll home and Thomas using his side on the interior over a smaller RJ Davis going to the left hook RJ made it very difficult to get there but Thomas able to finish it off with two Trimble again and hit the shot lets see if they count that p s up for the sideline saying count it its not the NBA you dont get that but you see theres the foul on the perimeter and in the NBA this absolutely would be a continuation but in college basketball that does not exist youll take it out under the basket but still great concentration by Seth Trimble Davis does get it in for POW under 14 minutes to go here in Tallahassee and and right now if youre Jaylen Washington you dont want to bring the screen out there because you allow jir Watkins to get back in position to guard RJ Davis Jackson shot clock to three on the spin Music rebound tipped two or three times and controlled by the nolles Watkins out of the pack with it hell give it up theyll lift it very quickly and knocked home by Jerry D thats how you get back into it get stops on one end make bre on the other it can make a lead disappear very quickly 6758 and a whistle off the ball there BT Smith Watkins with the head up finding Deng whos able to knock down the three ball and Florida State able to pick up their pressure as the fans react bringing back to high five OB we havent seen it in a while but however its still alive here in Tallahasse Davis in the back court now Florida state with a flurry showing some life some energy pal dubing it downstairs and a foul Washington went up for the slam and Malo got in the way and prevented the dunk Drake Pals did a great job of finding Washington over the top when you see the switch hes done a great job of putting the basketball in position for Washington to be able to catch and try to finish we saw them connect on a high low earlier and then once again Drake pow finding washingt over top this time its a f Malo send Washington to the free throw line he makes 67 the 610 junor from Gary Music Indiana and number one is short and coming up next the big 12s top team number four Houston will take on number 10 Texas Tech we cap the night with Kansas and Colorado in Boulder at 11 Eastern OB youre a historian can you name me probably the worlds greatest entertainer from Gary Indiana the worlds greatest entertainer from Gary Indiana that would have to be Michael that Jackson that would absolutely be Michael Jackson from the G also the home of the big dog Glen Robinson rather gifted family yes it was Thomas heres Swinton to launch in and out from threepoint land second effort Thomas with another cant train that FSU all over the glass and a foul well the seminal Relentless in a rebounding prey this looks like a team thats playing for its coach OB this looks like a team that once a win here on their home floor look at the offensive rebounding by the semal they didnt have one in the first half and they get multiple on this one possession Alone look at the white jerseys on the interior of course the size Matters the second tallest team in the country and theyre Flex their muscle right now on the offensive glass Ian Jackson with a foul now Balo hits that and just like that Hubert Davis responds getting jayen Withers at 69 back on the floor to try to help with that rebounding maluk received his first scholarship offer from FSU and he was in the eighth grade and the Freshman rattles thaten home great lineage you would expect for him to be good comes from a great blood line of Hooper OB well this is impressive and a bunch of very talented Applause bigs too off to Withers he swing it Jackson from the corner off the side of the back cour but giv Swit a lot of credit for getting over there contesting that shot we know how well Jackson been shooting the ball Thomas with the dish and the Slam by Malo great play and here come the NOS great play by switon attacking dropping it off and Co ham using the entire Arsenal playing 10 Gods trusting The Freshman AJ Sinton to make plays as he does on the last possession sixpoint game Watkins getting ready to check back in for FSU withs off the fake Airborne draws the whistle and hell be headed to the line with 11 and 12 to go and Florida State says its the most important thing that hes done in his life and this St man has accomplished a lot I think its fair to say hes done a couple things but to make sure that he knows that thats the most important thing that he has done in his entire life yeah really considers that his legacy more than coaching more than what hes done as a broadcaster thats going to be his legacy and hes in over 13 hall of fames its 13 to 15 we lost count and there are probably more that he will be in the Hall of Fame as well weve had so much fun working with him on his incredible return a big scrum here with 11 and a half to go in Tallahassee North Carolina leading at 6862 how about this now Malik Yuan who is out with that ankle injury and he comes out for the Huddle he can barely put any pressure on that thing needing help just to get back to the bench and Obi he went back in the tunnel we thought he was going to the locker room he went back in the tunnel and sat on the chair just to himself and tried to talk himself into being able to go back in but I can tell you leak sometimes it just doesnt work Ive been in that situation before as much as he wants to help his team in this one the best thing that he can do is be there to support them on the sideline cheer them on because going out back on the court would only hurt them snon just a 61 foul shooter Music Applause missing so Kad will set it up here for Carolina see the space theyre giving kadoo still trying to invite him to shoot the three they hit one Trimble will hit this one from way downtown you definitely dont want to invite Seth Trimble to shoot the three because hes done it very well this season knocking down his second of the E Watkins gives it up Airborne off the window it wont go for maluk but hell draw the Music foul and at this point of the game Florida State can no longer afford to trade threes for twos as North Carolina starting to heat up from Beyond The Arc youve got to find a way to force them off that threepoint line and to try to go in and score over your Applause size foul on Luben putting Swinton I should say maluk at the line and now Kate Tyson will come on for Hubert Davis and the seven foot freshman as that one go around and out so FSU missing a couple of foul shots here the last minute or so be Jamir Watkins who had 18 first half points only two in the second half so give North Carolina tremendous amount of credit dribble off Target for the way theyve been able to bottle up Watkins and for th state to be successful hes going to have to get going here heres D that didnt touch anything and out it goes back over to the heels with about 10 and 12 remaining so Florida States comeback B has stalled a little bit in the last two minutes yeah and a lot of it has to do with North Carolinas offense SE Trum knocking down to three and then getting to the free throw line for the tar Hills as Elliot kdo continues to operate at the point theyre playing off of him but he can still get to the basket trying to do that right now into the paint with the kick witherss knocked to the deck as he draws the foul but thats the way kdo has to play even if theyre going to stay off you for someone as quick and as fast as Elliot could go it gives you a running start it makes it difficult for you to stay in front and now he can still find his scams to drop it off to his teammates and once again allow them to get back to the free throw line now getting about six assists a game and itll be Withers to the line after the foul by Swinton he makes 72 he has been a major difference maker in the string of wins for North Carolina hes coming off 16 Points 11 rebounds Saturday against Virginia had 16 to9 the game before that yeah wither started the first seven games of the season for North Carolina after the comeback from Maui Huber Davis made a change in the lineup they went a little smaller because Greg Pow played so well against Michigan State but you consider the rebounding and the experience that Withers brings to the lineup Huber Davis getting him back on the floor and the tar Hills have been better off Jackson on a big drive there knocked out of play NE to hit the deck another big here for Leonard Hamilton he was holding the back of his head no foul there yeah Ryan gr concerned going over making sure he talks to need to anytime you see a player holding their head or neck area you want to make sure theyre okay to continue Ron grber has the conversation seems to be accepting of nes an so FSU to put it in from the Baseline with 10 minutes left heres Thomas K on him and a Applause whistle so a lot of fouls here in the second half not so many in the first 20 minutes yeah OB this will be free throw attempt 27 for the seol so they have been able to get to the line throughout this night Kevin nickelberry assistant coach under coach Hamilton whos up roaming the sidelines as well told us earlier today they have to get to the line against this Carolina team one thing it does not only allows them to put points on the board but allows them to set up their pressure if theyre able to make that second Get Up by Watkins right there yeah Nick who missed his calling I think he should be a comedian to be completely honest I love the guy great basketball coach but even better comedian by the way the way he roasted you today well again thats why I think hes so good at it Watkins with another one coming and sticks that hes locked in nothing funny about this right now no this is the one thing he does take take Serious outside of basketball nothing else does he take serious but with his game time he is absolutely locked in back again once again back up B and hes got a lot of experience as a head coach so being an assistant is different for him on the sideline K taking on the big with the left hand though rebound torn down by Watkins he wants to lead that break Jackson on kadoo body to body and tipped up an end he two right there so C from that head injury and he gets a basket and right now FL they looking around is to looking at guys like why are we not up pressure but Thomas taking on the challenge of guarding RJ Davis shell get the switch NE to clapping his hands looking forward to the matchup against the reigning ACC Player of the Year Davis lips and the ACC Player of the Year wins that battle RJ Davis loves that match up too just one it they got down to six points 9 minutes to play the swing for Deng yes and an answer as he knocks back the long one from the corner but now see the pressure from the seol now theyre back up 94 ft missed the assignment on the last one Leonard Hamilton has said for the last 15 years we may not beat you one through five well withs beat everyone to the other end Davis saw him and darted the pass in a foul yeah but the goal is to wear down the tar Hills you got a great match up N2 was welcoming the matchup however so is RJ the step back hes done it so many times OB on the other end Den finds the corner three ball and its good as the SEO bench is involved in this one now trailing by six you know this is an easy game to pass over even though its on a big money neither team is ranked if the season ended today neither one of them go to the NCAA tournament but its been a high level game its been a very highlevel game and these two teams have picked up their level of play as of late these are better teams in February than they were in November and December and thats one of the things you have to be able to have as a coach is your team to improve the entire season unfortunately as you mentioned they wont end up in the NCAA tournament if the season ended today but theres time left OB especially for the tar here and time left in this game 840 to go 7769 Washington four fouls and Luben four fouls thats your foul trouble for North Carolina nobody has four for FSU and North Carolina back in the zone defensively this time the Simo well prepared for it in the second half get it inside to Watkins whos unable to get it to go in the midrange that PO in and out 7769 and a quick strike its Davis the other end transition defense is always important when youre playing against the Tar Heels you cant allow RJ Davis to get the easy ones as such suddenly back up to 10 in deep nice spin by D instead of the long one underneath for two gets to that short Corner that coach Greenberg was talking about in the first half and that spot has been productive for the simol against the Zone dang with 13 Applause Davis looking for his shot a lot more here yeah theyre going to run a extra Defender Adam Watkins coming over to double team and we have a timeout with seven Zubin coach thank you very much 7971 North Carolina and the ball inbounded for Washington FSU had cut the lead to six but now Kad with it looking for help off to Trimble shot clock to seven Trimble to drive again shot clock to four Davis swooping in it backs it in you know were going to have to see that on replay because RJ Davis going to the right was about to get the shot blocked he switched it to the left hand to avoid the shot blocker Im not going to say it Micha like Michael Jordan did in the 91 finals but it was kind of like what Michael Jordan did in the 91 finals its hard not to go there it really is in a play like like that bank wont drop it rolls away Jackson couldnt connect tremble quickly to the other end of the floor and lays it in and a foul two I tell you what a strong finish by Steph tremble but the acrobatic finish by RJ Davis look at this right left boom off the Glass Great touch crafty and then the strength to be able to finish by Seth tremble backto back tough finishes for the Tar Heels as they try to finish off a tough game here in tallah weve seen RJ make a lot of acrobatic shots and a lot of big shots in his career this is right at the top the one he just made it absolutely is and now that bucket alone gets him to number three in ACC history passing Dicky hem and now behind JJ reick and of course the great Tyler hansbro the alltime leading scorer in ACC history Watkins with his fourth foul as well on that play and Carolina again again opens it up now to 13 and Davis has gone from playmaker back to scorer here in the second half yeah was much more of a playmaker in the first half we talked about the five assists but here in the second half hes been able to just go get a bucket plenty of time here for Leonard Hamiltons team but they need to run right now with six and a half to go shot clock of factor at five Davis backs up hell launch it Carolina tough D and now they can take their time Washington up set the screen a little stumble here by Davis got the mismatch once again hes going to drive it slam on the brakes trying to swing it inside for Washington and North Carolina will keep it 556 on the clock five on the shot clock and theyll put it to 20 shot clock back to 20 and kot to put it in Huber Davis letting his team know they had a full 20 second shot clock so they didnt have to force an opportunity down to 10 now Davis way down cant hit and out it goes back over to the nolles and maluk was able to win that battle against RJ which it hasnt been easy to do throughout this one but forced him to settle into the long threepointer over a contested hand decoin Davis the point guard the Freshman from Baltimore the hand off for Jackson Davis trying to start it denied heres Jackson shot clock to five back to Jackson tried to Slither that pass and theyre going to turn it over they never got it up to the rim so its a shot clock violation and the first one in the game for the tar Hills we saw two in the first half from FSU but now the Tar Heels ratch up their defense here in this second half holding on to a 13point lead looking to extend that so have the seminal run out of gas they lost one of their top players their number two scorer when youan had to lead because of the turned ankle that has had a profound effect it really has and when you consider maluk has played very well but having to play so many more minutes and when you take away the threat that Yan is on the offensive end good oh high off that backboard rebound snatched by Washington heres Kad got it from the corner a B man rebound by jayen Washington and finding kadoo in the corner who knocks down his second three 8771 they get an answer B bowan able to hit that one but four and a half minutes to go in North Carolina showing no signs of backing off here tonight in Applause Tallahassee and making a run at a 100o nights Tyson wasnt quite ready but that pass that rifled right through his hands no and it was the right play by kadoo to get it to Tyson now thats the thing kados had turnover issues but thats not on him thats on the receiver Im sure they give that turnover to Tyson because Kad put him in a great spot thats an offensive foul theyre going to get Davis for that one with 46 to go I think they actually got maluk on that one with the offense with the moving screen didnt give Kad an opportunity to be able to get around the screen thats going to be a foul each and every time as he comes up in immediate and again Obie way back in the day when I was playing college basketball the rule was go put a body on a person now you have to give them a step to be able to redirect K offer tremble Yuber Davis hopping up and down on his sideline RJ Davis Washington gives it back to him under four minutes to Music go RJ making a move again with the scoop and it wont drop for him Thomas got it quick release and the threepointer goes yeah once again back to 10 but weve seen the simol get it down to six a couple of times in the second half just havent been able to get past that do they have one last run in them in the remaining three and A2 minutes k trying to fight his way to the basket lost it s Os forcing to turnover once again itll be ball Bing off the back of that iron that would have been a big one but give Elliot k a lot of credit sprinting back contesting that shot and a timeout North Carolina just over 3 minutes to go they look to protect a 10point lead here 8 for North Carolina 15 assists to only six turnovers for the simol so North Carolina by 10 and the ball inbounded for Powell and back for RJ Davis got the mismatch again of course B Bowen more equipped thats why they bring the switch Gad back out top trembles open cant bury it and a high rebound and its going to be North Carolina ball great Hustle by Drake pal not allowing johir Watkins to have the loose ball and tonights game checkin brought to you by all states 2589 career points that is a lot of points man it really is and obab removed the Astros tremble inside again and another bucket for him another bucket for tremble as he continues to attack the basket playing great basketball coming off the bench now 15 points for Seth Trimble as hes able to get his shoulders past need to and finish through the contact but OB I mentioned Im Im done with the Asis I was with an Asis for guys who played 5 years and looking at their records differently and I was reminded by my college coach Jeff Jones this happened many many years ago when freshman werent eligible to play they could only play 3 years so the guys who could then play four years came in and broke all their records so Im removing the asteris hey thats just a lot of points for RJ Davis a great college career as you mentioned reigning ACC Player of the Year and trying to power North Carolina back into NCAA tournament contention dang will LIF from way downtown nothing but Nets and a timeout FSU 22 to go seems like that cushion can never get past 10 weve seen that six a couple times but North Carolina keeping that cushion extended for a double dig Duke is up to number two in the poll they highlight our Saturday mens basketball triple header NC State Georgia Tech Will tip it off at 300 Eastern then SMU squaring off against Stanford we CA the night with coopera flag and Duke hosting this FSU team at Cameron Music indor so almost to the end of the ACC regular season whos your surprise team been thats easy Louisville what Pat Kelsey has done in Louisville this year right now sitting at two or three in the ACC I believe three right now but with the the turn around that they they had in lisal has been tremendous get Patrick Kelce and his staff a tremendous amount of credit they have absolutely been the surprise team of the League this year always helps me have a great point guard yeah it doesnt hurt Chucky heurn shot 19 free throws Saturday against Florida State again 17 of 19 from the free throw line against the seol he put a tremendous amount of pressure on their defense program record so 9080 with two minutes to go yeah thats been the story tonight as you mentioned the seals just unable to get over the hump against North Carolina heels offense has been in fine form tremble with the drive hes had a really good night cant connect there but out it goes with a minute 44 left yeah Watkins had the rebound in his hand just unable to secure it but it gives the tar Hills another 20 seconds seconds to run time off the clock into the backboard for tremble and time running out on Leonard Hamilton to win his 200th AC regular season game tonight on the iron and tipped up and in by V Allen Luben and Luben allowed that to come off of the rim at least it looked like it from this angle he let it come off of the rim before he tipped it back the swing and a jumper from the corner swished in Good Touch there by Watkins and another stop tonight of winning his 200th ACC regular season game hes number five all time in the ACC anyway behind Coach K Dean Smith Roy Williams and Gary Williams tipped right back to RJ Davis tell you it doesnt get easier for Coach ham this weekend having to go to dur and take on the Blue Devils so trying to get to 200 becomes even more difficult on the road if theyre unable to overcome this ninepoint lead get 106 remaining rest of his schedule at dugat Virginia and then home against SMU on March 8 before the ACC tournament we got a minute six left Powell at the line can I just say this I dont know if well get another chance to cover his team its been an honor it has been a pleasure pleasure to cover Leonard Hamilton it absolutely has and OB for me has been even more of an honor to be mentored by this man hes been a tremendous amount to me in my life he recruited me way back in the late 80s and 1990 when he was at Miami he has been a mentor and a confidant ever since especially once I started doing TV my first trip here he came and picked me up and just gave me a you know some tidbits as how to carry myself in this league on the microphone as well as as a as a young black man representing other black men in this industry and Coach ham is always been a mentor to me ever since from Gastonia North Carolina by the way hes done a terrific job at that helping you along too getting you started I thank you very much and I thank him for all his help think of all the things he has seen and done since he was born in 1948 76 years old such a great success in this game another time with 583 they continue to fight 9283 North Carolina as we continue the conversation on Coach ham he makes makes sure that he lets everyone know how gracious he is one of the great foul Shooters really in the history of the ACC in and out on that one so theres your Jinx 569 to go th this young man right here Charlie Ward of course teammates with Hubert Davis those two guys were together with the New York Knicks so that yeah Charlie coaching high school basketball now here in Tallahasse a little torn between his Alma mat and his teammate but I can say this with confidence the only NBA player with the Heisman Trophy and the the Jersey which you wore tonight to prove it just in case anybody forgot possibly the greatest two sport athlete of all time oh yeah and again hes got some Florida State company to go up against when you think about Dion another guy oh yeah Carol Peppers yes in NFL Hall of Fame 456 to go and RJ back to the line one other thought about Leonard Hamilton he is smiling more than I have ever seen him smile because in basketball season its all business for Leonard and every other head coach but hes smiling a lot and hes lighter I think you know hes at peace with this decision the timing on it I think is very appropriate it is very appropr and the fact that hes finishing the season is more appropriate but he has made it clear its time hes ready to go now hes not done hes just ready to move on from what hes doing right now but coach ham will continue to have an impact on young peoples lives hes talking about teaching hes talking about the ministry when hes done learning how to sing learning how to play the piano making more records he has a couple record labels yes he does and he and more importantly he has so many people that look up to him we saw it in the pregame Uber Davis walking up to coach hands and thanking him for what hes done for all of us and when he says all of us he means black men Coach ham was the first assistant coach in the SEC Hubert Davis of course an assistant coach for Roy Williams but coach ham paved the way for so many young people to be able to achieve their dreams coaching on the sideline when he left Gastonia went to work at Dow chemicals for one day OB didnt call in on Tuesday as we see the conversation between the two and we watch you with thank coach H thank you for everything thank you so much very classy move there by hbert who of course played for him with the Washington Wizards when he was traded to Washington and Leonards one year in the NBA walking straight on cant hit final seconds here in Tallahassee North Carolina will continue to roll they had a fight on their hands most of this night but they are going to go to 18 and 11 116 in the ACC and this is going to be four straight wins for North Carolina North Carolinas not done dont give up on the tar Hills yet theyre going to continue to fight as they have all season long Huber Davis has his team playing their best basketball of the season right now 96
