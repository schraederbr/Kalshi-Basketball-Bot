while the injuries about them I think as a season whereas on were going to hear a lot about them we are ready to tip things up here in South Bend inside the Purcell Pavilion Notre Dame coming out wearing the home white Radford wearing the road red cheski in the circle ready to jump it up with Shaquan Jules and Jules wins the tip for Radford Applause on ibuchi ezia Cuda also known as o and heres Daquan Smith comes to a jump stop floater goes Radford gets on the board first youre going to see them coming to push out the line of attack Notre Dame Notre Dame doesnt want to foul on the defense they do a great job of Defending without fouling La chesky going hard hell be fouled and go to the line for two you see the starting lineup for Notre Dame JJ Starling he is the Freshman from Baldwinsville New York going along with Trey Wirtz Cormac Ryan Nate lecheski and Dane Goodwin the graduate student JJ Im sure has a lot of nerves its his first car this game Im pretty sure his familys here to watch him as well so hopefully he settles down a little bit but he got a lot of Veteran guys to lean on to help him to the Line Nails the first free throw this is another you want to get him going early as well so were guided they need to step up he has to step up and and produce and take up some of the slack that they lost with Paul Atkinson last year so hes the only big they put on the floor right now there are other freshmen two bigs are coming in shot over 45 last year from three and over 200 rebounds that has only one of four players in the country to do that take a look at the starting five four Radford Highlander Smith Jeffers as the yakuta Antoine and Jules bucket goes for the newly inserted majao niang hes the 610 transfer from Florida Atlantic seems to be a concerted effort to attack the paint I dont think theyre fearful of any shot blocking from Notre Dame Cormac Ryan his first three in and out Applause now usually when youre playing against someone you go off their stats from last year but Radford played it at slower Pace one of the slowest Paces in the country a year ago they want to completely change that this year this team wants to get up and down to Florida and play with pace 10 on the shot clock theyre going to work through the big man niang in the post Applause good defense turnaround jumper no good nicely done by Nate lasheski both teams want to play with pace vsky head fake and gets all the way to the bucket hes got the first four points for Notre Dame you have to go for a shot play he shoots the ball so well so when he pump fakes he can he can drive by anybody all year long with that move pick and roll niang thought about the free throw jumper will reload to Jeffers yakuta letting it fly from deep that was something that plagued Radford in their first loss on Monday they were just five for 25 from three but that first one goes well theyre going to get him up theyre going to even the exhibition in first game they shot over 20 25 threes a game so the question is how many are they going to make when they won an exhibition they made 12 when they lost they only made five so and thats similar to what Notre Dame wants to do their team that wants to get up over 20 25 threes as well shot clock Lonnie now for Notre Dame a lot of dribbling from Works turnaround jumper tough shot no good rebound goes to Jeffers now we talked about before about playing with Pace the difference is Radford wants to play 94 feet at PACE Notre Dame wants to play with Pace in their half court sets they want to control the tempo dont be surprised by this early start Raptor to a 94 lead Bradford the last time these two teams played the Highlanders won back in 2018 and there are three players on Notre Dame who were on that team they remember that game and so does decide Jefferson he was also in that game as a freshman so Applause that also knows ACC basketball getting his guys prepared to win Nate lasheski has scored all seven points for Notre Dame Bradford with a twopoint lead here early in this first half set in defeat thats brick Antoine and this is his first shot and niang is going to be called for the overtheback call head coach for the Radford Highlanders in his second season is Darris Nichols now Nichols was an assistant coach at Florida he is known as a excellent recruiter hes a guy who helped build all those strong Florida teams now in his second year Randolph you talked about it he wants to get things faster he has a lot of his guys now in the program hes got a lot of got a lot of guys he recruited and transfer reporter from winning programs so theyre going to surprise a lot of teams in the Big South this year hes expecting to be to finish a lot higher than the sixth place that they picked them in how about lashesky he has been the offense so far for Notre Dame going hard draws a foul and hell go back to the freethrow line to shoot too they need him to be really really aggressive hes a tough matchup I mean hes shooting 46 from three when he shot fakes and plays out there most teams switch right now Radford inability to switch on him is putting there big at a disadvantage and thats hard to get to him you cant close out the name he just shoots it too quick and too well thats 610 hes not received Applause head coach for Notre Dame Mike Bragg in his 23rd season we talked about him having his most experienced team he is 220 in home openers and we talked to him about just what its like being at Notre Dame for so long being a legend and he said Im as invigorated as ever he did he just signed three young star fourstar recruits hes got a ton of talent still coming into the program Mike Brays not going anywhere well I picked on him early because I told him I said hey how does it feel all your buddies are retiring all your peers hes like now Im becoming one of the old guys now so but he feels young he loves coaching fan base loves him and recruiting is going really well so I dont see Mike break going anywhere anytime soon Notre Dame football back and it fell back in the zone now theyve had trouble keeping Bradford out of the pink so now theyre going to match up try to slow things down a little bit tied up at nine a piece we played four minutes here in South Bend first game of the season for Notre Dame tonight 10 on the shot clock for the Highlanders trying to figure out this Zone Jeffers penetrates gets all the way to the rim Mike Bradys got to be disappointed in that youre not supposed to get to the rim against the Zone someone should have been there to meet him I think its a little match up there running in late clock they probably trying to go man and got caught out of position now Goodwin has a mismatch inside he was calling for it now hes got it in the corner sets his feet and his three Threes a little short right now theyre not switching anyone on on Nate nashewski Antoine hell let it fly his first two shots Off the Mark right now the pace feels like rapid the way they want to play its a ragtag game Notre Dames got to settle down and pick up their Pace in the half court and running their sets right now so Trey works is the guy running the show for Notre Dame all the offense has been scored by lecheski Goodwin hard no call ton of contact here come the Highlanders Giles thought about it well get it up and on the rebound a foul is going to be called against lecheski a good start for Radford 119 lead over Notre Dame early on here in this first half flash it back 2018 right on this floor Radford they brought their a game they were not messing around they dont look like theyre messing around tonight ready to play and we expected we saw the earlier shoot around and spread was 18 we didnt think itd be that far I mean this team rappers come out they gotta athleticism they got depth and it is early Notre Dame had a chance to tie it at the buzzer Radford came away with a 6360 win and the Highlanders early on a good start here they have up by two against Notre Dame Notre Dames that back in their Zone trying to find that weak spot Justin Archer into the game now for Radford float game in and out for Daquan Smith guys didnt see the shot clock there we had to throw up a floater on the Run we havent seen the McDonalds AllAmerican JJ Starling get into the action yet for Notre Dame its been the lachesky show he scored all nine points but heres darling with a ball in his hands trying to go to work double team working the pick and roll Lubin lost the handle heres the turnover got to get to him in three Kenyan Giles knocking it down Bradford is clicking early on hes an explosive player from the bench he comes in hes hunting shots hes looking to score and he can flat out do it a little too close there as Asia Cuda called for the reachin theyre going to come after uh Notre Dame here get us youre still in transition you have to build your defense you got to protect the rim but you got to get to these threepoint Shooters and cant leave Giles open hes an explosive scorer freshman from Chesapeake V8 coach Nick was talking about how lucky he was to get him Works driving Baseline laying it in first Notre Dame player other than nashewski to score tonight I was going to say that just someone else decided to join the game help you guy out and they needed some help now Mike Mike Bray is going to go with a short bench hes only going to go about six or seven deep tonight thats because theyre without Marcus Hammond he injured his knee hes the transfer from Niagara surprisingly noted Ames having communication issues right now theyre having breakdowns on their defense you dont expect that from a veteran group of guys now they did Force Giles into a tough shot Notre Dame gets the stop lets see what they do on offense here underneath all alone laying it in then Allen Lubin he is another one of these freshmen ESPN ranked him as the 69th recruit in the country Mike Bray keeps bringing in Talent here at Notre Dame another good recruiting class in the 20 degree class but again he just shows hes theres been no let off in his game Applause ever since Notre Dame went to this Zone it has slowed down Radford not Kenyan Childs gets that turnaround jumper for Giles thats his second bucket hes got five he can score it and you dont want to get him going early hes a handful to deal with three ball a little short by Cormac Ryan Notre Dames getting looks they just havent been able to knock down the three early on one of four from Deep but radfords having no problems DeQuan Smith hes another shooter you know I teased him earlier told him he was the second best shooter in the gym hes proving me he may be the best shooter in the gym Goodwin takes a deep two no good oh the follow Slam by Lubin with the offensive rebound no box out there they got caught in rotation thats what you want to see from a freshman coming in thats the way you get your first basket maybe thats the spark that Notre Dame needs to get going here Smith penetrating and theyre going to call a foul then Allen Lubin another one of The Talented freshmen coming in for Notre Dame making an impact early on shot goes up nobody box out okay thank you the Radford Highlander is shooting 50 percent from downtown three of six theyve got themselves a fourpoint lead John schripping alongside my partner Randolph Childress all right are you surprised by this star here first game of season for Notre Dame no because you never know what to expect the first game rap is coming in here with house money they got nothing to lose you know they favored to lose by 18 points and theyre just relaxed theyre coming off playing Notre Dame has seniors but you know theyre still trying to figure things out as well because they got new guys that have been implemented in this team and they got to get those freshmen up to speed so still earning the game you got to take the temper expectations Daquan Smith leading the way for the Highlanders with seven points hes going to get a breather on the bench right now and the ball is tipped away steel coming away for Trey Wertz now one thing coach Brady has to be disappointed in early with uh his team is just a defense you know they finished third in the ACC last year in defense and coming out tonight giving them 50 to the first TV time out he cant be happy about that now theyre back to their man to man also into the game for the first time EBU yamazakis The Freshman from Japan there he is with a ball in his hands and denied at The Rim thats what you want to see from your freshman rotating over protecting the rim Applause just help coming over with the freshman look at that blocks knocks it off the defense offensive player keeps possession Lubin with a great defensive play you know all the hype has been with JJ Starling deservedly so but Lubin has stolen the show in terms of freshmen so far early on because gray said he has a high basketball IQ and his transition was even smoother than JJ so far you can see why works one on Three flips it into the bucket Notre Dame down by two he works using his size hes a big guard as ball handling ability hes hes been a backup point guard for this team his you know since hes since hes arrived so dont expect anything different from him you just love to see the aggressiveness from him you know this Zone has really slowed down the offense for Radford but thats what you want out of your Zone slow the pace now Notre Dame doesnt have a deep bench so they have to play some Zone Jeffers forced into a tough shot and Notre Dame starting to pick it up defensively zone is helping these guys they rotating their bodies theyre going to keep the same rotation if theyre going to keep a five or six man rotation and as we talked about this team has just gotten so much better its been a big adjustment from them from two years ago to last year last year Notre Dame on this floor 141 at home talk about protecting your home court and a big reason that because of the Improvement in defense that was the knock against Notre Dame for quite some time youre Starling and he knocks down his first college shot thats what you want nice Easy Pass nice easy look help you get going everyone remembers that first shot they make in college so now hes got that out the way lets hope he can relax and settle in in this game JJ Starling is Notre Dame their first lead of the ball game as Giles as foul then hell go to the freethrow line JJ Starling we are going to see plenty more of these this year its just a great pass from Lubin as well to find JJ steps into it knocks it down freshman helping each other out you want to see if you might break so Starling commits his first personal foul as Giles goes to the line to shoot two for Radford and they find themselves down by one and he misses the first Tuesday night well have a mens basketball doubleheader for you right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app Louisville they host App State at 6 Eastern then Armando baycott and number one North Carolina hosts Gardner Webb at the Dean Smith Center in Chapel Hill how good is North Carolina this year theyre really good as they get their bench involved in in the offense and getting the flow of things theyll be even better were fun to watch Monday night so Charles goes one of two from the line ties the game at 20 Starling caught in the air scrum on the floor finds a kick out this is worse for three both teams love to shoot the ball from behind the arc JJ stalling nearly lost the ball but gathered it kicked it out thats what you want from guys drive the ball in the paint kick it out to the shooters theyre always going to have four guys in a threepoint line they can knock down shots thats a deep three Off the Mark Starling with the board and all of a sudden Notre Dame with the momentum up by three under nine minutes to play in this first half the mark the Freshman couldnt connect turnovers typical freshman mistake when you come out you make a good play you want to try to make another one comes down drives Nitto loses it kicks it out great works theres another guy another 41 threepoint shooter Notre Dame has four guys out there now and it shoots over 40 from the floor from three Notre Dame in the middle of a 101 run right now a threepoint lead under nine minutes here in this first half Smith trying to go to work the float game goes rolling in on the rim gutting the lead to one Zone has slowed him down a little bit but when you attack a 23 Zone you want to catch that ball right around the freethrow line that time Daquan Smith got it there Applause Music pressure starting to bother today and theyre turning up their defense but theres so many ball handles with Notre Dame not a team not not many teams have this many bar islands and ability to pass the ball and a jump ball called inside as the akuda got the tie up possession Arrows with Notre Dame if you want to see Nate lejevski catch it high and keep it high put it down there for the little guys theyre going to come grab him for it Notre Dame keeps possession of the ball Music so works for inbound seven on the shot clock for Notre Dame and tied up as the akuda will commit the foul on Goodwin equipment stopped good better remove right there got a guy hooked up on you so you stop trying to reverse its just a vet move drawing the foul its amazing the growth weve seen from Dane Goodwin throughout his career came in as a sharpshooter but he has really improved all aspects of his game hes a really good player I mean he literally was a 50 40 90 guy a year ago doesnt shoot a ton of free throws so he missed a couple late in the year last year dropped him down into the 80s but hes a 50 field goal guy 40 from threepoint line I mean hes a really good offensive player and hes playing bigger and guarding bigger guys on a defensive end you know something interesting with all these veterans coming back we talked to Mike gray about that in his 23rd season I said what is it like coaching all these veteran guys he said I actually text them before this game because we dont have a deep bench to remind them do not foul tonight we only have six or seven deep we need you for the entire game here were going to step aside Notre Dame with a one point lead well be back after this welcome back to South Bend Indiana Notre Dame with a onepoint lead eight 11 to play here in this first half Mike Bray I mean were talking about a Hall of Fame resume the job he has done this is his 23rd season at Notre Dame and he keeps getting better and better recruits come here in the Notre Dame I said that to him today and he kind of rushed it off as if its something that shouldnt be considered and I dont think theres any doubt hes hes had a Hall of Fame career he doesnt have a national championship I think that still motivates him Goodwin jumper goes Notre Dame at the threepoint lead and hes recruiting lacking Goodman does a great job with that thats the Staple in his game if hes coming off a pin down and youre big doesnt step up he likes to curl in there and put pressure on your paint falling back to the zone Smith left alone in and out from three Ryan with the rebound you think Ive Notre Dame though finds a way to make a Deep Run in the tournament thats what he needs to seal his Hall of Fame career as Ryan with the blow Bob I think its done already I just think he this is just gravy in a sense I I dont think anything he needs anything about it thats just a personal you know everyone plays the game to win a National Championship and Mike Rays no different hes an ultimate competitor hes but hes as good a coach there is in the country Justin Archer with the twohand slam Radford trying to figure out the zone They Trail by three works lechesky that has picked off Josiah Jeffers Bradford theyve got numbers in transition Giles pull up three knock down we got a tie ball game Notre Dame cannot turn to basketball over and if you do you have got to defend the threepoint line Radford is looking to in transition theyre looking for three this is the fifth tie of the ball game all knotted up at 27 a piece going hard I thought he got an M1 there its a great strong move by that you have to crowd him because he shoots it so well he needs to continue to stay aggressive he got off to a quick nine thats his first basket since now in this Zone Notre Dame has to protect that free throw line area Smith got by his band throwing it up at The Rim and on the rebound theyre going to call it on Justin Archer for Radford Applause second three of the night stem transition you gotta find those guys theyre running to the threepoint line a second thats child second three Applause Music gotta love the mentality early on lashesky had nine he hits that bucket to go he leads Notre Dame in scoring hes got 11 right now and you see him already attacking again hes trying to go one on one at niang wurtz deep three Kansas now in double figures hes got tens yeah they start to heat up from behind the line right now and starting to extend his lead a little bit they can get a couple more stops but theyve got to keep the ball out of that spot in that zone Notre Dame shooting 50 percent from downtown thats their fourth three of the night driving Baseline kick out to Smith tipped around another offensive board for the Highlanders Notre Dame has been vulnerable in the glass they gave up 22 offensive Rebound in their exhibition game and thats a lot of offensive rebound traditionally theyve been not the best rebounding team but giving up 22 extra possessions is difficult to overcome theyre shooting just enables them to overcome so many things so the personal foul called on Van Allen Lubin Notre Dame is getting spread out in that zone because of radfords ability to shoot the three youre gonna have to be close in the paint and then extend out once on on air time when the ball is moving right now theyre a little bit spread out almost mantoman like and theyre giving up gaps dribble pullup jumper tough shot by Giles now the same thing on the other end I Notre Dame is running it outside look at Lubin I mean hes ready effective and Goodman is probably their best low post player skip pass Ryan you know hes always in shooting ready a deep two knocks it down Ryan his second buck in the game hes got four and Notre Dame have hit their last eighth field goal Music I can I understand everyone running at quarterback Ryan I think he has the quickest release in the country I think his release is unbelievable click and when he shot fakes I would imagine everybodys going to go for it great pullup jump shot by him does he have the prettiest jump shot in the country its just effortless he keeps it high its so quick if youre not there on the catch forget about it Josiah Jeffer says dont forget about me he is the leader on this team hes the guy whos bringing everybody together all the transfers neighboring relying on him earlier of the Season hes the most experienced guy as a starter he has the most starting experience trapped underneath trying to find some help Brian all alone from the wing gets his own board lecheski on the dump off Ryan another offensive rebound back to lasheski one on two and hell be fouled Notre Dames not known for the offensive rebound but thats a great possession shoot the threes long rebounds take a shot guys are running in Long Shots long rebounds great effort guys continue to play this is something we saw from Notre Dame also last season a team also known as Shooters but we saw the toughness build they formed it on the defensive end and now its carrying over on the offensive end getting on the glass youre going to see Anthony Solomon talking to him he credits A lot of that with him Anthony Solomon was here through that Elite eight round and all those postseason runs and hes now coming in uh Mike brace turned the defense over to him and hes a key reason for them last year coming from 14th all the way up to three hes brought that toughness and echoing that and the guys hes better guys will blow it in theyre taking small pieces to the game like right now late nashewskys getting to the free throw line you know he did it in the exhibition game hes doing it so far tonight thats something he that he hadnt done in his career and hes knocking him down hes five of six from Milan nashewski has 12 points to lead the way for Notre Dame he has to take up for something for Atkinson leaving as well so you do want to see that that bodes well for another day Jeffers off the hot ball screen knocks down another three Jeffers hes got seven points now if theres a concern you have for Notre Dame playing this game is the pace okay turn it over heres the steal for Radford Jeffers dump back extra pass Giles in the corner and Radford their second three in a row theyve got six threes on the night and it is a tie game thats Joes third transition three you have got to find him but you cant turn the basketball over and this is a team that scored 21 points off turnovers and then lost to Marquette with 25 points in transition so they want to play with pace starling shot off tomorrow I mean Randolph you called it earlier Radford has nothing to lose tonight they play with no fear and you dont know what expect because youre coming into this last year they were one of the slowest teams in the country you didnt expect the entire philosophical change so its an adjustment right now Shaquan Jules gives Radford the twopoint lead under three minutes to play here in this first half and Notre Dames going to play their guards theyre not going to go deep into their bench and Radford is going to go at least nine deep free on the pick and roll with the nice head fig hes got 14 points now these looks so good right now he needs to set screens because they are not switching on him and if youre going to show and try to recover to him youre never going to get there thats why hes having a big game and if Im Mike gray Id run him in ball screens all night until Force Radford to make an adjustment Applause Giles finds niang picks up his dribble resets with 10 on the shot clock for the Highlanders Jeffers Let it Fly thats over lisheski in his face knocking it down Bradford retakes the lead Notre Dames playing in that drop coverage meaning they want to keep Nate lazeski in between his man in the basket but the guards are not getting through the screens enough to bother those midrange jump shots and right now radfords knocking him down under two minutes to play here in this first half Notre Dame down by two Starling drag the pivot foot thats a travel Josiah Jeffers the senior leader for Radford he is bringing it on hes playing really well right now coming off the ball scream lakelands late see you big fella take those two with you but I know its frustrating if youre Notre Dame coach Anthony Solomon told me The Scouting Report was defying jobs in transition you got to know where he is he has three threes in transition so nothing drives to coach Ingrid and Scouting Report mistakes and right now Notre Dames had a few we asked head coach about Kenyan Giles he said hes the right choice I said what does that mean we were looking at him all summer he was a backup point guard on his AAU team but we just knew he was going to be a good fit for our team on the rim macheski is going to be fouled Over The Back by Jules I want to know who played in front of him because he this young man can play hes an explosive scorer I mean the ball looks good every time he leaves his hand I mean hes playing well at least 12 points Off the Bench hes instant offense hes only played 14 minutes tonight and already has 12 points and he was their leading scorer coming from the bench against Marquette in the first game look youve recruited in the ACC you know how hard that is how do you evaluate a player who doesnt even get that many minutes in the AAU circuit well a lot of times its just sometimes you know people out there that tells you and you got to trust your eyes I mean thats the bottom line thats one thing that I was always told even when I got first got into business is you know Talent trust your eyes and you see it and someone found a gym with this young man because hes gonna be a heck of a player Bradford with a twopoint lead as we approach a minute to play here in this first half Applause picking up his dribble looking for help extra passes to Antoine and he is short on the jumper its a good side you want him to take those shots again hes a town of the young man he hasnt got going yet but if he gets going then things could get really interesting under a minute to play here in South Bend Applause anything with Nate necheski setting screens Works back to Starling knocking it down his second three of the night JJ starlings got six his offense have been really easy for him when hes allowed it to come to him right now being a Freshman the McDonalds AllAmerican you can see the anxieties pushing in metal to put it a Timeout on the floor Radford wants to call a timeout with 234 to play in this first half well be back after this JJ Starling the McDonalds AllAmerican his stroke is looking good straight drop by train coming off the pin down throwing a defense kicking to him great step in knock down three by JJ Starling again he scored and done well when he allowed the offense to come to him hes forced the issue a little bit had a couple of turnovers there as well but so far living up to the expectation and a lot of pressure hes the first McDonalds with fruit since 2013 that was Demetrius Jackson and since ESPN has started ranking in 2007 hes actually the highest recruit at number 18 in the country on ESPNs ranking coming out of high school and hes trying to replace Blake West and he came in not as much not as much height but had a heck of a freshman year and Mike Bray he has a bunch of Veteran guys with him thats going to ease him anything so I expect a great year out of JJ hell settle down in this game as well so McCormick Ryan commits the foul thats his first the teams fifth 103 on the clock for Radford Applause Notre Dames in Atlanta man defense now theyve gotten out of his own Jeffers with two on the clock step back three and thats how the first half will end Notre Dame with a 4039 lead lets go to the studio with Kelsey Riggs and Luke Hancock who have our halftime report John Randolph thanks welcome into this ACC Network half timer noted name that turn the basketball over because they have so many handlings but giving Bradford credit and I think some of that is because they dont have their point guard they dont have Marcus ham in there and and were seeing it I think weve talked so much about JJ JJ Starling you know and comparing him to Blake Wesley but they also had princess Hub a year ago and thats the kind thats who Marcus Hammond is replacing and they dont have him right now as the acuta with the penetration gets all the way to the rack and Radford retakes the lead by one someone has to rotate over I think right now because of rapids ability to make shots with all their guys on the court no one is rotating to protect the rim and we have a steal ezia Cuda one on one will pick up his dribble good transition d by Notre Dame they need to do that because again that was a bad pass but you can see he was looking for someone at the threepoint line theyre trying to get in the paint kick it out to threes Notre Dame has to stop turning the basketball over and theres Marcus Hammond he is the grad transfer from Niagara he is out with an injured knee no word on when he will come back but missing him especially as a ball hander is a big loss for Notre Dame and they havent had time to practice without him this young man played in their exhibition game and they he just got injured right before this first game so they hadnt got a chance to you know to practice without him they have to know what theyre capable of doing hes been in a lineup leading up into this game so theyll figure it out in due time we dont know how long hell be out were they throwing that at you I dont know if they were giving it to me I was gonna shoot it Laughter hey I like this kind of game its not much defense guys are just jacking it up thats right in my Island that they knocked down the monitor everything at the scores table here a little too close as the accuta called for the reachin thatll be his third personal foul but thats what happens when you guard a guy like he has a quick release as we talked about you got to get up on him and unfortunately he can put it down on the floor also got Izzy yakuta with a with his third foul so he goes to the bench he gets a breather but that brings in the Freshman Kenyan child God you dont want you almost want to say no dont file leave him out now when they need a basket in the post Dane Goodwin is really good at just going in the post good Antoine winning that battle shot clocks at five but Antoine bumped him on the way by and will be called for the personal foul yeah dont be surprised when they want to go to the post up they dont you know they dont have anywhere else on the lineup right now they got four perimeter guys but Dane Goodman part of that 50 40 90 package we talked about hes really good at this curling off the inbound shot too strong and posting up hes a really good player theyre getting back in transition now they got to match up kickball Applause if youre just joining us this thing has been close the entire way ton Elite changes in the first half Radford with a onepoint lead over Notre Dame Radford lost their first game of the season on Monday at Marquette because thats what they didnt really shoot well they have shot it well tonight this is the Radford team we expected Antoine no good on the take good defense thereby I know the name theyve been able to secure the rebound and actually pushed Tempo themselves this is what they need to do put Nate lejevski in ball screens youll get a good shot its like a bass Ryan in the corner oh for four from downtown tonight hell find starling Applause and uncharacteristically Notre Dame as the team cold from Beyond three tonight well theyre going to live by the three and dive out of three theyre good looks theyre getting them right now theyre just not knocking them down theyll knock down shots they have to come back and fix whats going on in the defensive end right now Notre Dame shooting 35 from Deep the personal was on lasheski that is his second okay this is a team that held people to 65 points or below that was their mark and right now radfords on Pasty to shoot you know to surpass that number Giles forced into a tough shot Radford up by one Notre Dame trying to push things Notre Dame to start the second half oh for four from the floor theyre gonna need to help him down there oh for five as Goodwin takes a shot Radford theyve got five on four if they want a Goodwin trailing behind the play finding threepoint Shooters this is Smith gets his own rebound and Radford will reset the offense theyre spread Notre Dame out and theyre hooked up to their guys they have to get into help they have to trust their teammates and trust their help off the dribble handoff heres Smith on the window gets it to go Radford a threepoint lead Notre Dame still looking for their first points here in the second half Carter was the defensive breakdown theres their defensive philosophy is pinning you on the side right now the guards arent fighting through the screens and allowing The Bigs May allowing the guards to turn the corner and theyre just getting whatever shot they want just run the ball screen with youre gonna get youre going to get a good look inside shot goes Cormac Bryant his third bucket of the game hes got six rapper has no answer for that right now and I think theyre going to see them go to that theyre trying to sprinkle in Goodman on the on the post but they really want to get the ball now putting Nate lazeski and ball screens and catching guys rotating at him and him one more and making an extra pass and theyre getting open looks great job by Trey where its getting through the screen these guards got to get through these screens to stay in front of the basketball going to the hoop Jeffers will be bumped by wurtz so for works that is his first personal foul Radford with a onepoint lead here in the second half well be back to South Bend after this Music coach Darris Nichols he told us probably the most interesting part this is Allison McCoy shes the associate athletic director for student athlete Support Services she makes sure all the guys are on top of their studies for an hour every single day and Coach Nichols he said in order for the guys to meet each other and gel as a team every single City they go to they actually change room assignments they have a different roommate for every trip with the left and one spray pass I dont know if I would like that though you seem like a guy to be playing PlayStations be playing PlayStation 5 all night keeping me up this is a great curl again theyre not keeping the ball out of the paint coming down the lane landed off and then and one theyre being punished because theyre allowing the ball to get in the middle of the floor be a man or zone and right now until they fix that theyre gonna have a tough time stopping raffle youre telling me you wouldnt want to get to know your teammates no you want to just stay with one guy for the whole season I think I would I think we get along we know what we like I you know you might snore or something who knows now you know I dont snore come on dont put that out there you know you could be playing PS5 all night Im trying to you know texting on the phone I was a serious guy I went to bed early I was ready to go so thats what I mean sometimes you got to get out of your comfort zone thats right thats how you guys thats what college is about but my my pregame prep was pretty simple so far its been working for Radford this is worse from Deep short on the rebound and the rebound is Shaquan Jules somewhere Tony Rutten is listening to this so hes going to talk trash to me about it because I gave him the blues as a freshman on the road shut up turn the TV off again now Notre Dame has a bigger lineup on the floor they either going to throw it inside Music or expect give it to that guy its always a good idea ski reloads hes short on the three Jeffers gets the rebound he says calm things down lets run this at our Pace weve played five minutes in the second half were up by four now both teams are playing with their big alanos you know Raptors doing the same both team runs this ball screen motion penetration tipped out the rim no good Radford they are the aggressors on the offensive glass just getting to all the loose balls another official rebound when theyre not securing it theyre getting their hands on it theyre just playing a little harder than child takes the book get big and one young fell as flexing hes a handful he can flat out score theyre having a hard time contrain containing dribble penetration freshman on freshman there we will step aside Radford with a sixpoint lead he will go to the line for a threepoint play when we come back I respond before we went to Great Kenyan Giles going to work hes just showing you hes much more than a threepoint shooter there he had the big on a closeout switch five just pulled it out in ISO and the rap was just giving him space right now theyre getting in the paint whatever they want Notre Dames defense is something for it so they have to keep control of the basketball theyre having trouble guarding their basketball and again it goes back to what we talked about I think its not having Marcus Hammond in the lineup tonight is another potential guard defended At You Luke youre missing out on so Giles he has 15 points tonight Radford a seven point lead this is their largest lead of the ball game as Notre Dame started the second half just one of eight from the floor started to have a 102 run right now again anything with the ball screen is a good idea now now they made the adjustment in the switchman Lubin will step out hes off the mark you can tell everybody Notre Dame bench thats not the shot they wanted from the freshman no need to force anything if you know the name just settle down and now what has happened is both teams now are switching off theyre so afraid if everybodys shooting the ball theyre switching with all five guys Childs look at him dribble with his head up trying to find somebody hes got his man Jules inside our dribble comes back to the left rolling off the rim two red jerseys are on the ball Antoine extra pass this is Giles misses everything its good look another turnover Radford coming back running the floor Giles pull up at the elbow count It Radford extends their largest lead of the game theyre up by nine he is fearless he is unafraid in a moment and again hes leading the team and scoring again with 17 great pass a little bit free works with great class lube and thats thats how you want the offense to come if you know today let it come naturally you dont need to force anything no need to take quick shots plenty of time to get yourselves back in the game but they have to improve this on this end of the floor now theyre falling back to their defense to the zone defense we played three minutes here in this second half Radford the Highlanders theyve been the aggressor Giles what a dish off rocking the rim is Jules and Radford doing anything and simply again against the Zone theyre getting the ball in the paint off the dribble forcing rotations and getting any shot they want quartz trying to penetrate lechesky hell be bumped on the drive fouled by Jules all right heres Saturdays week 11 ACC Network college football lineup Fresh Off Their upset of Syracuse Pittsburgh they Spur off against quarterback Brennan Armstrong in Virginia who they need to win out to become Bowl eligible that games at noon Eastern vet got a true freshman quarterback MJ Morris leading 16 NC State against Boston College and the day is capped off our ACC Network Prime Time match in Syracuse to trying to turn things around they take on number 23 Florida State Seminoles have won two straight Seminole starting to play good football great look to some there Trey Works using his size six six guard lead guard elevating over to smaller Defenders the rapper hes got 16 to lead the way for Notre Dame spin move caressi on the floor and a jump ball as he tied hes tied up by Ryan possession hour goes a Notre Dame Music dont be surprised the Islanders Shaq Jules who just threw down that last bucket for Radford he had a big summer he played in the FIFA games that were going down in Brazil with the national team for the Virgin Islands I mean thats just coached Darris Nichols what did that do for Jules he said playing with Pros in the FIFA games seeing how those days operate seeing how they play and prepare for a game and what they do in their off time he is now buying into the system here at Radford he understands what it takes to be successful night in and night out because when you go to those games youre operating youre playing with pros and their preparation and everything is something you can learn from every coach that Ive talked to that have players that played in in the for the national team came back really impressed with the next step that their players take JJ Starling back in the game for Notre Dame trying to go off the bounce with the left you see the quickness Starling had two threes in the first half thats his first bucket in the second hes got eight you can see again it was another screen by lashesky they didnt want to switch it that time but a great job by the Freshman identifying that getting aggressive and turning the corner now you see theyre picking up their defense theyre fighting through that screen good defense by Ryan shot clock under 10 for Giles Bradford spreading the floor Giles for three tough shot at the ring tipping it in thats Justin Archer thats the difficult part about when you switch you had a guard on the Freshman didnt box him out he had a jet ski outside they wanted to ice on and they had a guard on the big and a big one to battle there Giles a little too aggressive when we called for the reachin this is what you want to do when you when they switch they ISO your guard to talk as a big you want to take advantage and get the rebound he helped muscle The Freshman there on the glass just turning the corner nice finish with the right hand how does Notre Dame get more of that from JJ starling just let it come organically you cant force it that time he just came off you want to play in a controlled aggression right now Notre Dame is in the half court set in the post theyre going to go to Dane Goodman hes their best goal post guy he didnt finish there and then he commits the foul off the Miss and will foul Jules on the rebound I think he was trying to get the ref to call the foul I think theyve kind of saw the him grab his arm and hes a little frustrated because hes missed two layups and shes struggling from the field tonight and I think hes just just seeing some of that frustration after he missed got to point Blake Lane up there Goodmans got two points one for seven from the floor that was his second personal foul theyre going to get enough offense they just got to sit down and guard here keep the ball out the middle of the paint they force a tough three but lacheski will foul Smith and Daquan Smith will go to the free throw line to shoot three you can see that happens a lot you know hes accustomed to playing in drops they were a little bit unsure of what defense they were doing they switched at the last minute he was late and unfortunately a veteran guy jumping out fouling a threepoint shooter he knows better than that Saturday morning 11 AM Eastern the ACC huddle crew will be in Syracuse New York to get you set for another full day of football theyll also have the halftime shows and they have the pre and post game show throughout the day 6 30 get a complete wrapup of the afternoons games and theyll get you set for the prime time matchup between Florida State and Syracuse going down on the ACC Network at 8pm Eastern right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app so I talked to Daquan Smith at the free throw line before the game he transferred from Murray State and he said one of the biggest reasons why he came here is because at Murray State he was kind of a role player right he only played about 10 to 15 minutes per game here hes going to get a ton of playing time you know who he played with at Murray State a certain jaw Moran who is terrorized in the NBA right now he said John Morans like my brother I text him before his games he texts me before my games and he said John actually texted him after the loss against Marquette and said just keep shooting youre going to do your thing itll come through foul now the call was made on the floor work now the result could be a one or a two or it could downgrade it to a common foul or no foul after they go to the monitor so you see the referees Bert Smith Terry Oglesby JP Primm taking a look at things at the monitor to see if this is in fact a flagrant foul on Shaq jewels ladies Nate lizewski is allowed to stand there and and hold his ground so I dont think he was leaning over into space or anything at all play a good defense stop the ball and heres another look and lets not forget lachesky is 610 so to catch him in the face thats a high elbow I think its a play for one okay free throw in the ball Ill be shocked if theres anything more or anything less for that matter but maybe this gets to know the name defense gone I mean you saw a little bit of you know anxiety last possession with Dane Goodman hes upset fired up about it and sometimes you need some external help to get going so the game is starting to get their defense going to get two screens theyve got to keep the ball out of the middle of the plank right now when rap Brothers done well theyve turned him over before theyve gotten the ball in the paint and have caught off it so you know something we also cant forget this is just the first game for Notre Dame right this is opening week across college basketball Radford played their first game on Monday losing to Marquette so this is their second game even though Notre Dame has a ton of veterans coming back still game one still game one and again we talked about Marcus Hammond being out you he was injured very early I mean very early before the first game coming over to let us know what happened Applause thank you so we have the decision on the call the referees have decided that well be upgraded to a flagrant one Notre Dame will shoot two free throws and theyll have the ball one for one so far this year I got that one right okay Parker there you go get it Im sure the balance out but yeah I thought they had to call that and it wasnt intentional but it happened you know anytime the elbow is getting near the face its one of those things most times you really want to teach kids to rip lower than higher for that very reason lets see if this gets Notre Dame defense going so lashesky will go to the line to shoot two free throws Notre Dame will have the ball hes been shooting the ball so well you want him shooting these free throws right now hes six of eight so far tonight and he got to the line about nine times in the exhibition game and hes on Pace to do that tonight and thats just a great sign that hes indicative of having a big that hes attacking the paint driving the basketball and its just showing his senior leadership right now lets see if he can put this group on his back he started carrying him early lets see if he can continue to carry him late now lashewski was one of three players on this Notre Dame team who was on that team in 2008 when they lost to Radford so he is trying to carry his guys up he has 18 points to lead the way for the fighting Iris tonight hes definitely done his part to carry the upside low for your offensive lows for this group three Off the Mark Ryan on the offensive glass will get the board and hes fouled by ezia Cuda and thatll be his fourth personal foul Notre Dame guards are so big and thats one advantage that they do have that these guys were sneaking on the offensive glass and they have a distinctive height advantage of about two or three inches and even more with Giles coming in on the floor now doesnt it feel like Notre Dame is trying to get back the momentum in this game and it seemed like the big play in this game was Dane Goodwin going hard getting fouled hard and it kind of woke everybody up well hes trying I mean hes trying to get his guys going and hes selling those answers hes just trying to pump his guys up hes frustrated that hes not scoring but he knows that hes a veteran guy theres enough offense here hes trying to get his guys keep playing so they just got to get it going on a defensive end right now that technical foul should could be the thing that likes him as well time to play this threepoint game now Brian trying to pump up this crowd it is a threepoint lead for Radford as we approach nine minutes to play in the second half to get through ball screens right now thats what you want to see if you know today get through the screen get back in front of the ball slipping free Antoine extra pass in the corner good defense there feels like this game has switched it has theres been a couple of things that have gone against forever the heart foul the technical foul two free throws on the ball stepped out of bounds so a turnover for Notre Dame as good one out of bounds and Notre Dame will have to reset on defense just you want them to settle down now this is where again is this team with even though it has experience theres still some anxiety because as a veteran group this is also their last first game and can never overestimate that Smith inside the knee hanging slipping free and the foul that pick and roll has been working all night for Radford just bad communication you know they were in drop coverage initially and then they switched and you see here lazesky so far back of the ball screen you know when they run it hes so far back but then its a switch the guard cant get back in front of a big if youre going to switch that late so if his drop he has to be up calling it out to the guard can get under I can tell you as a guard if you call it a switch that late he cant get in front of the bed you know Zhao niang the grad transfer from Florida Atlantic converts the threepoint play pushes the lead back to six his team isnt going anywhere we talked about it they built this roster off a lot of transfers but theyve come from winning programs so these guys know how to win works with the scoop shot at The Rim hes been equally as impressive tonight as well hes created shots for guys hes a veteran guy hes been around the block from has all the tools to to help this team Trey Works has 12 for Notre Dame trailing by four pick and roll back to niang and hell be fouled This Time by JJ Starlin thats his second personal it doesnt matter whos in the screen it has to be better communication again theres a late switch and if its gonna be that late again the guard cant get back under it and theyre going to be late score every time Applause well have a special ACC pm tomorrow with the crew theyll be in Syracuse New York to get you set for a big weekend of college football they also have the latest from around the conference 4 PM Eastern right here on acc Network and an ESPN app its a big one and one settle tomorrow tar he was coming in town hey now hey but it aint gonna have to sure that ball screen defense again the last two times they ran the same play switch has been late and theyve given up giving up baskets Tony angos one of two from the line lead is five under eight minutes to play here in South Bend Brooks picking up his dribble Cross Court finds Ryan quick move Baseline hes double teamed Notre Dame he just needs to move the basketball and put Nate lejewski in ball screen like this put him in Bossman dig it in works thats a deep three he works Trey works brings Notre Dame back with him too so great to see this young man get going offensively better job now switch to ball screen Smith has a mismatch step back three Dakota Smith doesnt care whos guarding him right now its a great step back three that was filthy Declan Smith hes got 16 Works in and out dribble just moved to basketball let the open man take the shot Notre Dames at its best when that happens Music great job by Nate not setting the ball screen because they got a switch Works can he get another one that is two deep threes in a row for Trey wurtz he took a Timeout on the floor works is heating up hes got 18 Applause lets move into step back three telling Trey Works Anything You Can Do I can do the word says not so fast my guy Im coming right back at you Applause what a game we have and something in the end of the night Trey Works has hit back to back threes and I dont think either of them have hit the rim he was dancing on that one in the next play he comes down he catches the big on the switch nothing but net on that listen Mike Ray told him when he put him in the starting lineup he usually comes off the bench Mike Ray said keep the job make me have to bring Marcus Hammond Off the Bench and hes doing that tonight hes going to make it hard for Coach Brady to take him out of the lineup but he keep playing like this Mike gray is 220 in home openers here in his 23rd season at Notre Dame better job stepping up on a switch with the freshman and switching again now theyre stepping up now theyre not switching so theyre Smith step back another tough dagger says hes too little Declan Smith the Murray State transfer bringing it tonight hes got 18 thats a difficult shot there Applause finding a rhythm hes really aggressive Ryan picks up his dribble looking for some help someones got to cut to the basket and an offensive foul Jeffers goes down to the floor offensive foul on Ryan thats his third personal Music ity I want to see it he just does a great job kill just dribble walls up the way he coaches great job stuck his shoulder and its lucky they dont take a look at it I was wondering that yeah thats above the shoulder area so that could have been a reviewable play right there he probably could have asked but you know now if you do that youve got to be willing to risk the time out and I dont think coach Nichols wants to do that Notre Dame good defense on the pick and roll Goodwin on the breakout for the Fighting Irish and hell be fouled by Antoine to go to the line for two Goodwin just got the ball that time put his head down Drew contact got to the line he needs to get to get himself going so nothing like free throws again when youre scoring you have a slow start want to get your free throw line to get yourself going theyre going to need him in his last six minutes the first free throw for he is a perfect three of three tonight hes automatic put this in a book dont believe in the announcer Jinx put it in the book Ill take him shooting free throws any day of the week radfords lead is cut to two under six minutes to play now to switch it again Smith once again gets to his spot Off the Mark Starling rips down the board good idea that time bothered him 16 guy with reach now theyre switching everything with the Jeske now hes gonna go on a post great misses just didnt rap for theyve got numbers if they want it in the corner Giles thought about it pulls it hits it a three ball for Kenyan Giles and Radford extends the lead back to five that doesnt count as a turnover but Nate najeski fell and they got numbers again and who did they find theyre looking for jobs in transition thats his full three tonight getting an open looking transition how about Giles The Freshman from Chesapeake Virginia hes got 20 points in his second college game off the Poke away they get Giles with the reach and no who do they as a child yes so they called it on Giles stays here with Notre Dame I thought it was a good defensive play Giles with 20 tonight 43 in transition jab steps off you a little late you got to close out to him hes already hes hit you up for 17 already run him off the line what a start to this young mans career I think were gonna have to figure out who that starting point guard was on that AAU team for Giles to be a backup we need to also as what he claimed with a start spot on his on his college team why is he not start in the lineup right now but hes instant offense Off the Bench I mean he has a early lead on a the Big South uh freshman of the year right now I cant imagine any freshman in that conference plan any better than he is Applause Notre Dame needs to come up with a defensive stop under five minutes to play Down by three to the one possession game but their defense has been solid theyve been getting better I just got to clear up this middle ball screen up oh pick and roll again Archer rocking the rim just I know coach gray has to be frustrated the middle ball screens are just not communicating on it lachesky and Archer theyre fighting lucchesky he sold that one it wasnt that dramatic give him an acting job but he did get fouled some of these guys if rapper has a really physical team to some of these guys Audreys a big strong guy so theyre a little frustrated with the letter mislayup again you know those things you get mad at yourself and you can get tied up a little bit and sold the foul thats what experience thats what you want from your experience get to the line I mean Archers shaking his head but that was 100 foul thats a foul I dont think anybodys ever really filed and threw their hand up and that happens like one out of every ten fives how about Les schewsky nine of 11 at the free throw line tonight you can see the Improvement here in his graduate year at Notre Dame its got to get more comfortable finishing in the paint like that last time not as comfortable but he is willing to go in there just like The Possession before he was trying to punish Giles inside on a switch and I dont think theres anybody out there he presents that kind of problem because he shoots it so well youre talking about a 46 shooter from three so he shot fakes you you got to go for it he drives you but when he can switch on both smaller guards and take him inside theyre gonna need him to do that to make up for some of what they lost with Atkinson last year for those one of two from the line but he has made a careerhigh 10 free throws tonight 10 of 13 in the line for macheski to fight over this gotta fight over it gotta get over it Giles elbow jumper falling away lacheski with the rebound and he now has a double double 21 points 10 rebounds for the Notre Dame big man its been difficult to stop it for three wide open not down automatically dang Goodwin Goodman curls off put so much pressure on the big to help he stops back knocks down to three I expect them to come back to that look what a ball game weve got tonight Bradford with a onepoint lead thats how you wanted to switch if you Notre Dame now you just got to stay in front of the ball use your limp great job nashewski doesnt foul rolls up on D and Ryan pulls down the rebound for Notre Dame communication on the switch guards able to get under thats the way Notre Dame needs to defend that action theyve struggled with it all night there again running back to the same thing Giles called for the hold away from the ball Nate lasheski The Graduate 610 big man stepping up from the outside and Notre Dame down by one Bradford with a 7170 lead over Notre Dame lets take a look at your summary if you are just joining us Kenyan Giles The Freshman from Chesapeake Virginia leads the way for Radford hes got 20 points four of seven from downtown he has stepped up big he is approaching a career high hes got 24 points 10 rebounds a double double thats his 10th career DoubleDouble but Notre Dame does not have a bench they just go six deep Radford leads the bench scoring as Goodwin goes to the line yeah theyll theyll lose the bench going deal most of the year and not so much I mean when when Marcus Hammond comes back then well decide you know Trey Works looks like he doesnt want to give that position up but either way theyre going to have some offensive foul power coming from the from the uh from the guard spot Notre Dame comes all the way back trailing the largest leads by nine this is their first lead of the second half so going to that middle ball screen again theyre doing a great job now going under it communicating the switches now someone that guards got to make a play Nate lazeski is using his lamp off the bounce oh with the kiss off the Glass Bradford retakes the lead by one thats just a great play under three minutes to play here in South Bend lasheski on the Block Applause Starling will reset the offense for Notre Dame shot clocks at 13 theyll make a play at this point got the switch works and Ryan lets it go stop on the rebound and he misses everything yeah it didnt balance himself caught it was off balance and then laid it up great offensive rebound though but you want to finish it but hey you need to stop Applause needs to keep this ball out of the middle putting a lot of pressure on his guards in the middle getting over that screen Jeffers hes trying to take control of things with the crossover gets to his right oh Applause and he creases the lead to three theyre attacking him on that switch and he has to get someone to help him I thought he did a great job before that time he gave up the angle and it is crunch time in South Bend under two minutes to play Notre Dame down by three Radford has led for most of this game dont settle just just take them in he cant follow with the mismatch he knows Giles has four fouls thats the leadership by lasheski he now has 26 coach nickels calling Tomball hell draw the play Music timeout Radford a one point game Notre Dame first game of the season trying to get the dub Music coming out of that Radford time out up by one with 118 to play here in the second half the Highlanders they do have some foul trouble on the floor theyve got three guys with four personal fouls Giles as yakuta and Jules both have four and you can see on that last play Giles he couldnt defend the four fouls no and you need him on the floor hes the one guy of those four that they need out there they dont have depth Goodwin with the clear out hell be called for the personal foul Applause thats the other thing when you switch one of your guards has to box out the big and Jews is just a grown man out there hes just so physically strong its difficult for anybody to box him out let alone a guard even someone decides a good one Its gotta they got a team rebound I mean other guys got to come in there cant just beat the guard got switched on tour Jules goes to the line ready to shoot his first free throw of the night and he makes it Music Applause hes a big free throws for a guy the head shot free throws all game long can you go to the first game of the season with a chance to upset Notre Dame on their home support he goes one of two a twopoint lead for Radford as we approach a minute to play here in South Bend Works picks up his trip dribble Mrs Les schewski on the curl yeah great job getting the deflection on it just put luceski in the ball screen The Freshman trying to run the show Starling up at the rim and a block is called if thats on ezia Cuda thats his fifth it is he tried to slide over to step up and take a charge thought he might have gotten there Music first Smith didnt think so I dont know I dont know what yeah I mean its burnt corner to the Block its a block Two Shots theyre not gonna change it now thats right but no you hate to see that poor poor senior and for any guy you know you dont want to foul out a game and thats and its kind of when youre on a verge of an upset but give credit to JJ Starling The Freshman with the shot clock winding down hes the aggressor taking it to the bucket now goes the line for two and he misses the first hes a defining moment its early on its nerves again hell be fine I think hell make the next one and on to the next play Im a call listen here he is automatic there you go young fella youre also a perfect two for two on your automatics calls so far this year hes a burger guy for a reason hes a McDonald AllAmerican for a reason hes been in these moments before just not at this level yet and theyll put the balls in his hands with many more fighting Irish they need to stop down by one how are they going to guard this ball screen are they going to switch it Smith reset to go with five on the shot clock getting all the way to the rim throws it off no good you got numbers if you just sniff it down behind the play Notre Dame has five on four numbers if they want it Ryan recognizes and he gets the layup to go Notre Dame takes the lead and they stop the play because Declan Smith is still down after taking a hard fall going to the bucket lets hope hes okay Ill take the Quan hit the bottom of the basket there just a great drive he got to the rim and just missed it full Mack Ryan fell on top of him and Ryan got up and just hustled down and made a play you hate to see that happen at the expense of a player getting injured but Heads Up played by comeback Ryan he didnt know he heard him he just fell on top of him got up made a play so Smith is still down lets hope hes all right after taking that hard fall Daquan Smith the Murray State transfer to continue to call the Ford hes got hes still underneath the basket Applause you still need the basket I dont know how theyre gonna play the game yeah theyre gonna sit I think we got to have a full time out here hope hes not injured back he still had gotten out off the floor yet but we saw him go down hard and then on top of going to the basket Harding taking that fall it appeared like Ryan came down on top of him thats what it looked like incidental yeah oh like accidentally tried it tried to block the shot 100 fell on top of him lets just hope its nothing serious and hes going to be okay and hes getting up off the floor now so I think so the Quan Smith helped up off the floor as he gets a Round of Applause by this crowd here at Notre Dame now if youre if youre after here I I mean youre losing this is where you miss DeQuan Smith hes a playmaker hes a veteran guy that you want to put the ball in his hands but I think the other guy is Kenyan Giles I think you got to find him right here its only nine seconds left you dont need to run wait run time we just need to get right into an action and I think youre going to put a ball screen on identify a person maybe its Nate lazeski get the ball screen early Applause Music hes a freshman him with Jeffers but I I like the way Giles has been playing and I I hes hes his coach said hes a player he doesnt lack conference he talks to himself on the fourth and he hadnt answered himself yet so they dont worry about it they think hes okay but lets see what they do when they come out of this timeout both teams are in the double bonus so if Radford draws a foul you know they will go to the freethrow line to shoot two 95 on the clock here in the second half if youre the Highlanders you do have two timeouts remaining so if something breaks down you can still use one of those twotimeouts looking at where maybe theyre going to write a dribble hand up I cant imagine theyre gonna sit Giles over in the corner but because Jefferson police up to the task as well hes a veteran guy in a threelevel score himself called another time out of here its a Radford calls another timeout backtoback timeouts what did they see what caused him the cause the second time again I think youre just trying to identify what defense theyre in and you want to know whether theyre going to go zone are they going to demand and he might change the play now and decide to add something just in case Notre Dame does that because so theres a lot of games and going on right here you know what team can do both so you got to be prepared or have a play drawn up you cant have a mantoman play thinking its going to be a ball screen and they run back and running one three one zone so I would imagine theyre going to do something that has an option that they can run against Man Four Zone because they got nine nine seconds they got plenty of time if youre Mike gray in Notre Dame now that that second timeout has been called do you counter the chess move and change your defense its a gutsy call I got a better improve right so I I you know you got a better group of guys but you do have a freshman out there good question Im wondering is coach Nichols who is he going to attack is he going to attack the Freshman or is he going to attack making adjustment I think hes going to put one of those guys in the action and its out one of his Dynamic guards to go play youre right here theyve been loose all game go out and Win It ton of confidence theyre without ezia Cuda he has fouled out they without DeQuan Smith because he took that hard fall theyve got Jeffers Giles their goto guards on the floor they also have Brian Antoine and their two bigs are jewels and niang theyve gone to a big line up here so I think youre going to see him run up instead of ball screen early yep all right football here we go six seconds to play Jeffers getting downhill throws it up off the rim tipped around macheski comes down and hes fouled look how pumped up Nate lashesky is as he goes to the freethrow line 04 on the clock hey great drive by Jeffers he got the shot up got to the round they got another hand on the 5050 ball again but credit to Nate majeskis hes been the guy all night for Notre Dame thats a big time rebound right now to close this game out thats the difference in winning and losing the game now should there be more time on the clock Im sure coach Nichols is going to ask about it this is the option here is you want him to make the first one but right now Id ask him to miss the second one lasheski has 27 tonight his career high is 28 yeah this will be something that theyre going to discuss in a Timeout does he miss it he only got 4 seconds so well see if they add any time but theres not a lot of time there so I just you know I tell him to miss the shot but you go up three you give him a chance to get one off if they add any time now point four its just enough to catch it just enough to catch the shoot so if they missed the free throw you cant even set up a piece yeah you dont have time to heat it thank you thank you feet so Im pretty sure thats what theyll tell them I mean if not you give them a chance to execute a play which is what theyre setting up right now I encounter that by telling him to hit the square Music and you got to practice these situations to be comfortable in it but again this is where the experience of Notre Dame comes into play you got these guys theyve been in so many games like this Music be interesting to see which option they decide here so youre calling lecheski misses free throw I Im calling I would suggesting because Im not saying I mean its easy to say and they got enough push tonight hes got 27 so you know maybe hes playing well enough but again he may make it and they may trust their guys and say no foul I mean theres theres not a lot of time here so but again youre gonna give them a chance to execute a play if you make the shot what a ball game weve seen her eight lead changes tonight great game Notre Dame with a twopoint lead point four to play lacheski goes to the free throw line for one more game one of the season for Notre Dame this has been a thriller yeah and theyre 04 seconds away from them just to win first win in the year thats all you can do and this has been a team thats notoriously had a slow start to the season and again theyre missing the starting point guard lets see what they decide to do here look like Mike is coaching the guys up to be attentive hes gonna make it and he makes it hes gonna press the ball a full court even the buzzer oh off the rim comes all the way win it 7976 over Radford for head coach Mike gray in his 23rd season he stays perfect in home openers 230 with the win tonight over Radford great job Bradford came to play tonight got to be happy with the win to Mike Rays team the show theyre better from poised their leadership Kate bottom top they battled back to 10 again they got to show up some things but it wouldnt overreact its just the first game they just lost the starting point guard Music Nate leszewski and ties his career high with 28 points tonight going along with 12 rebounds and three assists the big man stepped up big when Notre Dame needed him to squeeze out a threepoint win dominant performance for him dominant performance Radford led by nine
