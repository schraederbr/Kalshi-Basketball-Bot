in however hes 0 and3 throughout his time at Georgia Tech but looking to get a win here in the ACC tournament in his backourt Nate George playing extremely well by and Dongo both sophomores are members of the all ACCC H and dango at 14 n during the regular season George at 6 and2 assists per game gets it off for POW dips that shoulder and goes in strong for two and the first basket today by Duncan pal the 68 junor and Duncan pal started the last 14 games for Georgia Tech and has really played great basketball since being inserted into the starting lineup now Virginia at 15 and 16 after dropping a 14point decision at Syracuse on Saturday an up and down regular season DayDay aims off on the first jump shot of the day but a team capable of getting very hot they hit 11 threes when they beat Georgia Tech in their first game look at the starting line here for the yellow jackets and we talked about Nathan George a guy at 6 and2 assists per game honorable mention all ACC and the number one assist man in the conference and gets one on that possession to Bango whos able to get a basket early so weve seen the sophomore for Georgia Tech step up early as we look at the Virginia starting five Isaac mcil who misses on that one the leading score in the middle of the lineup 14 points per game he gets 14 Saunders gets 11 11 those are the only double fig guys for the Cavaliers po who hit that first basket trying to back his way into the paint that one slapped away actually lost it he lost it himself and he turns it over and these teams met once during the regular season it was early in February mcne had 20 DayDay ases had 18 Virginia rolled in that one in Charlottesville 7561 that was actually on February the 8th which is now affectionally known as T Bennett day so when you think about that was a lot of emotion for Virginia playing that game at home against Georgia Tech and Ron Sanchez told us pregame they had a lot of emotion they needed to be able to find that again as McNeil is able to knock down the three ball 41 Beyond a threepoint line for the Junior from West Virginia who has tended to run hot and cold did not have a good game at Syracuse in that finale as he was just three for 10 but he can get hot how giving it up here to mustaf and hell turn it over Ro on a run Saunders out in front hell draw the foul Elijah Saunders the junor will take the Music hit Isaac mcil who led the ACC in threepoint percentage 41 gets a great look knocks it down and mcney has been much more aggressive as of late the latter part of the Season hes looking for his opportunities more early in his career he would have turned down shots like that to move to play the offense but now he is looking to fire earlier in the shot clock and it has helped this Virginia team become more efficient on the offens so if youre teaching proper form and mechanics on how to shoot a jump shot just look at that last one by mcne right I mean thats picture perfect it is picture perfect and of course he has the best guy to help him on the bench and Kyle guy who leads Virginia in alltime field goal threepoint field goal percentage so Im sure those two have got a number of battles in practice shooting the three ball Terry trying to take that Baseline around ases and slapped away and no deflection after that lets go back to that jump shot again because if youre teaching a 9yearold kid the proper way to shoot a jump just take this clip and run it well you start with the feet the footwork to be able to get the inside foot down and then power up on the outside foot but they follow through the release back back to beef what we used to talk about back of the day balance eyes elbow follow through see it still sticks it still sticks itll never leave A Life Lesson its incredible there a lot of us out there are like how come I didnt run into somebody to teach me exactly what you just said that would have done me absolutely no good anyway Saunders a little bit too strong and Georgia Tech on the Run Georgia Tech with only eight scholarship players available theyve really been beating up this year Terry Off the Mark and and hes a big key for them at 15 points a game but the odd thing is theyve been better without the players you consider theyve won eight of their last 12 games theyve gotten much better down the stretch coming into the ACC tournament started out 2 and six in ACC play but finish strong and theyve done it with you know very few of their players available AES on the drive and hes on the line too and hell turn it over thats their first turnover of the ball game we go to that injury list for Damon stmy of course was a g great player in the day played in an Arizona team and went to the final four and the players that he has lost to that injury bug and you consider the players hes lost kaasi Reeves was a leader for them Miss 25 games Luka bryen jvon McCallum was a starter coming over from Oklahoma they were expecting a lot of mustaf Miss time with the foot entry Lance Terry so and when Virginia played against Georgia Tech on February the 8 they were not at 100 so damus Adar looking forward with this opportunity to be able to play Virginia with this team at 43 Yellow Jackets you go to Charlottesville and its Tony Ben youre like okay well try another day George on a good drive will lay it in the honorable mention all ACC but DM challenged Nate George earlier this year especially with all the injuries to become more aggressive offensively looking to score hes of course we know the leading assist man in the ACC is 6 and half per game but he wanted them to put more points on the board and George has responded had four straight 20point games in ACC play Saunders gets a great look and not a kind Applause Rim mustaf bulling his way through and it comes free unable to get a good shot Music away and heres mcney Saunders again they move it quickly and good defense it was George coming out of nowhere and George fortunate on that one because hes already playing with one foul Dam star cannot afford for him to get one but does a great job getting his hand on the basketball and not committing a foul roof you talk about a determined drive but guess who stayed home and blocked it that was day a aims with the Applause deflection and roie will set it up now for the Cavaliers Saunders again roie wide open he sinks it from threepoint L and you cant leave any of these Virginia Shooters when you consider de James Ro and of course mcne who shot 41 from three you have dangerous Shooters you mentioned earlier OB they made 11 threes in the first matchup vers Georgia Tech and theyre off to a great start here as well theyre talking about how do you develop a picture SAR said I want to change things up so he decided to make sure that they were breaking their huddles with a different word in Mantra it is connected he said when theres a sense of urgency you have to be connected because everyone has to be locked in Nathan George as well mentioned how these guys have been able to step up for one another on the defensive end theyre moving with one another as well so thats how theyre staying connected but also feels like they can connect in this tournament and said they are very dangerous indeed moved it downstairs very nicely to Powell there for his second bucket and he has four quick points Georgia Tech in the paints already a nice little advantage and thats an area of concern for Virginia they gave up 42 points in the paint to Syracuse on Saturday and allowed the orange to shoot 60 from the field so one of the things Ron Sanchez wants to make sure he cleans up as what Virginias doing on the defensive end but off to a good start offensively roie dropping in two close in he has five Applause points George for Powell again hell launch but well short rebound knocked around a scrum for that and Dongo hitting the deck and a tie up on the play with 1336 to go itll go the opposite way Virginia ball Ron Sanchez the interim head coach of course replacing the threetime national Coach of the Year Tony Bennett on October 18th so late by the time he became the interim guy well and when you consider that hes taking over a team that is a very young team that added to the circumstances when you said there no Gra graduate transfers only one senior thats in the rotation for Virginia thats tame Murray at the top of the key so a young team by all facets in todays college basketball game buan gets his own Miss he was knocked to the Baseline theyll swing for roie and Dongo coming in to spoil that pass now Virginia if they beat Georgia Tech they will face the number one seed in the number one team in the country the Duke Blue Devils at 1200 noon tomorrow the Blue Devils beat Virginia by 18 back in the middle of February in Charlottesville McNeal off the curl cant get that one to drop as mentioned Georgia Tech with wins against Louisville and Louisville is number 21 and Clemson in an overtime game when and they were in the top 25 so they have a couple of very impressive wins pal dipping that shoulder it wont fall Kofi with the rebound the bay and Dango putting pressure on Virginia to make sure they keep a body on him every time a shot goes up hes attacking the offensive glass something that Virginia has to be mindful of they already got one offensive rebound looking for more and Dongo third Team all ACCC averaged a double double in ACC play only he and Eddie lamb can doing so B and Dongo playing his best basketball as of late with Dam STM we mentioned you know Georgia Tech won eight of their last 12 games and when you think about the fact that theyve lost so many different players a mallum a starter but they continue to get better as the season went along OB and youve got to give Dam star a lot of credit for the way hes kept his team together through their Applause adversary Georgia Tech winning the ACC tournament here in Charlotte on two occasions in 19 1990 in 1993 they beat Carolina in 93 beat Virginia in 1990 in this city and then the the most outstanding player of that 1993 tournament is now on the staff for Georgia Tech it will be one James forest in the building today talk with the most outstanding player from 1993 I was in that tournament OB but James forest was the guy and when you consider the Blue Devils coming into this building youre talking about a significant fan base however I believe were going to have a big time showing in our next game of Carolina blue think about the state of North Carolina Duke is the national brand but in this state I believe Carolina is the brand most of the young players that grow up in the hoop state which North Carolina is want to play for the tar Hills for college basketball well North Carolina gave Duke a serious run to a point in Chapel Hill they had a sevenpoint lead with about 15 minutes to go Murray lines up a long one and knocks it down T Murray the senior being honored on senior night for Virginia getting off to a good start knocking down to three and this is the key for Virginia when they make threes they normally have success we mentioned they made 11 threepoint field goals against Georgia Tech in the first match up one of the very few double fig wins that Virginia had in ACC play its Terry nice spin move but cant finish it it kicks right back to him for a long one he misses the three so that was a tough s seconds for him yeah Terry normally a brother to be good shooter both his shorts his threepoint shots have been short in this game normally a sign of lack of legs but Im sure Terry very well rested at this point but hes dealt with a number of injuries throughout this year only missed three games but hasnt played at 100 yeah the only Georgia Tech player remaining from Josh passner last team shot clock of factor down to four ams got a look at it got to get a shot in the air steps back three that missed badley Yellow Jackets trying to push it a bit but all of their points have been coming in the paint so Applause far up top for mustaf the 65 freshman from Maryland slamming on the brakes cant hit that his dad of course started Maryland it was a first round NBA draft pick he passed away last October yeah lost him in October and damire was truly having had big expectations for Jaden Musto throughout this year of course going through that tragedy absolutely slowed him down in his progress but he has noted that Damon and this Georgia Tech family have absolutely been there as a support system for him throughout the tragedy in the fall a lot of talent he started seven or eight games early in the season missed a bunch of games with a foot injury as the injury bug continued to bite the yellow jackets all season Applause long fou deep in the corner shot clock inside 10 thats bad spacing you cant run right over Lance Terry runs to the corner and brings his Defender thats an immediate dammar just as perplexed as I am why would you bring your okay so Duncan pal has a mismatch here you youre not theres nothing you can do there other than bring another Defender to the party youve already in that cofin corner that was kind of rude on the spin thats going to be a shot clock violation and Dongo couldnt get it off and theyve turned it over three times and that was a possession that was going nowhere for Georgia Tech theyre fortunate to only get away with a shot clock violation on that one in comparison to it being points on the other end for V off of Turnal Virginia in the blue roie gives it up heres Saunders off the Applause fake Saunders is open hes missed a couple of ones like that and Georgia Tech W for their last Music eight George trying to feed downstairs its knocked away intended for buing Dongo but it never got there really give Andre Ro a lot of credit under sized in comparison Dongo however he fights the battle down there forcing the turnover giving Virginia the basketball right Applause Music back AES on a penetration back for Buchanan and a onehander boy he got a terrific look yeah you cant ask for a better look than that Im not sure why it wont just shoot the midrange jump shot Blake can absolutely make that in comparison to going to the oneand push shot you can at 611 Dogo again and hell draw the foul he takes a hard hit down he goes to the deck and hell be up to shoot at the 821 Mark he gets a helping hand from George to get to his feet and the foul will go on Tane Murray OB we can see the emphasis from damire is to get the basketball Inside by and Dongo carving out some space and a nice find to get him an opportunity the hard foul but sending him to the free throw line forcing him to earn those two points in comparison to giving up an easy bucket sof more from Sagal at the line 65 shooter he said a nice yeara 12 double doubles four games of at least 20 and 10 one against NC State he went off for 29 and 17 rebounds hes been spectacular especially late in the season damus admire has been able to rely on him and really when the very few bigs they have available when you consider the lack of size that they have in available player but you look at the double doubles and everything hes been able to do throughout his last 15 games in ACC play he really is a Difference Maker for Georgia te top five rebounder in the conference and the first points by either side in over three minutes so it got chilly and 1312 Virginia Virginia the nine seed the yellow jackets of Georgia Tech the eight seed many times its one of the best games in a tournament like this the 89 game the 89 game is one that you always look for because both teams have had the opportunity to prepare for each other youve gotten four days to be able to work at and the 8 n game in my opinion is Advantage because you know your first two opponents youre going to take on the number one seed and of course if youre trying to make it run to the to the title so who better to face early than the number one team if you can beat the number one team then you can win the championship I guess there are two different ways of looking it like at that I guess one thing is yeah its great its opportunity the other way of looking at it is its the best team in the country maybe thats true but if youre going to win a h tournament youre going to have to beat the best team in the country at some point true enough Ames Euro stepping inside and that wont drop and po tried to save it and a timeout was called and granted to Georgia Tech so well take the break 722 left first half day number two moover blocker offensive system was and you see as five different Georgia Tech Defenders Have Eyes on the ball handler and Isaac mcy off of the dho Blake mchan is allowed to set a flare screen for Tame Murray who knocks down the three ball but this is a staple weve seen so many different players Joe Harris Malcolm brogon Justin Anderson Kyle got so many different guys getting looks off of that but its the misdirection that throws guys off because you have to pay so much attention to McNeal that you allow T tame Murray to get a wide open look on the opposite side MC at 41 beond the threepoint line meanwhile Georgia Tech just stuck offensively mustaf tried to get inside heres Applause Powell mcy right with him Terry whos been really quiet this is 15 points a game shot clock to two Mustafa Fall Away good tight defense Again by the Cavaliers OB there was a note in the great Mike stamoss Georgia Tech game notes of course moves to s for Georgia Tech Georgia Tech has not scored over 66 points against Virginia in this 13 game losing scen wow and so when you consider Virginias defense has been its best against the Ramin wreck they have bottled Georgia Tech up Saunders in the paint and hell draw the foul 628 left in half number one the Big 12 bracket that that fun fact I just gave you are you taking back the fun fact Im adding to it its not just the last 13 that Virginia has won its the last 21 meetings in this series they have not scored more than 66 points wow against Virginia had 61 in the matchup earlier this year sers at the line up to 1712 Virginia this is their biggest lead so far today and dmire is saying to our director Griff get that camera off me Ive only coached against Virginia three times I got nothing to do with that not all on those last those 18 prior to me arriving in the flats funny how the new guy has to wear it too though right you know he has very little to do with it Kofi collecting that loose ball and another turnover here for the yellow jackets they have six swooping inside so he gets it done on both ends and Kofi got off to a great start for Virginia this year slowed down hit a little bit of that freshman wall but playing good basketball down the stretch was in double figures in that match up first Georgia Tech the first time a freshman he rarely turns it over too hes very good with the ball powering inside the lay in by and Dango so Obie this is something that you and I saw for the first time against Pittsburgh Virginia went to a switching defense of course you would understand the way that they played defensively forever they brought it out brand new on a big Monday for Pittsburgh end up winning that game on the road and that was a midst of a threegame winning streak but thats one of the things theyve stuck with since is just switching defensively allowing their bigs to go out and try to deny those opportunities just like Elijah saers did there with mate George George with a Miss hes 33 outside the three Georgia Tech finally back on the scoreboard after a lengthy drought and within Applause five Saunders again barely nicking the rim and he played Just 16 17 minutes at Syracuse in a regular season finale after he got elbowed in the mouth oh the stuck Bango coming out of nowhere to slam it down well when Georgia Tech struggles to score bangos been the guy hes got both the baskets during the to end the drought for the Ramin wreck and even though Georgia attacks having such a hard time scoring Virginia unable to separate NOS absolutely you got to go box out especially with Bay and Dongo is in the pained area you cannot allow him room to operate as he goes over the top of Saunders for the Highlight finish to make it a one possession game you see why people talk about him what an exciting player he can be the sophomore from senagal he can also step out every once in a while and hit a threepointer yes he can hes very skilled dmire really loves his progression now hes made that sophomore Applause jump Saunders with the G A reaching a F theyll get Terry for that as this ones tightened up 1916 Virginia at one point was 1 and six in conference play after they dropped the game to Lille in the middle of January so to earn a first round buy here in the ACC tournament that is some achievement yeah it really is and when you consider of both these teams have nearly steps behind the screen fires away from about 25 ft and and knocks it down but both these teams got off to rough starts but you got to give both their crit the coaches a lot of credit for sticking with it through adversity and getting their team to play hard Damon STM of course getting his team to 500 in ACC play and Ron Sanchez winning the five way tie for Ninth Place at a record of 8 12 in ACC play ter trying to get heated up and drills the threepointer a fifth year guy who scored over 1300 points a tri for him and again 15 points a game if theyre going to win today he has to show up theyre really going to need produ from he and Nate George in the back court as well as a strong performance from mango up front mcil on the drive and a reach and a foul weve seen a lot of Isaac over the years thats a guy that I think the deeper he is from the basket the better he is he wants it at about 25 to 28 gorgeous day here in sh now back in Charlotte 323 to go first half Virginia and Georgia Tech tipping off the day and weve got North Carolina and Notre Dame in game number two Notre Dame advancing with a lot of controversy on a foul or no foul what should it have been didnt look like a foul by most accounts Notre Dame squeaks by date with the tar Hills in Charlotte I can tell you right now OB its going to be a lot of Carolina blue in the Applause building hear this afternoon without a doubt mango lunging am will have to fire it up there he got it off in time but could not hit the shot 2219 Virginia Applause Music Applause Music and Dango just had a spectacular dunk moments ago oh what a nice job using a window for two but you like the action that Georgia Tech is running to be able to get indongo into space its not its feeding him on the post but he runs the uphill dho with Nate George George is now putting it right where his teammate can catch and be effective Bay and Dango with 10 already along with rebounds and N George with four assists already so theyre getting what they need on the offensive end o nothing but net for mcne again as is Virginia when Isaac mcne is playing as such you see no hesitation at all coming off those scens looking to five he has 11 George rifling the pass pow In and Out Boy that was in the cylinder and a kicked out a great find from George getting downhill attacking the paint mcney really heating up as he is prone to do it 23 against Villanova 27 against wake in an eightpoint win in late February Kofi lines it up thats a rounding out hes rims a little bit unkind here in game number one Music today 2521 Virginia ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by principal let our expertise round out yours that is as true as it gets it really is its a thing of beauty to see Isa McNeilly shoot the basketball especially when hes confident in hunting shots hes got to be so aggressive that he even takes some bad shots every now and then Force the coaches to tell you okay maybe we didnt need that one but there very few times where they have to say that to mcney because he can make tough shots Music Terry to drive it contact there and a whistle as he got the shot in the air with a minute 17 left before halftime foued by mcne his Applause Music second so two fouls on the Junior and he is going to have to get off the floor here as D ases will replace him so he doesnt pick up a third before the break yeah minute 17 remain remaining you should be able to handle business until the second half and allow McNeely to be able to stay sit on the side and watch a great job by Kofi there getting a hand in the passing Lane and this is where Virginias been opportunistic and trying to run throughout the season not settling especially when they have numbers and Advantage trying to take advantage of it turnover is a bit of a problem for Damon Stam Myers team Georgia Tech with Applause seven quick inbounds to copi with a miss that was a quick shot by Kofi I dont know if thats the one that Ron Sanchez wanted especially off of the underneath inbounds the turnover George and a whistle no basket as hes hit before the shot he is fouled with under a minute to go and thatll go on Tane Murray his second a non shooting foul so Terry to put it in Music Applause Music Applause they want andago again hell draw the double crosscourt boof to the foul line keeps on moving and drops in two Loff just showing off his size and strength scoring over top of data a in the painted Area georia Tech makes it a one possession game Virginia should be able to get close to the last shot about a 5second differential between the game clock and the shot clock knocked away Ro he will scoop it up shot clock to 12 Kofi copon pow looking to make a move got to get a shot in the air now down to three on the shot clock aims with a two and short time to get one in the air here for the Yellow Jack its George on the drive de Canon with the block at the horn thats how the first half comes to an end Virginia and Georgia Tech locked up in a tight and the officials are going to stop for a moment lets see if they put any more time on its a smart play by Nathan George to attack the basket he recognized once he got the rebound that he had more than enough time to get to the end but an even better play defensively by Blake Buchanan denying that opportunity and they will put about4 seconds on the shot on the on the clock because the basketball is not out of bounds till it hits something out of bounds theyll go to point 4 seconds which is enough time to catch and shoot three you have to tip it but point four you can catch and shoot so theres still the opportunity for Dam STM to be able to run something to get a quality look on underneath out of bounds Music play so point four yellow jackets can tip it up Nathan George will check it Applause Music in opportunity to Tire Take the Lead here and they wont get one up there they are its going to be a foul theyll go looking to see theyll go look at the monitor to see if the foul happened Applause before the expiration of the clock Virginia is convinced that it happened after well with point four you only have time to catch and shoot so the clock starts as soon as it catches the hands but is there a foul already the previous foul is under review to see if the foul contact occurred before the clock got to zeros so the problem is if Buchanans hand is on the basketball early then this will not be a foul however as you look Buchanans right hand goes down on the catch M thats going to be up they they could very well give free throws for this one watch on the catch the hands are but the hand is on the basketball at first and then it rolls down to the wrist this is going to be dicey because if the hand touches the basketball first which it did with with Buchanan thats not a foul so thats on the catch you only have point4 second so there fou Cur at 0 point3 therell be two shots for Georgia Tech white 31 so we got two shots coming Virginia with the foul and that one goes against Buchanan his second andron Music Sanchez concerned because he if what I saw was correct Blake buchanons hand was on the basketball adjusted to 01 still time left by the way still time left but more importantly you get the free throws and thats the concern unless the officials saw that there was contact as soon as he caught the basketball second day in a row weve had controversy this one down the stretch of the first half not the end of the game as we saw yesterday in game one so pal with another one coming and this one can tie the game of 25 with 01 showing he does exactly that muray looking to put it in and thats it that is the end of the first half at last and it ends 2525 well and again when you consider how each and every one of these games that weve had so far come down to the last minutes often one possession shot clock to 10 McNelly cutting through no pass there shot clock down to three heres mcney again quick launch but no and a whistle as well just seconds into the second half thats the foul you got to stay away from if youre Blake mcon 90 ft away from the opponents basket no need to foul and now just like that you Canon picked up his third foul and Jacob Kofi going to have to come in and spell him but again its one thing to get your foul as a big man when youre trying to defend your Rim but 90 ft away from the basket L Canon too valuable to Virginia to make it commit that foul over the top and Dango tied up by mcneel no basket the foul came before that you can see the adjustment early though from damus dmire recognizing if Virginia is going to switch theyre going to look inside for Bay and Dango with a with a point guard a smaller guard trying to defend him and just like that Nathan George knows exactly where to go the basketball thats three fouls on mcely by the way oh and that foul yes when underneath out of bounds Play Obie you learned that we all learned that one early you take away the basket first dont allow that pass to go right inside for the easy layup first lead since it was 65 for the yellow jackets RO with a tip pass out for Saunders Saunders has had some great looks but hes been unable to bury them he really has and Ro actually had a great look there all he needed was a reverse layup to get the two points he decides to kick it out Virginia ends up with the empty possession Nathan George The Talented point guard theyll get the swing up top Terry great ball movement here mustaf Airborne cant finish Applause that Virginia looking for the win to get back to 500 right on 15 and 16 Yellow Jackets 16 and 15 for the season the winner gets the number one team in the country to tomorrow at noon the Duke Blue Devils on the run and tapped away and itll stay right here Nate George LED and Dango a little too much on that one great play by roie to get over and knock it away otherwise that would have been a dunk for Bay and Dango who had had his theme coming down the floor weve talked about the injuries for the yellow jackets again just eight scholarship players for Damon stanmire but that includes ja and McCollum out with a head injury we havent touched on him yet but thats 12 points a game and a really good shooter and more importantly your veteran presence youre talking about it still a young group for Georgia tchas mustaf is able to come in and clean up the mess off of the first Miss by by and Dango in this game but with two Defenders there trying to deny indongo no one there to can put a body on Applause Musta go be back for Ames a AES by Saunders again hes 0 for Applause six mcney shot clock to five Georgia Tech come out with a lot of energy defensively flipped up but no by mcal a big tangle for the rebound it comes right back to Virginia and thats two yellow jackets fighting for the basketball ends up allowing Virginia to come up with the offensive Rebound mcil with that quick release of three absolutely buries that is 14 but those Second Chance points are a byproduct of two Georgia Tech Yellow Jack is fighting over the basketball no communication there forces them to turn it over Dongo Saunders with the foul trying to prevent him to go to that iron again he had a sensational dunk in the first half 2928 Georgia Tech now North car I thought he was going to drop like 30 on Duke the other day he had 15 pretty quick ones he was really rolling and got off to a great start in the second half but after that the Blue Devils just pretty much took RJ out of the game forced others to try to beat him and they were unable to do so but a big win for Duke because again without that theyre the third seed in the ACC tournament amazing yeah but I mean you got three teams with 18 or more wins in ACC play thats never happened before the ACC went to 20 games in 2019 20 season but youve got a record 19 wins by the Blue Devils and then youve got both Clemson and Louisville with 18 wins and Clemson the only team to beat them in the ACC number one Duke roie will fire but that wont drop one and done for Virginia George trying to push it Powell going inside little too much on that pass and went for the save and an outstanding play yeah that was a great play by Lance Terry there to be able to get to the basketball but in midair throw it off of tame Murray forgive me off of Saunders look at this but to throw it off of Saunders and not get hit by the basketball going out of bounds stylish wouldnt it it very stylish there heads up play by Lance ter and give that an 87 you got to hold up your car Music Powell George again pow slithering in a little bit too strong in another whistle 1612 on the clock here in the second half of game number one of round two Ron Sanchez if Virginia beats Georgia Tech he takes on Duke tomorrow of course Ron Sanchez No Stranger of coaching in this building played a number of exhibition games here as well as showcases when he was the head coach at University of North Carolina at Charlotte for 5 years very familiar with the city of course and looking to have some success here with the whoos home of the ACC pow in close but no cant finish it but the second time that theyve been able to get the basketball right under the basket when underneath out of bounds play going to get a third crack at it and that one works and theyve got the big lead the yellow jackets to 3328 Georgia Tech just dominating in the Applause paint thats been a struggle for Virginia throughout this season is getting hurt with points in the paint we mentioned 42 against Syracuse they actually gave up 50 to an opponent earlier this year youan had elected not to take the shot and Virginia loses the basketball and all the momentum right who said yes yesterday you and Coach beheim were talking about this that Cooper flag deserved the defensive player of the year probably as well I I I think so for a number of reasons you start with the fact that hes on the best defensive team in the ACC hes the best defensive player on that team in the ACC but from a defensive rating standpoint hes number one National in the country the country so how is that guy not conference defensive player of the year long one around and out by George and look a lot of people say well you cant give him everything thats not true guess what give him give him everything he earned I agree you know and he earned Chucky he had a great year too great defensive year tremendous player he but maybe not even the best defender on his team P Kelsey told us that they made a change defensively is when Lis got better is when Terrence Edwards took over that role of guarding the opponents best player and he made them a better defensive team to me that means that hes the best defensive player on the team M I think it was a great point and I know a lot of people say ah you cant give him everything yes you can if he earned it the all defensive team its a great group anyway Chucky hurn an electrifying player that shot will go and a whistle too but how about the concentration of Isaac McNeely and the thing is he knows Obi well before he gets to the basketball he knows hes shooting this basketball thats the difference in mcney this year in the yearss past at this point he already knows when he touches my hand Im letting it Fly and Lan Terry caught off guard and chasing him runs right into mcney who misses the free throw how did that happen how do you do that know after a shot like that hes an 82 Bou sh yes so Georgia tick by two they turned it over Saunders out in front a dribble down and the slam but let think about that three by mcney and just like that Virginia going a 501 to make it a tie game once again and Georgia Tech Music turnover downstairs on the spin up and in by Sutton the 68 freshman with his first bucket and thats a nice play by Sutton I thought that Virginia did a great job stealing him behind the backboard however Sutton getting to that left hand and the jump hook allows him to put georia Tech back in front Isaac mcney whos in some foul trouble three another catch another shot not this time well youre shocked when he misses one the way hes been going today yeah really especially moving to his Music left Nathan George the top assist man in the conference this year again its Sutton gave up the dribble Terry shot clock inside eight now as hell drive it the scoop and the tip wont go for Sutton rebound a Chase for that great Hustle by George to bring that one in 20 seconds from on the shot clock but theyre going to reset the shot clock to actually 30 saying that Virginia had possession of the ball lifted by George hell knock down a triple big possession Gib George a tremendous amount of credit chasing down the loose ball and then turning it into Second Chance points George getting 12 points 6 and a half assists a game hes also an excellent rebounder at 63 Ros pass just kind of floated into no mans land no one alerting lance Terry that Tam Murray was behind him but you talk about George and his numbers only one player nationally has numbers that are rivaling George and that would be Braden Smith as George gets another assist to Suare but when you consider the his six is six but when you consider the only person that has numbers that rival that is Braden Smith and Purdue who was the Big 10 Player of the Year Angels got more on their JW hes absolutely outstanding but I think I have a fun stat for you to Cory you like fun stats his games with his hair braided he has nine of them he shoots close to 50 from the field 36 from three he his hand is all over this game right now its a triple double watch for him his hair unbraided though in the 19 games hes shooting significantly less at 38 and Dongo with a spectacular rejection man did he get back and his first block as he closes in on a double double and Bay and Dongo getting back and blocking the attempt by tan Murray Lance Terry stepping out of bounds so its unable to get the possession back with a great Hustle by Bay and Dongo denying an opportunity for Virginia in the open court a Georgia Tech after allowing Virginia to tie the game at 35 going on a 70 run to put some separation between the yellow jackets and the hoes ACCC tournament able to shed a little more light on a really gifted player like Bay and Dongo who probably does not get a lot of attention as mcney cant cash in 14 points9 rebounds the game all those double doubles hes closing in on another one today at 29 17 against NC State 26 and 13 against C hes said some monster game he really has OB but hes played his best basketball as of late when damis dmar had a full you know rotation Bay and Dongo was kind of the guy that was a little left out with the less players they had the more spectacular hes been how working on roie and a foul against Virginia and we have you covered on selection Sunday once again at all starts at 6 Eastern with sports center on ESPN recently now one of the great times of the year where are you going to be during all this I will be in Milwaukee calling the Oklahoma City Thunder in Milwaukee bus game naturally on on selection Sunday will probably be your third game of the day actually incredibly enough you are the busiest basketball analyst alive today I carry that with a badge of honor I I really do and Im very fortunate that our employer allows me to be able to go different places and have different experiences covering both the ACC college basketball in the NBA nicely done by Buchanan inside we call Cory privately Mr Sky priority Folks at Delta love to see him coming man thats my people my family my peeps are at Delta thats right 4337 power slam good find indeed but heres been the problem OB for Virginia they cant keep guys out of the paint and so Nathan George is now having his way getting downhill Duncan Powell filling the lane coming in and in comparison to waiting it was like a 7minute drought for Georgia Tech right but now here in the second half theyve been able to operate very effectively Nathan George sharing the sugar seven assists for him 4537 Georgia Tech with 10 and a half to go here in our very first game of day two and coming up Notre Dame and North Carolina at 230 in Applause Charlotte back from mcney he gets sealed off Murray with the drive and another rejection by indongo that triggers the break Terry has it slapped Away by am that was a beautiful pass from George but heads up by day day ases to not be folded by the look away and speaking of taking another flight to block tame Murrays attempt by and Dongo hes been picking on T Murray here today backto back rejections that is a first class flight Terry pulling his way inside cant finish Terry would have been much better served to take that one and drop it off to a Dongo especially how hard hes worked on the defensive end allow him to get a block you can a good feed and Kofi will finish that with the slam yeah Kofi recognizing the shot blockers going to jump the pump fake and then stepping under for the dump and Virginia now with a 40 run of their Applause Music own Terry needing some help in for pow and Nathan George will walk it up 63 sophomore from Toronto George second in the ACC in minutes played however first in ACC games played all 55 minutes in a triple overtime game triple overtime win at Clemson and Duncan pal is now starting to get going on the offensive end of the floor as well 15 points for pal shooting 60 from the field he just finished second in voting for the ACC Sixth Man of the Year Jeremiah Wilkinson and Cal won that pull up pop and offt Target by Ames one and done and George isnt going to wait hes going to look for opportunities to keep the foot on the gas pedal for Georgia Tech you better have your head up too you absolutely have hes the type of passer that will take your teeth out if youre not paying attention George wanted to step back Powell has it shot clock to nine Powell so strong inside and another basket for him hes having a day hes having a great day and hes been able to do it off of dribble penet penetration just going at Virginia Defenders and isolating on his side getting right to his spot yellow jackets with their biggest lead Music today mcney it opens up a bit but he cant hit it on the reverse the follow is up and good for Buchanan with 823 to go and we have a timeout well take the break as well Georgia Tech really grabbing hold of a game that was tied at halftime meanwhile North Carolina fan Charlotte Georgia Tech right now with an eightpoint lead over Virginia in big case because of Duncan Powell You call him the bounce back King he went over 11 against Wake Forest but its what he does in those following games Im not sure if its a shooter around or a pep talk but he averages double figures in the following game going back to Syracuse he scored two points 13 against SMU Clemson he had nine Florida State he had 20 BC three points and pit 26 and right now he is on his way to another stellar game here for the first round guys he has really shown up here in this one thats exactly right Angel and had a 2310 rebound game against NC State so he can really leave his mark on a game he really can just like Angel gray Obie how great is to have Angel back with us and giving us up depth stuff about first off were talking about braiding hair lets go back to that lets go back to the Nate George hair braided versus wearing the Thro analytics pow is shock clock down to two a fallway he drills it and Duncan pow has found himself on a heater right now Virginia has no answer for Duncan pal and how they can keep him out of the scoring column up to 19 points here so far this afternoon 13 in the second half the major reason the yellow jackets had the lead at the 7 and 12 minute Mark by 10 shot clock at seven Kofi back outside Ames is open and it comes right to Terry and Virginia and their first game of the ACC tournament is in trouble yeah Virginia struggling now to put the ball in the basket more importantly struggling to try to contain Duncan pal whos found his way on the offensive end not to mention Nathan George might get into double figures again an assists he forced that shot rebound comes right to Applause Saunders Cavaliers on the Move Saunders out for cops open hell take it strong and and draw the foul he elected not to shoot from about 14 ft he does draw the foul with 645 to Music go so a 10point lead for Georgia Tech job done for the orange 27 points five rebounds and two steals for JJ who was putting on for his hometown Syracuse Squad isnt that nice when you can do it for your hometown and itll be Co at the line Jacob cop is 610 freshman from Music Seattle 76 at the line he front rims the first one Powell I think he can add to that list of stars so far here in Charlotte what hes doing so far 19 points hes made eight of 12 George by the way nine points nine rebounds seven assists for the yellow jackets yeah Nate George on triple double watch now and again the seven assists is something thats probably going to be the easiest part for him that you would expect going in there getting nine rebounds you dont often expect that from a point guard but average over four rebounds per game so thats one of the areas where davmar leans on his point guard Cavaliers need a hot hand right now down 5142 driving inside and Day Day Ames will pick up the whistle hell draw the foul well theres no doubt about it the Southeastern Conference is loaded and heres the tournament bracket just feels like everywhere you look theres one tough team ranked in the top 20 that is going to be an absolute Gauntlet when you consider whats going to go down in Nashville this year for that SEC mens tournament Championship the concern is do those team beat each other up so much that they dont have enough left in the tank when they get to the NCAA tournament well I think its a great point because look at the tail end Auburn losing two in a row at the very end is that just you know running out of gas well and they they lost to very good teams they lost at Tex SM and you and I did a game at Tex SM earlier you know you know how difficult it is to play there and then they lost at Alabama so when you no they lost a home was that a home game home game yeah home game they lost to Alabama but in they rivalry thats always going to be tough as well so Auburns still one of the elite teams nationally but there are so many of them in the SEC this year my pick in the SEC tournament is Alabama shot clock to five heres George rolling inside and Dongo got it up there and he hit it and the eighth assist for George but those two have a great chemistry great connection they both got a tremendous amount of experience last year as freshman under damire in his first year and now have made that sophomore year and sophomore jumps Dango almost came up with another block but just a split second late so 5346 Georgia Music Tech Powell back for George George Powell and indongo have been the Stars today for the yellow jackets as they look to play again tomorrow against number one Duke Applause mustaf strong inside but left it just to the right of the rim nango with another offensive rebound and put back 16 points 10 rebounds qu blocks for Bay and Dongo whos already starting to put his resume together for all ACC tournament team George with the rebound so 5546 the Yellow Jack and George will take his time Music here point guard from Music Canada they try and get him with a double he breaks Music free heres Powell again nice pass cant convert that but a foul as mustaf takes the hit that was with just six on the shot clock and mustaf does a great job getting himself into position to help out pal as he drives Baseline and going to run into two Virginia Defenders mustaf gets right into that dunker spot gives pal outlet and finds his way to the free throw line Freon Saunders by the way must missed six games with a foot injury earlier this Music season a Georgia Tech team thats overcome a lot of injuries OB when you come in and you wear that number three at Georgia Tech youre talking about some legends that have put that Jersey on and I dont believe after this year anyone will wear that again because that number three was retired by Dennis Scott but you think about Dennis Scott War I Travis best War I the great stuff from Marberry War I youre talking about some Dynamic players look you remember those Georgia Teck teams in the 90s under Bobby kremin yeah played against those teams you played a game have to remind you for one second that that was some tough sledding and then we go back to 1990 when they won an ACC tournament championship in Charlotte Lethal Weapon 3 Kenny Anderson Brian Oliver and Dennis Scott Dennis Scott was ACC Player of the Year averaged 27 points per game that year a terrific play by ro got it for yes Ames able to beat every one of the basketball oh but off the hands of Saunders and out after all of that work to turn it over DayDay Ames with great effort getting the 5050 ball dammar not happy about the fact that his team didnt get it but Virginia turns it over and gives it right back and this is where you very much 5746 right now Georgia Tech now looking to inbound theyve got a couple of guys having big days three actually George with nine points 10 rebounds eight assists so he is on the of a triple double and Dongo is seventh double double in the last eight games and Powell has been a star today as well with 19 points for the yellow jackets and thats the thing its been a balanced effort by Georgia Tech throughout this game shooting 44 from the field Virginia only 32 difficult to win when youre shooting that poorly and you cant find a way to stop Duncan pal whos now up to 21 points this afternoon he said during a timeout a couple of minutes ago theyre not going to be able to beat us with threes if we keep shooting twos and making them another whistle here with 258 to go and man is he doing that he is now 9 for 14 from the field and all of those twos lets go back to that timeout a moment Music ago hey no threes still they cant beat us on twos no threes hey hes not raining twos and dunk it who started his college career at North Carolina t here in the state of North Carolina and then went to Sacramento State now finds himself in a beautiful role with dmire but he didnt start the beginning of the Season he started last 14 games as you mentioned earlier he was runner up for ACC six man of the year because of his efforts and what he was doing Off the Bench but since getting into the starting lineup over 14 points per game and has really become a reliable source of input of offense for Damon well the Cavaliers in deep trouble of being one and done in the ACC Applause tournament mcney right through for two and mcney getting downhill and is much more than a shooter could take more of those opportunities because everyones trying to run him off the threepoint line often times could get all the way to the basket to finish 19point afternoon for mcne that was a 10sec call give mcney a tremendous amount of credit as once the clock hits 20 seconds its an automatic call Lea cell right on top of it and if you have not established in the front Court getting not only the basketball but both feet that is a 10second violation super job by this crew Lee Cel Tommy morsey and marnur Saunders will hand off for mcney back for Saunders had a really tough shooting day five to shoot for Virginia mcne working on pow got in close and draws the foul 146 to go so getting updated on the other conference tournaments as we come to you from the ACC tournament in Charlotte championship week and the great weeks of the Year big 12 mens championship Houston the number one and right now the number two team in the country behind Duke yeah when you consider Houston now two years in the Big 12 two times Big 12 Champion Kelvin Samson two time Big 12 Coach of the Year you got to think thats a pretty good addition to the conference with youve seen just a with Houston with Kelvin Samson of course looking to get back to the final four and possibly win a National Championship which is really the only thing missing on his Hall of Fame residence a lot of people think this might be his year with that team yeah I mean when you start thinking about Duke Auburn youve got to throw Houston in there as one of the elite teams nationally in Virginia ratcheting up the pressure forcing a timeout from the rambling wreck damus admire not happy with the way his team is handling the pressure in the quarterfinal Yellow Jack itss by nine Ro off and a foul by roie stops the clock with exactly 90 seconds to go his second foul Yellow Jackets not a good shooting team not a good foul shooting team at 68 one inone time here actually have not been many free throws in this game and thats a byproduct of V Virginia doesnt foul much and thats one of the areas where when you get late game situations you find yourself still with the ability to be able to foul and have teams in one and one in comparison to being the double bonus so it works in their favor if you dont make free throws Boop pure on the first one sh you Ron Sanchez there the interim head coach Virginia looking for a head coach well if this is the last game for Ron Sanchez for Jason wiford for the crew thats been part of what Virginia has built over the last 16 years as a proud of them I will say that Im very happy that they were there and more importantly great people that have represented the University of Virginia extremely well of course Ronnie wman Orlando vros and you got the two legends both Kyle guy and Isaiah Wilkins on the bench Isaiah Wilkins Defensive Player of the Year Kyle guy whose number most likely will be retired at the University of Virginia soon so a lot of great people over there on that bench right now and if this is their last game I want to take my hat off to each and every one of and thank thank them for what they have done Im taking mine off too because its its not just something you say you know you hear that every once oh theyre great guys but these are really terrific people and weve got a chance to deal with them a lot all through the great years of Tony Bennett Tony himself of course aims on the drive will lay that in but this is a terrific group of guys and a tie up with a minute two left and theyre not done fighting down nine a minute and two remaining here the possession arrow does go back to Georgia Tech but Virginias able to flip the possession arrow so if they get another tie up it will go their Direction P gets it clear for Music Terry really hes been one of the offensive names of the year for the yellow jackets but they really havent needed a whole lot from Lance Terry CU so many other guys who filled those gaps today they really had theyve had a big three in this game you talk about George Distributing the basketball Duncan pow scoring from every different direction and Bay and Dongo dominating on the interior has really been a team effort but with three Superstars dropped this game for Georgia Tech Terry 72 at the line gets it back to 10 and hes been held to Four Points today we talked about the yellow jackets being a fly in the ointment Music maybe OB you you called this a couple weeks ago but we started showing the bracket of teams that could really do some damage uhoh again he does bring that that uhoh with those long jumpers hell have to commit another foul to stop it at 43 seconds but you you you brought out we started showing the bracket and you said Georgia Tech is a team to keep an eye on during the ACC tournament yep yep and I I know you felt the same way because of who they have beaten L of and Clemson when you beat the two and three teams in the conference now you get Duke coming up and it didnt go well when they fac them in December theres a 26point loss for the yellow jackets but theyve been getting better and better they came in having 1 seven out of 10 they have and when you consider that this Duke team coming in tomorrow is a new team Malik Brown is back however Jay Lucas is no longer with them Jay Lucas associate head coach is now the head coach at miam small things can alter the chemistry of your team and so when you think about this Duke team its going to be the first time weve seen this version of the Blue Devils tomorrow without one of their coaches on the bench now that said Duke is a spectacular team they have perhaps the best player in the country you and I have covered Cooper flag all season long were both in agreement he is the best player in America certainly the player of the year and the Rookie of the Year in the ACC so whats the game plan Whoever has to face Duke what is the game plan to knock them off their game if you can what you have to do to be able to beat Duke and of course this came from duke you have to be able to beat their switches you got to when they switch out defensively and theyll take you know their big guys K malawat Malik Brown whoever may be you got to have guys that can go make a play the bo Devils arent going to allow you to run your offense theyre disruptive defensively theyre not going to allow you to run your offense but Georgia Tech has a number of guys that can beat you off the bouns and theyve got guys who can finish on the interior I look for it to be a different type of game than it was in the blowout the first time these two teams met because I think Georgia Tech is playing much differently than they did oh my Kofi getting to the 10 6257 this ones still up in the air here in the timeout maybe a little premature talking about Georgia Tech facing them as Virginia has made this a fivepoint game off of the nice fake dho by Kofi and able to get downhill quickly for the dunp the fake dho getting to The Rim finishing off quickly but more importantly very little time running off the clock and we know that Georgia Tech has struggled with the pressure against Virginia love the wrinkle by Ron Sanchez adding the full court pressure into the mix for examples just like this when when you do get behind weve seen Virginia teams in the past when theyve gotten behind really didnt have a way to try to catch up but this pressure wrinkled by Ron Sanchez allowing them to stay in this game Georgia Tech had a lead of 13 points not that long ago it was 5946 since then the Cavaliers have gone on an 11 to3 run theyve gotten right back into game and again pressure situation for the rambling wreck right here to be able to get the basketball across half court theyve struggled with the pressure from Virginia weve seen a 10second call weve seen turnovers so Virginia ratting it up and this is one of the things that Ron Sanchez has talked about his team all year they keep fighting no against adversity everything thats G on they continue to fight and they still fighting with 36 seconds remain Bears repeating the yellow jackets are not a good foul shooting team just 68 36 seconds to go and Georgia Tech just trying to get it in here itll be Lance Terry on the Baseline looking for cutter and George they try to wrap him up and they do okay so thats remember on the tie up possession before Virginia flipped the arrow so now the basketball goes back to Virginia on it underneath out of bounds play with an opportunity to for them to score again without using much time and make this a one possession Game and Watch for number 11 in blue mcne as he tries to get free they stick with him heres his long one got it wow the inbounds George trying to bring it up twopoint game but you still cant play it out good foul you cant play it out because theres not theres no shot clock so you have to foul send Georgia Tech to the free Thro line but let me tell you right now OB theres more pressure on these free throws for Nathan George than theres been throughout this entire game look at Isaac mcney weve talked about him having the times to take some shots that may not be the best shots but thats how you build this confidence knocking down a long three to make it a twopoint game George is two for five at the line but hits the first 27 for mcnb way and look at the look on the face of David STM let me tell you what that young man I shouldnt call him young cuz hes my age and were not young anymore but hes made shots like that so he knows what that is to opposing team former NBA Rookie of the Year and two for George but still enough time for Virginia D aims to get to the rim quickly if you dont have a easy three attack get the bucket thats what McNeely did and knocked away with 123 to go theyre going to review this one but it was a great job defensively by Jaden Musto to get a hand on the basketball and it looked at first glance that though it went off of McNeely the officials will go over and review but the last to touch that is mcney now look whos keeping an eye it will be under review on this and week by with a controversial call yesterday and eliminated pit from the tournament so they review The Possession and did it go off mcne in the end which would get it back over to the yellow jackets who lead by four call on the floor is confirmed white ball 129 on the clock so it will be Yellow Jacket ball and great play there by moaf and theres a rule if the ball goes down its all ball if it goes up that means you got arm its a foul and that ball goes down does a great job defensively by mustaf knocking it off of mcney its a regain possession for Georgia Tech Georgia Tech the eight seed Virginia the nine seed Georgia Tech was pretty darn comfortable a couple of minutes ago that changed Applause fast and so Terry inbound 129 left in for George and and hell draw the foul at 118 118 on the clock and he is one of the best foul Shooters on the floor he makes 81 yeah make calmly made two on the last possession now an opportunity to make this a two possession game a sixpoint lead Cory hes played the entire game 11 points 10 rebounds and eight assists thats a 63 sophomore with all those boards and nothing new for him to play the entire game we mentioned earlier played all 55 minutes in a triple overtime win at Clemson and ended up becoming the ACC player of the week after that week another with strong performances back to back against Louisville and Clemson knocking off two of the top three teams in the ACC fivepoint lead for the yellow jackets and and make it six very calmly at the line George drains them roie on the drive the scoop no and in the final seconds the yellow jackets can celebrate the victory here in Charlotte they will win this one 6660 and eliminate Virginia here in the second round of the tournament
