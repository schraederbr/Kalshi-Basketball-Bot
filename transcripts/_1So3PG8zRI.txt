hes looking for a guy like Jose Alvarado like Moses right to step it up for the rambling wreck but when you go against NC State you know youre going to see full court pressure theres an extra guard in the starting lineup for Georgia Tech and DJ Burns is going to get the start after coming off the bench the last three games for the wolf pack Rodney Howard all over the place and NC State controls the tip and you see immediately the 131 from Josh pastner Kevin Keys talked to us earlier today Debbie about the fact that of course Georgia Tech will mix up their defenses well you know theyre going to give multiple looks and they change the top of that zone and they change the way they rotate with different looks it is really tough to study you got to run your man offense and you got to move the ball and try to get them in rotation and Georgia Tech starting their eighth starting lineup on the season as Debbie mentioned earlier Kyle Sturtevant back into the starting lineup started the first eight games of the season in his first start since in Sturtevant lets one go early and is on the point knocking down to three balls for a team that has struggled to score All Season that cant be a better start for Georgia Tech getting started it to get going outside the ark EJ burns with the look inside the Zone off the mark and Sturdivant pushing the basketball the easy one to Jalen Moore getting the easy bucket thats one of the things that Josh Pastor talked to us about they needed more transition buckets well they have to find some easy offense right theyve been struggling to get to the number 70 in ACC play theyre averaging less than 70 points a game closer to 65 as turquavion its a big triple and thats the thing Debbie it doesnt matter where he is on the floor you have to account for zero in Ridge aquavion Smith he had 18 points in the first half of the game here last year got off to a great start here as well Applause on that uphill pass thats the one that darkell joyners got to get this is where Kevin Keach really loves Joyner defending the basketball but another bucket in the paint Coleman some more who gets his second bucket here on the evening a three for three start for Georgia Tech that allows them to set this defense when they make NC State take it out of the net you know thats the one thing of course with Josh Pastor he relies on the defense he knows theyre going to be solid on the defensive end of the floor as for clavion Smith lets another one go unable to finish it but the offensive rebound for Casey Marcel who lines up the three ball unable to knock that down multiple chances for NC State doing the job on the offensive glass Joyner for three unable to get it normally two for a dollar works this time the Wolfpack got three for a dollar and get it back once again thats why you got to get on the glass against Georgia Tech because it is harder to get organized in that zone if you get offensive rebounds and kicks to the threepoint line theres turquavion on The Possession before knocking down a triple for the only basket early on for NC State and you made a great Point Debbie where you talk about getting organized in the zone thats the exact knowing exactly where turquavion is at all times a scramble underneath basketball will go in the directions of Georgia Tech you know Corey when we were talking earlier about what did Georgia Tech have to do to win this game at home and one of the things was scoring early to gain confidence set that defense Josh passner is so good at changing the rhythm of the game with the defensive looks that he goes with I even saw him working on some junk today dont be surprised if we dont see boxing one triangle them two at some point one thing you know for certain about Josh Pastor he will mix it up as cost ertimus Off the Mark Kevin Keats imploring his guys to get out and run especially off of missed shots you dont want to allow Georgia Tech to try back and set up their defense well and DJ Sprints back to the top of the floor where he sets that drag screen thats where the foul occurred you know DJ Burns has been coming off the bench the last three games hes coming off a career high seven assists for NC State he really passes the ball he really does DJ I talked to him about that earlier today you say hey what are you doing with all these assists man he talked about you know you I can drop dimes when I want to he also can Barkley you you know back you down back you down back you down hes built for that hes built for that Jaylen Moore playing with confidence early two buckets for him Rodney Howard getting inside going against DJ Burns but another chance for offensive rebound Georgia Tech third into ACC over 11 offensive rebounds per game thats one of the things that you have to account for at all times yeah and I like getting a ball to Josh Howard early like establish him on the Baseline see if he can get two feet in the paint Back DJ burns down put some pressure on DJ on the defensive end and Edward needs a dewana not making the trip so of course NC State nailed down three front Court players with the injuries that they have on the season more minutes for DJ Burns in this nice Bond when Georgia Tech plays through the elbows they have one of the better cutting games in the ACC look at this basket cut Ian Smith doesnt jump to the ball this is a great delivery by Howard and a terrific timing play by Georgia Tech and Debbie one of the things of course you and I know very well way back in the day when we were playing basketball when you play against a team that pressures you and denies the back door is always going to be a look Josh Pastor has his team prepared for that here this evening sir quavion Smith for way downtown hey we might want to call that Midtown I told you that he was warming up from the logo Im gonna have to get my tape measure out in the first half we might have to go out there at halftime and measure that one I tell you what I used to be able to maybe give it a shot from there now I have to throw the basketball to get into the room for that far away for real were going out there and measuring oh you got the tape measure for real Im not kidding with me for 20 years I tell you what it doesnt get any more official than Debbie Antonelli on the ones and twos Music Applause Jayla Moore once again on the inside in the basketball coming in out of bounds miscommunication from the wolf pack its in play Miles Kelly picks it up and scores the bucket the rambling wreck with a seven of six our early score Georgia Tech six for eight from the floor and NC States had turkavion Smith provide a couple of Threes that one from the logo and then I dont know what you want to call this Corey a lack of focus a miscommunication but Miles Kelly is in the scoring column based on his heads up play right there and one to go to the free throw line well call that either oops or whoops but either way its got Greg again a seat on the sideline watching whats going on right now as Ernest Ross gets his introduction into this game had a big game 17 points for him against Miami a career high eight of ten from the field and right now Josh Bassett going to stick with the one three one zone its been working outside of jaquavion Smith no one else with a bucket yet and a steal for Kelly who gets the layup once again and you have to appreciate the defensive effort from the wolf hope so forgive me from Georgia Tech here early on a 104 run well first of all darkell Joyner cant just dribble over mid court and pick it up I mean thats feeding right into the Trap and theres DJ with a drop off and Ross picking up where he left off and these two guys DJ Burns and Ernest Ross they were the stars in the game versus Miami where the wolf pack got a big win at home at PNC but Jalen Moore now with his fourth field goal here to start the game Georgia Tech is getting whatever they want offensively early on their defense is working theres a miscommunication but that goes back to what you were talking about previously with DJ Burns in his passing ability whenever you play against the Zone its important to have a guy in the middle of that zone that can make plays as Joyner comes out with the steal and the finish and the foul and thats what Kevin Keith love so much about jarkel Joyner we can talk about his offensive numbers all day but its what he does defensively that he loves most incredible ball pressure nose right on the ball great anticipation Kyle Sturdivant has been known to be stripped at midcourt a couple of times this season already remember we were talking about that before the game like we thought how they gonna handle the pressure of NC State they got to have a third guard on the floor sturdivance knowing to turn it over thats a Scouting Report steal right there it absolutely is a third of it now out of the game having a conversation with Josh bash on the sideline but you see NC State picking up the pressure and going to find someone to be able to go after Debo comb is going to be the primary ball handler theyre going to heat him up exactly what you want out of Georgia Tech you want you know theyre going to be frenetic defensively with their effort if you can speed them up on the offensive end you make them uncomfortable and Davon Smith stepping into the game at that point guard position but even still even though you dont take the basketball from him you force a bad pass another turnover for NC State as DJ Burns was anticipating Casey Marcel cutting to the basket but no cut ends up in a turnover thats where DJ sees the game like a guard right he has Vision on the top of the floor he understands the Zone he sees the angles sees the lanes in the zone not many post guys can do that they really dont talk with DJ prior to the game I said do you know Debbie Antonelli oh as Jayla Moore has gotten off to a great start double figures for more already in this game I asked DJ I said do you know Debbie Antonelli from from South Carolina he says not really personally but I know a lot about her I know who she is youre a superstar I know I know a lot about DJ I like talking about him oh my goodness is Ross going to drop some triples on Georgia Tech and I believe thats the first threepoint field goal made for Ross on the season I want to say he came in oh for two you know what the four players at NC State have gotten so much better not just their ball screen defense but Ross is playing with a ton of confidence coming off that huge game he had against Miami the block shot in the corner about to quavion Smith another opportunity for the Wolfpack to get out in transition the extra pass from Smith to Marcel unable to knock down the three but a good look for Casey Marcel in the corner Debo Coleman getting a good look from the top of the key doesnt go down but another offensive rebound for Georgia Tech and Debbie Davon Smith comes in averaging close to Six rebounds a game coming off the bench at the point guard position I mean Hes listed at 61 but I I think hes barely six feet and that just speaks to what a great rebounder he is look at the pressure from Ross ending up in the steal from Joyner the layup and just like that its a one possession game Kevin quiche has been in a lot of energy on this sideline you can tell how important a game this is for the wolf back Applause thank you Applause Casey Marcel with the block Moore has had his way in the painted area but not that time Casey Marcel standing his ground defensively ever since that timeout Kevin Keats called his team has been higher level energy better connected harder working a refocused group and that score was 136 when we went to break when they had that time out now its just a twopoint game yeah only the wolf back on a 102 run right now an opportunity to tie or take the lead on this possession after a tough start Kevin Keats has to be happy with the energy and the effort hes gotten from his guys in the last four minutes nice Bond underneath and the Wolf Pack bench wanting a goaltending on that possession as Ernest Ross Cuts back door the nice fine for from taquavion Smith well that was a not a makeable shot kind of like in football right its uncatchable so youre not gonna call play on that Roger Ayers is having a conversation with Kevin Keats right now because of where our location is right here next to Kevin were were watching coach keeps work up a lather here on the sideline yeah hes getting it in over here Debbie of course when we come to McCandless Pavilion we have the opportunity to sit right beside the visiting team bench so we have a little more insight as to whats going on foreign college basketball doubleheader Matt Cleveland leads FSU against jamarius Burton and Pitt in our first game at 3 30 Eastern then its off to the Dean Smith Center for Caleb love and North Carolina hosting to quavion Smith and NC State and another Tobacco Road rivalry matchup should be a great afternoon of Hoops right here on acc Network and the ESPN app Applause right now Joe lunardi seven teams projected to the NCAA tournament two on a bubble big game tonight Corey Clemson on the road to Wake Forest right after us Debbie I think it should be more I think Wake Forest should already be in that mix and honestly I think Syracuse is a team thats getting back as Smith makes another great defensive play his second block on the evening lets come back to that because I want to talk to you about Syracuse I agree with what youre saying we got a good one with a onepoint lead 11 42 to play left in the first half this is the Bracketology according to Joe lunardi that came out today Corey seven teams right now projected you see NC State projected as a sixth seed Ive seen him as high as a five and then being considered Virginia Tech and Wake Forest but you and I both like Syracuse I like Syracuse I think with Jim behomes group is doing this year has been incredible when you consider where they started and what theyre doing right now the way that theyre playing and with Syracuse that team continues to get better I think theyre going to be a great team well I shouldnt say great but a really good team at the end of the season and I think thats something that should be taken into consideration I think Jesse Edwards has been the key for them I mean if they had Jesse Edward last year helping with the bayheim boys I think they would have made a bigger run at the end all right I like his game a lot its careerhigh 25 points last night with Jesse Edwards in a game that Syracuse LED pretty much the entire second half Miami coming back at the end to win that one but you know thats not a bad loss Miami is a not just a good team but a very good team every Thursday night womens basketball takes over the ACC Network this week Diamond Johnson number 20 NC State host Haley Cavender and Miami at six Eastern Dennis the Rivalry matchup between number 13 Duke whos 161 and 60 in the ACC and number 17 North Carolina led by Deja Kelly averaging 16 points per game four boards and four dimes should be another good night for womens Hoops on acc Network and the ESPN app Miami Katie Myers team theyve won five in a row NC States lost four out of six Reynolds Coliseum will be sold out the wolf pack better show up I was talking about that with my guy your guy Dave OBrien on Saturday and I love the fact that the womens programs at NC State and in North Carolina play in Reynolds and Carmichael respectively I think it gives a great atmosphere for two great womens basketball programs and I know you guys get to go in there and do games you had a big game last Saturday at Carmichael right right North Carolina sold out Carmichael Arena first time since 2015 knocked off NC State who is higher ranked at the time and North Carolina is putting it together they look Courtney bangart lost four in a row theyve won three in a row this is a big game for them on Thursday against Duke now tell you this you are the Czar you are the mentor of mentors when it comes to broadcasting when it comes to television personalities media personalities Etc have you got your hands on Deja Kelly yet because she is a star in the middle yeah shes a big time player too shes the energy of North Carolina shell play well on Thursday night speaking of playing well Rodney Howard continues to play well shooting at a high clip the tip in for him off the offensive rebound and thats an area where Kevin Keith came in concerned about this Georgia Tech team as DJ Burns gets his first field goal on the evening once he gets inside the middle of that zone you let him you know DJ was a guy that reclassed up went to Tennessee out of high school of course made the trip to transfer to winthropus Roddy Howard knocks down his second straight bucket but I like seeing DJ burns with Kevin keys and hes not necessarily the style of player that Kevin Keith normally goes after but hes fit in very well with the Wolfpack I mean right now Georgia Tech is elected to play him straight up and NC States getting him the basketball right here on the elbow and he has been dropping dimes the missed opportunity right there mishandled on the pass with three assists already for DJ but the seventh turnover for NC State here in this first half you know what Corey I think people forget that DJ was in high school with Zion Williams and then there was DJ yeah I remember DJ but DJ was eybl guy though he was on the Nike side while Zion was playing with the three stripes you know Jeff Gravely at NC State did a great interview with uh with DJ the other day about you know how much he loves NC State how much he loves the fans they were chanting his name the other night for the Miami game he loves it hey Debbie Ill tell you Ive known DJ since he was a freshman in high school his personality has not changed he was this guy way back when he was 14 15 years old gotta stop that guy early you cannot give to favion Smith that look Georgia Tech dodging a bullet on that Music is his footwork hes got great range hes got great confidence but he gets into the Rhythm and shot very quickly because he has excellent feet I agree with you wholeheartedly on that and I will add one thing to it his confidence hes got it speaking of confidence Jocko Joyner has as well and Rodney Howard Over Georgia Tech playing with a lot of confidence on the offensive end of the floor lets pray hold back substitution number 10 NC State going with a really small lineup on the floor right now four guards and DJ Burns and you know as well as I do what that opens up is opportunities to offensive rebound Javon Franklin on the floor now for Georgia Tech one to better offensive rebounders in the ACC so its going to be interesting to see how they keep him off the glass Casey Marcell sidestepping knocking down to three coming in shooting 45 percent from Beyond the threepoint Arc one of the best in the ACC from a percentage standpoint and really been a great addition to NC State after transferring from Virginia Kevin Keets calls him a workout Warrior hes first guy in the gym hes the last to leave and hes really improved this game this has been the guy for Georgia Tech in the first half Jayla Moore already in double figures going to the midrange a little hard off the glass but no defensive balance getting back as Joyner pushes it but a big time block by Davon Smith covering up the rims all right Applause this is a tough transition right here for the wolf pack its a two they dont get on the other end and its a foul on DJ on the defensive end jark Kell on the push look at the closing speed of Smith Music things have changed well what changed for NC State is their defense right they picked up the intensity jarkel Joyner got a couple of steals made a couple of layoffs turquion Smith has hit a couple of threes and Georgia Tech was playing through the elbows they were playing inside out theyre doing a good job of getting into the freethrow line here in the first time and you mentioned Georgia Tech this was exactly the start that they needed 20 points in the first six minutes of this game theyve stalled since but Josh bassner talked to us about how important it was for them to get off to a good start one of the reasons why he made the change their eighth starting lineup of this season getting Kyle Sturtevant back in the starting lineup the detail the Precision that Josh passner ran through shoot around today was amazing just the different looks defensively what hes thinking about when the ball is dead when the ball is live what what he wants to call they like to run Princeton but hes got to call some sets I mean fascinating hes admittedly a repetitive repeater he likes to go over things he likes repetition and wants to make sure that his guys get it whether its him saying something or doing something as DJ Burns gets his second bucket driving past Howard on the interior of that zone Freon pass has done a really good job defensively he was stuck on a bigger guy before the timeout now hes got Davon Smith you would expect what Brian passed of course to be a great defender great feat coming off the Gridiron of course where he was a two score star getting beat on the back door on that possession and weve got a little bit of a mix up nothing no harm done but Davon Smith on the back door would finish I mean that is so quick again its a nice sleeve by Howard thats the second time Georgia Tech has been able to get that exact cut and look at the Hops on Smith and Debbie youve been doing this longer than I have and youve covered this ACC for a long time so you can think back to Ben Lammers making those same plays right there at the top of the key when Josh pastner first took over here at Georgia Tech and you see Rodney and Howard showing off his passing ability as well you know Josh mentioned uh Ben today actually about facilitating through the elbows and how much he missed Ben David Smith attacking the basket once again yeah great Im sorry Brians got to be raising his hand on that Corey because DJs in the vicinity you cant get another foul on DJ but that c again thats why I mentioned you as one of the best basketball Minds thats a vet food Brian pass is the software right now he may not recognize that yet that he has to be the guy raise his hand to take that foul to keep the big fella out of foul trouble you know what Corey back in our day we had to raise our hand they dont do that anymore I never raised my hand every Thursday at 10 Eastern right after our womens basketball doubleheader the nothing but neck crew will break down the night in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every womens game and look ahead at the best games on the schedule in the coming weeks has coverage you can only get one place right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app so you can watch anywhere Applause and thats just great Patience by jarkel Joyner in the twoman game they are always looking for each other Joyner and Smith yeah these two guys play very well together you would think that theyd have much more experience than they do but I can remember them coming in on media day and just seeing the way that theyve already bonded early and you can tell that its matriculated onto the floor Applause he really is his stat line is outstanding its five assists and right now Georgia Tech is damaging NC State points in the paint that has been the struggle for the wolf pack and we have to mention Ebenezer dwana not here unable to make the trip and he is the rim protection for the wolf back without him on the floor you see Georgia Tech has made a concerted effort to get that basketball in the painted area a 2214 Advantage points in the paint I mean Im not saying that DJ needs to rest on a defensive end but hes got to be careful like like that right there you cant pick up a cheap one reaching it but you know as well as anyone most fouls come from fatigue when youre tired thats when you commit those silly fouls being out the wrong position as Casey Marcel comes up with a great defensive stand well you want your perimeter defense to be really good so you dont put pressure on DJ and let them get to the second level nice fine from Smith to Terry in the corner unable to knock it down now Debbie of course you watch as much basketball and break up down as much film as anyone as Joyner gets an easy bucket blowing the doors off of Terry getting the easy one but when we come back I want to talk to you about to quavion Smith does he settle for jumpers too much because hes such a great shooter Stitch fix when you dont have time to shop well do it for you tell us your style size and price range we learn what you like and what you dont then our style experts deliver clothes that match your Vibe and fit your wallet with try before you buy keep what you love and send back the rest plus shipping and returns are on us its the easy way to get pieces that fit Stitch fix get 20 off your first purchase back up a Camas Pavilion and earlier in this game a basket that was given to Howard was taken away and actually given to Franklin so theres going to be a change in the scorebook on this one but Debbie we talked about to quavion Smith a great shooter 96 made threepointers a year ago as a freshman third alltime for a freshman in ACC play but he has the ability to attack the rim and score off the bounce does he settle too often because he is such a great shooter when he catches in Rhythm and he doesnt put it on the bounce and try to create on his own you know just to pull up for a jump shot I think thats when he has when the ball gets stuck thats when he has a problem when he catches it on a reversal and he looks to make a move quickly I think he can take any shot he wants and hes one of those guys as Rodney Howard knocks down another bucket and hes had success in this one but taquavion is one of those guys even though hes righthanded he jumps off of his right foot dumps lefthanded we saw that a lot from him during his freshman season a number of times here on this court as DJ Burns misses the look on the inside he has the ability to attack the basket and finish I would love to see him do it more often well it depends on we have dark Hills on the floor jarkels on the top of the floor turquavions on the wing now people gotta remember to wait turquavion also leads the team in assists speaking of finishing how about day on Smith man I mean he comes off the bench hes energetic hes bouncy hes aggressive and he can finish at The Rim we talk about his ability to go up upstairs Casey Marcel driving to the rim unable to finish but DJ Burns right there Johnny on the spot with the second chance opportunity but Debbie you talked about it earlier DJ Burns has played a lot of minutes in this first half and hes visibly winded right now put them in tough position when you put him in that pick and roll action Applause the foul you have to call its unfortunate because its a loose ball but it was a takedown at the 50yard line and Davon Smith turn the corner young man throw it down for both these teams NC State at home versus Miami and an overtime win scored 52 points in the paint against the U and conversely here on their home court Georgia Tech only scored 16 points in the paint against Pittsburgh on Saturday Pittsburgh score 30 against them and its been a reversal of Fortunes this evening thus far Debbie well I think a lot of it has to do with Howard facilitating the offense through the elbows look at the numbers three point goals last game against fifth they made 12 tonight theyve just made one NC State is doing a good job of guarding the threepoint line but I think NC States got to keep moving the ball keep attacking keep going inside out and playing through DJ I agree DJ Burns making things happen when he gets his hands on the basketball in the painted area another opportunity for DJ after the break moves Rodney Howard out of the way going to that left hand once again able to finish deep in the shot clock throw it in there and he can bail you out you know and such a smart player hes recognizing of course DJ told us earlier send the double team come on I want you to send it because he likes dropping dimes out there but if you dont send the double hes going to win that matchup versus his God mantoman see this is where Howards got to swipe it and look to attack DJ swipe it through absolutely Jayla Moore continues to go to work in this first half Georgia Tech has not trailed in this game and more now with 12 points Applause one of the things that Georgia Tech did really well in shoot around today is accelerate through their action in the quarter Court I think if they can continue to cut work hard play right there again off through Howard yeah nice cut by Smith unable to finish but right now its an advantage for NC State and this is the guy you got to find him in transition to quavion Smith attacking the basket able to get it to go one Defender not enough to stop Zero from getting two thats ten points for turquavion in the first half to lead NC State scores Applause thats what youre talking about Corey right put it on the bounce I like to see him playing that way of course he has the quickness he has all the ability to score in many faces as Debo Coleman lines up the three unable to knock it down but the offensive rebound for Davon Smith and the opportunity to go to the freethrow line and extend the lead for Georgia Tech the back double doubles points and rebounds for the point guard for Georgia Tech attacks turkuevion off on off Advantage Crossing up his D attacking off that closeout such a great threepoint shooter teams are going to run him off the line so the more he mixes in those opportunities for him to attack the basket and again this is what I love the most Dame hes down one hes still smiling this is a young man who has fun playing basketball and of course for old schoolers like me not necessarily you youre ageless but at the same time we appreciate seeing guys like that ask to quavion why he had his shirt off earlier today in shoot around he says I am bgu thats big guard View and thats a big move from Big guard you to get the first lead of the game for the Wolfpack tomorrow Applause s Kelly from the top of the key unable to knock it down quiet first half for Miles Kelly who leads Georgia Tech in scoring Kelly is the guy that Josh pastors talked about when they have to play half court basketball they need for him to be aggressive Josh pastors you know he talked to us earlier about the fact that right now where Georgia Tech is struggling is they dont have that one guy like a Jose Alvarado who could just go off the bounce and go get his own theyre looking to find someone that can be a scorer for them in the half court stay up there get up there draw two move it LJ Thomas is getting better every time he gets minutes from Kevin Keats hes a bigger guard you can see aggressive attacking the basket strong enough to be able to get in there finish but I love this footwork and playing under control all two once he got in the painted area Kyle sturdivin who knocked down the first three of the game for Georgia Tech off the mark on that one now you see NC State wants to call the timeout Kevin Keats wants to try to run down these final 22 seconds and get the best possible look as his team has taken a threepoint lead with 22 remaining when you have Auto Glass damage trust safely this dad and daughter were driving when they got a crack in their windshield pullover he wouldnt take his car just anywhere so he brought it to Safelite we replaced the windshield and recalibrated their cars advanced Safety system so features like automatic emergency braking will work properly all right all finished wow thats great thanks stay safe with safe flight schedule now Six Flag repair safe light replace okay Coach Antonelli an important possession for NC State before heading into the halftime locker room what would you like to see here from the Wolfpack Id like to see the ball come into DJ and let him make a decision with it I think youre gonna know you know that Georgia Texan is saying that Zone theyre gonna trap on the top I would draw two move it play through DJ started out and right now Josh pastner showing a mantoman look switching it up going into the timeout thinking that Kevin Keith will draw up something to play against the Zone but Georgia Tech Will morph into a Zone to clear mantoman its a good adjustment its a good call by coach passler Im still doing going through DJ Applause they had a foul to give oh no they did thats oneonone and thats a tough foul right there you put to quavion Smith on the free throw line with an opportunity to add well I like the adjustment by Josh pastner mixing it up last possession Kevin Keats cost timeout he changes his D you get DJ burns out now because its a defensive possession after the free throws you dont want him to pick up another one hes just got one great call Debbie and if Im Kevin Keets right here you make this second free throw Im thinking we go with some full court pressure 72 see if you get a steal and a look but to try to speed up Georgia Tech take them out of whatever they want to do but get somebody on Miles Kelly because Smith is going to push and the substitution by Josh pastner allows Kevin Keats to be able to get Brian passed back into the game taken to quavion Smith off the floor bringing Lance back on the floor as well gives them another threepoint shooter Applause Avon Smith with an opportunity at the end of the half unable to finish it great job defensively by Breon pass as NC State ends the half on a 80 run over the remaining in the last 243 of the half Casey Marcell getting the ball to Cleveland Smith who continues to be aggressive attacking off the bounce to the finish and of course the smile to the partner carries around a tape measure but this tape measure is your second tape measure because your original tape measure that you started doing that with is in the Womens Basketball Hall of Fame one congratulations and secondly that is spectacular the fact I get this the first time Ive ever done a game with a Hall of Famer by the way well listen uh the product is the narrative when Im just enhancing the product by going out there and measuring how deep if the threes are sometimes you just got to go out there and measure you have been enhancing the product for quite some time young lady and when the game is better because of you look I love you too buddy Applause we love the game we love the people in the game yes we do we work with a lot of great people and get a chance to call ACC basketball which there is none better is jacquel Joyner gets inside and finds Greg Gantt whos able to finish on the reverse layup and that is where the difference has been made for the wolf pack in this one attacking the paint Debbie I think thats what they have to do is play inside out get the ball to the middle playing through that middle third of that Georgia Tech defense third of it with the pass inside to Howard who Maneuvers around the basket unable to finish but another offensive rebound for Georgia Techs third of it from the top of the key unable to knock it down and with DJ Burns in that one foul I think he can get a little more aggressive in his defensive effort around the rim the turnover from Joyner the ninth turnover of the game for NC State is Casey Marcel Music applying to defensive pressure to Miles Kelly at the top of the key good job on Miles Kelly tonight switching off on him NC State likes to switch one through four Kyle started but going to the midrange getting the bucket and Debbie Im so caught up in getting a chance to work with you today I forgot to mention Dark World Joyner with three turnovers has turned the basketball over for the first time in five games as another turnover for NC State Joyner came into the game playing on 143 minutes without a turnover over the past four games Applause Kevin keeps cant believe the foul on again I thought he got the ball first and then I thought Miles Kelly tripped over the ball yeah thats a tough one to go against NC State right there it is that got a great crew on hand today of course led by Roger Ayers whos the best of the best Lee Cassell right there with him and the Paul sells joining out the trio today Music Im sorry Corey NC States got to do a better job of bumping that cut back door Coleman attacking in the midrange well I was going to say the exact same thing that you said so well just say great minds think alike it is better that you said it than me NC State bringing that screen much higher DJ Burns coming out close to half court to set that ball screen as Casey Marcel finds himself in the corner still nine seconds remaining on the shot clock but a strong attack from Casey Marcel and again hes another one of those guys who is a knock down shooter its best evident in his percentage but can benefit himself and his team by attacking the basket even more one of the things Kevin Keith told us is Casey has gotten a little bit more comfortable playing at this pace right at a faster Pace acceleration through their offense not just the up and down vertically but playing in the quarter Court a little bit faster much more confidence because hes worked on his game so much in the off season foreign the transfer portal closes and our huddle crew will have a full breakdown of college footballs top players who landed at ACC schools coverage begins at nine Eastern 6 Pacific right here on acc Network and the ESPN app the portal closes I didnt know the portal ever closed Im sure theres some people out there wishing the portal would close forever foreign Music handling the basketball being pressured by Joyner and this matchup has been one to watch the entire night thus far Joyner putting tremendous pressure on Sturtevant trying to initiate the offense and you see how late Cleveland took a shot to the ribs hes down three its hard to tell from that angle exactly Music and Roger air is over at the table the officials are going to use the under 15 timeout here to review the action is to quavion Smith tries to gather himself we have the opportunity to sit down through a timeout was walking around with his shirt off if your big guard you you got to be able to take a body blow got a little bit of a body Blow from Rodney Howard coming off the screen right there and it took them down so the next time I have a conversation with the quavion were going to talk about whether hes really big guard you or not you think that turquavion has an ounce of body fat on him zero thats why he wears a number zero has no fat whatsoever I mean and I dont think he ever gets tired but look at him back smiling that thats what I love about him up off the bat up off the canvas smiling once again thank you another offensive rebound for Rodney Howard and thats going to be the second foul on DJ Burns you talked about DJ staying out of foul trouble in that first half but Howard getting great position to come up with that offensive board telling you Rodney Howard hes got nine points hes got five assists doing a fantastic job in this matchup right here being a facilitator through the middle third of their offense and we came on air talking about the guards it has been a great matchup with the bigs in this one you consider DJ Burns and Rodney Howard Jayla Moore continues his excellent play in this game another bucket for more going to the jump hook to make it a one possession game Applause Music all right well he be on Smith from logo range once again unable to finish that one Kyle Sturdivant with the rebound and they push Miles Kelly lines up at three unable to knock it down that would have been a big bucket for the yellow jackets Corey NC States got to stop playing just on top of the defense and quick shooting like that not a pass and a quick shot if you stay on top of the defense and you never play down inside or take the ball to the Baseline you never bring the top of that zone into the paint then you get the ball reversal and it opens up space on top and to your Point NC States had most of its success throughout this game when theyve gotten the basketball inside the zone to DJ Burns allowed him to be the facilitator correct you can go inside you can go to Baseline short Corner somehow get behind the defense that collapses another nice pass from Burns but more coming over covering up the rim as cost Irving gets out in transition attacking the basket great job by Ross playing with those two fouls staying vertical and not picking up the foul Kevin Keith was looking for goaltending on this play right here but now thats on its way up its not in the cylinder amazing I think its a great block and its amazing how the energy on the offensive end and having success offensively has really changed things from Jalen Moore in this game coming over making a great defensive play but hes got hes got his confidence going on the offensive end of the floor well hes hes not a very good threepoint shooter right now in his career he can do other things to help the team win hes doing those thinks tonight rebounding scoring in the paint being aggressive attacking Casey thats what Im talking about Corner three you called it okay you stay on top and the Zone stays on top but if you can get some vertical push whether its off the bounce or passing to the corner you can get behind the defense well and one thing of course you know this we teach the young people at home the most difficult place to guard when you playing get some one three one is that corner is those Baseline Corners its so difficult for whoevers playing that back line when the ball change the sides of the floor to be able to get out there and cover a shooter Casey Marcel standing his ground another great defensive stop the kick ahead pass as Joyner is able to climb the ladder and go get the finish the dunk and just like that NC State pushes it out to an eightpoint lead defense leading to offense for the pack ing it up Rev it up the thing is that you not only have a good resume right now youve got lots of opportunity for Quad one wins inside the league moving forward and Greedo Harley you look at the next five games for the wolf pack at North Carolina of course that would be a quad one win if theyre able to get that Notre Dame at home at Wake Forest which would be another quad one win and then home with Florida State so as you mentioned a number of opportunities for the Wolfpack to continue to bolster that resume and I can tell you right now that Saturday match up it the dean E Smith Center is going to be rocking when the wolf pack entered the building foreign not working on that possession Kevin Keats here hes entertaining right hes been entertaining you know that is one of the benefits of doing games at Georgia Tech doing games at Clemson you get an opportunity to be able to you know really see the coaching styles of the visiting coaches now we dont get the Outlook that we normally get being across the floor and getting to see the reactions from both benches Etc but this is an additional perk to being able to sit right beside the visiting bench and I cant tell you one game that Ive done especially in this building where I did not have at least some conversation with the visiting head coach even coach came here actually talked to me a little bit after Corey was that the right call you know so weve been through that a number of times here as long as they dont ask us how many fouls one of his players has or how many timeouts they have left were in good shape you would know that information though I talk too much to even pay attention to that come on I thought the game changed when Davon Smith came on the floor for Georgia Tech I think he is a rhythm changer for them on both ends of the floor yeah I agree wholeheartedly Tristan Maxwell getting inside the painted area another turnover for Georgia Tech leading the wolf pack in a transition Casey Marcel in the same spot where he just knocked down the three unable to get that one to go as Jalen Moore Corrals a rebound not only did he get the rebound there were three red jerseys around him oh open three Casey Marcel looks to the bench my bad thats a wide open three its a rebound and a Sprint up the floor Music see those are the plays that can change the game right it could have gone from eight points to 11 then you set your defense now Georgia Tech is at the free throw line and Lance Terry is an excellent free throw shooter foreign heres Saturday college basketball doubleheader Matthew Cleveland leaves Florida State against jamarius Burton and Pittsburgh in our first game at 3 30 Eastern then its off to the dean E Smith Center for Caleb love and North Carolina hosting sir quavion Smith and NC State and another Tobacco Road rivalry matchup should be a great afternoon of Hoops right here on acc Network and the ESPN app Applause good Hustle by Marcel one of the things that Ive really noticed and this is the first time Ive seen the wolf pack live this year Kevin Keiths group plays hard they play a lot harder than they did even a season ago where a lot of those 50 50 balls go their direction that they didnt get last year oh theres no question I think theyre not only they play hard they play connected like that right there I mean Ernest Ross almost got his face taken off on that pass and thats the thing if youre going to be a passer throw it somewhere where your teammate has to catch it you throw it at their face they better catch the basketball but the leading scorer in the ACC gives up what would be an easy look to get another look for his teammate in the largest lead of the game for the wolf pack and this is a pivotal stretch right here for Georgia Tech another push for de cuevion Smith who has become so much better as a playmaker this season in comparison to just being a scorer which he was a year ago Debbie well thats one of the things coach catch talked to us about right go to the NBA Combine what do the guys tell you in the NBA become better passer become a better facilitator right get better on your defense we already know hes a dynamic offensive scorer but hes out of those other things to his game consistently this year he absolutely has Debbie I was at the NBA Combine covering for ESPN last last spring and turquoia Smith in his first game at the combine hit six threepointers scored 20 points and kept we had Kevin Keys come up to the table afterwards and Im just looking at Keats saying you know hes not coming back right so did everybody that wears red yeah roots for NC State thought it was over very mature decision by taquavion Smith to come back to get better and I do believe that by winning more importantly than anything else he is enhancing his draft status heading into this year or if he decides to come out he may stick around with the wolf pack and I know of course they would love to keep him in Raleigh well jarkel join our eligibility expires and so does mahorsich by the way hes probably watching right now from the training room where it is he spent six to eight hours in the training room trying to get back because he wants to play and look Off the Mark for declavion Smith who was on the floor Jalen Moore contested that shot Tristan Maxwell Im sorry glance Terry attacking the basket and is able to get the bucket through the contact an opportunity for the threepoint play a big basket right there Debbie for Georgia Tech known as a threepoint shooter and watch Lance Terry gets his shoulders by the defender thats how he can handle and absorb the contact high off the glove here at Georgia Tech a very exciting stuff for the fans and weve got an exciting night around the ACC Debbie well baycod already with 17 and 15 in the game with nine to play Florida State in command on the road at Notre Dame and of course I know you and I are both looking forward to that Clemson Wake Forest game later when were done absolutely you know Armando bacott who wasnt even scheduled to play on Saturday at Louisville had a doubledouble in the first half of that game and continues to add to his ACC leading doubledouble status tonight against Boston College but the fact that he has rebounded from that ankle injury the way he did against Virginia is amazing LJ Thomas off the back iron Greg Gannon and Ernest Ross brought both on the floor Corey with three fouls DJ Burns has only played five minutes here in the second half and theyve been able to rest them and keep them out of foul trouble is 34 opportunities already a fifth look off from three for NC State got five looks from three on one possession unable to knock any of them down but Kevin Keats continues to encourage his guy simply because theyre battling on the glass and getting more shot opportunities than Georgia Tech and NC State almost doubled their offensive rebounding in just that one possession only two seconds hands points for NC State in this game even though theyve been crashing the offensive glass and this is one where Javon Franklin can really be in attack mode against DJ Burns whos back into the game like you talked about before being able to catch it that free throw line rip and attack DJ cap getting downhill Applause doing a great job staying vertical Joyner attacking the basket getting out of transition is that a second or a third gear right there my goodness it whatever it is its fast now again you got you got different type of cars Debbie some of them can go really fast in second and third some of them need to get to six but jacquel Joyner hes a guy that can get it done first gear hes fast he has really changed the complexion of how NC State likes to play right Kevin Keats always wants to play full court press on ball defense he sits right in a stance and he gets right in your grill every time hes so disruptive on the defensive end and then the pace that he pushes the ball with thats why turquavion loves playing with her I think thats even a bigger component the fact that taquavion has someone that he can go to toward by someone he can look up to is a big brother whos been through the battles before to kind of encourage him and bring him along that third Dynamic is just as important as what he does defensively and offensively for the pack all right DJ talking on that back row Jayla Moore unable to make the three and of course when you play against the wolf pack long shot lead to Long rebounds and oftentimes gets you out into transition Joyner taking his time on this possession Applause Applause modern day basketball Debbie a 10 break Miles Kelly stops at the three Applause its a reach by Kelly Applause Music Applause Music Jacob cell had the same angle we had that was a reach I agreed wholeheartedly leak acell making sure as Kevin Keats was Defensive sliding all the way out to talk to him before that call made sure to let Kevin Keys know we got it were on top of it this was a block it was not an offensive foul on your guy oh my goodness its so fast explosive absolutely and again when you are at a standstill and can still beat your guy thats that quickness that you were talking about with jacquel Joyner and a dimension that he adds to this team but quite frankly they didnt have a year ago of course Darion sebran was great attacking the basket but they didnt have a guy in the backcourt as a guard who would just flat out quicker than everyone else on the floor I mean its a hips and shoulders game right so youre trying to ice him and keep him on one side of the floor you dont want to reverse the ball but his explosion and first step is so quick even if you try to square them off to the sideline you still can get by you or if youre staying between him and the basket he still can get by you and he has an infectious personality I believe that is trickled down throughout his teammates you see how much fun theyre having we watch them and shoot around it doesnt get any looser than this group was and Kevin Keys told us win or loss doesnt matter these guys are going to be loose theyre going to be relaxed and theyre going to come out and play hard let me look at Joyner in a stance right there Music excuse me two for 17 coming into the game thats backtoback triples hes taken that hes missed yeah and again oftentimes you know you tell coach I was open and theres a reason youre open the team is the opposing team is leaving you open for a reason they want you to take that shot no easy bucket for Miles Kelly the easiest bucket hes gotten here on the evening its been a struggle offensively for Georgia Techs leading scorer thus far opportunity here for Georgia Tech to get it back into single digits third of it to Terry in the corner and just like that its a seven point game Kevin keese wants the time out to talk it over Georgia Tech with 8 40 remaining not out of this game theyre not done yet foreign Music state did not make Georgia Tech pay for their poor shot selection they turned the ball over take a quick shot yeah darkell Joyner were were admiring his explosiveness but were going to get in there you got to be able to make a play yeah and especially when its your point guard because if his Joyner attacking the basket theres got to be communication with the teammates knowing whos going to be the guy back defensively having that defensive balance and there was no defensive balance on the last two possessions Miles Kelly shot the three in the corner on transition one time but this time he goes in and gets the bucket then Kyle Sturdivant with the great penetration having his head up finding Lance Terry over in the corner Terry knocking down the three ball just like that weve got a seven point game and of course with that threepoint line games are rarely over with this much time left Georgia Tech averages seven made threes and they havent made a bunch uh in this game Ive got them just making one but they are known for defending the threepoint line and theyre back in this one three one again defensively difference having Ross in the middle of that zone is NC State is over seven with their past few possessions Mr quavion Smith gets the easy bucket he was thinking of a highlight level dunk on that position thats probably smart play thought about it again and just laid it up Midway through wait hows Kelly with an opportunity unable to get it but Jalen Moore putting pressure on NC State on that offensive glass once again Applause Music the turnover from DJ Burns allowing Kelly to get out in transition to nice fine to Franklin the Finish once again a seven point game Georgia Tech starting to score in transition off their D Lance Terry up the floor Advanced passing itll come easier than that oh here tonight well and its allowed Georgia Tech to 20 points off those 12 turnovers all right turning the ball over in the live situation has allowed Georgia Tech a team that struggled to score to get some easy offense going the other way weve seen a couple of dunks youve seen the threes only two triples in the game but its not how many you make sometimes Corey its when you make them yeah Georgia Tech went over 16 in between those two threes that they made the first was the first possession of the game for Kyle Sturdivant and then of course Lance Terry before we went to the break previously as DJ Burns gets the basketball in his hands and Debbie I always love to see when coaches feel their teams are struggling and they come out of a timeout who do they go to thats always a Telltale sign as to who coaches trust and you see Kevin Keith has trust in DJ Burns making sure he got his hands on the basketball yeah thats the key word right atos who do you trust you need a bucket you want to make sure you get this guy going he has not been able to get going here in the second half Applause thank you Ernest Ross trying to front thats a great job Inside by Franklin working hard off the ball to get positioned deep in the paint both teams going with bigger lineups as Ross picks up his fourth foul Greg Gantt will come back into the game to replace him Ernest Ross coming off a careerhigh 17 and nine played 22 minutes in that Miami game he had some big rebounds in that game we got a fivesecond call another turnover for Georgia Tech is Josh pastner just puts his head down the eighth turnover and what theyre so good at is cutting and they didnt cut they didnt cut hard no four turnovers each in this second half for both these teams and right now if youre Georgia Tech this is an important defensive stand right here trying to find a way to cut into this lead a little further to quavion Smith gets a look in the midrange unable to knock it down but another offensive rebound as Casey Marcel comes flying in no one getting a body on him turquavion waves off the screen he wants to go oneonone Applause Lance Terry on him he just clear Josh pastner told us earlier NC state has two guys that when they need a bucket that can go get one to quavion Smith and Joyner he doesnt feel as though his team has that yet his last Terry gets in the middle of the unable to finish Rodney Howard but another offensive rebound from Franklin and in emphatic finish Applause Music I mean I thought Lance Terry was fouled but this is the kind of momentum play that Georgia Tech needs this is a big time board and finish in traffic Javon Franklin one of the best offensive rebounders in the ACC showing off not only his offensive rebounding but his finishing as well his team in rebounding Music Georgia Tech is over their offensive rebounding average theyve got more than 13 now they average 11 which is third in the ACC behind Duke and Duke leads the ACC and were offensive rear mounting thats the fourth foul on Greg Gantz so now Ross and Gantt playing with four fouls Georgia Tech with two bigs on the floor trying to exploit those mismatches in the middle and put pressure on NC States defense DJ Burns trying to back down Franklin a nice pass from Burns to get whos able to knock down the bucket but the officials would go over and check to make sure got that out of his hands in time Roger Ayers Lee Cassell come over and check the monitor they countered it on the floor Wanda Floyd did Count however this is good officiating because you can stop the game at this point because its a scoring issue in the first half you may not have stopped the game you might have looked at it later but because of where we are in the game you got to call time you got to stop the clock and theyre going to say its no good yeah any shot clock violations they go right when the basket is over as you see the basketball in Gans hands when that red light goes off on the backboard which means that no bucket ends up being the defensive stop that Georgia Tech needs you go clock light horn thats how you look at it thats what the officials did yeah youve been to officiating School correct yeah I put the put the crew I cant when I was a freshman in high school my God John AKA Jimmy Spears after a big game as a freshman for Waynesboro High School I would have to get up at 8 AM in referee youth games on Saturday mornings I knew that that was not the life of me Debbie Im with you shot clock down to five Howard with the basketball Terry that shot was blocked by Casey Marcel I mean how solid has Casey Marcel been all game we know he can shoot the three hes got a couple of those but defensively he has rebounded he got a tough offensive rebound a couple of possessions ago hes defended well I believe hes the perfect compliment to this backcourt when you think about what Joyner does what he brings to NC State of course the quavion Smith is a star no question about that but that steadiness that you talked about that consistency from Casey Marcel and of course a veteran you know his veteran leadership I think he balances out really you know what is necessary in this backcourt you and I were talking about most improved players on our list in the ACC Caseys on that list Miles Kelly has improved nine points per game and then Sean Padula running the point right now for Mike young until Rodney rice is 100 and ready to go go go yeah you right you like you like Rodney rice coming in and being more of the ball handler I do putting Padula off the ball and again Rodney rice getting back into the mix for Virginia Tech very important especially with Hunter Couture still out and thats really been the struggle for Virginia Tech as they struggled in ACC play Im not sure if people realize the importance of Hunter Couture and all the things that he does outside of scoring but youre talking about the ACC tournament Most Valuable Player a year ago without him its been a struggle for the Hokies well I remember Virginia Tech had a slow start last year at the beginning of the league and then they win the tournament go to the NCAA so you cant worry about Mike Youngs team right I mean Im not worried Ill tell you this Debbie I actually called the game a year ago and it was Jan it was late January where the change happened for Virginia Tech at Florida State Hunter Couture makes nine threepointers and Sean Padula makes six they route Florida State and that was an upward trajectory for the Hokies after that is another three Off the Mark for Miles Kelly and the basketball will head back to NC State foreign smith top of the key three and it is good he loves that matchup hes seen a big basket right now Debbie I think he loves every matchup Im gonna go as far as to say he doesnt think anybody can guard him so hell take his chances in any matchup another block shot for Casey Marcel who continues to play Stellar defense and thats one thing about Casey Marcel regardless as to whether the shots go down hes always going to give you that effort on the defensive end up in the right side of the box score tonight blocks steals rebounds nice move by Lance Terry going off the opposite foot with the left hand layup a much needed bucket to get this game back into single digits after a big three for Smith on the other end all right DJ Burns inside to quavion Smith becoming a great playmaker accepting the Trap getting the ball in the middle of the floor to Burns untroppable unflappable I love it you made it up Im using it you can use it thank you Ill make sure to give you your credit lets go NC State keeping the energy High Corey an 11 point lead for the wolf pack as we head into the last segment of that game looking to get their second row win of this ACC season and of course they already actually have a row win in their pocket to head back home the NC State managers are undefeated in ACC play 70 they won 7974 last night against the Georgia Tech managers I think its one of the great Traditions that has developed in college basketball that the managers play the night before in here under the lights with the big scoreboard and everything else so for NC state that that team is Caleb Garrett Cole Colt Josh Zach Jack Rudy and Jackson they call themselves the pack of Manis the pack of managers I like it matter of fact I think I love it the pack of mayonnaise Im good with that and if you have never seen the managers games its hilarious oh my goodness and again they are so competitive and youre thinking about there are no officials on the floor either so youre talking about calling your own fouls really getting after this to Cleveland Smith lines up knocks down another three the fist pump by Kevin Keats right here recognizing that could be the dagger for this game as NC State extends to its largest lead of 14 stop looking around its winning time and thats turquavion Smith time Music DJ Burns moving his feet getting the deflection Applause another turnover for Georgia Tech Kyle Sturdivant taking the foul to stop the break as jacquel Joyner already had it in second gear Debbie he was thinking about putting in third and we might have seen some fire come from his feet well NC state has shot 38 percent here in the second half but its their defense has been the difference and theyre a rebounding ability and making Georgia Tech uncomfortable offensively Applause every Thursday night womens basketball takes over the ACC Network this week Diamond Johnson number 20 NC State hosts Haley Cavender in Miami at six Eastern then its the Rivalry matchup between number 13 Duke with 161 and 60 in the ACC and number 17 North Carolina led by Deja Kelly averaging 16 points per game four boards four dimes should be another great night for womens Hoops on acc Network and the ESPN app eight of the 15 teams on the womens side have at least one win over top 10 teams wow thats the most of any conference thats how good the league is this year you know this year but it seems to be every year on the womens side in the ACC of course we know what you know my big sister Dawn Staley does at South Carolina yep but when you look at overall depth of the conference I would have to say the ACC has to be right there at the top when you think about all the programs as you just mentioned eight programs where they win over a top 10 team this year its no question I I mean its its a competitive and as competitive as its ever been every night you gotta fight to win and the coaching in the league has gotten really good but NC state has dominated the last three years theyve won the ACC tournament three consecutive years thats hard to do as you know it absolutely is difficult to do winning one is difficult to do so imagine a threepeat Music Kyle started it missing the free throw and thats been a struggle for Sturtevant on this season at the point guard position and you look at the numbers four Georgia Techs third one a 56 free throw shooter and Davon Smith 522 coming into the game thats one of the areas thats been a true struggle for Georgia Tech all season long well thats Josh pastner has talked about his team struggling and scoring and making free throws would be easy scoring opportunities atos they didnt score on all those situational offense really important for him and he talked about that with us today no I can imagine how coaches when you come in to shoot around love talking basketball strategy with you see they dont talk to me about that well why not I mean come on one of the things that Josh and I talked about today was that you know I I thought he had a really great interesting philosophical point about offense you know 80 percent of offense is when the offense breaks off its unscripted right so the first 10 seconds of the shot clock if you can get something in transition thats unscripted but then you got the middle ten right thats where you got to execute and you run stuff and you try to put your team in a position to score but then when you get under 10 everybody calls for the ball screen come out and thats unscripted like go and make get a bucket right 80 I thought that was very interesting you see Josh understands your intellectual basketball line he talks to me about recruits thats why were a good team then because thats it thats it Music Ernest Ross nice show sportsmanship right there giving a fist bump to coach fastner as he leaves the floor and thats going to be five on Ross who didnt have a career high like he had last time out versus Miami but still had a very positive effect on this game eight points for him which if you take away last Saturdays game would be a career high for him so hes playing great basketball as of late he is and the four position between dewana and Ross and Gant has gotten so much better for NC State their ball screen coverage is better their ability to score on rim runs and dropoffs and put backs you know DJ can make a post move the other guys just need to do their jobs really well and they they are doing their jobs well yeah and we talked with Kevin Keats earlier today really about you know a new staff of Coach Keiths three first year assistant coaches with them in a change of philosophy going more so to a coordinator system as DJ Burns picks up the offensive foul Music but Kevin Keats talking about you know Joe Justice being the guy who helps him offensively they talk a lot about offense Joe Justice being more so the offensive coordinator while Kareem Richardson and Leroy Watkins are more so the defensive coordinators for the team you know Levi not with the team but also he hopefully well be back soon hes not feeling well we should wish Levi gets better soon absolutely and Levi coming of course at NC State Alum but coming back home from Ole Miss where this guy with the basketball has some success as well so not only did Levi bring himself and his family home he bought a pretty good point guard with him that was wrong my goodness I mean thats just fun to watch on cue jacquel Joyner knocking down the midrange using the shot clock if people understood how hard it is to do what he just did you know size up your D explode past stop and jump straight up sometimes he jumps backwards when he shoots his jumper and its incredibly hard to do the hardest part and all those things are extremely difficult to do and I agree with you wholeheartedly but even more difficult is earning the trust of your head coach to be able to go do that in game great point Applause Jalen Moore continues to play good basketball and thats going to be the fifth foul on Gantt as Jalen Moore has reached a careerhigh 17 points and also a careerhigh eight made field goals in this game and that is the bright spot thats come out of this for Josh pastner NC States going to go to four in a row some that thought this could have been a trap game only because Georgia Tech has one win in the league need to think again NC State played really well and now they can get ready for the game over there in Chapel Hill on Saturday its going to be some fun and we have to remind our audience last time taquavion Smith went to North Carolina he dropped 34 on the heels it will be must see TV on Saturday ACC Network wolf pack at North Carolina one of the oldest rivalries in the ACC ENT and then I love working with you we gotta talk to our bosses the Corey cast we gotta talk to our bosses we need to do this again its been fun its been a lot of fun breaking down the game with you and hanging out with you all day today huge win for NC State on the road
