for your team that is and again there are a couple of possessions from being six and one and that would that would make them a top five team in the country this team is that good theyre playing they continue to play toward that level and show you everyone what theyre capable of being RJ Dart and arando bacot jump Setter Elliot kadoo controls and away we go from the Smith Center out of the holiday break heres Harrison Ingram the Stanford transfer up top acon looking for a post up they move it to Cormac Ryan one thing thats different about this T here team this year is that just the balls moving it seems to find that guy quite a bit RJ Davis who scoring in bunches hey we check out the starters for Charleston Southern the names to know start with RJ Johnson the leading scor hes a fourthe player from Matthews North Carolina outside of Charlotte and then Taj Kelly this guy the junior forward at 672 53 he gets 15 and8 a game and was preseason All Conference meanwhile for the heels you know Bon and Davis theyve got the first two buckets setting the tone for Carolina great start to this game by the tar Hills again the ball is just moving they want to look inside to take advantage of amondo inside but the balls going to move theyre not going to force it into him and whoevers open is just taking shots DJ Patrick the transfer from USF and one of four in double figures for Charleston Southern buries the three to get them on the board its one of the Hallmarks of Carolina offensively this year it is moving Ingram misses for deep this the top 10 offense in the country according to Ken Pals metrics diving bid by Ingram got to love that effort and you say this when you watch Carolina on film this team plays really hard theyre playing together and theyre playing really hard uh I I think that the issue isnt just defensive theyre not finishing possessions right now thats the key this is not the same old Carolina team that used to dominate you on the glass this team is only outrebounding their opponents by two rebounds a game and thats a really low number for Carolina as good as they are ninth in the country you ask Hubert Davis the areas to improve the rest of the year defense and rebounding will dig into that Davis transition three hes not a guard in the country playing better than this young man he hes put it all together his confidence is through the roof and you can see with his hot start early here knocking down his first two JS 23 plus as we said in seven straight games for RJ Davis Patrick turns the corner lost it on the way up and recovers great job there just Gathering yourself harison Eng going got a hand on that deflected it and Patrick the red Shir Jr from Powder Springs Georgia Ingram cant connect on another triple try and the rebound secured by RJ Johnson the Charleston Southerns got it downed by two the first two and A2 minutes Music Johnson for three wide left bacot clears it see what adjustments the tar Hills make tried another three hes got two of them this hes two for four so hes shooting 50 I guess he said percentage wise its okay to take that I know Huber want want him inside early to stablish himself in this game and Charleston Southern seem to be content with allowing Carolina four and five men to shoot those threes that is Alan suler sophomore in a transfer from Northern Kentucky their third leading score at 11 a game but hes been a whole lot hotter than that recently I think hes good score outside of RJ Davis as there is on floorida tonight he can really score the basketball Carolina needs to get to him early cuz he can get hot and get going and hes got a quick trigger as well tried it from three to strong for Alan suler now cormack Ryan going to work on DJ Patrick back it out to RJ Davis who gets a ball screen from bacot Davis again hes come out cooking knock down another three there again theyre not up because theyre sagging off because they want Ingram and Bott to take those jump shots and so when they come off those dribble handoffs and those screens those threes will be there all day scary proposition for RJ Davis who knocked down five of them against Oklahoma 23 points four rebounds five assists three steals and he didnt turn the basketball over once theres Taj Kelly you love his game I do when when their offense breaks down when the guard play cant create off the bounce theyre going to throw it inside to Taj Kelly and his size as a for man his ability to shoot that midrange Applause shot Davis the left hand gets the roll and RJ Davis has an early 10 you got to rotate over there he puts pressure on the defense they didnt cut him off and it doesnt matter left right hand midrange three hes hes just got it all hes put it all together to yearo this could be a big time scoring night for RJ Davis 10 already of the Dozen for the heels the first five minutes whats new nothing pick and pop heres Dart the fiveman not known for his scoring and Carolina pushes up three Davis is feeling it squared up Johnson moved it for Bott now the Freshman Kad wraps it around for Ryan great job coming off the Stagger screen there Ryan comes off just t curls right there in the midrange knocks down the free throw line jumper corack Ryan who had 20 broke out of that shooting slump against Kentucky on four triples followed it up against Oklahoma with 13 Patrick contested got to rise up over kadoo Davis pushes and double figures already taking Johnson off the bouns bot says he wants post entry from Ryan tipped Away by doart stays with the heels when we come back Carolina by five and RJ Davis with 10 already in Chapel Hill are with Erics family and may we all be empowered by the way he lived and how he treated others just an amazing guy um so giving to to others and just I always called him a gentle giant a guy you played against and in many ways basketball wise came up with yes same time same class either as Eric Applause monos Harrison Ingram draws a foul with the shot clock winding down you had some battles with Eric montros on the did I ever uh competed against him so much you know like I said in high school and obviously going him going to Carolina and myself going to wake it was just uh he was a competitor and hes one of those guys who didnt enjoy a competing against him I have memories of him in many different ways so many different memories and from competing against him as you see here uh funny story about that shot its a loose ball I throw it to my teammate we start to break Eric montro pushes my head he uses my head to get off the ground to run back to transition defense uh many battles but so much respect for who he is and what he was and just a tremendous honor well we will remember his Legacy and he will be close to the hearts of so many here for a long time the game back in Chapel Hill where son nimbley had to take a timeout under some pressure from Carolina was leading by six in the first six minutes here at the Smith Center and this is whats different about this Carolina team is that theyre theyre getting after you on the defensive end of the floor extend pressure they use that to such success in the their lone ACC game of the season so far against Florida State thats the way they want to play they they they much better defensive league and is creating Havoc you can see here I mean look at this nearly got a 10 count and then force a Johnson turnover and the heels run heres Davis driving bumps no foul called kelly clears it and heres Patrick over the Music timeline Patrick feeling good early rims that one out in the rebound to and Washington the sophomore backup big from Gary Applause Indiana the Carolina guards are going to get plent of shots with the you see the way they playing the Carolina bigs theyre sagging off so theyre able to turn a corner like Ingram does here high off the glass at roll off Washington the stick back and thats what happen when you switch that guard comes down gets deep in the paint forces you to switch you challenged your big to win that battle on a guard he had the guard on him in that time Washington does just that you mentioned rebounding for Carolina earlier plus two on the glass early and their first offensive rebound something youre going to monitor throughout the night were going to sink our team into thats a big part of the story for the heels going forward Withers muscles down that rebound and Jaylen Withers threw a foul as well on gtis heat and off the bench for the Buccaneers this is what happened Ingram comes in he curls and they switch it and you and you tell you guards dont get it blocked its up to the big to go up win that battle get that offensive rebound and punish them for switching and Jaylen Washington does just that and thats what you want to see from him as well because hes a really good perimeter shooter so getting down inside doing the Dirty Work big for him to get extended minutes here for the Carolina Davis turned the corner and now pick and popped he that too yeah thats what he does hes really comfortable doing that he starts playing inside out and look out we talked to Hubert about this about about guys have to force you to play them playing time is it earned I mean is it give it its earned and you got to force a coach to play and you do that by get to the offensive glass finishing and knocking down open shots former top 40 recruit as the heels on a 100 run set tremble into the game off the bench has the rebound the lead in double figures D Withers with post entry and a kick ataj Applause Kelly so offensive rebound to get his first two and then pick and pop for three theyre sitting back in the lane like that that shots going to be there but hes the one big thats I think hes the best perit to shooting throw away the numbers Washington is a guy he can consistently beat you by knocking down that shot and thats from your game plan defending arando then they go to the bench and bring this guy in and theyre going to have to make a quick adjustment to get to him on that Music shot how would you defend the RJ Davis in ball screens I would change it I wouldnt give him the same look I think he constantly VAR I think sometimes you got to trap him you just cant give him the same look hes too good for that too much experience like now youre in TRS hes going to eat this alive all game long another offensive rebound for Washington and a quick seven for the backup bck and again same thing he gets deep and when a gar gets that deep against drop coverage you have to switch it and again you challenge your big to get in and here creating another turn over here Davis got the tip tremble BLS it in I was holding my breath I thought he was about to actually dunk that he had a poster earlier this year went up with bad intentions of perhaps another meanwhile a scoreless drout of 4 and a half minutes for Charleston Southern its a really good defensive uh lineup out here for Carolina right now sh clock winding down on DJ Patrick can knock it down from Dave its a 140 run for Applause Music Carolina tremble for Ryan in the midrange swirls it out its a good look you cant you know thats a good shot youll live with that shot theyre going to be able to come off that screen because again Charleson Southern is so concerned about Carolina theyre sagging in the paint and the guards are able to turn the corn and put pressure on the rim as much as they want they just dont need to settle Kelly has that one get pinned and to held the ball the arrow keeps it at this end when we come back well a turnover at one end of and running at the other you were thinking poster Rand shers look at this jump and go here they line up big here early what we talked about he got to his midrange shot knocking down threes there but I think his biggest Improvement in his game outside of his confidence its just what you just saw still there on the other end is defensive end of the floor hes turning that in the offense and hes just in such a groove right now just controlling the game for both teams and thats thats what you want from an elite guard and hes proven that he is so two things on the point of Defense Hubert Davis said to us today at shoot around the defense for RJ Davis is now on par this year the way we need it then the other thing he said after the win over Oklahoma Hubert Davis said I think this is the first time that RJ Davis is being celebrated supported and maybe noticed the way he is right now and Hubert said I absolutely love it well how do you not notice a guy that goes on a 27 point per game average the way he has and been so efficient in doing so Alan suler hit the three out of the corner for Charleston Southern and then Elliot Kau turns it over RJ Davis has been that good now we talked about it this is the one concern that you have is when he goes to the bench right now to a bad defensive possession no communication switch leave someone open sumon the knocks down a three come down turn over there this is what we mean when we say hes that important to this group and they need to show that they can play without him playing at such a high level kadoo The Freshman is the only starter on the floor for the heels right now Taj Kelly went pivoting through the lane and then missed it too strong joining kdo its tremble Withers Washington and Paxton W the brown transfer and 50e Senior Off the Bench whos got it eight in white with thought about it and now kadoo step back miss the mark suler the rebound Charleston Southern Team 4 and eight told you theyve already underwent that coaching change and now their third ACC opponent Washington spiked that on suler tremble for withs back out kadoo W Rises can hit and tip back out to Trimble Trimble off the bounce goes spinning and finishing so Trump was giving his team reliable minutes I think consistent minutes when he gets in the game he just an elite athlete and a big time Defender that time shown youed reversal a finish early that time getting in the paint just an impressive athlete Ace Defender since he set fo on campus as a freshman last year Kelly had woi digging down at him and it goes out of bounds with eight left to shoot we showed you some Jaylen Washington buckets hes got a block as well really good Rim protection here comes over week from the week side blocks it but more importantly keeps it in brown and creates the uh fast break there thats a big time block great job by him keeping it in bounds as well one of three blocks for Carolina already first 12 minutes Johnson cant hit from deep and its a 5 for eight shooting start for Charleston Southern trembles feeling good had that one roll off cleared by Applause Patrick Johnson still scoreless so far the averages 17 a game Trumble showing his youth there hit the last basket that time no pass just came down shot it again you get any shots you want in games like this youve gotten off to a really good offensive start just move the ball another another young player coming out no pass dribble and attack again Tribble attacks a second time after Koo tried the first time but was met by RJ Johnson suler who stepped in as the two guard in the last month since that coaching change itsan nimley taking over as the interim head coach Patrick trying to back down OIC Kelly attacks poked Away by bacock tremble looking for the trailer Applause kadoo Baseline cut it eventually finds Zaden High you some good minutes against Oklahoma match the season high with a dozen minutes off the bench woic cant hit B got the offensive Applause rebound and he will back it out to Applause kadoo kadoo is probing bounced it for Bott hands from doart Saved By woic cant hit this time from Deep yeah I think hu is going to get RJ Davis and some of his starters back in the game they have theyve been in control of this game but they let the momentum kind of get back to Charon Southern not running their offense quick shots RJ Davis and cormack Ryan sitting at the table ready to come in Johnson with his first points cing from Matthews North Carolina got guy went to Charlotte Latin and is third in the Big South in scoring and hes been very efficient from threepoint range as well this year you know it means something to him from North Carolina you grow up wanting to play against the TP Hills if not play for the TP Hills Bon bu hes got a chance at a threepoint play when we come back Carolina in control starters will turning for Hubert Davis after this here at the free throw line for arando bat 23 this year hes up near 80 we asked Hubert Davis about it he said its confidence its as simple as that Hubert said everyones looking for what was the change he boils it down the confidence now Armando has said that he is going a little bit slower maybe not rushing as much at the free throw line but the routine is the same that deep breath the three dribbles the high release and its been money this year no Jinx I was waiting for him to miss I was about to tell you you jinxed that but no he hes a lot more comfortable there you can see in his shot and he has improved in his his mechanics hes wanting to expand his role spend a little bit more time on the perimeter and angram off the turnover forces a held ball Arrow keeps it this this was interesting here on the inbound RJ Dart was about to inbound Zaden High sort of stuffed the ball it appeared back toward doart after temperatures had cooled a little bit the inbound happen then the turnover then the held ball and now a technical on Zaden high so this did not elicit a tech to start a warning from Bert Smith and then eventually Applause attack and RJ Johnson goes to to the line and he makes both and this was the technical what do you think I guess he said something Im some he said something there I mean I was looking I didnt know what you know what else what else was there and well a guy whos been bringing energy when he does come into the game Off the Bench true freshman from San An B out of B yeah you use that as a teachable ball he has he does play hard he comes in and bring a ton of energy and again hes one of those young guys we talked about making it difficult for Hub to take him off the floor Huber Davis raped about the energy that Zen Hot brought in that game against Oklahoma said did you see him out there heres doart banging with Bott now Kelly off Target he hasnt been able to get going either just two points points on now one of seven shooting for T Kelly B with another chance at a threepoint play I think this is when amandos at his best Bs at his best when he catches on the move I think just getting to the basket you know picking and rolling slipping hes just so much more effective because he is an elite passer as well mean finishing at The Rim on the Move makes it really difficult hes not an Above the Rim guy hes a below the rim guy more agile than people thinking so why does it help you when youre moving well because hes hes not a hes a below the rim big so L will bother try to put him inside its really whats happening in Charleston Southerns v hes so much bigger Kelly and these guys are struggling his length is bosi him so he negates your length and it gives him an angle to finish when hes facing you when hes driving hes got the last eight points for Carolina and hes in double figures already with 10 of his own six rebounds as well and now a too big lineup for Hubert Davis as Bon stays in and Jaylen Washington replac Zaden High I dont I dont count amondo stats until he gets to 10 Im already put him in the books for hes 10 and 10 hes going to get a this he hasnt done anything yet my hes going to when he gets his 10th rebound his 10 point then Ill start at what 73 rebound uh double doubles I should say already in his care automatic as he puts on the Jersey just put it in the book Patricks feeling good and buries another DJ Patrick second three and hes got eight points to Pace the bucket theyre in this 131 to kind of get Carolina out of their Rhythm use this 5 of the time this year big from Davis way you attack it RJ Davis experience you know hes got that skip dve it down to Gap and when you know one 31 cant allow straight line drives like that coming up on five to go first half the lead at 17 for the Tar Heels against Charleston Sou you see has four wins three of them against non D1 competition and theyre having trouble just getting into their offense whether in the full court or in the half court right now yes hard to run offense at half court I think the only guy affected from that range is Seth Seth Curry Johnson has it blocked by Bott with2 left on the shot clock thats why this Carolina team is when theyre defending theyre as good as any team in the country because of that not many teams can switch a center and late clock and stay in front of a point guard 210 of a second and a lob necessary and a shot clock violation we told you they loved the defense last time out against Oklahoma and thats carried over to the first half today what are you laughing about Randys R what are the Vets we got got a big time crew here corat grab for three hes a streaky guy great side hes knocked down at first I was surprised to see he struggled from three early hes a career 36 threepoint shooter shooting 29 so far this year but I expect him to continue his mechanical wise I think hes techable 34 for his career of course two years ago and Notre Dame had that big season where he shot 41 from three and a good Defender whoa Ingram went somersaulting over Bott Kelly scored and hopefully both Harrison Ingram and Armando Bott are all right and they appear to be got smiles from those two and that is a welcome sight Ingram over the Virginia Tech and it wraps up with the game will be at number 16 Duke and Notre Dame from South Ben all right first half action here so far at the Smith Center looks like this Carolina up by 18 Charleston Southern slow offensively here this last handful of minutes Carolinas rebounded better and its a k of basketball and Charleston Southern is struggled because this Carolina defense is five block shots and five steals theyve been really active that into the another offensive rebound and it rolled out for Harrison Ingram yeah active on the glass and excellent defense and the heels have protected the basketball to your point just two turnovers these first 17 minutes fouled once as well and that was the TCH on Zaden High Patrick for three thats his third and hes up to 11 guy who started out in junior college then spent a couple of years in South Florida but didnt start there and last year missed a bunch of time with an ankle injury Washington has had a great first half you got to find him you got to find him one I mean I know their defense game plan is to play in DRS but hes a guy hes different than any big that they have that roster he is really comfortable behind that line and the difference is hes capable of beating you from the threepoint line you got to get to him 10 points now and hes in double figures for the second time of this year at 11 against UC Riverside good hands from RJ Applause Davis Davis with entry for Washington what a half for jayen Washington mix up there in the transition defense no one picks him up hes doing it inside and out for the tall heels early in the first half one of the things Hubert Davis said to us earlier today can we get a little more production out of our four spot well playing bacon in Washington looks pretty good here in the first half I think from a physical standpoint the four spot is a lot more natural toward jayen jayen wash RJ Johnson with a tough step back too why is that well because its let you know hes hes still hes recovered he had injuries in high school hes just not a big guy riding down the lane comfortable facing the basket squaring up and when he shoots it this well hes going to dictate matchups because you dont want to switch it because of his size theres suler being hawked by Ryan top follow comes up short Davis pushes hes got six assists already drives takes contact and well go to the free throw line on a foul from RJ Johnson Jaylen Washington has a dozen here in the first half his career high is 13 last year against Virginia taking with the defense gives him that driv and kick knocking down second tray ton night and here just a mix up in coverage and wont get a dunk any easier than Music that whats his ceiling with how skilled he is off defensively and the way he can shoot it you know its hard to tell right now I mean hes I you know theres a lingering effect because his injury was his second KN injury he had prior to him se he hadnt played much in high school and literally spent much of last year recovering from that as well so its hard to tell but skillwise he has it all its just a matter of him being comfortable and how his body feels going forward but he can definitely shooting and iss definitely more comfortable facing the basketball I mean we had coaches around the ACC last year who would say to us you see that Washington kick the way he can face up he scares you because hes you know at his size a l 610 or so in his length I mean he he he allows Carolina he can be a backup five or stretch four charl Southerns got to get it over and they do to doart 9 seconds into the timer and now Heath drives and scores fouled by Trimble and a chance at three for the sophomore backup Guard from Atlanta Gattis Heath the Third Music hey as you gets at the ring in the New Year well have a womens basketball quadruple header Sunday right here on acc Network starts at noon Eastern number 21 Florida State against Wake Forest the number 14 Notre Dame against Syracuse followed by number 19 Louisville against Miami we finish the day with number three NC State and Virginia so coming up on this final minute before halftime Ingram knocks it down Ingam missed his first too knocked that one down hes been shooting it much better this year than he has in his entire career I mean up to 44 hes only a 31 threepoint shooter and kiding looks like that hes going to continue to knock him down at a high at a high rate he had said before the season that he thought his efficiency from three would increase from where it was at Stanford 31 from three in those two years hes banging with Kelly they had another one to roll off and its cleared by James okako getting some run here in the first half and Hubert Davis will take his use it or lose it timeout before halftime well take it with him 30 seconds and then back for the final 24 of the first Music half bot called it a mustwin game for them well it was from a confidence standpoint they had dropped backto back games against Yukon and Kentucky and you needed a win like that against a team that was ranked in the top 10 and just to say hey that we belong you know you lose a third one there youre losing confidence theres a belief with yourself and this Carolina team and well get into that in the second half they have a heck of a a conference uh schedule to start the ACC kadoo okako tried to follow Ingram left it short and and we will head to halftime Carolina puts up 51 in the first half they lead by 23 that because more importantly now in this generation not everyone works without the ball they either work with it or without it and he has done both you can tell and is showing off here hes really fun to watch right now playing at extremely high level well meanwhile Charleston Southern just 28 points in the first half for this 4 and8 Club seven turnovers to five assist is trying to get their studs going RJ Johnson six points on two of seven shooting and Taj Kelly their number two scorer four points on two of eight shooting foul goes against Taj Kelly fortunately for those guys they have some of the better perimeter Defenders against them corack Ryan is just such an underrated Defender and hes been that way for quite some time when hes dialed in hes as good as a on ball Defender as there is heres Bott traveling the call on Armando Bott and only the third turnover for the heels yeah I thought he got away with one earlier just got didnt get his feet ready established and shuffled the puppies before he decided to make his move there and that time they got C North Carolina extends full court pressure again on charlon Southern this is something the Buccaneers really struggled with when they got blown out at NC St last month they had 22 turnovers against the pack RJ Johnson gives it up to Kelly who flips for Alon suler turnning the corner now hes a great story we told you a sixth straight start in that time hes getting 16 points per game Z nemily said to us today that a lot of the credit goes to their staff s the change three and up Su as Ingram responds with the three yeah hes suon is a big part part of you know the excitement about Charleston Southern as they head into conference play the next game against Presbyterian and just coming in and just shooting the basketball well SCS it on all three levels the length I think this game has bothered him some but he can really score RJ doart steps out and sinks one his first points 69 fifth year senior whos a heart and soul type of guy for the bucks K off the bouns driving on Kelly got his own Miss and follow first points for the Freshman from West Orange New Jersey I think he needs to be more aggressive hes has a reputation of being Kendall Marshall type of pass first guy as he get into conference play hell learn that teams will start giving him that shot because of so much you know so much scoring ability around him theres your defense for cormack Ryan hes stripped Kelly Davis spins out of the corner Davis attacks and finishes RJ Davis putting on a show when hes shooting at that level you got to honor him you got to get up and pressure him hes shooting so well from behind the line and hes just driving into bodies and forcing the referees to you know to to make calls and when they dont hes giving them angles to finish like that under the foul as well theres out the ey on RJ Johnson cant get a touch instead its Kelly good hands kadoo Davis attacks again and RJ Johnson stripped him heck of a play by Johnson there RJ Davis coming at you ahead of sche not only to get the strip but stay in bounds and throw it to a teammate Johnson off the bounce guy who started his career a couple of years at Holy Cross now his second year in Charleston suler gets a switch from Ryan Kelly wats it Kelly on the F A not there his struggles continue now two of nine shooting Applause Music angram timeout Charleston Southern No One turns defense and offense better than North Carolina theyve been the best at it I think that Ive seen this year and theyre continuing that Harrison Ingram and the heels off at running defense to offense in a third three for twohour pregame show followed by Command Center broadcast of the game multiple camera angles and realtime player and team stats then after the game against number six Georgia stick around for the ACC huddles postgame show with Randolph childis Mike Monaco here in Chapel Hill Carolinas in control against Charleston sou the number nine team in the country trying to get to 9 and three before its back to ACC action next week off the RJ Johnson Miss heres Elliot kadoo out there with Ryan Bott Ingram and Davis the starters out of halftime still for Hubert Davis Kad knocks down the three all right you said more aggressive whats that look like well just like that taking open the shots one and but taking his type of shots I think he can be really effective in transition theres been a couple of times hes just come down trying to run plays he has to keep you honest defensively if not when things break down you cant allow you just a sag off and help on all the other guys and just being able to do that just knock down open shot to be more aggressive in the transition his first threepoint make in more than a month doart on the block off the glass to Applause respond and even that move he didnt shoot it but he put pressure on you you make a mistake he can turn the corner just keeping you honest Davis short and a good block out by gtis Heath for Charleston Southern this difficult difficult parts of the game as well when youre up 29 you know you dont the score is z0 you got to continue to play in defend Johnson got his own Miss and found Patrick to knock down another three hes got three of them already and recovers defensively nicely done by DJ Patrick suler kicks he thrives got his own Miss missed the follow and then over the top and itll stay at this end of the floor well Elliot Kad attacked earlier now he knocks it down from long range but this year their fewest rebounds per game in more than 20 years and only a plus two and 1 half rebounding margin before today you saw out rebounded in three straight games yeah its its its critical for their team and because when they go to their lineup defensively theyre really good and they versatile and they switch a lot and a lot of times its up to their guards to be better rebounding and Amando be pulled away from the rim you know the tendency is to sit back and say hey let the bigs get it because Amando when you play with a dominant rebounder you dont always go yourself and these guards got to when you do the switching and everything that that a lot of teams do its its imperative that your guards rebound the ball what Hubert Davis say to us today at shoot I talked to them about rebounding 50000 times every day theyre they listening today and on qwi Jinx and they give up an offensive rebound but theyve done a really good job they were prior to that they were plus 14 on the glass and thats a good sign of the take of basketball good hands by Davis who takes the b and a chance at three a thats just clinical on both ends from RJ Davis just does a great job he CS a screen cant get back in front GRE to turn over gets back in I mean look at this coming around the corn he fights tip to the head just a great catch and finish there didnt have time to gather himself and dribble just catches it I think the dribble was more to try to get itself get balanced to know where you are and finish thats a big time shot 17 points eight assists at a career high five feels for RJ Davis did we say he was good I thought we said he was good I think so all right so give me your short list of the best guards in college basketball him Tyler K I think way Taylor Taylor I mean you put me on a spot I know Im going to forget a few guys but Taran Shannon obviously its a very different situation now but he had been playing at that L and I and I I put him in more of the point guard category I dont think thats turn Shan rooll anyway or so yeah I I think those three guys what Id say are the best three and uh RJ said Colorado States been really good he has he has I mean theres so many guys but I dont think you can say any of them have played better no no that arent no ones played better with the level of competition that they play I think as we get into conference play with everybody else well see hes shown us against that stretch when no one else in the country has played seven straight games like that hes averaged 27 a game 262 that stretch hes proven to you like you know at Big Time games I can put this team on my back hes just playing at a level there so much confidence and freedom that hes playing with coming up on 13 and a half to go in this second half tremble trying to lock up Alon suler peting on the Baseline and tremble matched him tremble pushes drives finishes TR I think trumbles their best perimeter Defender I mean his athleticism and strength just allows them to switch and guard bigger guys he apologized to RJ Davis there tell him I kick yeah maybe next time Ill kick it out to you those are good problems to have they great problem to have when they come off of turnovers and steals your defense creating RJ Johnson Ryan was right there with him but a foul goes against Carolina he did a great job of moving his feet keeping the ball in front of him just tried to block the shot second on Ryan and it puts RJ Johnson at the line niy looking up scoreboard still with a long way to go here in Chapel Hill this is whats different about this team is their ability to defend and continue to defend up 34 hey next Saturday right here here on acc Network our first basketball triple header of the New Year mens side Virginia takes on NC State starts the south of 2 Eastern then Florida State yeah lets hope for some good weather South Bend this time of the year man it can be cold just hope for some good good food good meal on the Mike Monaco what do you think corn dance not a bad choice you there before it was good it was good an old Mike Bray favorite Davis goes spinning bouncing wiers RJ Davis is just dominating his game hes just getting wherever he wants to get finding his teammates with his ninth assist Kelly backs it out for Heath cant hit give it to Davis let four go oh Washington tried to rip it down Heath went up to match him Davis swirls one out and a foul away from the ball on the rebounding action goes against Charleston Southern how about RJ Davis 17 points nine assists and hes done it defensively as well with five steals yeah hes dominating this game both end to the floor but on the offensive end like I said hes hes hes just a complete package hes playing with so much confidence hes attacking you off the dribble hes making the right plays the right reads hes finishing at a high level right Applause now were trying to run them off the screen there couldnt get their spacing organized to free Davis left alone count cant do that Applause counting just knew that was going in the groove hes in right now the way hes playing cant make a mistake like that and leave him wide Applause open 20 for RJ Davis Johnson for Patrick teardrop no Washington the rebound is fifth tremble driving and couldnt Applause finish Carolina has doubled up Charleston Southern still 11 minutes to go thats the one thing I think you know when they go back and they watch film that hubs going to speak to those guys about theyve had quite a bit of those plays where they you dont mind your guards attacking but you cant have four or five possessions in the conference play where you guard dont move the ball and just come down theres no extra passes in their shots Washington the roll man and he gets fouled by Kelly that is four on taj Kelly one of the studs for Charleston Southern Davis dishing and scoring as well just doing it all there the drop pass comes down witherss banging the Baseline jumper car line up big here in the second half said at RJ Davis has dominated this game 20 points nine assists five steals he is playing at such a high level he is I I mean just being really efficient with the basketball he three ass six from behind the arc had missed a free throw and again its just not a guard playing better in the country and you cant use the argument that hes playing against Charleston Southern I mean hes done this against High major competition and just really really impressive and fun to watch him play it just such an elite level check out the way he has played this year and its free its confident its with leadership Armando bat has told RJ Davis this is your team and the way Davis is playing backs that up check out the the the tattoo just be you hes doing that this year he is I mean so much has been said about he a Caleb love and a year ago and them playing together I think they both have been really good apart they were good together as well and theyre even better apart right now no guards playing better than this guy with the ball in his hand right now still with 10 and a half to go in the second half here in Chapel Hill 7540 Washington was Tangled with doart so its a woic turnover hey as it get set to ring in the New Year well have a womens basketball quadruple header for you Sunday right here on acc Network starts in noon Eastern number 21 Florida State then number 14 Notre Dame action against Syracuse 19th ranked Louisville against Miami and the day finishes with number three NC State and the who Charleston Southern China hand handle this Carolina pressure what do you like most that the Bucks have and that theyll carry forward in the league play in the big S well I think this is a tough matchup for him because Kelly is usually has a hell have a physical size Advantage when they get in the conference play that that was negated the length and the size interior from Carolina negated that and they struggling but their guard play is really good weve seen that we have we have a sample size of that and having a guy like tajj Kelly when things break down you can throw it inside I think theyll surprise some people when they get the conference 21 seconds to shoot it here suler does and hits they got that guy coming on as well he can score I mean make no mistake dont judge him by tonight I mean coming in tonight hes 16 points his last five games but he can score it on all three levels weathers for three to answer and we told you that Alan suler has been freed up is what son nimy said to us earlier today he told him at the time of the coaching change youre our starting two guard until you decide youre not and hey if youre going to shoot it 17 times a game which suler basically has you better be in the gym butan nib said to us thats longw but you know what thats what happens when you play with a coach that allows you to do that and were seeing that with on the other in with RJ D I mean its like hey this is your team putting the ball in your hand go play if I see you working on those shots I got no problem with you taking those shots in the game and youre seeing that even with Charleston Southern saw RJ Davis check out hes got his first career points assist double double 20 points 10 assist in 26 minutes without a turnover as he sits theres Jaden toson freshman from Concord North Carolina suler we told you will shoot it about 17 times a game and he is making them right now knocked down his last two bombs from behind the threepoint line and you got to get to him K and this is what hu wants to see out of this lineup too he he can he wants this group to continue to defend theres no let him I think hell get amondo out here shortly after he picks up another rebound and gets his Double Double K tremble wji Withers and B out to 13 five for the heels with Washington indeed getting ready to check in doart banks in a three second three of the ball game for RJ doart had four all SE coming into tonight yous not happy with that thats the third three in a row sus knocked down too and to hard gets in knocks down his second three of the night and cant take your foot off the gas too much time left and theres still guys in this rotation that that have playing for Hubert that have to continue to show him they want to continue to to play a lot wji is won and want more minutes Withers is another one and and Washington had a good night two more for Jaylen Washington hes got a new career high with 15 thats why he scares you at his length Its ability to stretch the Applause floor suler hot he third three in a row for Alan suler and hes got 19 Music points Washington going to work on doart and the confidence is rising for the sophomore it is and even there you can tell hes not comfortable with his back to the basket as much and thats okay just turn and face at his size he can just Elevate right over you suler with Trimble pressed out on him Kelly follows Washington comes over the block there Kelly does a great job of getting inside and tipping it in Applause ball screen from Washington tremble pulls up just so comfortable right now and that not settling getting there shooting that little that little floater coming up on the final seven minutes of the second half Kelly hes got a unique game that was his desp there to us when we chanted with the pregame coaching staff has called it unconventional at again 67 253 very talented got his heat the rebound and he pushes stops pops cant hit Washington the rebound hes got 17 and seven tonight kadoo moves it woic off the shot pick and one and he got hit in the chops too he earned the a one the hard way there great drive by K and finish and find and W you pay for it gets in near Pump fakes draws the contact well you paid for that one Carline up big got popped hes bleeding and hes getting attention on the bench trying to check back in yeah you can see him come down right there clearly accidental by by doart there tried to challenge and went in the air and wji made a big time play and just got popped there looked like Jaylen Withers was checking out the handiwork and where roic got hit and where he needed the attention so cono comes in Off the Bench Carolina is going to elect to have him shoot the free throws just the basketball play is what Roger sis came over and told us when they checked out the F yeah I didnt think he was in the air and its a natural reaction too when someone goes into your chest your arms come down and unfortunately you got got the elbow across the eye lets hope hes okay looks like he has gone down the tunnel no sense in bringing him back with the lead where it is for the heels K do the rebound coming up on six to go as tremble pushes K do thought about it trying to take suler off the bounce oh nice finish hey now hey that is a big time move there I was just thinking when he caught it thats the shot he needs to take it open in the flow of the offense but when you get creative and get in the paint finish like that nine for kadoo suler short kadoo the rebound the quick hit ahead for tremble couldnt finish rebound High left alone and how about the offensive rebound from Ingram he rises cant connect Hubers not happy with that possession he loves the offensive rebound hes wanting his team to pull it back out take better shots Kelly got bumped Heath back out doart Ingram the rebound its opened up here these last few possessions with five to go kadoo trying to find oako diving on the floor suler and itll stay with Carolina networks got number five Florida State covered in Miami for the Capital One Orange bow tomorrow two Eastern the Huddle crew with a 2hour pre game show then its a command center broadcast at 4 Eastern for the matchup with Georgia 700 the Huddle gang is back for the postgame show kraton Libo has checked into the game third game for him this year getting some burn okako its stripped but stays with the heels all right so its coming fast for Carolina after this you go back into ACC play weve already played once remember already a win here against Florida State and beginning on Tuesday its Road games this team is and you know its weird to say but Carolina has not had a true Road game this year yeah and theyre going to open up AC but not open up ACC play theyre going to open up New Years with three straight road games in the ACC its a brutal stretch to start I think it gives this team a chance that we know theyre very good I think its a chance to see how good this team can be if they can come out of that stretch winning two of those three games I I think it you really have to start thinking about this team could go from good to Great from very good to great I think they got all the other pieces and being able to take their show on a row would be impressive at pit Tuesday then at Clemson Saturday and then State Carolina at PNC so yeah six neutral side games so far in heels we know how hard the schedules been yes one of the most difficult nonconference schedules in the entire country arguably the most difficult among power Conference teams and for as hard as that was then you got this to start league play again it its going to be different you dont know how you guys are going to respond I mean some of those neutral sight games for Carolina is home games they travel well and the Yukon game in New York wasnt that was Pro Yukon but theyll definitely the zoo will be rocking in bit and pits had their number lately three straight five of six and thats not going to be an easy game at all and I I believe theres not a team playing any better than the AC in ton theyre really good uh thats thats thats thats difficult to play there no matter where when but this team that team I I think is as good as any team in the ACC is PJ Hall a first team AllAmerican right then hes playing as well as any I mean he has competition if youre going to go by position but hes right there hes been affected with so many guys and you know we talk so much when you get to those bigs of Zach Ed and what hes done and but PJ Hall has been right there I heard the guys in the halftime show Justin and Joel talking about Clemson tonight taking care of Ratford big day for Joe Gerard for the Tigers hes why I think theyre so theyre just different they got a guy like that his experience his ability to score it just changes the dynamic of that team withs in the heels force a shot clock violation 333 to go Carolina cruising 25 looks like this around the league Carolina of course ninth Duke 16th we were talking about Clemson theyre 18th tomorrows action by the way pit at Syracuse Virginia at Notre Dame a game you can watch right here on AC Network at noon and also in League Play Virginia Tech at wake 200 over on ESPN 2 all conference games are big this time of year and and you know its its time you know its the most exciting part about the season you get the season going and now everyones through their nonconference slate well here in Chapel Hill coming up on 3 minutes to go in a game in which Carolinas dominated out of their holiday break lay tremble scores two more theyve looked apart theyve really done it defensively against Charleston Southern I think the only question mark hubberts got to have with his group is going to be how good will we be offensively when RJ Davis is struggling though that hasnt happened it happened off I it doesnt look like its going to happen but its bound to happen at some point you know once he gets strong that guy to his right is more than capable of lifting up the load and and currying his team as hes done so many times in the past but theres so many different work weapons I think theres multiple guys theyre getting their bench together with Washington and tremble where theyre just starting to F figure some things out and theyre getting contributions from their freshman so we well see what happens with this team I mean most teams dont expand their rotation as the season goes on but again I think CU said today if guys force him to play them hes going to play but they earn it in practice and again its not many off nights coming for RJ Davis tonight with how good hes been 20 points 10 assists no turnovers plus the five Steals and how about this would you believe that RJ Davis with the 20 points and 10 assists first Carolina player to do that in the game since Kendall Marshall 11 years ago 20 points 10 assists in a game thats surprising I mean with that the elite players that theyve had at that position hes got 20 plus in eight straight Games first guy to do that for Carolina since Psycho T did it in N straight and 0809 hes leading the ACC and scoring and amandos leading the ACC and rebound the last time they had a PA do that was shot mson there assistant coach over there sound late good company Carolina sitting on 99 after two more from Trimble gives him a dozen he has matched his career Applause high suler on a step through couldnt finish and Carolina brings it up looking for a 100 Withers handoff okako finishes and the fat go berserk cuz its two for one sausage biscuits yes I want cheese on mine bring it I want cheese add cheese on mine wheres my coupon were fans right we get

too strong from Deep at his heat the rebound playing hard here in the waiting minutes for Charleston Southern we told you theyre going to get back into League action as well kick things off in the Big South Wednesday for them against Presbyterian hard fall there for Zaden High you know s Nimble an her head coach again he took over a month ago tonights his sixth game since replacing his old college coach B clay Raab s NY said to us today the first week it was about mindset and it was about culture and you hear Ed ig7 a lot from them every day is game seven said to us today we didnt really have an identity and hes been its its not its a difficult situation you know to to come come in like that and and take over in the middle of the year Applause and and try to get this team improve the way they have and theyve done so they respond theyre theyve responded to him I know you look at the score tonight this is an elite a really good Carolina basketball team and it was a tough match up for them to come in here and win this game Carolinas playing really well but I I think theyll do damage in conference play in the Big South and guys enjoy playing for him and they they respond to him they just came across a far better team tonight thats playing at a high level and starting to click on all cyls off the shot fake the dish from Landry and okako gets fouled yeah thats the road ahead for Charleston Southern whos going to fall to 4 and nine we told you Carolina back to ACC action Tuesday at pth G you could to watch out ESPN hey one last note on RJ Davis told you 20 points 10 assists five steals the first 20 point 10 assists five Steel game ever in Carolina history wow and that young man is having himself a year he really is hes fun to watch hes great to see just a great young man and he is playing a point guard position as well as anyone in col basketball The Vibes are pretty good over on the Carolina sideline and why wouldnt they be coming out of the holiday break with as thorough and convincing an effort as they had tonight I think Hubert Davis is going to be pretty pleased with this one from both ends jumper goes down for Quenton Bolton getting some run here in the waiting seconds 105 to 60 Carolina wins at is 9 and3 and they get the dub in their final nonconference game of the season the way you wanted to handle things coming off that
