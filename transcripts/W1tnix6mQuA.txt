lineup up a little bit our officials today Tony Henderson with Jamal Spearman and Anthony eids and were underway in game two of the AO Nation Orange Bowl basketball classic today from Sunrise Florida seals with the ball here to start Tain will mix his defenses itll play his matchup itll Play Zone itll play man I know what Florida State wants to do is run their man offense no matter what coach Hamilton doesnt want its guys standing around watching and thinking instead of playing jump ball after the Jerry dang mess for Florida State and its tane possession look for Florida State to hit hit tane with pressure they Florida State plays a lot of people they play that to their strength Applause just checking the clock I think just make sure everythings right and and it is so its two lane possession Greg Glenns going to put it in Against full press here early picking up full anyhow Rumba hands it off Mari Jordan now for to LAN Florida state will try to switch everything heres Clen now thats what theyre doing Jordan shot clock down to five here for the Green Wave Rumba back up to the top this is Caleb Banks thats a three and he hits it Caleb Banks is a very talented basketball player he has the ability to step away from the basket knock down jump shots as he just did drives it also finishes well around the glass and an early foul its going to be on Jordan fou Ser there you see coming right off and knocking that down Banks they like to play him a lot of different positions and one thing Ron Hunter does is he lets his guys handle the ball and let them create Banks is one of the guys hes chosen to let create moving screen here on Malik Yan for Florida State he picks up the foul his first you know back to banks for a second number one in white for taine as they get possession when we were talking about this and I think you had mentioned at the coach you know they need him to be a little bit more aggressive and maybe teach him to be that guy right cuz he is their guy now their leading scorer didnt play a lot when he was in Indiana now here hes going to be playing a lot hes scoring a bunch of points for too late yeah and and and thats a mentality and so I think I think you really have to play into that and do things in practice to force him to have to take that role cuz its hard for guys to be I think thats the hardest jump to be a role player to be the guy you know everybody wants to be the guy but all the other things that go along with it is you you got to train them and teach them to do that yeah a couple things there can they be the guy right can they go from that role into that next Ro cuz thats an important one thats mentality and thats what you have to figure out and see like with my main guys there were a lot of conversations I had with them that the team did not see and there was a lot of pressure out put on them that the team did not see and then all of a sudden it gets to be your turn and we start to have those conversations and you look at me a little differently you said I just thought I was going to get all the shots I didnt think I was going to get all the pressure grumball for three that ones good and its two in a row for Tain from the outside its Rowan Rumba I think coach Hunter is very comfortable when his team is shooting the ball well because he likes offensively to give you a lot of freedom and when the balls going in the basket the more freedom you can give your players but getting good looks at the hoop right that freedom to do whatever you want but getting those good looks inside here is Watkins and finally gets the scoring going for Florida State and thats why hes so important to Florida State because Watkins has game recognition in real time he sees what needs to what will work during the course of the game Brar another three corter and thats off a little bit long rebounded by Yuan for Florida State Id like to get you in inside a little bit give him a touch here underneath the basket gets it the dang and hes fouled and and thats what Yans able to do hes able to catch it turn Face score or catch it and pass but I think as many touches as he can get today especially against this matchup I think the more effective Florida State will be Banks picks up the foul his Applause Applause first all right Kevin Chris thanks very much as we welcome you here to Sun R Florida for the second of two games in our Auto Nation orange ball basketball classic from Emirates Bank Arena home to Florida Panthers its the seminal here and the tan Green Wave right now its a 64 lead for T Lane three and a half minutes gone by here in the first Applause half seols possession this is Jerry Dag Justin Thomas into the hands of Malik Yuan goes crosscourt opposite corner Watkins for three short and rebound Green Wave and cam Williams two lanes in a couple of early threes theyre two of four from the outside Florida State 0 for three from threepoint range Banks takes it in on the drive two strong fight forward euans got it for the seminal both of these two teams will really challenge you at The Rim defensively so if youre going to drive the ball you better be strong you better finish strong just like that Watkins for Yan throwing it down to tie the game at six I just think Ying is is ying is so important for Florida State I just think hes very active hes very skilled and hes very unselfish Applause Music youan now tries to force it inside he does and collecting it is dayquon Davis The Freshman who puts it in in Florida state has the Applause lead eight nothing run after trailing six nothing to start this game and we played just under five minutes here today youan going up top youre watching vwe on ESPN and will be be back after this all right this H seon fromy and

basketball classic sponsors Auto Nation welcome back game two of our double header here today Sunrise Florida as its an 8 to6 lead for Florida State over to Lane Mike Cory Perry Clark with you here it was a 6 nothing start for the Green Wave as they hit two threepointers and now Florida States on an 8 nothing run over the last 2 minutes and 23 seconds Florida state does what it does really well they get the ball inside they like to play around the glass and uh theyve really done a really good job as far as as playing through Ying I I think that hes been the guy that scored and has set up the other guys on the team four players for Florida State have two points a piece theyve used a different starting lineup here today it was jir Watkins with dayquan Davis Jerry Deng Malik Yuan and Justin Thomas every one of those players except for Thomas so far have a bucket here in this first half two Lan inbounding get it in Mari Applause Jordan itll be interesting to see the way T Lane handles the switches by Florida State as what they run offensively Percy Daniels hands off grumbot another threepoint attempt that one short re by Watkins Watkins trying to go corner and he did so to AJ Swinton who corals it now inside for Applause y Yan gets a step good up fake count it and another foul Applause 23 you a is so tough inside when I watch film I thought this would be a tough matchup for Tain because of the physicality that which Ying plays with talked to him yesterday the guy that went initially to Old Miss and then South PL Community College last year junior college player of the year LEL Texas and he said that humbled me and really got him ready to play at this high level once again first ACC game of the year the last game versus NC State he had 23 points hes tough hes physical he plays Music angles the thing I like about him too defensively he talks a lot right Daniels throws it away looking for Asher Woods goes into the front row its an 11 nothing run for Florida State after trailing by six to start the game this is what got has gotten to Lane in trouble at times they hit spurts where they break down and not able to score which then defensively they make some mistakes and they find themselves in a hole lets see what happens here on this defensive possession with that them to your point starts to affect the other side of the Court youre right and now Woods guarding Watkins tough cover there and thats jir Watkins for you yeah Watkins is a guy that smells blood in the water I mean he just sees the game in real time and see whatll work and when itll work transfer from VCU had opportunities potentially to go to the NBA last year this is a Blocks going to be a goal 10 going to count the basket for Caleb Banks you know Watkins coach had some workouts with Sacramento Portland Charlotte Milwaukee got some information you know from those places and more for his next opportunity at the next level and hes come back here to finish out his career you know you had a good talk with him yesterday and I think what I got out of that was that he was very comfortable making decision that would be best for him in a life decision and coming back to Florida state was the best life decision for him well another big decision for him hes going to be the first in his family to earn a degree hes going to have his degree in social science and interdisciplinary studies and that means a lot to him so going to get his degree finish off the year strong hopefully for him and also maybe incre increase your draft status for the next level why not without question thats what Im talking about life decision thats a life decision right right there lot of contact on that play right there coming back is Banks slow to get up now hes recovered has it yeah the way T Lane plays Glenn is interesting because hes their biggest guy and they keep him up top a lot as count of to initiate Banks kind of throwing himself there at the rim and he got fouled I love the way Banks plays if for fans the first time seeing this young man hes always in aack mode and uh hes really hes very good athletically um he can shoot the basketball but the fact that he always put pressure on the defense is one of the things that I really like about his game Swinton call for the foul for Florida State substitutions here dang and Thomas go out Applause youan is back in Christian Neo is in as well for Florida State heres the runner on the shot no good that time by Greg Glen and the rebound into the hands of Watkins thr those guys to get up the court here now he goes up top and almost the alleyoop there for you and he said my bad our Auto Nation starting five for the tane Green Wave and the players on the court right now as you see the runner no good by Glen and theyre starting to falter a little bit here from the field coach after a hot start early and look out now they get it the TR great transition again Watkins triggered the Applause transition and Yans got seven points here to get things started every time T Lane looks up theres a Florida State Jersey right in front of so its really not a lot of room to penetrate great feed from Watkins and now a steel Watkins takes it himself and hes going to be fouled by Banks and after a 6 nothing start by Tain its a 152 run by the seal there a great dunk right there by Ying with a great finish and then another thats the way the seos are playing today Music us here we go folks that atmosphere is going to be incredible can you believe it the first round of the college football playoff begins Friday December 20th Music all right this DJ this is your orange basketball classic host and its time for your AutoNation air guitar cam I need everybody to get your air guitar out I want to see who the best rocker is in the building lets go let get Applause yeah whos joining my B tonight whos joining my oh we got some rocks I got my stage let get youut that was Music here we go folks that atmosphere is going to be incredible can you believe it the first round of the college football playoff begins Friday December 20th so whats great about the playoff look at these awesome games we got coming up on the college football side of things theres Ron Hunter for the Tain Green Wave that got off to the fast start they hit the first two shots both threepointers but since a 6 nothing lead here coach theyre down 15 to two on the Run by Florida State and they have only scored one bucket in the last 6 minutes and 18 seconds and again that thats been a problem for them throughout the course of the year and so far its been consistent scoring one for nine one for their last nine after two for two to start you know Ron was explaining to us yesterday how hes so used to having veteran players and older guys and so he gives his team a lot of freedom offensively and with young guys I them being able to respond to that freedom sometimes can be a bump in the road Music subti sub Watkins has made it a 178 game as Justin Thomas comes in for Florida State Florida state will continue with the hard ball pressure and they will continue handling the ball screens by switching and their sides is so much you know its hard for people to understand the sides see against smaller guys maybe that pass gets through but the length that Florida state has it was Yan getting in there again to make the play for Florida Music State Glen Greg Glenn call for the foul for Jan his first that two lane becomes very smallish when Glenn goes out fifth foul for the team in this first half just two in Florida State Thomas for AJ Swinton now for Yan gets a step look at that move by Malik Yuan they just dont have the physicality or the size the challenge Y at at at the um Rim right now coming off a 239 rebound effort in the last game for Florida State and the overtime loss at NC State by 10 points and I think its a little scary because uh you know coach Hamilton had said hes just starting to scratch the surface of you know what he wants and believes that he can do and uh yeah so far uh hes only got nine points and five rebounds and an assist here in the first n and a half minutes of the game those of us that know Leonard Hamilton he is great for understatements and so I think that was one of those understatements I think hes scratching more of the surface here here now today Applause heres brumba lost the handle on the deck its going to be a tie up dayquon Davis thought he had taken it away but theyre going to get the ball anyhow oh no they got a timeout called instead thats why he thought he was upset he thought it was at least the jump which would have been Florida State possession grumball calls the Applause timeout well be back Theon is really Music Chang see you guys 10 minutes and 21 seconds to go in the first half Florida stayed 19 to8 over to Lane here early they have been led by number 12 Malik euan hes got nine points five rebounds for the seals as he steps back out and this team also defensively has you know made some really nice plays inside and have made it tough on two lane just to get a good look at the basket well anybody that plays against the lonard Hamilton team knows they bu off their defense theyre very aggressive with it they use their hands they they shut down driving lanes and their ability to switch on everything just shows you the versatility that guys have to have defensively shot clock and its going to be a violation Applause VI substi Tain is now three of 12 from the field well I think Tain is go they cant just make an entry and expect to get a good looking shot I think theyve got to reverse the ball from one side of the floor to the other I think theyve got to be able to establish some sort of inside game to make the defense collapse right now Florida State just really playing good perimeter defense and theyre able to get take to Lane out of what they want to do heres Watkins on the crossover guarded by Jordan up top it goes now heres Davis and theres a foul underneath Woods was had both arms wed around you and and uh he said Im not going to get DPed on this is Im not going to be a post to child today picks up his first personal 16 foul up to the top Thomas for three no good rebound by Glenn all right what are you got to see here for Twain well not that interception Davis for Applause two I think Tangs got to get into a flow right now Florida state has taken them out of their flow brumba for three thats in and out rebound by Thomas its one pass and a shot and its hard to get good offense when you have one shot in a pass there there you see the pressure right now was make the pass David picks it up and he comes right in there use the rim to protect the ball and is able to finish its a 13point lead but Florida state is on a 212 run four turnovers in the last four minutes for through Lan Glen final basket and thats again thats the way coach hunter likes to use Glenn that he uses him to initiate his offense because of his size his ball handling skills I I dont think theyre going to be able to live off of Glenn bringing it down and driving to the basket Yan gets it up top now Davis back inside for Yuan theres a spin by Davis instead its a three in the corner Thomas he hits it well against the matchup its hard to go take away the low post High Post in the corner and Coach Hamilton talked about attacking one of those areas every time down out of his man offense Justin Thomas hits the first three of the afternoon for Florida State and they now lead it 2410 coming up on 8 minutes to go in this first half grba inside rejected Yan Applause Watkins kicks it D he got it stolen away thats a nice play there made by Mari Jordan Jordan takes it in hes blocked by Justin Thomas and its been all Florida State so far here in this first half and they have been moving the ball and this time on the offensive set it results in their first threepointer of the day seminal 24 Green Wave 10 back after Music this ear all

Nation the title sponsor of the orange W basketball classic here today as we have 6 minutes and 56 seconds to go in the first half the foul was on Jordan for Tain and now the Green Wave with Logan Stevens whos in this the sixth game of the season coach has only played 22 minutes coming into this game here today and you know coach Hunter probablys going to try to get something going figure this thing Applause out offensively I think julan has to be able to run something Florida state has been playing basically oneonone right now and its hard to beat a team like Florida state whos so well versed defensively with just oneonone action Rowan Brumar for the basket for two lane and its now Music 242 Stevens called for the foul next Saturday ends basketball right here on the ACC Network on the ESPN app Cooper flag and Company Duke number four in the nation take it on attack it to noon Eastern and our Prime Time West Coast matchup Cal squaring off against number 23 San Diego State thats next Saturday ACC basketball here on the ACC Network this is D at the free throw line for Florida State look for right now for two lane to try to run they some horns action that will get them one or two passes they run horns in the flex than side thats a good look there coach and that thatll give them more offense thatll be in the pain as opposed to when they were running their open motion where they were stuck on the perimeter got a half Banks produce he averages 16 points a game hes got seven so far here in this one dang for three got it they really like him as a shooter coach ham was talking about he thinks he will develop into one of the finest shooters that will be at Florida State s all for their first five from threepoint range theyve hit their last two and now fouls called and its on Justin Thomas of Florida State Thomas back to brumba Stevens and they got of bobbled at the official St so no travel its just no driving Lanes on the perimeter because theyre switching everything and so and then theyre in the gaps it makes it very difficult to get dribble penetration so I think you have to go to some other type of offense that you can initiate instead instead of trying to initiate off the bounce first foul on Watkins for Florida State 5 minutes and 20 seconds to go first half Stevens goes out for tane now its Banks Glenn Rumba along with Asher woods and cam Williams five in the court for the Green Wave down 15 the shot clock is at five grumba takes a look steps it in threepointers short rebound Watkins ahead of the pack hes got a wide open man and missing it on the shot was Christian Neo and driving is Banks and hes Applause foul that was tough luck by Neo that time he never got his feet set and then Tain was able to come back but again Mike its awful hard offensively to get into a flow when they basically have you going one onone and youre not getting in out of any sort of offensive flows one more for panks tomorrow afternoon ACC Network womens basketball going a triple header here coming your way Miami and pit they start us off in newon eastern Georgia Tech and North Carolina and then Clemson and Wake Forest St in the ACC Network tomorrow womens college basketball what about for Florida State on the offensive end and then what Tans doing defensively look at that play there coach inside for NE to for easy two I think as long as the balls in wh his hands Florida state has their offense pretty much figured out and they let they let him kind of read and initiate Applause three Porter Woods no banks tipped it rebound for the moment it was Thomas and he lost it Banks gets it back and takes it in for twoo Applause late hes trying to get it done for them coach hes got 10 of their 17 points so far and the ball is out of bounds Florida State possession when we come back there you see right there on the break great roll right there NE to was able to finish that makes it easy again KN to those type of shots are called high percentage Music Applause Music all right fans this is this is the Amazon package pass contest we have three row here right here in section 103 and its simple rules I need you to get this package to the end as fast as you can all right Rose are you guys ready all right you guys make some no right now all right on Applause Music Applause Music my 12 Music Music down Music of the your local tol toyotacom today take of deal our toyot the Orange Bowl committee would like to thank the following AutoNation Orange Bowl basketball classic sponsors amarit Music Bank welcome back were in Sunrise Florida Today double hener in the ation orange Wall basketball classic and Florida State leads to late 31 17 big reason why that guy number 12 right there Malik euan boy hes getting it done early in this game coach well he really is because hes so aggressive inside in his energy level you see him there on the roll and he finishes with a flush hes trying to post up hard and take it to the twolane defense right there hes able to use his side and angles hes always been a factor for Florida State to be able to have a good inside game and he shares the ball with the other players and they read him extremely well and I think thats why Florida State offensively has been as effective as theyve been he and Watkins together have really galvanized what Florida state is wants to do offensively hes almost got a double double here in the first half hes got nine points and seven rebounds well the physicality Florida state has against whether or not two lanes in a man in a Zone in a match up uh it it doesnt matter once the ball gets to the low block because it all becomes oneonone Play Once the ball gets into the post area you know thats I think something that folks dont understand a lot of your defenses to keep the ball from getting to certain spots on the floor but once he gets to C spots on the floor then the game becomes more oneonone and I think especially in the post area and thats where Florida state has an advantage 3317 now Watkins has eight points hes four or five from the free throw line for the seminal and what Im saying about Tane offensively is they try now to run some flow offensively its hard to go against this Florida State Defense off of isolation or clear outs and its an offensive foul and a push off on Asher Woods here he gets called for it for tane and thats going to be his second personal foul again and Coach Hunter is trying to explain slow down reverse the ball weve got 30 seconds on the shot clock lets use some of we dont have to get a shot in the first first pass or two inside youan goes up again and he is fouled and looks like its going to be on Glenn and thatll be his second certainly Florida state has come up with some action that has create problems for two lane offensively as again Yan is wide open in the middle and hes big enough and strong enough to be able to finish when he gets the ball that close to the Applause basket I got one shot Music all right so Tain one for two from the free throw line in this game Florida State 10 of 12 theyre getting it done at the line too foul here on D his second for the seals thats going to be the 17 foul so one and one here for brumba Coach Hamiltons not going to be happy with Ds defense that time because he didnt really need to Music reach Swinton is going to come back in for Florida State Florida and uh its like youve done this before you kind of knew d goes out yeah there was no need for that I mean they had the ball away from in the basket now we stick one of the better foul Shooters on the line for a chance to make two now this twolane team comes in at five six they had a five game losing streak going on Coach snapped it against Southern Miss on December 10th 86 to 58 you know what have you seen early on from this group you know maybe the reason for some of those struggles early and now in this position down 15 well you know when we talked to Coach honey yesterday I asked a question and he thought it was just a matter of playing and uh maturing and having the guys kind of grow up but you know I I think thats part of it and theres therell be some growing pains with this veteran with this Florida State team right now with some of the things that theyre doing but I just think offensively because Ive seen Rons teams play they flow really free offensively they got to get into some sort of Rhythm and Florida States an awful tough team to do that against and you can ask other coaches in the ACC because they switch everything theyre in the driving lane so you dont get easy access to the basket and you really have to run more patient offensively Percy Daniels had the foul for to Lane one more free throw coming up up next the nothing but n crew breaking down the day in ACC with highlights analysis of every womens game Sunday 600 Eastern they get covered all season long here on the ACC network and on the ESPN app 3619 largest lead of the game for Florida State theyve been on a 13 nothing run in this one it is a 6 nothing start for Tain and they have struggled since on the drive Mari Jordan got it out to the corner threepointers short by Banks rebound by Swinton seals running back to Applause Watkins Thomas defended by brumba takes it in on him no good there Yan had a tip into the hands of banks up for Jordan Banks to F nice job there Banks is always around the basket yeah he plays Banks plays with such great energy hes got to get somebody else to step up though and play with him that consistently can score in the half court hes got 12 points and six rebounds in this game for Tain as were down to a minute and a half to go in the first frame Applause look like is going straight man right now goes back to the Baseline side misses on the turnaround rebound by Glenn quickly Banks takes it in himself and hell head to the line for two with a minute 15 seconds to go trying to cut into this 15point lead Thomas foul 18 foul second on Thomas for Florida Music State I remember hearing you yesterday like we were talking to the coaches about like identifying the guy or identifying a player who is your goto player and and why is that so important why you have to I just think it gives you a comfort dont I mean its just like you know you have your favorite pair of shoes you have your favorite sweater you know you just know who youre going to go to when the games on the line or when things are tight and thats going to feel your energy and you got to have a connection and I think that that when years coaches talk about developing their team and chemistry I think that all goes hand in hand with that and figuring out who that guy is that you can count on and can put some pressure on to uh produce and its good for the the coaches and the players they got to know that without question knowing for players I think what makes them feel comfortable is knowing their roles knowing what youll accept from them and knowing what you wont accept from them behind the back there pass here from brumo to Daniels doesnt go fight for it and now players running into each other this is going to Danel I believe its on to Lane in Ringle up the foul fou Char you know and getting back to that point I I I dont I dont think that team a coach can really do it on their own timeout here were back in 30 seconds Music 417 seconds to play in the first half 3622 Florida stayed with the advantage here now you know the other thing too to has had 13 fouls in this first half as well too I mean just kind of you know in terms of I mean where have you seen here with that well well but I I I think thats just the way the game has flowed I think Florida state has been more aggressive going to the rim and going to the basket playing from the foul line in Tain has tried to do more isolation shooting threes and so thats just not going to necessarily draw you fouls so that that I think that stat sometimes is is going to the style of the game more so than anything else and I just think that um figuring out whats going to work today is very important as you coach your team you know I used to always tell my team the object of coaches to land the plane I mean its like you know you you got 40 minutes to land the plane and keep everybody safe so you got to figure out what I need to do today to land the plane and I just think that for Tain right now I think theyve got to run a little have more patience offensively get more people involved than just Banks and uh and then defensively uh uh Rim protect a little bit more and make Florida State shoot more jump shots than they do in the paint and how about moving the ball around a little bit more too like quicker and faster get that defense moving like you said if theyre going to switch and everything just try to get them moving around brumba thats not what they wanted there thats a shock clock violation and it it Stood Still for a while there coach like well you know again I mean you know and Ron Hunters won a lot of games and again hes used to having three guys that can handle the ball and break the defense down and uh and we talked yesterday and hes struggling with that because he doesnt have that with this ball club yet all right so nine seconds to go here for Florida State danks going to put it in to Watkins and here we go final opportunity before the half seals already lead by 15 4 seconds to go Watkins passes it did they get it up I dont think so and thats the end of the half Florida State led by as many as 17 its 15 at the half as its 37 has 10 coach Hamil has a way of understating a lot of things both to the media and to his players right trying to send a little message here uh to this team and uh so far working out here in this game today for them anyway as were back in Action second half jir Watkins working his way into the middle ball knocked away gets it back and its fouled and its going to be Jordan that picks up a foul Mari Jordan with his second for tan now the one thing tan cannot do is get frustrated theyve got a lot of basketball to play and uh they just got to figure out for the ball to start going through the basket on them for him and uh it it just kind of changed changes the whole dynamic of everything and Florida state is also able to get out and run theyve had turnovers that they turn into points they have 11 fast break points to none for tane nine points off turnovers off of seven turnovers by Tain from that first half Applause Davis and trying to save it was Applause Yan that that was a very good defensive possession that time by T Lane now theyve got to handle the pressure now offensively theyve got to get into some sort of offensive flow yeah Florida state has played pretty much seven guys in this game thats it eight have seen the cord been one for just a minute here a runner no good by Glenn I think thats where Glenn has to be more aggressive and all because hes a very talented basketball player if he gets the ball in that deep hes got to make something happen its over and down as Danang got caught in the air with that one and then lost the handle then Thomas stepped in the back corner with it I think those two possessions lard would like to have back Applause Jordan misses on the three trying to get there for the follow is Cam Williams and he got fouled thats the other thing cam Williams has been outstanding this year for Tain number three hes a freshman from Lafayette Louisiana coming off a game where he scored eight points couple of assists couple steals hes averaging almost 10 a game he has not even been involved one iota in this game he has one rebound at 14 minutes thats it got to get this guy the ball well you know again it its been a different type of flow because Florida state has made two lane basic play oneonone and so thats not where uh Williams is as effective as he can be you know hes good coming off of cuts and screens and crashing the offensive glass and hes only 17 years old been really the biggest surprise of this twolane team this year but at least trying to get your teammates involved right and into the flow of the game at some Applause point is a third leading score dang up top good look for the three Davis its going to Rattle out youan almost had it and its into the hands now of banks the lead is 13 here for Florida State l l as many as 17 brumba gets a step feeds it in Glenn Glenns pass deflected taken away heres Justin Thomas leading the break Davis Applause no and elain able to gather it bruman transition for three and a little ill advised there Here Comes decoin Davis and a one on four hell back it out so far neither team has really been able to get in any sort of offensive flow dang for three got Applause it he is a really good set shooter Im very much impressed with d and his ability and I watch his feet his footwork is really good on the catch and to be able to knock down threes rumbas pass intercepted coach Hunter has had enough over there and hes going to get Asher Woods Off the Bench hes going to check in rebound Applause Banks kind of looking at the body language too of the players coach it just doesnt seem like its there right now well its hard when the balls not going through the basket count out the basket blocking foul so Watkins with a second personal foul Banks is the only guy on the floor thats really looking like hes aggressively and playing with some positivity offensively the rest of the guys look like they have more questions than answers once they get the basketball shoot one shot you T Lane still I mean if they can get some offensive flow theyve got a chance of getting back in this basketball game try to get it the single digits at least give yourself a chance here Banks has a game high 16 points for Tain Applause kick ball shot clock back to 20 with 1623 to go in the game Watkins today just two of four from the field but hes got seven of nine from the free throw line with 11 points to lead Florida State the defense is clamped down TW shot just 28 from the field so far in this game heres Watkins three ball good luck got it 43 27 they keep him at bay coach and then they get the steal and its back to Watkins again and its like practice wow another three two in a row the pressure of Florida State and and thats the added DN Dynamic that they have when their half court offense is not flowing they can really create turnovers and then get in transition which creates easier baskets that was like shoot around right there heres a three for Twain and coming back is Mari Jordan and they needed that I mean this was pushing a 20 point lead if youre Florida State now Tain gets a Applause steal and they try to go back to back cam Williams misses on the three though and a foul on the rebound its going to be on Florida State and it takes us to a timeout 16point lead for the seminal here 1526 to go in this game there you see Watkins knocking down the three right there and then he does what he always does when he when he needs a basket you go to Watkins and hes been the guy thats floated Florida Music State imagine Court one that sees their customers as part of a team with a

stricking hard in his family Ive known him a long time and thats really had an effect and it really was very meaningful for him shot clock at 5 seconds for to Lane the runner no good that time by Asher woods and Florida State working with a 16point Advantage here what about what this group has been able to show you here today and the different lineup and stuff that has been on the court today for Florida State well I think theyve been very good defensively I think offensively theyve got a lot of their point off a transition foul line and taking the ball to the rim just like that take just like that I mean but but I think that they flow with that I think when theyve gotten in trouble when they settled for jump shots the disparity in terms of the shooting today 52 for Florida State 28 for t l that time Mari Jordan able to get the two there I still say its a lot of time left in this basketball game right now hes got to string stops together with a bat behind the back passing you and a three no good but get it it right back and look out Johson Thomas almost threw it down but too Lan the other way Banks he takes it in and hes fouled Applause Music Applause state was very aggressive on the other end it just didnt go and Banks has been the one guy that has been able to get to the line create contact and finish Davis with a foul his first for Florida State 16point game heres Caleb Banks whos three of five from the free throw line today you know sometimes the difference in a performance is your attitude and your Edge and certainly Banks has played with an attitude and an edge tonight that allowed him to attack a lot of the things that Florida state was doing the switching going to the offensive glass transition Spencer Elliott is checked in now for the first time today for Lane red shirted last year only a couple of minutes in the last game so getting some time here now just under 14 minutes left in the contest 14point Applause lead yeah the movement has just been so much better offensively you know for Florida State today clean up players like that for shots Jerry d d has really played well he hes picked them up in the second half hes got 13 points three of five from the Applause field to goes Woods 3 second Applause violation and again its going to be a happy flight home to New Orleans if I can say that at least if anything changes here in the next 13 minutes but yeah coach Hunter I mean he cant be that pleased with what hes seeing right now well hes used to his team offensively flowing more I mean most of his teams have scored in the 80s 70s and the 80s and so you know hes used for that kind of flow BL with the foul going to the free throw line need to Music next Saturday ACC mens basketball for you duke and Georgia Tech Cal San Diego State here right here on the ACC network of course streaming live on the ESPN app thats a week from today thats going to be an interesting game Duke at Georgia Tech Georgia Tech beat both Duke and North Carolina last year and I told Coach star that thats normally a year thats memorable for a coach I mean CU not too many people were able to do that so its going to be interesting Christian nitu from Ontario played Just 40 minutes up until todays game now you see anastasis roas who comes in as well true freshman from Greece just his fifth game of the year hes only played in 13 minutes of total time up to this point as well so coach Hamilton getting a few yeah hes playing a little different lineup I dont know what the reason for it but he playing a little different lineup than what he normally does Spencer Elliott was call with the foul for to Lane by the way previous foul driving for two is Cam Music Williams that time Florida State got caught in the back back door situation which not doesnt normally happen when you wind up switching the for NE to that was a smooth offensive play right there again Florida States looking to go back I think more so inside off of their offense

season gets going here it really is a special time of the year with playing basketball and football and it all matters 11 minutes and 49 seconds to go here with Florida State on top 55 36 and its two lane with Cam Williams to put it in play not quite sure what were waiting for here but now back to action with Glenn runs into a roadblock up to the top fre ball Williams no and Florida State running the other way here Davis get fast break Points 11 to two intercepted Ken and fouled I mean hes needed to try to get going a little bit coach one for four from the field just two points and what do we say at the top of the broadcast but did Hunter say we win when he plays well and he has to be more he has to be more aggressive you know he cant be passive uh he was a big part of the teams success last year um hes one of the veteran guys you know and on the other side you know to not to cut you off there but you know obviously something you know happened whatever at Florida State were not going to speculate but three starters whove played every game this entire season did not start today and they have not seen the court for Florida State and thats Chandler Jackson Boston Holt and Taylor bull Bowen and you know even without them crazy enough I mean theyre still up 18 points here today coach yeah well certainly you know theres certain things that happen on teams coaches and players they they kind of keep it between themselves and whatever the message was is being sent and other guys have definitely stepped up and played well today for Florida State they have Music yeah GRE GL with a foul and sometimes at the beginning you think well were just going to change our lineup and for you know for what were trying to do were going to try something different and then were going to bring you in later but when were in the second half its 11 minutes to go still havent seen you then right yep I mean thats uh thats for them and between the program with whatever happened but you know without those guys today Florida state had a good game 5537 in control here theyve been that way throughout thats traveling violation just under 11 minutes to Applause go sometimes when other guys are in the game and you start out and youre trying to make a point turn to them and say see it would be different if you were there but youre not here to help us you know and and really kind of make sure they understand the impact that they have on the team and what the team is trying to do thanks stays with it hes going to be fouled and wer embach whos called for the foul this is a lineup for Florida State and Ive watched just about all their games I have not seen before to get collectively and I itll be interested to see how long coach ham goes with this lineup and this is what has to be frustrating for Coach Hunter over there right with the I mean hes got his group I mean this is his group of guys and you know hes just looking for them to kind of gel and and and get this thing turned around a little bit here and youre going up against again and no offense right not the normal group of starters and players of for state that you been prepared against youre youre getting dealt one here to be honest I mean 16point deficit you know but coach Hunter is going through a lot of things right now hes got this young group hes trying to get them to play to the level that he wants them to play hes probably not even paid attention whos on Florida State te both teams will talk it over here here halfway through the second half 16 points 7o lead we can help you say hello to your 2 a Applause Applause I Music lets take a look at todays Duffy Sports Grill team parent MVPs throughout Amir Bank Arena here today coming out to support these teams we had Tulsa and UCF in game one knights with the win and then here right now T Lane in Florida state with a 16point lead for the seminal dely Sports Grill team parent MVPs here today Mike Cory Perry Clark seols possession you know Im Im looking at this Florida State team on the floor and Im its interesting who would they go through to you know and try to wor scoring going to come from but they still get it though thats the thing cam Williams of the foul for two in Ying comes back in Watkins is led the way number one hes got 17 points in this game dang has 13 and Yan has 10 so those three players alone out scoring to Lane 40 39 little Fade Away jumper here thats no good that time by AJ Swinton and into the hands of Greg Glenn grumba trying to power his way through gets it up top here for Jordan Jordan on the tank not there and now a foul is called and Coach Hunter cant believe it you know Im going to say this though just earlier this year you know Im fortunate enough to get connected with some of these officials and the conference uh you know led by Chris rastad or director of officials from the NCA and I sat in on a session in Philadelphia like officials convention and and learned a little bit about this so here youre going to go oh thats a late call wheres the foul you know what its about recognizing reacting and then and getting it right and theres a certain official who makes that call too you know what I mean so if its not your call you almost got to hold that whistle and not you know undermine your teammate you know so sometimes when you see that its not about they didnt know was the foul theyre just kind of waiting recognize react and then P that whistle you know and and again sometimes officials have a different point perspective of the play and from his angle he could see the contact and maybe the guy underneath could not I used to hate when they come along say well thats not my area its a big thing thats exactly right if its not your call its not your call now again if its egregious and and your part of misses it you got to blow the whistle but theres i y yall everybodys getting paid so see but thats where you dont cross each other up right in case one guy has one call the other guy has another thats why you have to let the official in that proper area make that call it was pretty interesting though just to be honest with you to be able to hear and see what they have to go through game in and came out not easy Rumba to Williams three ball no good and thats going to be a foul on Glenn and it over the back and coming up tomorrow afternoon our ACC Network womens basketball triple header starts in noon Eastern Miami and pit and Georg Tech North Carolina Clemson and Wake Forest noon 2 and 4 Eastern right here on the ACC Network in womens college

action UCF with the win earlier over Tulsa and then now here Florida state with a lead over two lane still 8 minutes and 16 seconds to play in this game Mike Cory Perry Clark with you here all right so its not what we expected right 14point game youve said it numerous times to Wayne they have time they just got to get a couple of defensive stops strung together here they really do they come out with full court pressure right now and I think you have to do something that Florida to get Florida State out of the Rhythm and their Rhythm has been getting the ball Applause inside Watkins for three no tapped back out and Tain recovering it here with Applause Jordan tan is out rebounded Florida state which is thats surprising to me coming into this game yeah very surprising 31 to 22 actually as Glenn takes it in for the dues five points for him just a second second field goal of the day Jan has been led by Caleb Banks number one with 20 points nobody else in double figures yet in scoring Florida state has three players in double figures Watkins 17 dang 13 and Yan 10 heres Watkins on the drive and foul see I think if Im Florida State thats what Im doing Im either throwing the ball into the paint or Im driving the ball trying to get to the foul line right now and Greg Glen is called for the foul and thats his Fifth and he has fouled out for two see the aggressiveness and with Watkins goes to the glass I think thats what Id be trying to do right now use that foul line to my advantage Glenn leaving the ball game is a is a big Advantage for Florida State I believe yeah unfortunately it wasnt his day here today for tane the guy coming off a 16 point 10 rebound three assist two steel effort in the last game and then today just kind of stiming two of five from the field that was it did had seven rebounds a couple assist but you know fouled out here for you know it was a different type of game for him I mean hes used to playing kind of a a point forward where he can beat his guy off the dribble because he is skilled in doing that and Florida State with just having none of it switching on everything and playing in the gaps and lets say this too you know its got to be tough right coach you talked about this earlier theres a few players you know from this Florida area and hes one of them from PPO Beach Florida not far from here had over 100 family members uh at the game you know today family and friends you know and and this is what happens right you want to go out there and you want to show everyone and just unfortunately it wasnt his that it it was not and again I think the flow of the game had a lot to do with it has there ever been a sense uh when youve been out there with your team even if a guy is and Im not saying do this but this him but a normally a starter or anyone that you put on the bench either early or not to start the game for them to see as this basket is scored here by Thomas to see and let them see how the game develops they go without question or I changed their role you know because I see that I cant take advantage of what I think I can and there you see you know again Florida State getting a really easy look inside and thats where theyve had most of their success today being able to score in the pain I think they just been too strong and tan has not really had a rim protector that been to stop Florida state from doing what they needed to do in the going call for the foul Justin Music Thomas there been 20 fouls today to by two lane as well and a lot of free throws 18 of 21 for Florida State theyve been money from the free throw line 86 17point lead their largest of the day is Applause Music 19 Runner here no good by Jordan offensive rebound Banks hes got 22 but then it makes it tough too when you have just one guy kind of doing most of the the workload and then the defense knows all right well we can make life tough on this guy I mean let somebody else step up and hurt us and really it hasnt happen today for Tain no Tain hasnt gotten anything easy either they havent got any easy looks at the basket they havent got any layups well theres one and a foul for Applause banks there Banks puts the ball on the floor again hes really attacking keeps his head up and hes able to finish that is the fourth foul on Malik Music mu Jordan goes out Williams is back in KJ green has also been in there number nine as well true freshman so heres Banks he could cut it to a 12point game here and he does still a lot of time now banks with 25 of two lanes 50 rest of the team has made up the other half hes eight of 15 from the field the rest of the team is eight of 34 just over 5 minutes to go Florida State in no hurry heres Watkins takes it in hes foul its on Percy Daniels his third for Tain well I just think thats the name the game unless you have a wide open three I just think that you have to keep attacking the basket get the ball into the low post and then if they completely collapse then kick it for a wide open three and draw the fouls here right youre in the bonus uh theyve been excellent from the free throw line today Florida State 18 of 21 what about for uh Florida state in the ACC this year early on what have we been saying well I I think the I think the biggest thing is their ability to be able to play in the pain area I think that they have to get a really good inside game I think whoever come plays well in the ACC has to have a good inside game good post up Applause game good for two lane with the American you know trying to get these type of wins right nonc confence play I mean its so big you know for the program for the league and thats why this is a big one here today tonight it is just because youre not going to get a chance chance to get a lot of squad one win right once you get in the conference Applause play foul on Florida State its on Yuan and he has fouled out here for Florida State that thats thats not a smart foul way out there on the floor for what he brings to this Florida State team 10 points eight rebounds had really led the way early for this group and now with 5 minutes and 3 seconds to go has fouled out of this game remember we know talked about the different type of lineup That Coach Hamilton has been using here today and now with him out theyre going to go to Christian Neu whos going to come back in and it really negates their size advantage that they had in their athleticism on the inside Music Applause Two Shots here for brumba Rowan brumba this young man is is is really unique came over from Georgetown has become the leader of this basketball team the go the captain has been documented earlier this year he is partially deaf and cannot hear well if youre behind him saying something this is number seven Rowan brumba youve got to be in front of him with face toface communication 70 death right now in both years and its been a real struggle and thats something that the coaching staff and the players theyve had to work through and and be conent of on the court for number seven and white for Twain and just admirable what hes been able to do out there battling through that without Applause question and to come in and to be voted Captain I mean that thats speaks a lot for his quality hes been a real leader too he reg at Texas went to Georgetown and now here at Tain and now inside his Banks couldnt get it to go that was a big one they could have really used that and on the deck coming up with it as need to for Florida State that could have cut it to a 10point game and now Watkins the veteran player knows were not in a hurry to shoot this ball here and theyre going to get a foul on to Lane that foul just didnt make a lot of sense why he would push way out there I dont know and KJ green got called for that foul so Watkins I mean think about this coach the last game versus NC State he was 16 of 17 at the foul line today hes 11 of 13 well hes the one guy in Florida state that has really been aggressive going to the basket and creating foul situations 27 of 30 in the last two games yeah I was just so impressed as you were talking to him yesterday you know of his values and whats important to him and why he came back to Florida State and really kind of quiet guy and Coach says you know he can take on more of a leadership role and he has been trying to do that for this Florida State team the senior from Trenton New Jersey the three years at you know VCU you know had offers right from St Johns Michigan showes come here to Florida State you know the hardest thing for a coach you try to make somebody a leader that thats almost impossible to do you know because it has to do with their personality and everything yeah coach he needs his voice just as much as his play on the court and today with 22 points in 12 of 15 from the free throw line he has helped lead the way Rumba got it the lead is 11 with 355 to play little pressure here in the back court seals get it over here to Applause Watkins tenis shoot knocked out of Watkins hands and itll be Florida State Hall with six to shoot when we come back 325 in list this one seols hanging on to an 11point lead their allar the for all the road War out War ailles tius ofus bedc all right F we this one more time it is time for our animal Camp presented by zo Miami lets see those animal faces everybody its time for the zoo Miami animal cam where are my faces where are my faces show me those animal faces courtesy Su Miami na sponsor of the na basketball CL your favorite the orange wall committee would like to thank the following AutoNation Orange Bowl basketball classic sponsors Sumit Tomo welcome back here for game two of our double header the ation orange W basketball classic 6554 Florida state with an 11point lead 325 to go in this game coach what you got to do with your Twain here they theyre trying to inch their way back this one finally I think you have to make some defensive stops and I think you have to take the ball to the basket right now and put pressure on Florida State and make them foul you well it starts here to hold them on this possession with only six to shoot gets inbounded heres a jumper and it is up No Good by Justin Thomas and a rebound by Banks and two Lanes got it Banks the first twolane player with a 25o double double against a high major team here in Florida City in the last 20 years I mean hes been outstanding 25 points 13 rebounds will it be enough here brumo for three no good and the rebound into the hands of Watkins for Florida Applause State look for Florida State to bring it out and try to run a little bit of clock and get it down to about the two and 1 half minute Mark here but Watkins takes it in gets the floater no and a foulest call again Watkins going to the basket what he should do at this point in time Music there you see Watkins putting the ball down going to the basket getting fouled but putting the pressure on the defense not settling for jump shots right last time this game was in single digits was at 17 to8 when Florida State LED 178 at the 1141 Mark in the first half Watkins 13 of 16 at the line and Jordan comes back in for Daniels for Tain coach this is going to be backto back games where Watkins has had 17 free throw attempts he hit 16 in the last game and now hes hit 14 today well has been very aggressive and if he continued to play with that aggression then he will get back Bank stepped over the line it looks like thats a tough mistake here in this stage of the game and your own back court and giving the ball back to Music FSU Daniels is back in for green I think they wanted go a little bit more sized and make sure they can get rebounds Applause yeah I dont know if they could have made that substitution there thats what theyre saying so green has to stay in 2 minutes and 43 seconds to go they want 244 back on the clock here if they could fix that the other thing coach about this game yeah is that its been hard this shot no good that time by Davis the heart of getting the flow a little bit here in this game of th thanks fouled hard that was a big Miss by Davis he had a flat layup right there on the on the inbounds play and come down the other end and put banks on the line Applause to the line K Applause the and Bs today eight of 11 from the free throw line with 25 points now Daniels will check in Applause Music Applause 12point game each team with two timeouts Applause remaining Watkins and fou again thats not bad though I mean at some point you got to send them the line you got to hope that they miss some so you get more offensive opportunities so Applause just like to hope to foul somebody that misses right will back theame Applause again Florida State playing without three starters Applause right rebound panks coming up on two minutes to go here 13point game could tane gets something from the field theyre three of 20 from threepoint range today dont need one quite this second but they put it up and its no good and rebounded by Florida Applause State s trying to use up some time here minute 50 to go leading by 13 to Lane Ive c a foul they try to get the steal Watkins gets it inside and missing on the runner that time KNE to and here comes two lane with grumo gives it inside Banks got it and its fouled so Cale Banks whos got 28 points now for Tain and a chance for the threepoint play to cut it down to 10 the worst thing you can do with Florida State right now is foul Banks really used the body well initiates the contact possession out arrow goes to Lane Music also now Florida state has done their damage at the free throw line in this game 24 of 29 because they have had no made field goals over the last 5 minutes and 8 seconds but they still lead by 10 as Tain talks it over here with a minute 29 to go and thats what I said earlier where I would put the ball on the floor and attack because the team that they had on the floor didnt have a lot of shooters for Florida State so I wasnt going to try to depend on that I was going to burn some time attack the basket try to get to the foul line get a couple threepoint plays but theyre going to have to come up with some stops and I think T Langs going to have the foul I I I I dont think they can sit back and just expect good defense and and Florida State remember youan has fouled out of this game now he had 10 points early on and its been Watkins whos just done the damage and every time they needed something he was able to get to the rim and get fouled and hes 15 of 19 from the stripe the best shooter has been dang all year you know for this game and you know he has its been a while since hes had a jump shot thans with a career high 29 Points and a a career high 15 rebounds for to lane today thats pretty impressive and just the third time in 20 years for Tan that a player has had 25 points and at least 15 rebounds its its an impressive day except hes been really the only one Bubbas got 13 the only two players in double figures for Tain they going to just try to foul here or you got to try to get the steal but then well I think yeah on the first one try to get a f a steal and then try to foul but I would try to I try to fou somebody other than Applause Watkins sometimes you have a real good shooting percentage from the foul line because the right guys 29 to go down Applause 10 dang to put it in on the run here is Watkins Alo Time Justin Thomas look at that thats a set play out of the timeout right there run by coach Hamilton Applause Music Rumba and hes fouled on his way up with a minute 12 to go right there to get in Watkins he throws it up Thomas is able to finish they started in that little box set and they wanted to get the ball to Watkins so he could push it and Thomas goes long my coaches have all these fancy plays out the time out Applause yeah grumball with one more to make it a 10point game once again its still a lot of time I mean its still a minute left hes got 15 points at a perfect six for six at the line today dang gets it and hes being held by brumba Applause Music Applause even coach H couldnt complain of that he just laugh you got it Music yeah 54 free throw attempts in this game today 21 of 25 for Tain I me they shot 84 then 24 29 83 for Florida Applause State 26 now for watz coming off the 24point effort in the last game that lost to NC Applause State 51 points there in two games for him Applause green needs the cutter Banks thats a goal 10 basket counts back to a 10point game you cant let him come down though and score that easy you have to get back set your defense and make them make two or three passes Watkins trying to dribble out of some traffic and a double team and its going to be fouled yet Music Applause again they trying to stretch it out here and give themselves a chance to Lane but its the free throw shooting its its too good on both sides today really I I get the strategy its just not working out Florida state has to get back and and make Tain have to move the basketball you know that theyre trying to put their head down and drive and just try to get to the P Music Applause line and Watkins with this attempt here will have a careerhigh free throws attempted in this game with 23 his previous career high was 22 versus rice and that was on November 9th so hes now 19 of 23 in this game career high 19 free throws made and 19 of his 29 Points coming from the line 31 for banks to the other side for tane clock winding down at this point Banks hits it 10point game 478 to go another foul here coming up the court obviously on green as he bumps right into Florida States dayquan Davis but again thats thats not a bad foul I mean at least you know you got Watkins that not shooting it so now somebody else has to go in and make it but the only way you got a chance is you got to you have to foul at this point in time so yeah depending anything crazy here Florida State wins this game going to improve to 8 and0 versus two lane all time and a neutral sight game which is where were at here today in Sunrise Florida the Auto Nation Orange Bowl basketball classic second game of our double header how about the win from UCF for earlier today over tulson I I thought it was a big time win for UCF I they played well they really played well together they executed they defended thanks has it green with 38
