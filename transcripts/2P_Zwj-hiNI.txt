thats a good personal foul will go against key number two take a look key right here thats going to bump up oh there it is right there no doubt about the shoulder and I told you he has a history of getting to foul trouble for these two valuable to the Buckeyes they cant afford to lose him because the size and strength he possesses they also making 64 of his shots nothing inside you to pick on some more Proctor yeah got an excellent look that absolutely buried it well he got a good luck he scored his body okay remember the big reputation as a shooter and his numbers dont show that now but John Shire told me and I believe in what John says hes a dick and its all said and done the kidneys are shooting to the great technique its American familiar with one another getting the right shot kickball there and Friday our NBA doubleheader ESPN and as the Lakers in Milwaukee 6 30 Central Time look at those kids hey right there you look at our future doctors lawyers politicians youre looking

half that new transfer came to Oklahoma state was a tremendous defensive player for they call it ice is a great player thats Mr Gervin man Mr Gervin hes in another world Granderson second to put ice to the line I was chatting with him today about how he killed the time on the 10hour flight to Maui he said I had never seen breaking bad and I binge watched it pretty much the whole thing all the way to Maui sick I loved it I watched every second of it didnt watch that movie in my life he didnt watch Mickey that was apparently coming next so he ran out of time but unlikely tremendous defensive player and he really Drew Memphis three points for him so far tonight Philadelphia Eagles playing Virginia Tech you know in Cincinnati had 40 against Arizona and what he did against this kid yeah baby abuse yes shut him down shut them down Applause Duke by two with the basketball inside the last five minutes of the first half Eric Cameron Proctor Blakes will feed the big Sandy pass inside and you dont know exactly what to do with it tremendous look that he broke down ball in great vision found the ultimate and a little Kaepernick defense I thought maybe it was deflector they quick deflected outstanding teamwork leading to a timeout by the Buckeyes well take the break as well 2723 wow wow what a great look Music the new Sonic two for five dollar menu for limited time only at Sonic Ive been doing a challenge here 25 guys were on the NBA rosters Applause the 2001 I think in a championship team they had 3549 Williams Ohio States done over four minutes without a basket during that time dick to turn it over four times and a selfish play meanwhile for Duke assists on seven of ten field goals made and some terrific passes holding his way in cant stop that tremendous job kid to blow on the inside very unselfers for the high percentage shot I think theyre going to do more of that pound the ball inside for the mix just name the ACC rookie of the week for the third straight week sevenfooter 230 pounds worth he plays with such confidence out there its about trying to get involved and does as he drops in a bucket they need more of that hes just a guy who can score on three different levels he has really that unbelievable ability to score so far hes 46 beyond the threepoint Arc so they need a lot more of that on this for tonight Mitchell to philipowski again they are keen on him every time down Blakes will give it up from the corner Mitchell foreign Applause Music very short Ohio State team South you can play four and five out and still play through the post and doing a great job of that but coach Vitale it is great to hear your voice once again hey Chef thank you so much lets hunt for is a lot of money for my deep Foundation helps out there with a count value some of that Shucks though Jack by the way Duke cleaning up the turnovers dick its six of them the first nine minutes over the top and Lively cant get it to go but there is a shove in there and theyve only turn it over one time in the last eight minutes see thats one of his strengths total lob up to him and great bounce off the floor Applause with the foul Applause will be Lively at the line named preseason ACC rookie of the year but he was hampered by a calf injury missed a chunk of the preseason hes not quite a hundred percent from St Luke getting right here he was out on foot surgery missed the first four games Whitehead did Lively with three points so far tonight scuffling to line early on but that one will rattle in I get a feeling hes going to break out I really do continue to get some logs thrown up to him 3125 last three minutes of the first half stepped back by McNeely thought about it Scramble for the ball but Ohio State throws it away picked off by Blakes on the attack into the corner long range yes nothing but net by Whitehead throw it some play but you know what he did he ran to shoot for three ready to go for the layup and it paid off he managed it into Trifecta left so this feels like that Duke spurt you were talking about theyre famous for this they really are hoping that Ohio state would have been able to silent and damage of the 611 freshman from Nigeria as hell draw the foul the personal will go against Whitehead number one well thats just hope that I really do hes such a solid Temptation I think Ohio state is very fortunate to have him quality guy in every right teams have been playing really good defense holding upon us to 61 percent tough to hit threes against Ohio State they are off to a 51 start into the top 25 this week look at the window games theyre really hard got a text today from his and he says hey good physical now come up mentally and theyre going to win their share of games I got a text from Mike Dennis today you get texts

positive situations out there he really has averaging nine again he has eight already in the first half to keep it within Striking Distance 3629 coming up on minute to go Applause the Airborne road to the left hand boy that was a difficult angle great move to get it and the foul using the left hand was really smart too he really deleted with the left hand great drive to the goal Ill tell you what hes used that Sprint really well thats the screen Wiley lays the screen for it no hesitation then he goes in and protects the ball lays it up with that left hand big time player I mean hes his game changed in the middle of the year and last year tournament time he was really so valuable one last year that he lost to the semifinals went to the final four goes through school down the road that plays a little basketball that would be the University of North Carolina oh its in the church Chapel Hill thats not far from me yeah theyve had some pretty good players over the years I think they had a guy of course his dads with 23 hes pretty good point yeah the Name Escapes me at the moment Mr Jordan Michael the Magnificent Keon young pretty good battle there using the window but no crashing the glass it comes back to the Blue Devils with 35 seconds before the break hes stronger going the other way King not a timeout so Duke will take one here with 329 to go and on top by 10 over the Buckeyes

soda would be a major major player East but Texas to me I voted purple one this year I really do I watched them once on TV and I was blown away on their talent the commitment to defense which is Chris Beards clubs all about I think though the two best conferences in basketball they cant hear me in ACC well maybe because the two best conferences are the SEC and the big 12 okay both of our hearts earn all of these conferences we get to cover everybody were very very fortunate you and I are going down field house pretty soon a couple of weeks for Kansas and Indiana well I cant wait to move down here youre talking about a place there are certain venues that are so special this is certainly special Kansas I really think that a lot to Wrigley Field where they left the Footwear parks where you had to bring luxury to work on a great basis not a bad office but it does a great job closing the Red Sox 17 before halftime splitting the D and a block by key they get an opportunity to get a decent shot off trying to get her up to 10 try to get him to see the digits big deal looks like he wants to take it he can shoot it pulls up and fires left his short second effort will not go and that and thats the end of the first half they had a chance Duke led by 13 and a half that last year Ohio State won the game 7166 Duke with that spurt up by 10 as we go to the studio Kevin bonds and set on the way hell be solid first 20 minutes for the Duke Blue Devils come on inside great look now watch and then Blakes looking back inside drives the ball inside what a great look terrific youve got to share high percentage shots man hes throwing the high percentage shots he knows the key to winning if you take good shots Dave thats the kick in basketball shot selection somebody teach that bad shots theyre going to start a score of the Ftype they really shot me okay thats their score Florida state is one at six and they havent come close to anyone theyre down two down two to Purdue enough second half our Sonic Blockbuster matchup underway Buckeyes looking for one of their own Duke has got an excellent production Off the Bench sticks 16 points by a combination of four different players thats made a big difference you told me he was going to go to respect more and respect him for one likely with the left hand thats pretty shots that we just started very experienced player they have easily a second effort just stayed with it very calm under there got the ball a little too easily to him theres nobody challenging playing the passing around he has 11 you can see that Josh get the kids buying him to play with defense theres like an intensity idea Applause banging inside flips it up wont drop for him and on the line and he turned that one over back downstairs we go to Chris well smoke with John chair going into halftime and as you guys said sharing the basketball he was very pleased with that Applause with that to be able to play through contact he said our two concerns also sensible and McNeil for Chris Holman on the other side said we have to be able to limit turnovers 10 of them in the first half just the swing by the way held to three points in the first half so thats of concern for the Buckeyes Applause jump shot hes got a guy to come back down two three quick threes youre back in the board game like they just picked up his second personal we talked about nine assists on 14 made field goals for Duke and they only turn it over one time in the last 11 minutes remember we were kind of harping on that first eight or nine minutes they were turning it over a lot

that for Daddys wow what good looking guys Dan and Jay will have the call on that one from Indiana batted away and scooped up by the Blue Devils which is Whitehead tipped on into the lane he cant finish it communication he hit a trailer a little flip over his shoulder he would have had a late because hes got a communicate here yes he will hit the three big turnaround could head to the other way second fivepoint turnaround to three there Applause right now its down to eight 5042 with just a little over 14 minutes to play you look at the turnovers those who calm down for the Buckeyes Duke with nine so far theres a ball to stop so Clays gotten crisper one thing I like about the bucket nice too they play hard thats a reflection of you coach thats a reflection of a guy whos teaching that who theyre buying into what he wants done to really see focused defensively right now oh I want to throw it up a little yeah youre kidding me what a nice play a little head fake to a high low action they were ready for that attacking that zone big guys can really play yeah theres no doubt about it sensual hasnt knocked away with 14 to shoot senzema has really been quiet and all I did in preparing for this game hurts so much I mean I had all these notes down I wanted to share here but I cant read it but hes got too dark I gotta finally put a little light bulb here for us a makeshift light they found in an office here Cameron Indoor this might have been right out of Coach Ks office chip sheets trying to cheat a little bit here oh God it did get a little dead shot clock at seven takes a look at that Gail you can hit the threepointer and cant do it this time he has not come up big today in huh Applause you know they got a good point production good point position those guys have to score for oh look at this match inside oh he wants to blow in the worst right in this they get it for an offensive foul thatll be number three Phillip phillipovski with his third they must have been could have had him really could have had him earlier missed him in the post I dont know how you can miss a guy that sucks the best post Pastor I ever saw in college in all the years they did games was Pearl Washington oh Pearl Washington circus hes talking about cancer bro was taking almost three cancels the magician with the basketball he and Julie Baden theyre going to be there put him up on the Rafters a couple of nice moves for him here in the second half he was all looking for a foul two there Music Applause got his signature on the floor 5244 take a look whos going down low he won a little flop quick he won a little flop cooler today called The Flop and holding wallets really didnt change Music the warnings done no more warning they go right to the line to shoot one it should make it really tough as well how did one of his five 244 Duke and the foul and since about will be his third they just cant get away from the duck but were going to have the same house thats hanging in here hanging in here yeah pretty sticky likely will replace Thornton for the Buckeyes its a nice combination were going through an improvement and weve got a physicality under the cards I must play right here with the jumper that doesnt get there shoulder Applause Music four fouls on it now Applause left shoulder Applause but guys go back to the bench and well bring suing back in so tough night for him the Freshman came in averaging 16 points a game its been rough sledding thats amazing whos hoping came from Butler hes here now Ohio trying to drive against McNeil cant convert Buckeye is trying to cut in likely gave up the dribble gets it back down to three key getting a lot of touches and thats where hes affected right in here nice big move and yes I got it to go hell be at the line for threepoint play hes really got their great ability to use his body Welsh Applause but they travel all the time so he wanted something he could easily take care of so he got a python he uh yeah takes care of a python back home same as seven seven has his own Instagram handle you know it gets cold up there in Columbus he wears tiny hats hey hey dick I know youve got pets Roger golden golden retriever would Roger and seven get along oh I know one thing living in Florida and I always tell my family to my kids you better respect reptiles he will respect the son if you better respect water but if you dont youre in trouble so when I see those guys I go the other way its a wonderful sentiment but you both lost me at the reptiles hat I mean where do you where do you shop for a reptile hat and and then theres the next question why do you do that well Different Strokes Proctor beyond the three meanwhile the Buckeyes have tightened this thing up knocked away Applause will be fouled as he went toward the blue area and draw the foul with seven on the shot clock and thatll be unlikely Applause Music to keep them away from them right is there a store or an online store you go for that or Im not sure I want to know another 34 to go at the line came in at 15 points nine rebounds a game he had a nice touch on the free throw line she admitted 80 percent although we got a lot of great big guys in college basketball really next game has two with big cotton so did Trace Jackson Davis I mean really when you think about the game Timmy think about the shiba and a lot of big guys came back and I think thats a good sign for power troops 5447 Applause still to come Indiana and North Carolina and Hoosier country Applause on a baseline nice Cut cant convert it though a missed there by Holden got a great look though a little tremendous job clay without the basketball a lost or great motion good bounce pass everything the score got to make that later you got to make them down seven on the road youre going to convert that Applause no rotation there whatsoever and a lady showing that bounce weve heard about Dave today weve seen that bouncing him Im so happy for him too because really hes been so much less his dad at age seven Mom battle and cancer what I love about her and they learn a little Dana ONeil she said I never asked why suing went up but a foul before the shot so no basket there and watch the pull rotation right here good job rotating wide open I mean I can make that layer come on I know Lively room number one and you can dunk it I mean I dunk it but Ill make them my little left hand layup by guaranteed I may not dunk it philipowski with number four pursuing at the line but again philipowski with four personals this guy has had a rough night as well scoring only four points so far and the big goes to the bench 10 and a half to play here Applause Duke unable to break away it looked one or two times like they might but the Buckeyes are gritty fought back thats a great move gritty the grind and battle they fight it was typical of Duke Island which happens in Columbus simply being seen that in a second half against the Wolverines of Michigan two I mean two runs for touchdown from Edwards are you kidding me right during the defense another State playing Carolina by the way coming up on December 17th which will swing a proctor of three got it thats good for him thats good and he sure had 20 coming into you good three thats the second one hes made and everybody has said he is a outstanding shooter yeah youre exactly right he was five for 32 from 39 oh a tough shot by suing in the foul up in the air got hit made it anyway so we got so many injuries he could play on all that and hurt the first game and that was it for him his comeback had the monster game out there in Maui hes from Hawaii I think he went to 33 yep 33 points against Texas Tech Mitchell with the personal to put him at the line looking for a threepoint play Cashes in General stop right here now Im gonna fulloposky on it again under 10 the Buckeyes are not quitting theyre going to use that screening room a little more flipping the ball up to lives and lay a screen a little bit of gold two teams in the top 25 going toetotoe with Cameron Indoor and thrown away Radisson is cutting and roach fired it out of bounds Applause Jay Lucas came from over Kentucky hes a big plus youre looking caramels with a great great guy Caroline does a tremendous job Chris the former and standing player to you in the ACC Emile Jefferson took a bit of Team on the floor to the paint off the fake double fake and one and once again its key to convert and hell be back to the line Keys doing a lot of the things he did but he did play that game last year with her down 11 at that half and he carried them back to the game and watch him operate around the inside give him a little push oh man he got away did he get away with a push right there yeah no threepoint play but a fivepoint game a little pleasure to who you are and a timeout Duke takes one here with 9 19 to go and anybodys game Duke leading at 5954 at Cameron indoors Sonic two for five dollar menu for a limited time only Sonic set key to 68 Junior from Bayshore New York dick hes shown up he really has hes been so productive inside a lot of confidence from last year hes got number seven hopping him on in terms of give him some incentive again last year he struck for 20 when Ohio State upset number one Duke that was one year ago today and he has 15 in this game Music and you know whos the happiest thing anywhere over that development I cant believe they found a hat for the snake but okay but Mr King gets back home six rebounds too and Duke with the basketball and a fivepoint lead so I think the screen rule to the goal with Lively youre a great play with you and he missed him he was wide open after this open yeah hell knock it a three big shot by Mark Mitchell The Freshman yeah Mitchell hes working on that shot hes willing to the good player very Fisco starts making that three and its big part of Dukes number one ranked Freshman Class by ESPN on the back suing cant get the shot away good defense make him pick up the dribble and whistle off the ball Roger Ayers with a whistle with a 39 to go talk about the freshman class and he had another McDonalds AllAmerican in Mitchell and what a group including James shooter doesnt play very much we could really shoot it hes a big time she missed 17 threes in one game 17 threesome game been a great classic you know what next year that staff did stop working man they got Mackenzie and Bronco coming in from out of from Newark New Jersey Sean Stewart 68 from Mount Vernon Academy with a police player after player killed Foster Sherman Oaks California the home of one of the greatest announcers of all planets I mean of all time who passed away but he just was such a he checks got a chance to do a baseball game with Keith Jackson once one of the Thrills of My Life by the way Lively just picked up his fourth you know has four likely and sensible also have four no mentioning Keith I had a pleasure to work on ABC but was the producer and thats just Goosebumps down and next door everybodys keep shots popped up in the lane a fight for that a battle Ohio state says they have it but possession arrow will keep it on this end a lot guys are looking for a time out there lets just keep hanging around hanging around talking about Duke foul trouble Buckeyes have some guys in deep trouble too Music Applause so 8 21 left well see how that turns out in the end who really gets burned by the foul Proctor tried to dump it down low to Young and a whistle and a foul that has got hit again two down play very active inside yeah I mentioned in a class Jordan McCain as well if you want to come over to California two man play right there take that shot young but hes very hacked up pretty good one of you guys like that Off the Bench man the other one and one Holden picked up his first foul theres been really strong on the offensive glass also been their number one dunk guy so far great family of athletes his mom Tammy played volleyball at Syracuse where his father Patrick was on the crew team Sister Jordan played volleyball the GW and his brother Kyle basketball at Sienna Sienna good little basketball program too we talked about a family see theyre gonna give a deal some shots theyre trying to blame him tough you gotta find shots for him hes the one guy that could stroke the three is that a shade to play them punk is right in his face he knows picked up by roach and off his foot and out it goes back over to the Buckeyes what a tremendous defensive effort I was watching away from the ball by Proctor against ONeill oh boy really could have gotten hurt on this Applause now to pick it off yeah this could have been ugly look at that looks like yeah this weekends featured college football lineup Conference Championship Saturday begins at noon Eastern three games at ABC and Sunday on ESPN at noon Eastern the exclusive reveal of the final college football playoff rankings find out who the top four teams will be playing in the fiesta and beach balls well the Buckeyes are hanging in here at number five they just did a little prayer hope that one of the guys slipping those four well I think theres three teams that are undefeated I mean Im only echoing what Ive heard from uh Kirk Herbstreit on the year and different people but those teams are safe theyre going to hope that Utah could do magically what they did the first time beat silly cow thats it because the quarterback is unbelievable key continues to fight and fight and fight and draws another foul and as he gets hit by Mitchell his third foul one thing Ohio state has not done at all though dick and its got to improve a little bit theyve only hit a couple of Threes yeah but he cant get a look I was watching The Wave away from the ball OT of guarding him he might allowing screens to get it open hes their real pure shooter for the perimeter they give Dukes of credit there they defend the three so well been two years in a row no they get two of Chris Holman fast can you really be excited but if two great repeated glasses to one now and then next year they get Chapman coming to Jefferson Countys Middleton upcoming parks and Royal so theyve been back to back some people say the best of the Ohio state has done for the twoyear period for many a year approach and a bump off the window but its a foul before the shot away from the basket 7 39 to go and still to come the second half of our Sonic Blockbuster North Carolina and Indiana and Assembly Hall cant wait for that one Jay and Dan have the call coming up I wish we had a big play to continue in about 30 minutes wait a minute one of us does have a big plane and its not me I wish they were expensive that was expensive but grants is ready to go to dinner because I came to the Washington Duke Hotel great restaurant yeah and nine people come walking let me tell you that bill was kind of big and I guess you got the best 100 man 1100 his nice taste in restaurants thats for sure Music here we go key with another touch could stay at 16 McNeil got it hes got touch you see the rotation he came off him really well Applause shoot the three 22 against San Diego State earlier no good team by the way coach Mitch has got a heck of a job he got put a nice day nice lean in yeah Applause he looks what a big time move they keep standing a dead eight cant get it down I think five has been theyve gotten no less than that just assuming to the land working hard with that right hand pursue with the big score he had sex about theyve really closed the door and sets them up and he is way better offensively than what weve seen here so suing now with 10 battling floaters here here he goes whats this this little float in the lane by Mr McNeil he knows this but he even though I can embarrass Mr roach are you kidding me hey when I think of Ohio State Obi I said four names jump at me I mean jump at me I think about Clark how long he was terrific just a great humanitarian as well Jerry Lucas are you serious how good he was and Ill tell you Jimmy Jackson he was in about a month vitality and why I love that Im gonna give a hamlet chuck oh yeah and there was a guy in that championship team but bob Knight was a buckeye yeah Michael Webb was special it was an offensive School well theyre looking for another star to emerge here tonight for Ohio State on the road to get him down to six again hes been just repeated one sequence after another down to six go back to eight get down to six they got to get some key stuff look at this future thanks in the corporate world educational World legal world I mean putting in the NFC cheese to come in here like 1500 of medals Im not acquainted with those numbers most people arent I was teaching the kids last night they turned me down in that 15 20 put them three times 500 500 500 look at the bench points thats such a key for Duke 22 of them off the pine tonight for Josh our team and off here for Roach Proctor outside shot clock down to six with the mount speed and a Dandy for young people off wasnt it great basket hes shown really some golden moments here give him Australia just really looked down a couple of big threes playing hard defensively I mean hes chasing hes chasing the bill all over the court because he didnt end up for the three people dont see the action away from the window watches the ball Im gonna watch a wave from the boar Ill see some of the stuff that goes on he will swing it heres Thornton off the iron second effort by likely his McNeil way downtown barely glancing off the iron he had finally got an open look he was short on each other Rush that shot three has just not been a factor for Ohio State they came in only hitting 34 percent and two for ten tonight three minutes sometimes hurt your team Big Time Roach one and done approaching a fiveminute Mark at Cameron so this one just went final in the ACC has taken a 63 lead as Miami wins and the ACC Big Ten challenge Applause its the last year to challenge is the last year picking up at ACC the exhibit of a pension with the SEC theres some interesting matchups there yeah hes played a very active role in this one lets do that one away tough catch Proctor and a threesecond violation nice catch oh look at this pass right here cuts the defense well wow nice little drop the time as Clark Kellogg would say right there for the little layup back to the Freshman who originally committed to next years class at Duke we classifies so he could play this year hes 18 theyre really high in heaven you can see why show some real good skills out here the dribble Applause wants to get inside again cant make the shot but draws another foul I told him its gonna cross the lane and a spin back the other way Applause rebounder he was a fearful offensive rebound the younger number three 7062 key back to the line weve spent considerable time he was only hitting 64 percent of the line down to play tonight you know people wondering might even flash with all these signs hit or Roberts foreign Applause Roberts University Applause they have been endlessly creative here Applause Music the Ohio State guy okay its the Ohio State its a great pride in that he shoots and another one coming for Zed key you know hes lost the sight in his right eye we were talking about Focus I have no side of my left Gallery together if I write his left but the bottom line he got poked in the eye when he was a training camp for the summer with the Miami Heat and hes never able to look for his last little little peripheral vision Key by the way a careerhigh 21 billipowsky playing foul trouble up to shorts he forced that shot wasnt available McNeil wont wait till launch he about picked off by suing suing working triplet take it away Stole It Away by Radisson soon did a phenomenal job at the Brady offensive rebound too many fakes with the ball set the screen and its roach with a good look absolutely random player he really is the Junior youre looking to play hes in the same dorm as my grandson good sentence and John Harris told us today thats the example on this Duke team that everybody looks to they look to Jeremy Rose shes a captain back door cut McNeil swing here for suing at a triple around and out comes out three back to the Buckeyes so it wasnt indeed fighting and battling but just cant come up with the good deal long distance and hits it and thats a three thats the guy that wrote the shooting I said earlier to telling us he made 155 if youre Huggins down to West Virginia coming into this year after three years well the Buckeyes just will not go away theyve not been able to get under five though the second half five years so heres a roach really wants to charge phillipovsky on the spin gets himself deep and made it oh thats so sweet but were serious come on man are you serious Philadelphian thats nasty man thats nasty a sevenfooter come on man stop going up and up I know NBA stats is a whole oh baby look at this really cuts the defense off ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by Continental coming up next Trace Jackson Davis is a Relentless offensive rebounder and Mike Woodson does a great job of getting the ball on the right block and he goes to work North Carolina and Indiana after we go final Obi Jeff thank you very much what a great night for college basketball early in the season still to come North Carolina and Indiana as soon as were done here with Dan Shulman and Jay Willis so many great games have already have taken place in the first three weeks of the season and it has been some great great competitive games yet because of the fact the football nominated have sort of ones that say it again Ill keep saying it I think decisions should start after Thanksgiving I think ratings of teams should not start until after the football ball season so you get a real read and the strength of teams Philadelphia by the way was 16 now for the Blue Devils said Davis disagrees with me put them in the Athletics nice drive yes it gets everybody excited I dont see how much excitement but I respect that I love Mr Davis give me a kiss championship game in the NCAA on the ESPN International good guy no and the rebound tip young got it back Ill tell you something youngest tenacious what a tenacious player you gotta appreciate that that was just pure effort yeah effort not a smart play too sorry authentication with termination of discipline hes going to be on the line so thats going to be Duke ball with a minute and 31 to go Blue Devils have it back young right there really young little young he lives back catch position look he wants to look at him keep it after him keep it active hes in his big body playing for Northwestern but now hes in that Duke uniform man you got to appreciate that people gotta respect efforts like that Proctor in close foul Applause 126 on the clock key with his fourth putting him on a free throw line now should have had that rebound Ohio States battles and battled the battle Chris oldmans got to really be a hope its got to be appreciative of that theres your balance huh yeah first time I heard how good he was as a coach Christmas from my former colleague down in the schools throughout Indiana he coached a butler took him three times hes there three years he took him to the HCA tournament just a good guy Joe Proctor with another one coming he makes 92 percent thats not the guy you want to put on free throw line it in your Ohio State come on hes done by now his stock put up tonight I think he and Lively have taken a step up again the Freshman Class 7769 that Benson coaches that go a while when Im back McNeil and on the line the turnover I mean look at that bench look at that they actively what 16 turnovers for the Buckeyes that one really hurt with a minute 19 to play Applause so Duke to take the basketball here on top 7769 trying to win their seventh Game of the Year Ohio States only lost once again no question 246 Purdue plus they did a great job to neutralize it and shut it off the prolific scoring ability of satsumar whos way way more talented coach taking his time shot clock now inside 10 trying to get five McNeil hell go down no whistle on the play he is slow to rise two days because were pretty interesting deals three short now back to him short again I think theyre rubbing up the bus stop man bus driver for the Buckeyes hes warming up that bust to get to the airport because wow this baby is over well Ohio State fighting from behind all night long just really never could get on top suing a pickup number five damn battle though I really respect that if its been unreal so he just found out with 12 points and he came in averaging 15 and coming off a 33point game they needed that kind of a game tonight what a sense of I have I dont have the stats in front of me here you see him he came in with a 16 point average yes yeah 15 and five and 39 and a half seconds to go and Duke looking to put this one into the win column and stay right where you are because good Carolina and Indiana coming your way that should be so much standing here with Danny Howies there as well I believe indeed she is and key moments ago and go grabbing at that shoulder uh oh he walked right off the floor had a terrific game 21 points well hes so important state because they dont have a lot of size hes an experienced player Adventure player he knows how to post up on the interior he seals people off really well Applause Buckeyes running out of time here dropped in for 12 points now for Roach you figure out a way to win this game but 36 seconds and down nine youre a genius theres a foul no basket put a whistle on the play stops the clock with 341 and roach with a foul to any coach at least unbelievable he told Michelangelos connection Bean Smith he was unbelievable at times later again Music Applause North Carolina State North Carolina Jimmy Bs having a great game this time and the last four minutes dont you leave dont you leave the expensive genius down here my phone rings in about six in the morning and Im getting ready here Applause I heard about the last four minutes all I heard about it was Dean Smith Dean Smith what about me the Duke students were chanting we want Michigan we want this kid oh God they they are so creative unbelievable with their mile now computer would have to be taken care of because there was really abusive years ago and there were a couple times it got a little bit out of here I could screw students but many years ago it really ratchet up there sets by the foul so Duke back to line itll be number five on him a lot of guys played in foul trouble in the second half here tonight 7870 the Blue Devils theyre back should certainly the difference here tonight right against as well first major win Obi for John Schneider at home so now you only needs coach got 1202 hes got my math he needs only what 1195 more wins in the kitchen coach my advice would be dont think about it John just dont think about it no ones ever going to catch coach gay no one ever ever I really believe that because of the kind of game we have its very tough with so much were gonna drive with so much evaluations and criticism and social media guys arent going to last that many years left in the years ago so I I I think that that record to me and Ive said is some people could see you know put us on me for it oh he loves coaching only one I dont ever change my opinion hes the greatest coach that ever ever coached on a sideline in college basketball I love John Wooden I dont let me come here this guy won 1200 games 1200 games John Shire the new man played it Duke and played very very well over 2 000 points and announced career the 09 ACC tournament Most Valuable Player got a chance to meet the president after winning it all with Coach K and then on the staff of the great Mike shazewski and learn from a master he did theres no question about it and he really soaked in all he could learn I thought it was a lot of fun covering Coach K last year his final year I thought you know he was lighthearted in a lot of ways not what he was coaching games but you know knowing it was his last time around I think he really enjoyed it a great deal hes got a great sense of humor I thought he let that shine throughout last season we had him a bunch of times both on ESPN and the ACC Network reach in foul here with 245 to go he had the one great gift that great coaches have never satisfied with what theyve done in the past its always about today to be better today if you apply that philosophy and Life to anybody listening out there young people being better today than you were yesterday and if you do know who wants to you look at the mirror say hey because I today Ben and I was yesterday in one of the things I wanted to achieve Nikki Lauren thats going to add up the incredible success likely with his fifth foul we all thought you got better as this game went along you were great at the start youre phenomenal buddy Im saying you were outstanding but even better by the time we get to the end of the story there we go critics up here better if we got to deal with all the critics out there that bang the typewriter diving up my own announces Im just here having some fun man trying to steal some money I want to steal some money no thats still anything 8072 and Duke adds to that putting the finishing touches on a victory and itll also be shires first win over top 25 opponent well gone first out there hes going to get a lot of wins trust me in that career young with a rebound he had a big hand in this one really played well all year yep the Lebowski on the other end they want him to dunk that baby at the end of these you know respect for the opponent so thatll do it theres your final score Duke holds off the Buckeyes 8172 they avenge last years upset defeat on the same night one year ago the other score it was going to be tough to beat him here especially coming in after the loss to Purdue you know theyre gonna have a chip on their shoulder freshman showed up in a big way for Chris and Dicky B Im Dave OBrien North Carolina Indiana OB
