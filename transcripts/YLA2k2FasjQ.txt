SS Paul zel and Tommy morsy on the whistle tonight Fon Reed and PJ Hall get us started the Tigers in Orange control it first its a twophase game tonight Eric as you said perimeter and the front court for really both schools and the matchups kind of within the starting five or the five on the floor at the time yeah when you look at Clemson theyre definitely going to look to go inside to Hall and sheflin and try to get that going on early on now its up to wait for for to be able to contain that and keep their bigs out of foul trouble as they go through the game and an offensive foul nope shot clock we got a shot clock malfunction as Hall controlled it 17 to shoot and the bottom line is the game clock has only 14 seconds elapsed the shot clock has 13 seconds elapsed and remember both started on the tip so weve already got a little mathematical issue of a second here in Winston Salem 14 seconds off the game clock 13 seconds off the shot CL so Tommy Marcy Paul Zella go over havent seen him go to the stopwatch yet thats when you know you got three L deal old school old school its a twophase game tonight Eric as you said so see the shot clock and there it is trailing the number right there yep so they will probably have to do a little work here you know West sometimes it just doesnt go how you plan you think you have everything figured out in the beginning and then yep so theyre going to go back and this is where the technology helps a little bit you can find out exactly where the clock sto and then measure how much came off while it was stopped Wes Im not the best with technology I I mean Im I guess Im a younger guy 36 but I like to think I like to write stuff down on the notepad still going through my notes and the iPhone its I dont know I guess Im old soul it is interesting because an early stop here kind of quales a couple things here one Wake Forest wanted to get a good start here in fact both schools talked about the start with us today yeah I mean Coach B and Coach fors talk about the first five minutes and how crucial that would be for both teams just getting off to a quick start getting that confidence going for both teams is is super important so while Tommy morsy and Paul zel talk it over Roger As now going to join Steve forbess team and lets see what we came up with here theyre going to put three on the shot clock what are we doing here theyre going to play from okay the game clocks at 1933 which means theres three to shoot and Wes in both shoot rounds these teams have been going over the out of out of bounds plays for both teams quite often so they know what each other want to do heres Jack Clark lost a handle on it itll be a turnover on the opening possession outlet for Miller look at Clark catch up hell knock it over the in line itll stay with weight Forest so the deacons of course 151 at home 8 one in ACC play Baseline for Miller and this is hildren and you see Fon Reed Andrew Carr and Hunter Salis who is probably destined for First Team all ACC first of next week 13 to shoot Miller looked at Reed out front heres Gerard against hild now Salis against Hunter pull up jumper from the right car the rebound against sheflin right back up strong and score and you know what w that thats something right there that its a positive for Wake Forest knowing that theyre competing against two of the best bigs in the country two of the best tandem bigs in the country in sheflin and Hall being able to get off a quick start down low you see car with the offensive board and put back and a two ball from out on the left left ties the ball game off the hand of Chase Hunter you see the Clemson lineup Jack Clark back in there for a second straight game he missed last Saturday at Notre Dame you see wake right now trying to get it down low and we talked about these match ups Hall and Reed and chefin and Carr Salis a three ball got it hter Sal is 67 three of the year hes 41 it started with Reed right there being patient waiting for the double team kicking it out and you saw the extra pass by Miller to Salis Salis knocking it down sheflin trying to get position with Reed inside as the Tigers move it around the perimeter tend to shoot for to or Hunter here and this is Hall with Carr on it hes comfortable catching out that far too DJ off the glass eighth best field goal shooter in the ACC averaging almost 18 against the lead is PJ Applause Hall Carr Reed Paul follows him tend to shoot for the dees here back to Solace with five to shoot theres a double team they dig around for it Halls got the turnover just a bad possession playing too slow they need to be able to pick up the pace a little bit on that side of the ball heres Reed or Hall rather as he works to Hunter PJ a three first one of the night side Rim Miss and hild and wait now will look to run here we talked about PJ you know shooting the threes an improved threepoint shooter but you know his bread and butter is down low thats his strength I dont know if coach branell wants him to shoot too much more of those threes double team kick out for Solace he will fire again and hit six for Solace hes the man he he hes the man for Wake Forest you know as Wake Forest goes I mean hes the leader he hes averaging almost 19 a game hes First Team all ACC NBA Prospect getting off to a quick start here decks have doubled a number on the Tigers theyve hit their last three from the floor including a pair of Threes from Solace heres Hall against Carr with nine to shoot right hand jump hook fell off the rim for Reed Miller drives the engine for the deacons this is the pace Miller has to be able to push it get up and down try to get early offense and a travel by Bing Miller will turn it over for Wake Forest well Steve Forbes his team Eric its a tale of where you play when wake is at home they are unbelievable statistically the road its a different story you know what and I dont have the explanation for you know this the drop off in the stats like that but I know being at home its a little bit more comfortable Wes and on the road obviously youre youre going against the way crowd but to be able to win games in the NCAA tournament in the conference tournament obviously you have to win on the road you have to win away Gerard and traffic took the contact scores his first bucket Joseph Gerard the third tonight in his 156th Collegiate game and you know I love Joe I may be biased cuz hes a cuse guy but or now a Clemson guy but a former C guy you know hes improved his game so much over the years he came in as just a shooter and and now you see him be able to put the ball in the deck playm and finish at The Rim Clark the rebound off the Miss from Miller here is Gerard three ball out front back rim high oh and it dropped down Joe used a lot of metal you cannot trail that type of a shooter up the dho you got to be able to try to stick on his hip and get over that see Joe take advantage of it one of the best Shooters in the country Tigers in front of point on Gerards three heres Miller the answer Kevin Miller better known as boopy is on the board I like bopy I like I I like that nick name we talked about it in the pregame West Miller and Salis have to have big games if wakes sport Wake Forest expects to win right here at home tonight and keep their NCAA tournament hopes alive Paul a hard dribble against Reed to the basket sheflin inside cleaning up and scoring first basket for Ian sheflin kind of what he does best there Eric doing what he does best at bowling ball averaging almost 10 and 10 in conference play I mean hes a candidate for the most improved player of the year No Doubt pretty fun ball game early huh absolutely Salis head of the circle thats a handful for Chase Hunter Salas rolls it in hes got eight of wakes 12 now here in the early stages and Wes I think for wake wake wants to play a more fastpaced game get up get early bucket get early transition early offense and I dont think Clemson really Minds playing in the half court grinding it out with the two bigs down low double screen Hunter will try a three missed badly hild the rebound six minutes in Wake Forest with the onepoint lead hildra spinning through hell lay it in cam hildra first points Junior from wording in West Sussex of England pushes the Deacon lead to three great p Bush we talked about him in shoot around hildr hes kind of the heart and soul this W for his team a gritty hes getting on the floor all energy and effort a guy that every team needs and a whistle and a foul off the ball and thatll get us to a timeout Hunter Salis has got eight of Wake Forest first 14 points hes dialed three already twice meanwhile Joe Gerards got a triple and he bought all of the rim just like dvo back to Winston in a Music moment early in often going three for four from the field two for two from the threepoint line I mean hes a first team all ACC AllAmerican type player and thats why the NBA is considering him a first round draft pick hunter Salis you know he comes in here from Omaha started his career obviously at Gonzaga he is third in the ACC in minutes played in conference games too ER its not like he didnt come off the floor average is better than 35 minutes a game you know what hes not a big guy either I mean its it takes a toll on somebody to be able to play that many minutes throughout the year and hes doing a heck of a job just going out there competing and averly doing it at a high level Marsh is come in to defend shefin and the tap followed by Chanty Wiggins Wiggins stuck a hand in traffic and tapped on the Miss 7 Minutes in we got a onepoint ball game just an interesting match up right here with Wiggins guard and Salis Im going right to Im going right to Salis right now he has to be aggressive and go get the ball Chanty wigin is to 611 heres Carr against Wiggins thats a tough match up five to shoot for Carr a double team Salis thought about it hell launch on sheflin and miss everything air ball by Salis would you like there defensively from Clemson they communicated pretty well they did a good job communicating but I think it was a bad shot by S he should have went earlier in the shot clock and when he saw that Miss matches Wing you got to be able to tack off the dribble and get into the paint once you get those paint touches youre able to be able to create for yourself and others Godfrey on the floor along with Wiggins Brad Brownell dipping into his bench Hunter back for RJ Godfrey Chase Hunter will launch from three and hild with the rebound for the deeps how about the stat they gave us on Chase Hunter before the game when Chase Hunter hits two or more threes Clemson is N9 and one hes 0 for two right now Frederickson on the floor young man from Oak in his rookie campaign for Steve Forbes daks heres Carr no hesitation missed everything Gerard the rebound of the air Applause ball reroute on the screen nice pass for sheflin Godfrey hunter or Wiggins rather not at all you got to you got to get more you got to get better spacing I like what Hunter did on the short row but then Wiggins went in Too Close created bad spacing up for three deacons are making you pay here early fourpoint lead on cam hildra second field goal equals their largest Advantage sheflin tries to answer and does and we seen him do it and shoot around he can hit it and if you know coach brell sees him hitting hes going to let him hit another one if he misses is probably going to tell him to sit down and get back and get back down low under the rim great shot hes 19 of 35 this year from three Eric you know what if the first one goes in you get to shoot a second one hild back to Carr great defense and theyll roll to the deck hell save it Frederickson Salis another three sure Hunter Salis now hes got 11 thats his third three of this first half Gerard to answer cannot got to look to push it here DS by four hildr love Mars had it taken out of the air shein the deflection Clemson the recovery this is where Wake Forest has to look for Salis Hunter thought he got fouled no whistle deacons the other way with the tiger turnover hildr skip for Frederickson step away Marsh battling inside lost it Godfrey it from it now were picking up a little bit love the pace both teams starting to pick up the pace just really getting into the flow of the game Josh Beetle Waits at the table for Clemson well have a timeout before Beetle sees the floor shefflin on the dribble heres Gerard Godfrey thought about it hell take car on the dribble got stripped of it off another Clemson turnover its four on the Tigers seven total in the ball game hildra standing three see I just dont like it West I think after Hunter Salis just hit three shots in a row you got to be able to find the best player on the team who has the hot hand you got to look for him your teammates have to be aware of that and he has to be able to tell them that Wiggins Gerard cutting through soft through jumper and they scramble inside and saved it to Frederickson Clemsons only made one field goal in the last four minutes they Trail by four heres HTH again double team coming somebody had to cut off that double over the top of shin Pam HTH is fun to watch Eric you know we when we were talking about in shoot around we talked about the great the heart the energy and effort but he is an improved offensive player going to the basket shooting the ball hes showing a little bit of everything right now daks by six Gerard a three rattles out for Salis hilds got lucky on that one sixpoint lead now hildr the launch missed everything shefflin the rebound wakes hits some threes four of them but they got three air balls and nine attempts too I I I dont I just I dont like how theyre going away from Salis after he just scored the first 11 points of the Game knocking down three threes another standing three from shefin slapped out by Godfrey Gerard from in the F in W forest and thatll be a foul on the Tigers thatll get us to a timeout Ian sheins first first on Clemson Hunter Salis continues the beat though hes got 11 including three threes and now cam hildr has stepped in hes got seven thats 18 of wakes 22 in winst who a year ago against Wake Forest in two ball games 21 A2 points 8 and 12 rebounds 52 from the floor and of course he averaged 18 and 7 a year ago against the league and here today PJs only got a basket to his credit so far on four attempts out of the timeout Miller Reed Zack Keller playing tonight and a turnover by Wake Forest Music here is Wiggins on Miller turnaround I mean thats not a shot you take against a guy whos 6 foot youre 611 against a six foot guy you back him down you wait for the double to come you look for the open guy or you finish at The Rim meanwhile heres Salis on beetle kicks it for Keller out of the corner Gerard the long rebound Zack Keller by the way just 7 of 23 now from three Eric off the Miss there Clemson started 7 to 13 they missed their last six Wiggins almost turned it over Frederickson got the turnover but landed on the Baseline so we still hold at 2216 7 MO two to go first half in Winston Forest against Clemson great to be with Eric dandorf West dur M Joel Coliseum kind of the game within the game is front court and back court Clemsons only got nine points out of their front court now PJ Hall spent a couple minutes on the bench w got 20 from the back court there yeah well we talked about in the beginning Ken wakes or Ken Clemsons guards contain wakes guards from getting penetration and paint touches and then the strength of Clemsons team is their front Court you know with Hall and sheflin and right now theyve been a nonfactor PJ Hall back on the floor has not scored more than 10 minutes he had an early field goal heres Wiggins he plays with tile Godfrey and Gerard and there goes Godfrey up strong around Keller for the basket r Jay Godfrey the sophomore from South guet High School north of Atlanta in Swani Georgia averages just under five in ACC play Sal has to look to be more aggressive in getting in the lane and creating opportunities for him and his teammates heres Miller digging in on beetle fallway bounces out Paul with a strong box out on Reed allowed gotri to keep it alive in the Clemson possession PJ three from the front and the tap follow Godfrey and the foul how about RJ Godfrey a couple of baskets here you come in you get opportunity you got to be able to take advantage of the opportunity that youre given thats how you go from four minutes to 7 minutes from 7 minutes to 10 minutes and I know PJ Hall has improved his threepoint shooting West but the strength of this team like we talked about is going down low to those two guys and then playing from inside out Eon Reeds second foul comes with 613 to play in the first half and Godfrey only 55 at the free throw line has five off of Brad brownells bench thats one thing we didnt talk about today was Bench scoring for Clemson and if you know PJ Hall and shefin are going to get the opportunities like they are early on they need guys like Gaffrey to be able to step up and make an impact Off the Bench tigers have got seven Off the Bench a three by Salis bounds away Gerard inside hes going to be fouled by Zack Keller I believe and it is on Keller the 610 sophomore from Highlands Ranch Colorado its his first its the third on the deacons Here Comes Jack Clark back Chase Hunter returns Clemson makes some substitutions here bopy Miller with Carr Salis hildr and Keller on the floor remember Reeds got the two now I dont know how much well see of Fon Reed before the half see wake bringing a little full court pressure right here trying to pick up the pace quick inbounds and look at Beetle Russ it into the front Court Josh got all the way to the Baseline stepped out of bounds and West thats what the pressure does right there it makes you play fast it makes you make quick decisions and I dont necessarily think coach brell you know wants Beetle making a majority of decisions for the Clemson offense five turnovers on the Tigers nine total in this first half onepoint lead for wake and the basketball Miller two side to side for Wake they have to be able to get in the gaps lost it on the drive here is Hunter live catch and dun from Clark Jack Clark hammers it home and Clemson takes the lead on a 70 run hello Jack Clark and those are the type of plays that you need especially on the road Salis digs in pull up jumper Good Hunter Salis has got 13 now in this first half on his fifth field goal for a guy like Hunter Salis a guy that could use his dribble drive to be able to get by put pressure on the defender and when you do that now they sag off and your jump shots open up Carr and Hall battling at the Block heres Hunter at the head of the circle PJ calling for it against Carr T to shoot double team kick for Clark three away got it five in a row for Jack Clark his 12th three of the year hes not necessarily known as a threepoint shooter West but this is division one college basketball if youre open shoot the basketball 13 of 43 on the years Clark two for two from three and there is a foul and its going to be on RJ godf see Hall passing out of the double team and you know I think Hall is an underrated passer you know sheflin and Hall are two of the best pass passing big men in the ACC in Hall showing you why right there Godfrey checks out sheflin comes back four and a half to go Tigers with a twopoint lead have to be aggressive on this matchup heres Salas hell take shein on the drive kicks for cars three weight back in front Andrew Carrs 33rd three of the year hes got five here in the first half thats one thing that car can do he can stretch that defense bring it out to the threepoint line and creates better spacing for that w offense Hunter tries to answer spins out one from the right under four to go terrific first half heres hildr for Carr more movement offensively too stagnant Miller and then throwing away to Clark bounces ahead heres Beetle back for Clark and a hammer with a right hand for Jack Clark Jack Clark came in the game and just made his presence felt on both ends automatically defensively offensively you see him getting two dunks Jack Clark is here and hes ready to play seven for Clark he had seven the other night against Syracuse at Little John Tigers Again by a point hildr the scoop tap follow Marsh good and the foul theyre going to score the basket Parker and pretty nice start for Jack Clark here today huh yeah you know we were talking about during break West its just good to to see him healthy really having an injury Riddle career you see when hes healthy he makes the impact the two dunks and hes a monster on the defensive side of the ball by the way Matthew Marsh fouled by Chase Hunter they scored the basket and then the free throw from Marsh just his third free throw conversion in five tries and waken up by two so a old school threepoint play if you will from Marsh I like this right here by wake I think their guards need to push up and put a little bit more pressure on those Clemson guards heres Gerard against hildr look for the quick look couldnt feed Hall great job by Carr denying that heres Joe wrap around back for Clark he slash got caught in the air how about a kick for Hall bounds away they scramble inside and hildr wraps it up and Clark will be whistled for the foul first on Jack Clark four now on the Tigers miss a heck of a ball game Eric I tell you what that last possession defensively for Wake Forest just active in it theyre in it theyre engaged theyre communicating I mean you expect that being at home theyre playing for their NCA tournament lives right now Wes thats a fact five of their last seven have been losses heres Carr with Clark defending back for Salis T to Applause shoot against shefin partially bothered nice defensive clarent from me and she Applause still a twopoint weight lead theres Chef inside and Hell ball going to send it to Wake Forest on possession hildr I think is the guy that had his hand on top of the ball here Eric I I tell you what yeah as you see right here I mean we talked about hildr hes a guy whos just going to bring it on that end all the time doing a great job tying up sheon right there but but Clemson offensively we talked about their bread and butter Wes being able to get down low to their two bigs and right now for most of this first half weve just been seeing these guys taking perimeter jump shots they got to get back to feeding those guys down low and they got to do a better job of getting position so their guards will have the opportunity to get it to them Mar inside for the dunk big fella oh my goodness I dont know if we were going to hear about Marshall out today but hes came in and had a couple big time dunks wait nine minutes the other night against George attack hes got five in this first half averag is only a point and a half an ACC play Clemson looking for a bucket Hall of three back rim Miss Salis the rebound fourpoint lead PJs missed his last six shots after hitting his first from the floor this afternoon said brell hes going to let him shoot him but I think right now its time to go tell him to get back on that Block 17 to shoot ball got knocked out of bounds its going to stay with wake you see Mars right here good job setting the screen short roll no help bang it on his head PJ Hall giving him a taste of his own medicine did he hesitate to read Beetle you know what he caught it right there on the short roll he did a good job of just being able to hesitate and then beok went away finish it at The Rim Junior at 71 from Cornwall in Southwest England five off of forbess pinch a couple guy from England out here huh yep heres Frederickson now hell gun for three rebounds sheff you got to look for PJ hall right here Clemsons gone two and A2 minutes without a Applause point minute to go and a half Clemson has to get into a pick and roll situation with Haller sheff get on that short roll at least let him catch it on the elbow great right there Hall missed it now seven misses in a row for PJ Hall one for eight in this first half thats a bad pass right there DS turn it over 38 seconds left got about a 101 second differential shot clock to game clock Gerard pull up three it bounds away Marsh the rebound tigers are ice cold going down the stretch here Salis Euro to the basket what a half for Salis 15 now in the first half seven nothing run gives wake a sixpoint lead and they use it or lose it 30 for Brad Brown L and Winston Salem back in 30 seconds what are Music you Joel Barry and Luke Hancock there already winning today Virginia Tech Virginia Tech already a winner today Florida State a winner and the auto owners insurance halftime report is next from Cameron final possession of the half belongs to the Tigers start off going to the pick and rolling into dho Gerard working on hildr bounces for Hunter shot fake at the horn for three bounds away and the deacons are going to carry a sixpoint lead to the locker room Eric terrific half for so the Tigers maybe in some ways fortunate to only be down six oh absolutely I think Clemson was just coasting a little bit in that first half now its time to pick it up in that second half and really show you know these guys what type of team they are Chase Hunter two points PJ Hall two points Joe Gerard five thats nine and a turnover by Clemson and a foul coming through the back court will be on Chase Hunter or shefin beg your pardon four itll be his second it is the first on the Tigers yeah not the start that Clemson wanted I I just think PJ right now if Im Im switching shefflin and Im putting shefflin up high at that top of the key and then putting PJ at that high low position at the low position heres Reed picked up on his dribble remember he got saddled in the first half with fouls Eon Reed only played eight minutes Miller on the drive forced it up they rattle around inside were going to have a foul on the deck Roger airs the whistle he works with Paul zel and Tommy morsy tonight Wes you talked about Reed you know not playing majority of the first half even though Miller Missed the shot right there Reed created that shot just by getting that seal right there and let Miller get into that open layup has to be able to finish that heres Miller against Hunter right back for boy off the Reed screen ski for hild Bo nice crisp ball Movement by the deacons and Reed missed the three still a sixpoint game were almost a minute in half two at Winston Gerard Hunter Clark whoa almost air m one to Gerard 12 to shoot Joe from the logo front rim Miss Tigers now three of 17 from three and theyre all tough shots Wes they havent seen a clean easy look Reed going to work on Hall and thatll be an offensive foul on E Reed thats his third crowd wont like it third on Reed first on the daks in the half Hall and Reed pretty good collisions here yeah you see the two big guys battling DJ Hall trying to work on Andrew carrr at the offensive end and then he and Reed banging away another guy ticketed for the first team all ACC is PJ Hall voting closes tomorrow afternoon and thats going to be on Marsh whos come back in the game well Clemson looked like they were trying to dial something inside first on Marsh and you cant put all the blame on the guards right now The Bigs got to do a better job of getting position ceiling so the guards have the opportunity to get that pass in there there it is right there shefflin against Marsh cant finish car the rebound on the back side they got the look that they want it just have to finish almost two minutes gone second half Solis fights through Rob and the slam from Mar what a look from Salas getting in splitting the Defenders getting the paint touch liveing it up to March and talked about Marsh getting his opportunity hes taking advantage of it Bo sure is Matthew Marsh has got seven now in the ball game inside heres Hall the catch up strong and hell draw the foul Marsh has equal his season high he at seven against pit see Salis right here splitting the D getting into the teeth of the paint great live great look for marsh and you know what youre not going to play a lot during the season he knows that he gets in hes getting the opportunity and hes playing his butt off PJ Hall will get a couple of free throws 79 at the line this year tremson is the number two free throw shooting team in ACC play at 809 Hall with this third Point Eric the number one free throw shooting team in ACC play is Wake Forest Wake Forest yeah you dont want to follow these two teams and I think for PJ hall right here its good just to see the ball go through the basket get to the free throw line see a couple go through youll get your confidence back going one of two at the line for Hall Tigers still Trail seven here goes Miller blur to the other end hi Jinx and Wes sorry on that last free throw thats all right youll get the blame all tapped away a pass from Marsh 15 to shoot for the deacons now Salis CLK with him and theres a turnover Gerard with the loose ball Gerard on the drive heres Hunter now Clark who had a flurry in the first half now back to Hall up strong cant go and last Touch by Marsh itll stay with Clemson and 15 to shoot yeah and and he even right there good job on the roll catch it and and you know what for me he can even take one dribble right there or just hold it and see whats going on so he can get a better look better opportunity at The Rim that was a tough shot heres Hunter all the way in traffic takes the contact hell get the foul in the basket you saw on the other end with Reed having a good seal for bopy Miller PJ Hall doing the same thing for Chase Hunter sealing it see right here sealing card great finish by Hunter and thats what he does thats what he excels at getting to the bucket finishing at The Rim left hand finish absorbing the contact thats a tough finish looking for the oldfashioned threepoint Play Some Nights its a blue collar game right this feels like one of those nights conter knocks down the free throw and Wes I tell you when I used to play I love those blue collar games I was ready to dive on the floor I bet you did get in somebodys face talk a little bit of trash yeah youre not that far from Detroit you like blue Colin fourpoint game after the threepoint trip for Chase Hunter hes got five in the ball game Miller on the catcher car with shefin defending and cant by the field goal but by Chefs foul which is his third its the third on Clemson in this second half and the Tigers have got their first bit of foul trouble and RJ godre is going to come in for Ian sheflin as Andrew Carr goes to the line Carr is 79 hes the fifth best free throw shooter in the OR 15th best free throw shooter in the ACC all five his points in the first half and the first one good dont forget Tuesday will be at Capital One arena in our nations capital for the ACC tournament presented by tro price Dave OBrien Jay bis open our coverage at 2 pm eastern time the nothing but net crew will be there Cory Alexander and I there for games two and three on Tuesday at Capital One Arena first time the league has been back there since 2015 when Joel Barry was the MVP of the tournament Hunter on the drive hell draw the foul and thats what Chase Hunter needs to do hes 0 for four from threepoint line in the first half his bread and butter is getting into that paint creating contact with that strong body finishing at The Rim getting to the free throw line thats what he really excels at first on Miller fifth on Wake Forest puts Hunter back to the strike here is hutter we have not seen Chase his younger brother Dylan in this ball game today Chase red shirt Senor from Atlanta a year ago averaged 13 points against the conference shot 27 from three his threepoint number a little better this year by about 7 he hits both free throws and here he comes and heres Dylan Hunter look at me right in the script spoken into exist they well theyre from your town ATL thats your town they are Westlake guys okay yeah their mom a terrific player at Georgia in womens basketball their late father Bryce Hunter terrific wide receiver in the National Football League starred for the Bulldogs as well how cool would that be to play college basketball with your brother Y and theres a foul off the ball thats on RJ godre his second fourth on climpson Godfrey by the way his dad Randall Godfrey terrific linebacker georgo was l player a pro bowler with the Dallas Cowboys he Godfrey looks like he could play on the Clemson football team right now dont dont do that D never know man he was already talking about shefin being a tight end heres Salis in traffic and missed the shot rebound Clark pulls it away Dylan Hunter handles the rock hell go to the basket hard draw the contact miss the shot Carr on an outlet heres Salis with Godfrey chasing and RJ will commit the foul itll be the third on Godfrey five on Clemson and were going to get free throws when we come back Wake Forest who led by six at the break protecting a fourpoint lead early second half tough night for PJ Hall averaging nearly 19 hes got three tonight hes one of nine from the floor but hes at the top awake scouting report as he would be just about every night right yeah I mean you see right here he did a good job contesting Hunter Sal shot does a good job running the floor Wake Forest doing a good job getting back but look at Andrew Carr right here just getting his body into to him and then getting off and contesting the shot at The Rim all while getting the outlet pass to Hunter house I mean wake has done a great job of just denying PJ Hall the ball I mean you you got to be able to get that position but overall wake for has done a great job of denying PJ Hall the basketball salus will be at the line hes scoreless here in the second half hes an 80 free throw shooter and this is his first trip tonight and free throw bounds away so you said hey get PJ Hall down on the Block get him some touches there the way wakes defending him thats a tougher ass for Clemson United yeah but but now you going to the Cross screens you going to the flash into to the high post working because if you cant get it on the Block right in there Im flashing to the elbow and now Im working off the elbow you want to try to get closer in than just working outside from the threepoint line now Miller defending hunter Paul has to pitch ahead fivepoint lead now for w cars deacons trying for their 19th win they would finish the ACC campaign 11 and n Clemson a win they would get one of the double buys heres Hall working on Keller with the left hand and one and and you know Im surprised right there that they just left him with Keller you thought they would have brought that double in but PJ Hall taking advantage seeing it see Joe coming off the double stagger right there and hes comfortable catching it that far out using that big body getting in and one you cant leave him by yourself with you cant leave Keller by yourself with Hall free throw good look at Marsh and Reed sitting there on forbes bench this ones on Keller go ahead Zack fight him on right you know what thats I mean obviously thats not what coach Forbes thought was going to happen hed have to play Zack Keller a lot of minutes Marsh has responded though appropriately hes tied his season n tonight with seven theres a foul on Wiggins Applause West we talked about guys even for Clemson you talk about Godfrey coming in taking advantage of opportunity these guys are high Lev basketball players as well obviously theyre not getting as much minutes as the starters but when they come in they want to be able to play well and make an impact six fouls on Clemson next one sends both schools into the one and one so he got away with a carry I believe youre right heres Miller tend to shoot floater in the lane the rebound quick outl for Gerard hes got Hunter but Waits on Hall heres Clark firing three ball for Jack Clark hes got 10 thats his second three of the night Jack Clark Im not going to say anything about you shooting threepointers anymore two for two tonight yep 13 of 43 on the year but hes buried two from behind the line sometimes its just a confidence thing Tigers still with are lead by one on the Clark three you got to go ahead and take that drive M they need more from Miller in this half heres bopy and did he throw it away almost two to shoot Salis tees it up at the horn and out of bounds to the Tigers 60 run by Clemson and heres Fon Reed back to replace Zack Keller now Reeds on the floor with the three fouls so if youre Clemson here are you trying to go get Fon Reeds for him Im going right at Reed right away and you know whats changed for Clemson in the second half just the ball pressure on on Wake Forest guards theyre doing a good job of rushing them in the shots making them take tough Applause shots hbert defends Gerard heres Hall with car defending PJ up strong right hand and I dont know how oh hes letting them know okay PJ Hall the basket time out Steve Forbes 80 run by the Tigers to take a threepoint lead PJ Hall might have been a slow scoring first not the case here in half two and PJ Hall gets look at the footwork right there and then look talk to him a little bit after the play you got to have that Competitive Edge if you want to play this game of basketball and PJ Hall is bringing it Ws got five PJ Halls got six here in the second half hildr off a read screen floater for Big E Reed and the dump wow with Chase Hunter contesting Captain Reed sets it down his first basket of the night is a highlight you see right here good job with the rub just go up and get it big fella Chase Hunter I dont know why you are contesting that right there just let it go thats a sevenfooter right there youre not blocking the shot Reed to the line 87 on the year just his 46th free throw attempt of the Season hes got three and were tied at 4 42 Wes if Im Clemson Im going right back to that guy number 24 right there Wiggins three at the front off the Applause glass go ahead D tell I was speechless for a second but it I mean the bank is up we were watching him shoot around and its funny because he can shoot the ball he just has an awkward form but it goes in and hey if youre knocking it down go ahead shoot it big fella way you no matter how you describe it its still three points Clon in front Salis caught in the double team Carr with a one hand save boy nice catch at two in p with two to shoot over Wiggins air ball and it will belong to the Tigers yeah Clemson is just doing a good job of getting them out of their stuff yeah you you know what sometimes the game of basketball is a game of luck and Im not saying it was lucky cuz I know he can shoot the ball but he didnt mean to bank that in Wes no s minutes in travel heres Hall double team coming skip for Hunter Clark Gerards been quiet not now theres the scoop in the score good finish by Joe Gerard Chase Hunter needs to make a better pass to Clark on that if he had if he just made a solid pass to him he has a wide open three largest lead of the night for Clemson at five wake just two of eight from the floor here in the second half Clemson is 6 for 10 from six down to five up in 7 and 12 minutes of action for the Tigers Carr against Wiggins shot clock at three Fall Away drops in for Andrew Carr thats a tough shot by car and I think thats next for Andrew Carr physically developing a little bit more maybe gaining 5 to 10 pounds just so he can be able to take those beaten down low and be able to play through the contact hes got nine wake to within three again heres Hunter hell flash foul on jumper no good and a foul will be called and I believe it is on its going to be on Hunter Salis Cameron hildr is shaken up we got free throws when we come back Sals first foul its Simpson 4744 as we bring you back to Joel Coliseum with Eric dandorf West Durham so here are the stakes tonight Clemson wins they get a double by meanwhile Wake Forest at 530 this afternoon Joe lonardi had wake off the bubble and then about an hour and a half later hes move weight to next for out Eric precincts reporting Electoral College in action tonight are they playing somebody that affects Wake Forest lonardi very busy Music like the first Tuesday in November for lonardi tonight heres two shots for Chase Hunter all right thats hes now got four the foul by the way on Salis Steve Forbes a little chapped to say the least going to the timeout but it was a good call it was a good call it was a foul hit him right on the forarm yep so heres Hunter second free throw good lead is five for the Tigers 8 minutes gone in this second half and this this right here where Salis needs to insert himself back in the game you see Clemson taking advantage going on their own little run Salis has to be aggressive and be more assertive Carr working against Wiggins skip for hildr hell launch and were going to get a foul on PJ Hall against Fon Reed so Reeds going to get a couple of free throws on the second against the senior from spart andberg South Carolina and the eighth on on the Tigers and Fon Reed III who in some ways personifies as todays college basketball player started his career at LSU then he went to Gonzaga and now hes at Wake Forest Eric and you know earlier in the season when you know he was out I mean you could tell the difference with this wake team now bringing him back I mean its a totally different Wake Forest team with him being in the middle just being a presence you know an offensive threat ruled eligible on December 6th when court of appeals deemed that the twotime transfers were immediately eligible and as you mentioned he has made a heck of a difference 4946 both teams in the bonus with 112 to go 168 meeting all time between these two and a travel on Wiggins as he was trying to set up guard and you know what Ro I thought Rog was going to call the first one but he got the second one it might have been a makeup for for the first call just a second turnover for uh Clemson in the second half seven in the ball game Frederickson on the lob for Reed oh what a save and a skip second pass for Carr fallway roll in Andrew Carr with 6 and the half 11 in the ball game Ian Salis doing the work for weight DS to within one and the crowd at the Joel to their feet this what we came to see right here with the crowd getting into it PA takes car to the basket layup good and the foul PJ Hall answers the weight call you see Andrew Carr hitting his second midrange jump shot in that paint doing a good job creating the contact and then PJ Hall this is my second half PJ Hall as he looks over at the Clemson bench after getting the and one PJ Hall look at he is a monster those shoulders free Thro good so Halls got another free throw tigers are six for their last six nine and the half for hall theres a foul on Clark thatll be his second out on the perimeter thats nine now on the Tigers were going to be here while shooting free throws tonight you see the Clemson second half the Tigers seven of 11 from the floor wake just four of 11 but hunter Salas has but a single point hes got 16 on the night for fours and this where it starts right here for S just being able to get to the free thr get it back going through the rim see it go through and I think for Sal hes hes not the biggest vocal guy out there but but I think for him when his teams arent scoring and theyre theyre going in droughts you have to be more vocal with your teammates and getting the ball and being aggressive in getting the ball getting to the basket and being able to make plays for your teammates especially if you go two three four possessions with not getting a score Carr out Keller in Salis it of both were going to see Fon Reed and Zack Keller here together now twopoint lead for cl Dive Right to the basket Gerard off a hall screen and PJ Hall is going to be called for the foul here offensive foul hildr itll be the third on Hall all here in the second half thats 10 I mean I dont know Wes what do you think he moved into it a little bit but thats a no call for me 1022 to go third on Hall who sometimes maybe not as discipline as you need him to be a well you need with fouls in relationship to the fouls yeah well you need him on the floor if youre Clemson so you got to be able to stay away from those Ticky tack fils so he plays with three Reed on the floor with three for Wake far see Clemson go into a little Zone sheins been quiet hes over on the bench theres a three from Frederickson to put weight back in front and proud the best threepoint shooter besides Salis on the team and right when Clemson goes to Zone they take advantage of it 93 run Parker Frederickson and our 12th lead change of the night we step aside in Winston sa onepoint lead for Wake Forest 951 to play deacons have been pretty crisp at times tonight offensively yeah you see right here Clemson goes to the Zone with fron coming in the game I dont know if thats the best idea a good ball movement find fron on the wing and he knocks it down and thats one guy that you have to locate if youre Clemson one of the best Shooters on the floor so Keller went off the floor Carr came back in Frederickson knocks down the three his first points of the ball game on his 49th three of the year and now all of a sudden weight back in front hall heres Clark see Joe oh and we get Joe Gerard is cramped up after Clark turns it over and Gerards going to come out of the ball Applause game and thatll bring Beetle back on the floor you hope thats all it is too its just a cramp and he didnt Music yep so Gerard will be tended to at the Clemson bench meanwhile after the turnover by the Tigers heres Salis and W forus a chance to extend the onepoint lead Reed lost it shoves it out Frederickson back for Reed a three short how about Fon Reed all eight of his points in the second half thats his seventh three of the Year Eric and I tell you what he doesnt shoot a lot of them but hes capable we talked about it earlier these guys are division one basketball players and theyre capable of knocking down these shots 123 run by wake its eight nothing in the last 77 seconds Hunter thought about it tend to shoot Chase trying to deliver to Hall does PJ with a right hand scores just keep going to your bread and butter Hunter I know you you can hit it youre capable but get into that lane draw the defense find your big whos been dominating the whole second half PJ Hall doing what he does best 11 in the second half for Hall whos got 13 in the ball game Frederickson meanwhile Hall goes down re will catch and score and PJ Hall landed squarely on his back and is still down Reed by the way gets the dunk five in a row for Wake Forest off the hand of Fon Reed W I know PJ is a big strong guy but you see right here see yeah it didnt look like much right there I mean that just goes to show you how big and strong Reed is down there those are two big guys just going at it just competing hard when two guys Collide like that they usually got helmet and pads on yeah two mat trucks right there yep fourpoint lead for w Hunter for three oh Chase Hunter with a triple he told me to be quiet yeah Deo quiet down there I can shoot it all right I hear you 12 in the ball game 10 and a half for Hunter so he and Hall who were very quiet in the first 20 minutes have responded for brown Ls team whos to within one now Miller trying to find a crease right hand shot good for boy Miller second field goal and boy needs to get himself engaged more in this game a great job of keeping him on his hip being able to make the read being patient and getting into his Applause float 6057 Beetle hesitate Runner good Josh Beetle pulls Clemson to within one nine straight field goals by the Tigers guys are showing up coming off the bench making an impact three ball good car I like it a little bit of back and forth right here thats what we came to watch W under seven to go PA out front heres Hunter back for PJ Hall a three short Salis The Rebound with 6 and A2 to Applause go you got to look at it great great Cai car on the score you see the two we talked about sheflin and Hall playing together look at Reed and Carr great feed great cut great find sixpoint game time out out Clemson wakes hit seven of their last seven from the floor Clemsons hit nine of their last 10 some kind of ball game on the final night of play boy Andrew Carr terrific night here in Winston here in Winston for basketball too Hall and the Tigers down six see Gerard back in the game just a quick little heres PJ double team coming got knocked off balance theyre going to call a travel I dont know about that one so a turnover by the Tigers will be their 10th Brad Brownell not happy he good job catching it I mean its a foul thats a foul right there Captain Reed stayed off held off his fourth under six to go Carr sheflin back on the floor too now remember he plays with three Carr in a double team with shefflin and Gerard they skip it quickly for hildr hildr into traffic Fall Away got it nine for hildr on his fourth field goal I mean how about the footwork right there being able to get in the paint reverse pivot Fade Away jump shot over a 610 Hall tough shot by hgri 231 run by wake theyve made their last eight shots Gerard sheflin quick entry for Hall and theres Carl on the foul thatll be his third nine on Wake Forest one and one for PJ Hall great job attacking the middle pull back get back in the paint reverse pivot tough shot by hildas hes bringing it on both ends of the floor tonight PJ Hall three for four at the free throw line all here in the second half to the line now this is a one inone opportunity fourth tiger in history front end good 1600 or more points 600 or more rebounds 100 or more blocks he joins Dale Davis Elden Campbell and Trevor Booker well those are some thats some good company right there yep all NBA guys yeah the Tower of Doom by the way Bale Davis and Elden Campbell Hall hit them both and I think Hall you could add him to a future NBA NBA guy as well six point lead for Wake just ahead of five to go Reed kick out car bopy Miller three sure hello boopy great short roll great job to control and kick it out to boopy Miller was knocking it down one of the craftiest guards in the ACC deacons on fire Miller adds to The Fray were going to get a foul called on Wake Forest whos hit its last nine shots after the Miller triple but Wes I think we knew this is how wake had to come out and play yep Hall launches and hits PJ hall now is having a heck of a second half hes got 15 in the half and 17 in the ball game one thing I like about him is he is not going to shy away from a shot 18 and a half Im sorry 18 in the game 16 and a half Eric excuse me and youre right hes not shying away at all he deflects the entry pass and forces the turnover sixpoint game four and A2 to go he has to be careful though picking up that fourth foul sheflin heres Hall working on Reed in traffic too strong shefin cant finish from the other side Hall and Reed both go to the deck hild the other end the easy bucket for the deacons 11 for Cam hildr man I tell you what you told it to me today West that shooter you love this guy hildr I mean hes a guy that every team could use just with his energy and effort and hes just an improved offensive player for weight 15 to shoot heres Gerard three and got it what a shot Gerards got double figures should have been a fourpoint play 390th threepointer of Joe Gerards career cuts it to five 7267 deacons burning a little shot clock here Carr with 11 to shoot entry for Reed against Hall you got to go at him return score and you know Hall has to be careful right there with the Flop hes going to pick up his fourth he keeps on doing that 15 in the half for Fon Reed wakes hit 11 in a row Gerard to the basket hell draw the foul and shoot two Music and little bit of post whistle Skirmish but no place for the week inside Eric yeah you see right here Reed go out his chest H the bucket really hear me saying anything you see that Wake Forest has hit their last 11 shots after starting the second half three for their first 10 Gerard at the line for the Tigers first trip tonight Joe is the best free throw shooter in the ACC yeah you see you know W theyre just getting good shots but it starts with that inside out balance I think Fon Reed did a great job of being a presence down low you see Clemson came with the double a few times he kicked it out for threes and then Carr cut to the basket getting good looks its just that wake is doing a good job with the ball movement and getting good looks little backourt pressure offered by Clemson double team on Salis Clark was there Tigers going to go Zone here with the foul trouble now remember that she off the floor Wiggins has replaced him they talked about it that shoot round they dont play a lot of Zone but in certain situations foul trouble and just certain times in the game they will go to it less than 5 of their possessions this year have been Zone Miller inside Reed threw it away Gerard shot clock violation last touch itll be a violation Gerard touched it horn went off before the ball went out of bounds thats why it belongs to Clemson watch the clock run out shot clock goes off before it goes out of bounds Gerard a three rebounded inside Reed whos playing on a mission tonight what a tough board by Reed right there two hands go up and get it big fella Solace thought about the three with two3 to play fivepoint lead for Wake Forest they have to try to get in that High post area operate out of there the short Corners in the zone Salis against the Zone attacks over Hall scores and thats what you got to do you got to be able to get in those gaps right there get in the pain and then you suck that zone in you either got the float off two feet or you got that kick to the corner for the three 10 game of 20 or more in conference play for Hunter Salis sevenpoint game Gerard on the drive blocked by Reed but a foul before the Applause rejection the foul is on hriff the junior guard his first couple of free throws coming for the tigers with 145 to play and itll be Joseph Gerard the third from Glenn Falls New York thats one thing about Joe we talked about earlier I mean he came in as a shooter and hes still a unbelievable shooter but hes improved his game putting it on the deck a little bit being able to get into the paint create contact and get to the free throw Applause line Second for Gerard is also good nine in the half 14 in the game 96 from the free throw line one of the best all time fivepoint lead for Wake double team Clark forces the turnover saves it for Hunter Chase to the basket re slapped it off the glass theyre going to award the go tend they want to look at it so Roger SS and Tommy morisy no oh it did not get to the glass thats a block that is a block by Fon Reed I think a block now he slaps the glass that doesnt make a difference though if you its a block yep thats a block boy Reed has played great tonight and I I just say in the beginning and it was a block but they shouldnt even have got to this point you see Hilder is trying to you know break the Trap break through the double team that passed the ball Applause ahead so he blocks it off the glass Fon Reed from Richmond 7 foot junor transfer did not score in the first half only played eight minutes because of some early foul trouble here in the second half hes got 12 points and three rebounds one of the and Tommy Marcy and Roger SS giving it the once over and this may now have gone to a timing issue as well Eric Wes I think in the beginning we talked about the Clemson of t or uh of the tandem of Clemson in their two bigs down low how about this Wake Forest tandem right now really outplaying well how about the tandm of Clemson Marsh Reed and Carr have all shown up tonight for Steve fors all shown up and to be able to win games going forward not just tonight but in the tournament you need everybody on that team to be ready to play and contribute and and thats what w for is doing so they continue to look here and if theres a reset of the game in any respect the alternating possession goes to Clemson or goes to Wake Forest rather but well see what Paul zel and Roger As Come Away with here there again the whistle was stopped after the block by Reed he blocked the ball before it got to the glass his hand then hit the glass which might seem as incidental contact if he got to the ball before Tommy morrisy to tell us here what weve got is nool he blocked it before he got through the glass got it thank you Tommy so as you suspected he blocked it before it hit the glass so therefore they go back to alternating possession they put 133 on the clock thats a nice piece of officiating after stopping the game with all the technology Leo get it right right and they did wake Force just needs to get a good look right here Zone with eight to shoot 70 seconds to play in Winston Miller lobing for Reed with Wiggins hell fire and the rebound the first of the night for PJ Hall heres Gerard right corner Clark for three nope rebound from Miller Clemson will have to foul here I think see if they can extend the game Millers a good free throw shooter 83 hes seventh best in the ACC and now Steve fors takes a timeout with 481 to go and 21 to shoot here yeah smart smart by coach fors I think just to be able to get his guys set want to get a good play get a good shot out of this timeout lets get to our Crush Star Stories for guys who are crushing it tonight brought to you by Crush well two guys that I think will be on the fiveman all ACC first team Eric Hunter Salis for Wake Forest started off with 15 in the first half PJ Hall has 16 in the second half for Clemson well yeah its been PJ Hall Halls half this half obviously in the first half you got to give credit to wake for so they did a great job of defending them and denying the ball and then you see Hunter Salis 207 for 13 but also seven rebounds four assists so hes doing a little bit of everything out there yep we said Hall first rebound a moment ago hes been at the top of the in fact Steve Forbes outlined today in their workout he didnt care who got the rebound long as 24 didnt right and you see theyre doing a heck of a job of just putting bodies on him hes been on the floor multiple times today and like you said coach BBs game plan is is working yep and the deacons who were trying to rekindle some postseason hopes now after losing five their last seven and three straight theyve got a fivepoint lead with 481 to go and you see our game reset possession belongs to to Clemson but its a fivepoint game now if youre Wake Forest do you expect Clemson to try and foul here or they play this sequence out because youll have about 27 seconds left if they take it all the way down to the end of the clock yeah I think right now theyre going to play it out I think theyre going to make wait for us shoot a tough shot and hopefully be able to get a rebound and score on the other end and then then foul if they have to foul yeah yeah Reed Miller Salis Carr and hildr for Wake Forest Wiggins Clark Chase Hunter Joseph Gerard the third and PJ hall for the Clemson Tigers hrth into the back court Salis with 20 to shoot give it to your best player and let him make a play Applause yep hes the games leading scorer with 20 heres Miller with six to shoot l for Carr out of a double team and foul I think that may be is that Applause Hall thats PJ Hall thats his fifth his fourth its his fourth yeah you see right here Wiggins was just stuck on Reed and he missed car in that middle and thats what opened up that shot first for Carr is good two possession game this will big free throw here Eric but turned into a three trip contest and these two teams obviously being the best free throw shooting teams in ACC car lift it on the rim its two possessions with a half minute to go I did it again heres Hunter Tigers cant wait Chase trying to reroute out of the right corner now Hall with 19 to shoot Hunter looking for an angle step back three good time out Brad Brown now on Chase Hunter three and its a threepoint game with 127 left and Fon Reed is down below the tiger basket you see right here I thought they were taking way too much time and Hunter did a good job of knocking it down but its only 127 seconds theyre going to have to foul right away you go for the steel West and then if you dont get it you foul okay but as weve noted before these are two really good free throw SHO teams wake is 10 of 12 tonight Clemson is 15 of 16 boy I know its been a struggle Eric the last seven games particularly the last three straight for Wake Forest they got all the look of a tournament team dont they I I tell you what they have the balance the inside the out they have the guard play which we all know in the NCAA tournament it comes down to the guard play sure we talked to D Nick the assistant coach for Wake Forest earlier in shoot around he said it was just one of those funks that they got in into and tonight theyre getting themselves out of it tell you this if theyre coming out of it they could be a handful in Washington now theyre going to have to play Wednesday before the quarterfinals theyre theyre locked in to either the five seed or the or the nine seed I think its somewhere in that neighborhood they could be as high as five or as low as nine but the reality of it is wakes going to be a handful in Washington if they play like this if Im any team in the ACC I dont want to play Wake Forest right now just with their guard play and their balance inside theyre going to be a tough out youre on the committee how many wins they need in DC two they win tonight Id say they need two in DC put them at 21 and we know how volatile the landscape is around Music them were going to send you right to Charlottesville when were done Mike Monaco Randolph chers standing by for Virginia and Georgia Tech who won here the other night inbounds to Salis and now they got a foul and theres Hunter and L reach Chase Hunters third Hunter Salis will go to the line he is three for four tonight thats the second time I saw Notre Dame wake they they did the same thing its the old I guess the Flea Flicker in basketball where you go in and do the the guy gets it out of bounds right I like the creativity by coach Forbes Steve Forbes will clear of the lane you see Brad Brownell out of timeouts with 102 left in a threepoint Music game first one from Salas is good terrific terrific player for Steve fors by the way a historical player in many respects Hunter Salis was the first fivestar basketball recruit from the state of Nebraska yeah I dont know I dont hear a lot of guys coming out of Nebraska Im just saying yeah we hit it on the head second one good yeah Miller just stay up on the ball dont let him roll it up here goes Hunter fivepoint game Chase goes all the way to the basket and dunks it down heres the inbounds to Miller with three two theyre trying to get the foul Hall will pay for it with his fifth with 22 Applause Music left that is five on PJ Hall and hes going to foul out of the final game of the regular season itll be the fifth time hes fouled out in ACC play and the six time overall and he exits with 18 points Applause tonight and Brad Brownell with 22 left to go in a threepoint game and were going to have fouls here or free throw shots for Wake Forest and realistically with 22 to go the deacons have to miss them both for Clemson to even then have a crack at a Applause tie what a game tonight by coach forbs yep I mean he his game plan was A1 you know denying PJ the ball making it tough for him Millers free throw seals it for the decks 80 76 with 22 to go wakes going to finish 11 and N in the league and so is Clemson second one good Miller was six hunter from midcourt at the horn and wake wins 8176
