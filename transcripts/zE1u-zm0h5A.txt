to increase their offensive output today Virginia one of the best teams in college basketball defensively they hold opponents below 55 points per game true test for this young but talented Notre Dame Team Notre Dame in white Virginia in the away Navy Blues it is great to have you at pcel Pavilion JR kesn working it around the ark that packline defense can be a disruptor for any opponent Burton in the waiting seconds of the shot clock KES Nails the three a good sign for Notre Dame right off the top when we talk with Tony Bennett before this game he said that was the concern and key for him playing this Notre Dame team he said look they shoot a lot of Threes as you take a look at the UVA starting five they must do a good job contesting perimeter jumpers of against Notre Applause Dame beatman will take a three cannot match kesn in the rebound rebound is engulfed by Notre Dame and Carrie Booth The Freshman hes 610 had committed to Penn State but when Michel Shrewsbury took the Notre Dame job he takes it and Jr KES off to a terrific start well statistically coming into this game Notre Dame 26 from Beyond The Arc as a team but Tony benett talked about it look they shoot a lot of Threes the key thing is early on theyve gotten open looks drive by ro is Off the Mark Burton in the front court and Notre Dame just 39 for the field only scoring 63 points but Michael shrewbury told us its all about being careful with the ball their turnovers have been way too rapid yeah and he seemed really excited about this team again uh challenged them after the Citadel loss and they responded with a wind ver miris and again a lot of young talent and he talked about the process of building the culture for this team and theyre going to be tested against one of the better defensive teams in Music Virginia Burton this is the Marquee matchup right here Burton verse beakman kzn is feeling it cross court and they do not beat this clocker they do my goodness that was close shot clock violation says Isaac Barnett third official I think though they may they may take a look at it it looks like again from that angle tough but veteran official approv Jamie lucky obviously Teddy Valentine on this and there I think they might theyre confirmed to see whether or not theyre going to go take a look Applause we see again Virginia gets him deep in the shot clock early on right here though again great ball Movement by Notre Dame backto back threes tough now it looks like J luck is going to go take a look will be under review and scoop crowd at first cell Pavilion at seats over 9000 a noon start theyre cranked up to start their new year a couple days early lets see again right here this is the best angle very difficult to tell on that that Music angle yeah so it looks like he might have gotten that off and did he call Bank do out hey in that situation thats like an alley three he didnt even come down with the ball and thats pretty good touch and that was pretty deep as well well too and if youre coach rusbear you can ask for a better start against this Virginia team no especially when youre shooting 27 for three from the season you its been difficult to score were going to get an explanation from Isaac Music Barnett after review it is a good threepointer so thats nine straight points for JR kesn point two was left on the shot clock well again degree of difficulty he takes that shot 100 times he might make it two other times if that and again he didnt even come down with the ball in that situation Virginia does what they do got him deep into shot clock and hes able to hit a bank three deep and right now on the at home Notre Dame up 9 Z early and kesn is a local boy from South Ben went to St Joseph High School his career high in threes is four set last year against Miami already has three Here Comes Jake Groves the Oklahoma transfer and the tough start continues for the Music Applause Cavaliers Carrie boo to the rack and Teddy Valentine calls a foul Boos father Cala boo was a star at fence State he was and thats a heads up play by Booth right there again I like what Notre Dames doing their shooting threes when theyre open but theyre not settling that time Booth could have easily taken that three head fake and something you never really you really see a straight line drive and no help against this Virginia D it was late and early on offensively Notre Dame is getting excellent ball movement and theyre getting high percentage shots Booth 11 for 21 at the line as Groves goes to the bench for Tony Bennett replaced by Bond and a 10 to nothing run in the first 2 minutes and 52 seconds for the five and seven Fighting Applause Irish jinu coming off a blowout win over Morgan State three days ago coach shrewbury talked about the difficulty of Defending Virginia They Dont Really te necessarily run sets its Concepts and a lot of pin downs and movement so the communication for Notre Dame has to be on point early on theyre doing a good job defensive rebounding too John Virginia has missed its first first five shots team shooting 46 Shai couldnt handle the pass and a foul is called on Notre Dame and thats on Julian R the Northwestern transfer noted AES Micah Shrewsbury in his first year in South Bend good success at Penn State Butler under Brad Stevens was an assistant under Brad Stevens with the Boston Celtics Indiana native the Fade Away by Bond and Jai has the board and again uh defensive glass cleaned up by Notre Dame and theyre forcing him into some contested shots thats all you can ask for if youre coach Shrewsberry your young team again hes been pleased with their defense on this end its been a struggle at times but early on at this game they are on fire unbelievable thats four threepointers for the Irish three of them by kesn that one by Marcus Burton well really uncharacteristically right now Virginia giving up a lot of uncontested jumpers beakman the fade Applause Music away kzne cut off Burton want him to get in the lane that is an emphasis of their offense its a freshman hes learning how to do it good defense by beatman raining ACC Defensive Player of the Year batted Away by Dunn who has a chance to win ACC Defensive Player of the Year this year dun on the Baseline and the flush an emphatic slam and thats what coach Shrewsberry staff talked about turnovers thats been problematic for this Notre Dame team coming into this game 121 assists to 160 turnovers you just cant do it against this team or any team live ball turnovers bond to Dunn after another turnover by the Irish and dun hits it so that gives them a little bit M more momentum headed towards our first media timeout and thats what you dont want to do against a Virginia team again theyre not going to score in the 80s you dont want to give them those free three buckets off of live ball Applause turnovers B Booth thats their first Miss from three McNeely the board Isaac mcne one of the top threepoint Shooters in the country 48 yeah he has been on a hot streak starting his season off and right now though of Virginia starting to get better offensive execution missed that short jumper there but again theyre getting a higher percentage look in this last three minute stretch Burton and bman thats our Spotlight match up good ball Movement by the Irish kzne number five to shoot hes got it give him the ball hes feeling it thats a tough shot mcney again right underneath him he just barreled his way down the lane and hit a tough a little short jumper that was contested beatman and he hits a two just inside the ark Rees beatman theyll need more of that and thats right there again that offensive action by Virginia again they do a lot of pin Downs uh coach whoberry and staff talked about that the communication needs to be better for Notre Dame thats a wide openen look for Reese beakman beat is their leading scorer 13 per outing Booth fake kzne nice pass to Booth can he get one off and he gets the roll everythings falling for the Irish and theyre contested anytime you play Virginia you know youre going to have to make contested shots rarely will you get open looks and thats what Notre Dames doing right now theyre hitting some tough tested jumpers and runners in the lane deep three by Isaac mcne just what the doctor ordered for Tony Bennett if theyre effective Isaac mcne likely is hitting a three and thats a breakdown by uh Notre Dame again mcne we talked about it almost 50 from the threepoint line you got to know the Scout you cannot give him airspace he said 33s and 61 attempts including 6 for8 against Syracuse and 6 for8 against NC Central Music ke ji and thats a nice maneuver by ji in the lane and I like that and again con Bennett we talked with him he was concerned about their physicality said look were not a really physical team uh in the post and he was concerned about the iris on the defensive and offensive glass and trying to control the paint da long rebound to Leon Bond here comes beatman to the rack and some contact took us a while to get to our first media timeout but scintillating start for JR kesn he has 11 points he only averages nine and Notre Dame will take it Reese beatman says you know what Ill grab from long distance as well USAA yeah they have awesome rates on coverage for our car home and stuff she has a lot of stuff dad a lot of cool

hes passed his season average of nine points and its been off of excellent ball movement a rare youll get this manyy open looks against this Virginia team but they done a nice job with their dribble drives that one right there were going to give him maybe four for that degree of difficulty off the charts on that right there a tough runner in the lane over mcel and again you couldnt have asked for a better start uh if your coach ruseberry and Notre Dame right there again uh over his season average already to start Music and Notre Dame has to minimize runs and thats Michel Shrewsbury told us he talked about violent runs that Virginia can put put together he said Miami does the same thing with beatman at the line how do you minimize Those runs yeah and he said look Miami they do it and it seems like 30 seconds you can be down 13 He said Virginia does it in a different way where it could be an 8minute stretch and you havent scored and theyre just on a 140 round and you know anytime they get a double digit lead you might as well triple it because the way they play defense almost a punch Away by beatman who is tenacious as you touched on in the open Marcus Burton The Freshman from

D shooting not exactly known from long distance thus far Malcolm but theyre doing it early and I like how theyre doing it theyre getting good uh looks uh coach rbbery talked about this not settling for the first one the balls moving left to right and theyre getting some open looks something were not accustomed to seeing against this Virginia Defense they have missed their last five shots as mcne find Buchanon bman thought about the three tan Murray off the bench for Tony Bennett a Music Applause bond Neely off a pin down and Davis the rebound Davis a transfer from Notre Dame hes going to be instrumental if theyre going to be successful yeah and defending the pin Downs again thats another key anytime you play Virginia they do a lot of actions at the fou line area pinning down for the guard so curls uh Fades you have to be communicating well early on Notre Dame doing a good job defending Burton ran into a double team Murr got a hand on him and then the wall of beatman on that backline Tony Bennett he needs no introduction a decorated resume with those 341 wins their all time winning as coach in the national championship almost 5 years ago and uh really does a great job in the Player Development Area I think everybody talks about their defense offensively though as you take a look at Sona I mean the degree of difficulty that these guys are making shots look if youre Tony Bennett you got to scratch your head because again Zona Im not even sure he was looking at the rim on that one thats two prayers answered in the first 10 minutes of the game yanon Zona the weak side rebound he averages two points in two and a half rebounds 69 seniors started six games Burton the dribble Music Drive IMS takes the three and he back irons it well you cant ask though for a better offensive possession again ball got into the paint went left to right extra passes lob to Buchanan why did that go arve well again its the helps side defense as Davis though is down and does not look good right now lets hope hes able to get back in name hes holding his knee now couldnt see it from our angle whether or not he collided or came down awkward Tay Davis is a huge part of their defense he guards their best player every night the opponents best player and youre right it this not look promising at the moment for Tay Davis but his loss would be enormous not only off offensively but defensively yeah coach shy said hes our best uh defender on the perimeter he typically takes the opposing teams best player and in this game that would be beatman so and lets hope that young man is going to be okay and nothing long term but certainly right now getting some help into the locker room oh yeah it looked like he rolled his ankle and knee on that situation and M a terrific defensive play to fluster Blake Music Buchanan 13 D 34 Jak Rose well right now with the exception of the turnovers of Virginia really has been unable to get anything uh going in their halfcourt offense again credit Notre Dame theyve done a good job I think a couple of things making some contested shots and then theyve limited their turnovers right now I think thats going to be the key theme for this game uh can Notre Dame withstand this defensive pressure of Virginia good pocket pass and dun converts set off the penetration by beatman and thats why I think hes one of the best guards uh in the country not just ACC but in the country uh he is doing so much for this team Tony Bennett talked about him not only uh leading uh by his play but also being more of a vocal leader with this group and its a maturation process for him hes gotten better every year gotten stronger as you know what it takes every year to succeed in college basketball kesn the fade away with contact and a foul so KES has been aggressive and probably an emphasis in the pre pregame by Shrewsbury take your shot yeah and again theyre contested shots uh hes been good off the bounce as well Music too go to Dame is a team shooting 73 at the line kesn making his 10th start as you get set to ring in the New Year tomorrow well have a woms basketball quadruple header on ACN it starts at noon Eastern number 22 Florida State hosting W Forest the number 13 Notre Dame against Syracuse followed by 19th rank Louisville taking on Miami we cap today with number three NC State and Virginia wish everyone a happy New

him to be effective Notre Dame is going to have success yeah and thats a hustle play right there again Virginia team that does uh plays in the low uh 50s every possession counts and gaining an ex possession that time off of a Miss at the free throw line thats Applause huge Julian Roper coming back from a foot injury Up and Under and roie takes the deflection for Applause Virginia after losing Tay Davis well see how Notre Dames defense Applause adjusts Virginia seems like theyre having trouble moving the ball from from side to side yeah they really are and I think the pin down screens again thats been huge right there theyve been able to come off those clean Ley and defend this line up right here mcney playing the point but this is the key right here roie the transfer from St Thomas is well Off the Mark hell hear about that one so Virginia not even shooting 30 Notre Dame has been capitalizing with a ninepoint lead AT purcel Pavilion Applause USAA yeah they have awesome rates on

into it QuickBooks Virginia Malcolm hucke has dominated the series last match up here in Notre Dame Notre Dame defeats Virginia by four points and in interesting swing too over the last six games between the two the average margin of victory has been six points and I think a lot of folks are going to look at these numbers and and do a double take and say man whats going on here Virginia one of the better defensive teams statistically in college basketball right now Notre Dame shooting 62 from the floor and 57 from the threepoint line Virginia has missed 13 shots Notre Dam has only attempted 13 shots and Notre damam has a ninepoint lead yeah and I think the rebounding really Notre Dame has done a nice job on the glass 14 to5 advantage and rebounding for Notre Dame mainly because Notre Dame hasnt missed many shots as well either and a foul on Music Virginia ke A J part of the focal point of that Notre Dame defensive attack Julian ropa takes a seat from Shrewsberry and rer they call him rer points they dont know how he does it sometimes but hes a kind of strange offensive player and that hes effective and you dont necessarily know where its coming from every team needs one of those guys again that does a lot of little things winning plays as coach crry Applause said kesn man is he having an afternoon Jr k got to love his aggressiveness as well and thats the key word right there I mean those are tough shots he is just big boying himself in the lane lowering his shoulder then hes hitting some tough jumpers then on the other end Virginia there in all jump shots and nobody on the offensive glass just really out of SN offensively Burton The Hop skipping the jump and Notre Dame ties its largest lead at 13 wow again thats a beautiful move by one of the better freshman guards in the league Burton beautiful split beatman an awkward shot at the Baseline but a foul against the Irish and keski again right here look at this this is not bad D this is a guy right here I got a size Advantage Im going to lower my shoulder and then hit a tough one off the glass and then we talked about Burton leading them in scoring thats a beautiful split help not there for Virginia and thats a wide open uncontested layup Burton five times this season he scored double digit points in the second half alone against Niagara Oklahoma State Western Michigan Marquette and Maris so he first half player and a second half player and thats interesting in that hes a freshman in the learning process for him its been a steep curve but hes capitalizing yeah he came in uh to this season opening game 29 Points uh the person who had that record before our guy former colleague lonso Ellis had 27 and you can see the future very bright for Notre Dame with him Manning the point guard Applause position Burton the crossover and the punch Away by McNeely thats the Virginia deflection strategy and thats what cannot happen again turnovers and Trav on Elijah Gert freshman guard Jamie lucky was eyeing him yeah and again a just missed opportunity for Virginia right now theyre down 12 and its really been surprising how good of looks Notre Dame has had again we know they had some young talented players uh but you just again dont expect coming into this game theyre going to get drives uh really with the help not there and thats been the case kesn almost traveled ji gets it against Miner who just checked in good take by ji but Miner has the rebound Miner is a transfer from Marry m College out the Northeast conference hes from Kingston Music Mass a steel Patman tried to

Im just paying for my own salad good news for Notre Dame Tay Davis is back so a quick recovery Malcolm and theyre going to need him if they are to hold on yeah and thats a great sign again as he walked off the court uh the question we had was is how long would he be out for and certainly hes answered that question uh we did not think we was going to see him back in this game but again youre right their best perimeter Defender great news to have him back out on the courton Shrewsbury for three the unconscious start continues for Notre Dame theyve hit five of eight triples Shrewsberry is first JR kzns fourpoint shy of tying his career high of 18 points Virginia has matched his 14 point total 63 from the threepoint line for Notre Dame right now beatman the drive thats what he can do he can ignite them not only defensively but offensively his progress again everybody talks about his defense of credit to Tony Bennett and their staff again his Improvement offensively again a guy that tested the NBA Waters uh hes going to be a pro hes going to be a very good Pro he reminds me a lot of Malcolm Brogden in the sense that again defensively you know what he brings uh but I think offensively underrated his game and hes just continued to improve under Tony Bennett and staff kesn Davis trying to maneuver and he does around Leon Bond largest lead of the game for the Irish I like what Notre Dames doing theyre just isoing guys theyre either putting kesn or that time Davis on the Block and let them go to work Virginia not helping and theyre just bar barring their way down and getting some good Applause looks Miner average 17 last year for Murray m just two this year off their bench and another steal for Notre Music Dame impressive ball movement Malcolm the ball is going

the field and you know John some of them have been tough again there were a couple early where he was able to get it off a great ball movement uh but some of these have been contested tough runners or turnarounds in the paint and hes a guy came into this game averaging nine hes at 17 points right now and 318 to go in the first half thats going to have to change for Virginia theyre going to have to get some stops and then on the other end Notre Dame right now winning the turnover battle in terms of points off of turnovers Notre Dame six points off of turnovers Virginia four remember that was a concern coming into this game a Notre Dame team that really has had problems taking care of the ball theyve done a good job doing that against Virginia and then turning Virginia over and getting some points so some anxious moments for Tony Bennett and inbound to Dun VI Neely they need him to get going and he does beautiful set play again their pin Downs really uh some of the best actions right there the screening excellent and then mcney the footwork coming off that was perfect Ney has five but Marcus Burton with a counter punch that is a big time move by Burton my goodness hes done that a couple times in this game where he split and then gone into the lane and finished through contact and thats going to be three foul shots MC Neely hoisting from The Arc but the last Burton Drive something a guard like you were can respect I tell you what I couldnt do it like this this is a beautiful split body control on point and then his eyes were on the rim the entire time uh you can see why coach rber and staff are so excited about this young mans progress Mr basketball in Indiana a big time pickup for them and we talked about his first game 29 Points in his opener first college game and he is going to be added to the list of great Notre Dame guards when he leaves here foul was on Braden Shrewsberry but the last five for Marcus Burton over 17 points and 44 for the field he scored over 2200 points in his high school Music career dra some comparisons to the other longtime Notre name great Chris Thomas another Mr basketball in Indiana used to love watching his game and hes only going to continue to get better but he is having himself a heck of a start to his young career at Notre Dame thats something Michael Shrewsberry brings the knowledge of this state one of the top Recruiters in Indiana Michel Shrewsberry throughout his career Butler Purdue Penn State I know your name and how about a three Marcus Burton say hello and that was deep over beakman that was almost at the logo and my goodness they are up 19 right now dun off the Miss three by baitman jinia shooting 32 beatman and a foul called by referee Isaac Barnett on the Northwestern transfer Julian roer but the largest lead of the game 19 points for not today well its different and coach Bennett talked about this uh look were on the road its ACC play he had concerns we talked to him right before the game he was concerned about the threepoint shooting he said when we asked him keys and then the physicality on the glass right now those things have been problematic against this Notre Dame team plus eight rebounding Edge as Dunn hits duns on some first round draft boards and some early Mark drafts they think dun could be a first round and they need more of that though from him look you know he can defend but were going to get into his numbers you know he can be a guy that blocks shots theyre going to need his offense Up and Under by J everybodys brought a touch to the glass for not today and Coach shrewbury called him an exactor guy he said look he brings a physicality to uh our our team and he has done that in this game doing a nice job controlling the paint Irish have made their last six shots turn around grow R Rose played at Eastern Washington Oklahoma and now Virginia and I like the last two possessions by Virginia John because of theyre in the paint again theyve settled for a lot of jumpers early on in this game and that will bring us to another timeout 3 seconds come right back to South Bend after this for USAA yeah they have awesome rates on coverage for our car home and stuff she has a lot of stuff dad a lot of cool stuff honey but USAA also has banking credit cards and loans plus advice and other perks only for emergencies thanks Mom and its all in one spot so we know shes all set because weve got USAA USAA more than you might think for the military community and their families Virginia with a dominant defense 54 points per game second ofation but not so much today I mean you look at these numbers uh Notre Dame 70 uh from the threepoint line 73 from the floor and again uh Virginia coming into this game one of the better teams defensively statistically in college basketball and really right now not Dame cant miss and then on the other end theyre really struggling offensively with the exception of last two possessions I think thats going to be a key for them they got to attack the paint stop settling for jumpers and then defensively Virginia get back to who you are which is keep the ball out of the paint whens the last time you saw a team shoot 73 in the first half travel on Bron shrewbury turnover for the Irish but thats the number for not today they made 16 of 22 shots seven of 10 also from distance well 469 seconds again your last two possessions for Virginia uh its been uh Groves and done in the paint this is the area they need to continue to Applause attack drive by beatman and taken away by Carrie Applause Music boo two second differential shot clock game clock Music Burton eyeing it and the reverse cant go here comes beatman onean fast break against KES but he lost it it goes Notre Dames way what happened there just really good uh transition defense that time by Notre Dame kept beakman out of the paint and he just turned it over really not much to it other than just good transition D that was good Hustle by JR kesn with under 4 seconds left in the half Burton launches and hes off the mark a rarity in the first half 17 points there plus plus plus in favor of Notre Dame shooting percentage laring threepoint shooting as well Notre Dame plus seven in rebounding that surprises you well I think the rebounding not as surprising I think theyll the open jumpers John that really to me the shooting numbers uh Virginia again just a team that really doesnt allow a lot of open looks OD Dame coming in with quick hands and a foul says Teddy Valentine part of this officiating crew with Jamie lucky and Isaac Barnett on Ryan Dunn just off the bat the second half hes Malcolm Huckaby Im John me Perell producer Alex cyber and an outstanding crew Happy New Year everybody thanks for spending part of your weekend with us on acc Applause Music Network kzne a oneman wrecking crew onepoint shy of his career high and hes got a high release point on his turnaround jumper again that was his goto move in that first half done beautiful down the lane what a pass and I like that twoman game they done that under whether its off of pin downs and then try to hit the roller that time uh beakman with a beautiful dump off pass to Dun Dunn has 10 of their 26 points three for Marcus Burton and industrious work off the glass by Notre Dame and kesd who hits the floor hard another good look though again off of ball movement but keski again driving Baseline collapsing that Virginia D extra pass and they got a nice look that time by Burton but again on the glass you talked about it John the defensive rebounding and offensive rebounding Notre Dame really Advantage them in that department on both sides sh to Davis after the foul was on beatman is first Davis got hurt in the first half but came back looked like a ankle injury and off the finger tips of Tay Davis the seaten hall transfer took his eye off of it yeah he did again he was thinking about what he was going to do I like that he wasnt settling for a jumper only good thing about that its not a live ball turnover again uh you get a chance to set your defense up Andrew Ro AC quiet first first half but he says its the second half now thats his first backet of the game and uh coach usbery talked about Virginia runs different from Miami they can do it in an 8 minute stretch where you dont score and next thing you know they run off eight or 10 Applause points Ro St Thomas Minnesota transfer 12 starts six points per game shoots 30 from three good defense by the Cavs three Booth no and McNeils got it some adjustments made defensively by Virginia absolutely uh again I think a lot of it is getting back to really not an adjustment but doing what they do best contesting Applause jumpers you can bet in the locker room there might have been some rather forceful language from Tony Bennett and a great Baseline move by dun and now Micah Shrewsberry needs a timeout and just like that Virginia uh back with n 10 beautiful execution offensively to

Clevelander South Beach be the real you hot start for Virginia seven to nothing run Malcolm to started and its all started on the defensive end uh theyve tighten up their defense I think the biggest thing they kept the ball out of the paint and then theyve contested shots on the other end a great timeout by coach shuberry but to stop this run he talked to us about that during the game he said look Virginias a team we have to limit periods where we dont score the ball easier said than done against one of the better defensive teams in college you also talks about the importance of valuing possessions and thats so important for any team that plays Virginia Burton heres a twoman game at Shrewsberry now to Roper who was quiet in the first half but not so much in the second and thats a breakdown by Virginia no need to help off that right there pman has Burton and check inexplicably the help comes off giving up a wide open three Tony Bennett not happy with that thats just a mental breakdown defensively by Virginia NE It Fade Away Roper the rebound rer has six Notre Dame has hit eight threes in 13 attempts and down the lane goes Ki what a beautiful pass by Burton we talked about his scoring uh but thats the area when we talk with the coaching staff they want to see him continue to grow coach Shrewsberry talked about uh watching film with him and making better reads look they know he can score but coming off ball screen sometimes its about drawing out the play and then setting your teammate up thats beautiful pick and roll offense that time all set up though by Marcus Burton and they are checking to see whether it was goal tending beatman will get credit for the hoop if it Music is and I think there was really no need for it right here again yeah it hit the glass yep so thats definitely going to be Music two and that will bring us to a T timeout so not to Dame with a 13point lead AT pcel Pavilion someone in this room stole my autographed basketball signed by

an obvious go 10 call M yeah hit the glass first easy call for them to make and Veteran crew and we had a chance to speak with Teddy Valentine before this game I had a joke with him I like man when are you going to stop he was doing games back in the early 90s when I was playing he looks the same in 42 years he has been officiating love him or hate him hes been out there and uh one of the more veteran guys and certainly uh he has been in some memorable moments of college basketball hes consistent absolutely and hes animated and he loves the cameras but I tell you what though again I think thats the key word hes consistent you know what youre getting with him three by Shrewsberry knocked down and hell take three foul shots Bren Shrewsberry the son of Micah Shrewsberry to the line Notre D shot 70 in the first half only the second time the team has shot over 50 in the half against Virginia other time against Wisconsin this year where they shot 52 again were seeing a lot of uncharacteristic defensive things against Virginia again dribble drives where theyre getting broken down credit Marcus Burton uh we highlighted that matchup coming into this game uh Burke uh Burton vers beakman and Burton has done a nice job getting into the lane that time finding Shrewsberry and close outs really have been uh poor in this game thus far for Virginia that foul was on Music McNeely that was his first and Shrewsberry with a couple makes for a 15point Irish lead l Dame lost ACC opener to Miami Music Applause Virginia played three days ago Notre Dame hasnt played in eight days when they beat Marist here on ACCC Network beatman the Leon bond is that a good idea absolutely hes wide open from the free throw line thats a nice find by Bean you cant ask for a better look a wide open fou line jumper good pass by Burton now Applause rer pack line de defense has been punctured at times Burton the crossover still that was a special move and I dont like the I like the offensive possession though by Notre Dame how patient they are I dont like the transition defense nobody picked up the ball and Reese beakman walks down the lane for an uncontested dunk Look Out Below beatman has 11 two shy of his season average he leads Virginia Music scoring Music kzne rer with under five to shoot to the rack and the disruptive nature of the Virginia Defense continuing beat had a guy open and a steal instead by Roper he had Burton on the wing but elect to keep it himself from what youve seen of the adjustments the Cavs have made its sty noted in it has but again Ive been impressed with the patience that Notre Dame has shown on their offensive possessions more good posss by rer but jamy lucky calls a foul thats on mcne his second fourth of the team Matt Zona off their bench and right here again a breakdown in transition defense thats one of the few things you dont want to do with this Virginia team dont give them live ball turnovers or transition points make them score in the half Music court Sona had two first half points limited minutes blav New York 69 and rugged Roper takes the three and its an air ball but zone is underneath did the hard part missed the easy one but Notre Dame controls the glass that they have throughout the day and another foul on Virginia its getting a bit chippy Tony Bennett said it uh right before the game uh his keys to the game he said look defending the threepoint line and then the physicality uh Notre Dame he was concerned about that he was he said look were not an overly physical team we dont have a Bruiser inside and he was concerned and right now credit Notre Dame theyve done a nice job on the defensive and offensive Applause glass and a 5sec violation Michel Shrewsbury not happy yeah and a very lucky too again not sure what he thought he got pulled over but again unforced a turnover right there not able to un inbound the ball under Music need nine turnovers for the Irish what a pass outstanding look by Andrew roie to Ryan Dunn and a foul and thats some great action again a wheel cut and then you had a back door had Notre Dame confuse on their rotations and I was on Roper with done at the line and this is one of those droughts that Michael shuberry was worried about they havent scored in two and a half minutes theyre ro for their last five next Saturday afternoon on accn well have the first basketball triple header of the New Year Virginia takes on NC State to start us off at two Eastern then Florida State host Virginia Tech finally number 16 Duke and Notre name here in sou Ben should be a terrific afternoon of Hoops on acc Network well another area for Virginia coming into this game free throw shooting as a team they came into this shooting 65 from the free throw line Shrewsberry the three McNeely has the rebound and zone is up limping for Notre Dame beatman try to Applause initiate Batman to McNeely good ball movement for Tan Murray Murrays got his first two of the game thats a great patient offensive possession they had some mismatches and look at this right here Virginia in a Zone going to a one two2 zone do you like it well again theyve been able to keep unable ex said to keep the ball out of the paint maybe this right here tried to force some deep threes kesn made his first four threes but hes been quiet its the start of the second half third game has missed its last seven shots as you see zero points in the last 340 this is Virginia this is what they do and Virginia for the game two of7 from the threepoint line 29 they have not shot the ball well from Beyond The Arc and still though within Striking Distance down 10 about the most field goals allowed since the lost to Ferman last year in the NCA tournament today with the 16 field goals for Notre Dame they cant get it under double digits its been a struggle for Virginia to find that magic under double digit number Le was as large as 19 points the runner by Burton hes magic when he gets in the lane John he has done that time after time The Bigs are opening up too big for Virginia and giving him Lanes to split when they set a ball screen for him The Bigs of Virginia have to do a better job being tighter on those screens and not letting him split cuz hes been able to get into the lane and score for himself or set his teammates up Burton has 12 kesn has 17 this man Carri Boo has a three first three of the game for boo he has six and thats Burtons seventh assist of this game uh he has played a beautiful floor game for Notre Dame roie the N1 so a flurry of counter punches but Mark as Burton fit to the task putting on a show one of the better freshman guards in college basketball right here to split and floater and then hes showing off the floor game with another assist the Notre Dame still up Music

uh but I think its the assist and hes controlled Pace Tempo going up against one of the better defensive guards in college basketball and REE beakman and really uh he has been the main key for them having this offensive output against Virginia Malcolm iss the only freshman of the country averaging over 15 points three and a half assists and one and A2 Steals and you were a great defensive player and I know you take a lot of pride in that and hes doing another defensive end as well he is and I think though the big thing uh right now theyre doing theyre putting him in ball screens the Virginia bigs and wings are not doing a good job hedging on them theyre opening up leaving space for him to split hes done that at least four or five times in this game uh that needs to change and the free throw Wes continue uh for Virginia Music Applause thats 6 for 11 at the line for the Cavs hes Malcolm hucke Im John M Perell great to have you with us on acc Network canne and Burton playing The twom Man game a screen by kesn heres Booth who hit a three moments ago and he gets the hometown roll Carrie Ruth the former Penn State commit and coach rusy talked about them not settling for the first three that they get be more patient they continue to be patient offensively pass up threes to get better twos really doing a nice job running their half court offense roie for Isaac Music mcy pman slips one to Dun who cant handle it but beatman gets it back from the elbow done industrious Applause no beakman no hard work by Virginia but to no avail yeah you got two clean looks off of offensive rebounding uh by dun and beakman got a wide open look short range and then missed a wide open three from the corner Booth takes a three and he makes a three Carri Booth offense at a premium well whats going on right now Notre Dame playing with great energy and then defensively theyre doing a nice job help side the help has been there and then theyre keeping the ball out of the paint just when you think Virginia is coming back not Dame has an answer roie for three and Burton caral it who has scored Notre Dames last eight points heres another split Burton by by Burton you got it Marcus Burton its your show this is a big time performance by this freshman guard we talked about it Mr basketball in Indiana coming out and then right here split and then look at this body control take the hit his eyes were on the rim the entire time and one that is a big time finish by Marcus Burton Marcus Freeman want contact him he can bounce off a tackle I I mean his ability again to play through contact uh has been impressive in this game hes hit some tough shots through contact and right now uh dont blank but Notre Dame up 20 largest of the game Virginia has never LED from the tip both of us looked at each other before the game and said hey you know maybe Notre Dame can keep this close that was kind of the Outlook of Notre Dame fan Blake Buchanan the jump hook too strong and booth has got it and again nobody on the offensive glass for Virginia and again I know they want to keep teams out of transition but right now youre down 21 you might have to start sending guys to the offensive glass try to get some extra possessions right now though time running out 826 to go and a Notre Dame team thats been very patient with their offensive possessions I think thats been key in this game they have not shot the ball quick uh theyve been patient and then theyve been working the ball around and getting it into the paint foul is going to break through Cannon is first with Kevin ji at the line usually its Virginia holding teams under 50 60 points but Notre Dame has had the defensive formula 39 from the floor 22 from the three for Virginia as you get set to ring of the New Year tomorrow well

first two of the Music Applause game snapping a 152 run for Notre Dame Logan Imes a freshman guard hes guarded by tane Murray now JR Music kesn disciplined offense I Notre Dame kzne flustered and a turnover is Applause forced McNeely slows it down finds Murray bad pass mcney was in the air Here Comes eyes against Murray and cannot convert but the put back is good my goodness what energy from

three I like the ability to shot fake dont settle for a three and then Ling off the bounce under control and its all been set up weve talked about it by Burton right here though hustle play and one of the numbers really I think the turnover game uh kri bo youre going to take a look at his numbers in the first half only three 10 in the second but the turnovers have been key uh in this game for Notre Dame uh they came into this game averaging 13 turnovers a game and remember John against this Virginia team the concern was will they be able to take care of the ball they only have 10 in this game thats the largest lead of the game for Notre Dame 24 points theyve LED wire to wire riding that 132 run in the last 346 Booth with 14 completing the threepoint play after the foul on Buchanan boo sixpoint shy of tying his season high of 20 against Western Applause Carolina more to ious defense by the Irish and the close outs the close outs by Virginia and then on Virginia and then the help defense again right here this is just great team defense everybodys locked in the rotations are on time and their hands uh their hands are in the passing lanes that time getting a deflection coming up with a turnover and a foul on Groves his second and Virginia has looked a bit lethargic throughout what do you think thats indicative of well in their losses you look at it and I think a couple of things for them uh typically theyre a team that does a really good job running their offense credit Notre Dames defense they did a really good job of making it difficult for them you look at the numbers for Virginia and shooting the ball really it has not been pretty 20 from the threepoint line two of 10 and 39 from from the floor a lot of it has to do with these defensive possessions as you saw on the last one the Closeouts and length of Notre Dame really has bothered Virginia and theyve been unable to execute in their half court heer shrewbury told us the season has constantly been evolving theyre through 12 now this is game 13 every opportunity is a learning experience as Groves hits for Cavs but theyre making strides and thats what hes a positive reinforcement that he has after beating marish eight days ago and now this game and I think its more the growth of the guy with the ball in his hands look Marcus Burton we know he can score uh you talked about all the points he scored coming in Mr basketball Indiana he was a highscoring guard but I think its his four game to me that has been key in this one he has scored for himself but he has set his teammates up you look at the assist numbers for Burton in this game hes got eight assists Music and the schedule on the horizon with NC State on accn 900 Wednesday and then number 16 Duke every games up for grabs Malcolm its that type of League at least in the early going we think you cant sleep on anybody well Tony Bennett we talked with him before the game uh he said look were in conference play now so there look theres again uh once you get into conference play obviously on the road it becomes more more and more difficult to win it doesnt make a difference who youre playing and certainly were seeing that this afternoon with a inspired Notre Dame team I really think their energy really has something we have not seen a lot this season they play with a lot of energy uh start of this game up until this point now and beatman has been hindered hes 0 for four from three Re beatman their leading scorer has 11 points Braden shrewbury the open three they havent missed many of those they rebound for Ryan Dunn and here comes Jake Rose Andrew roie on Shrewsberry the fadeaway over the top Burton he doing it all now he mans the Applause break booth for the putb what a second half for Carri Music boo it has been a dominant performance uh on the glass total rebounds 35 to 20 in favor of Notre Dame glaring glaring Edge for the Irish and just one of those days that sometimes happens in the ACC if youre Tony Applause Bennett burs just letting it roll Tony Bennett said it went off his foot he was calling for the back court violation ACC network has number five Florida State covered in Miami for the Capital One Orange Bowl coming up next to two the Huddle crew will have a twohour pregame show followed by a command center broadcast with multiple camera angles and real time player and team stats of the game then after against number six Georgia stick around for ACC huddles postgame show theyll have a complete breakdown with reactions from coaches and Music Applause players roie patient Miner first run of the second half for the marac transfer and a Music foul theyve been searching every formula theyve tried every combination theyve tried Malcolm has been off the Marth yeah again uh Virginia team that does a lot of their actions off of pin Downs a lot of a player movement read and react and theyve just been unable really to get any clean looks beatman with a book back and a foul so hell take that to add to his 11 points now with 13 the foul was on ji is second its been a frustrating afternoon of th th far for Reese beakman and Credit Burton again hes made him Chase all over the court and thats fatigue right there again short on the free throw and credit Notre Dame again theyve been patient offensively they put beakman in a lot of ball screen Music Applause Music Applause action Burton tries to knife through the defense knocked Away by Ryan Dunn Dunn goes down they can ill afford to lose him up a bit Applause Music gingerly beatman good body control and another foul against Notre Dame it has been a struggle for the 10 and two Cav Notre Dame from Pillar To Post has been Music dominant Music Music foreign Music Music Applause the Home Depot committed to filling the

buddy that box is for everybody theres a little mcnet in everyone coming to you from frost way with a buddy and a meal in every box the Kerwin frost box students students of any age from anywhere using our technology to power different ways of learning so when Minds grow opportunities Music follow Im here Courtside watch this you have got to watch this replay folks watch this watch Music this watch me watch me watch me do this with Virginia when you talk about a loss its always about where the offense is coming from and theyre two losses with scotson and Memphis they were both blown out and today its been the same circumstance yeah really right side uh outside of beakman and Dunn really not much offense uh only two players in double digits and you know its been a frustrating night for beakman mainly because he spent so much energy on the defensive end uh chasing ing around uh Burton but I think thats going to be the key theme for Virginia as they get deeper into ACC play they need more balance offensively look uh Im not as concerned about them defensively in terms of on the perimeter look Notre Dame caught fire today from the threepoint line some of those were contested y i I think scoring and also rebounding would be my two major concerns uh if Im this Virginia team uh wheres your offense going to come at come from and then the rebounding again Notre Dame has dominated the glass in this game and certainly thats problematic as you start going up against some of these bigger front courts in the ACC they have Louisville on the horizon at home see the plus4 rebound Edge for Notre Dame Burton a booth whos been fantastic in the second half it goes off his legs says Isaac Barnett and a turnover you feel like the league maybe is crystallizing a little bit as a puncher chance for everybody on any given night and I think its the same though just in college basketball yeah uh not just in the ACC there is much parody and I guess lack of a dominant team uh in conference play and also just across the landscape of college basketball I think its more of that so good hust by Logan IMS and Blake Buchanan but a foul on Blake Buchanan who has a bright future for Tony Bennett he said that we dont have that physical mentality yet were not rugged in the post hes counting on Buchanan growing as the season goes along to give him that yeah and again they lost a few guys to the transfer portal of Virginia two of their bigger uh players and I think thats hurt them to go along with again some of the threepoint shooting look mcney certainly can shoot the ball um he caught fire but hes struggled in their losses I think its more as a team finding that balance youre just going to need more than just beakman to carry you offensively uh when teams figure out how to score on you and your Applause defense Applause Kane Murray guarded by eyes gets by him and another Music foul thats on Carrie boo is Applause third and Michael shrewbury something he hasnt done a lot this year can empty his bench in the final 242 and certainly uh happy if you get a chance to get some of these guys that dont get minutes into the game and listen to this crowd salute Marcus Burton and Carrie Boo the JR KES Logan and keev as they will all take a seat it was an X Factor the crowd no doubt gave them a little boost today and they were here early we talked about that uh they were here early and uh the team gave them something to cheer about in this game oh it was a dominant really performance led by Burton bond with a Miss Tony Sanders the rebound hes a senior from Miami Alex Wade has the ball for Brighton Nifty dribbling by Wade against tane Murray Harbaugh the fade away three that was would have brought the house down absolutely and again as you start looking ahead under two minutes to go you know coach rosbury talked about he challenged his team after the loss to Citadel uh he talked about guys not playing with energy and that was a key theme for him I think they got that message in their last two games as you take a look at a three of V joh I think its uh their energy the energy that they played with and the physicality uh we were expecting that to be the story for Virginia that was not the case in this game start to finish uh Notre Dame defensively really made it difficult for Virginia and then they made Applause shots Jordan Miner just the second bucket in the last 10 attempts for for Virginia the unheralded aspect of the game you look at the production with 76 points the defense by the Irish yeah again look people are going to look at this and say look uh they scored 76 over 70 points against the Virginia team that came in holding opponents well below that but it was their defense that really set all of this up this will be Notre Dames largest margin of victory in an ACC game since they beat Georgia Tech by 42 points in February of 2022 I mean wow as you take a look at the upcoming schedule incredibly theyve never trailed well there life is not going to get any easier though again in this a very tough NC State team and then obviously uh you got Duke and again the way this crowd was today certainly students not here um but uh this place was packed and loud and certainly something uh to be excited about if youre a Notre Dame fan everybody talked about a rebuilding year and a maturation process they knew Michael Shrewsbury is a terrific coach he proved it the pen state but the patience that you need in that first year of a coach over and back against Virginia in a turnover so you know what thats like you went through it at Boston College every team of the Leagues been through it for that matter its patience making sure that you stay on track well I think absolutely a process I think on the other side if youre Tony and Virginia I think look defensively uh youre going to have games like this again make no mistake about it some of the shots that Notre Dame hit they were tough uh they were contested in the paint or threes for me I think again going back to the offensive theme in their losses uh its really been their inability to score uh thats been the issue and for the season only two players in double Music digits good drive there by ger as Virginia shoots just 37 and Notre Dame will drain the clock what a happy New Year for them and Micah Shrewsberry as they upset Virginia and win by 22 points it was a dominant performance uh you look
