more on the Move beakman nice fake there hell kick it back out high mcne on the drive very dangerous shooter but that one didnt touch anything but a tough shot for Virginia ree beakman actually had a layup that he turned away from after he got kishan George in the air wga poppler playing a tender ankle didnt miss a lot of time on Saturday against Virginia Tech but had a difficult time shooting it just one for five omir on the drive is going to scoop that one up and in NORAD oir really is the heart and soul of this hurricane team but the danger of guarding NORAD oir he can actually make thre so you have to honor him Beyond threepoint line and then he can get downhill oh by the way making 63 of his shots the Virginia starting lineup here tonight beakman remains their Premier Defender and really the number one defender in the league he is the reigning Defensive Player of the Year in the ACC agreed and when you think about ree beakman really his best competition for ACC Defensive Player of the Year this year is his teammate Ryan Dunn who also leads the league in Block shots so they all are leader in the category of their own and its usually when it comes to Virginia a defensive category heres packed to launch it way downtown that wont drop omir went for it down in the corner but its out of bounds off Miami and a fan taking a shot there and what we seeing you see ree beakman coming off and turning that corner gets to the basket the pump fake gets Kean George in the air beakman has a layup he decides not to take and then moving the basketball ends up being a tough shot for mcney RO looking for beatman he will set it up hes getting six assists per game number one in the ACC mcne and thats a shot he should have made as well so hes had a couple of opportunities early hes hitting 47 beyond the threepoint line hes much more comfortable out there but Obi as you mentioned Reese beakman with six assists a game for a team that doesnt get a lot of possessions L Chad oir leaving that one short the rebound comes back to the Cavaliers pman a pullup pop and short rebound tap back out for Virginia Pigman looking inside hell find dun here hes 68 on the move into the paint Little Fall Away short and a really cold start for the C ERS here at home which has not happened that often this year no this has been a place where they felt comfortable shooting the basketball but so locked in right now on how they going to defend North shadir who has caused problems with the entire league Kean George off the fake The Talented freshman cant hit it and his growth has really been something to watch from Miami this season hes coming off 16 points against Virginia Tech on Saturday thats double his season average for a young man who started out shooting the basketball so poorly in his first year now over 40 from Beyond a threepoint Arc but hes made his biggest impact on defensive end pman will drive scoop and thatll rattle in so finally Virginia gets into the scoring column and Miami with a man down yeah kesan George went up with an attempt to block that shot and immediately landed looking as though he was in pain and Miamis dealt with so many injuries this year only two of their players have played in every game one of them keesan George whos being helped up right now and the other benley Joseph who will check in for George yeah this is like the absolute last thing that Miami wants to see right now 22 in the early going weve never spoken but youve told us yes Dave well the Cavaliers have one returning starter and nine newcomers to their roster so Tony M message his team throughout this season has been dont grow weary of doing good in due time you will reap the Harvest and weve definitely seen that on the defensive end thats where their Foundation starts you already mentioned it number two in the nation on the defensive end first in the ACC defensively as well but nine newcomers it doesnt look like their chemistry has dropped off in that department seamless at this point guys and Angel of course you know a lot about this when you were playing at Florida State it takes a while for your system to get picked up thats one of the things that Tony Bennett has had to deal with is nor chir gets an easy one but as you mentioned nine newcomers it takes some time to get these guys acclimated on the same page especially with the defense and coaches never sure when that happens I mean it rarely happens so quick this has taking a little while with Groves and Miner and Ro all newcomers those are newcomers that are from that have played college basketball before then you consider the newcomers that this is their first taste of college basketball you talking about Blake Buchanan and guys like Elijah ger assess the first year years here at ubaa Cleveland jumping in the paint and a kick here for Joseph slick feed in the lane for two atthew Cleveland and are they ever happy to get him back he had missed two and a half games because of a hip injury finally got back on the floor against Virginia Tech at 15 in that game yeah 15 and 13 rebounds also so he provides so much production on not just his scoring but also helping his team on the defensive end good news from Miami Kean George putting that shoe back on after the retaping pakman little floater the tip wont go either dun tried to tip it back in and heres Joseph nor Chad omir if he stays out of fou trouble and plays all 40 look out off the fake takes the hit hell be at the line where he makes 79 I thought that was the biggest factor in the victory over Virginia Tech from Miami on Saturday they didnt turn the ball over very much in the second half after nine in the first half but they made 27 out of 29 at the line and when you have your big guys like omir who can get to the free throw line as much as he does but they take advantage of those opportunities thats always going to be a benefit for your team of course shooting into the first half of free throws here is easy its in the second half when hes shooting right into the band thats where it becomes difficult here in this building well that question omir one of the guys the many NBA Scouts you were talking about are here to see 21 Scouts as Cory mentioned and he will make one of two he had 16 points in the victory on Saturday but the four games before that he averaged 23 points and 11 rebounds a game so you could argue nobodys playing better than he is right now hes playing great basketball right now and hes really the main component for Miami cuz without him on the floor they are a completely different team he missed the game at Syracuse but has come back with the Ben be a dribble down cant stick it and its tipped out off of Virginia now you talked about how well they shoot it at home as compared to on the road overall Virginia only makes 445 and 37 from three and not a very good foul shooting team only 65 but right OB right now one for n to start this game so its been a cold start for Virginia on the white out here home pack on the drive heres Cleveland FSU transfers made such a difference when healthy but Miamis rarely been healthy and he missed ugly with that one we talk about Virginia shooting and you see the numbers in the 17 wins 39 a very good threepoint shooting team but in the losses only 3 point8 May per game at 27 Pigman again high percentage shot this time and only four points to this juncture of the game 7even to four Miami but I love ree bman being aggressive early to start this game and one of the things Jima is going to make ree beakman a score throughout this game hes not going to sit back and allow him to pick the team apart with his passing Miami running the motion pack with a pull up pop no and a foul underneath with 1326 to go here in the first half in Charlottesville and coming up next on ESPN round one of this season sunfl flower Showdown Hunter Dickinson and number four Kansas squaring off against cam Carter and Kansas State thats coming up at 900 tonight so Miami with a basketball to check it in on the Baseline they managed to quiet the big crowd to this point which comes to this Arena expecting to get a win every time and they get it every time Rees beakman getting an early rest be interesting to see how Virginia responds with their leader on the bench Dante Harris checking in and Harris been dealing with a bum ankle as well still running with a little bit of a limp yeah missed 10 games because of that ankle injury so it hasnt been a big factor quick strike underneath they got gr scen for two the 69ine grad whos been around a bit Virginia his third stop hes also been at Eastern Washington and Oklahoma but hes been adding much needed offense for Virginia especially over the last two games gam hes made eight threepointers in the first half of his last two games OB so look for Jake grov to be aggressive wga poppler playing on a bad ankle himself up top omir straight away and too strong s now Virginia with a chance to grab a lead for Tony Bennett who is 12 seven all time against Miami heres Harris last year averaged 12 points a game and a whistle on the the reach thatll go against Miami lets go to Angel as just an update on kesan George the athletic trainer Sam Johnson was working on his ankle at the end of the bench they were able to tape it up he was able to double sock while he was putting on his shoe I could hear him mouthing to the trainer I dont know if I can do it they went to the back of the tunnel he tried to see if he could put pressure on that left ankle it was very Ginger you could see him trying to see if he could work something out in the back right now hes still walking it off but we will have update as soon as I can guys all right angel thank you the foul went on Nigel pack a moment ago when an athlete says I dont think I can do it if the if the athlet says they dont think they can do it most likely they cant do it and thats a tough scenario for this Miami team whos dealt with so many different injuries throughout this year OB and you mentioned the NBA Scouts in here the majority of them are here to see Kean George hes the guy alongside Ryan Dunn who are projected as first rounders this year Joseph Off the Mark with a long triple and suddenly The KES have gone cold and theyre down one of their hottest players in The Talented freshman George and we will see if he does return tonight thats a huge miss the way hes been playing heres Groves got a good look and knocked it down theyre calling it a two playter and thats a defensive breakdown by Miami Jim lger can only fold his arms and can barely look at that possession as two guys run away from the guy whos made eight three pointers in the first half of the last two games and give him a wide openen look gr came in at 50 from threepoint land got a two on that one back feeding into the corner Cleveland got a good look wouldnt fall for him and done with the rebound hes not a big scorer but seven rebounds a game and as you mentioned the best shot Blocker in the ACC and he makes the energy and effort plays a tip end against Clemson on Saturday ended up being being the deciding bucket for Virginia of course after o have nearly knocked down the fourpoint play shot clock is down to six mcne he drains the triple hes 47 and overall number one in the conference and he is life out here in the jpj so Miami is taking a shot right in the mouth well see how they react here Nigel pack the junior point guard lines up a lengthy shot nothing falling right now for the hurricanes and Virginia leading it 117 under 10 minutes to go in half number Music Applause one Harris on the wing shot clock inside 10 again McNeely to Harris Groves wont wait yes another Applause Music triple you know as a team they dont shoot the three very well but theyve got a couple of guys who hardly Miss they absolutely have two guys who are knockdown Shooters in McNeely and Gro Pat shoved it up there and the rebound by Dunn all the momentum now belongs to Virginia theyre in a 12 nothing Applause run MCN again didnt have room to get off the three Groves in heavy traffic barricaded that time shot clock to five Harris with a quick step loose ball and a big tangle possession arrow will keep it on this end of the floor with 848 to go and a quick turnaround here for Virginia feeling thirsty well have more on that when we come back to John Paul Jones Arena Liberty Mutual C guys angel thank you very much I mean my formative years as a college basketball fan Ralph Samson was player number one for me Groves front rim that one and Miami with the rebound well of course as a Alum of this great University Ive had the opportunity of course interact back with cig little page a lot and also Carla Williams and both great representatives of the University of Virginia and more importantly glad to see that the University of Virginia on the Forefront of advancement and diversity Joseph with a pretty play kissing that one off the glass Miami steming the tide a little bit there 149 Virginia in a quick moving first half now early in the contest Miami seeing kesan George 68 freshman have to leave with an ankle injury but he is back on the bench now so thats a very promising start Murray lost it and got it back Beakmans going to drive it off the glass but no and another one of the Miami freshman in the game Paul J as Bley Joseph turns it over and that has been a problem for the Hurricanes all season long its the Music turnovers Joseph with the foul Jim Lena Music you know back in the day as an assistant coach this was Jim Lena looking very 1981 in that shot coach Paige also and Terry Holland on the bench the great Ralph Samson and my Coach Jeff Jones joining out the five RJ Davis and number three North Carolina hosting PJ Hall and Clemson thats followed by Texas Tech taking on number 13 Baylor both games are they on ESPN and the app huge game for Clemson North Carolina beat them earlier this year at Clemson and after that loss on Saturday at home vers Virginia Clemson finds themsel now two games under 500 in ACC play they are still regarded to be a NCAA tournament team however they got to start putting some wins together to keep that resume up you know PJ Hall is looking hard at that tape that game tape against Carolina the first go round trying to figure out how to get through Armando Bott who just shut him down well I can tell you what Jordan Miner had did a little bit of the same he was four for 16 from the field against Virginia on Saturday so hes got a couple game tapes to go back and look at 14 to9 Virginia Miamis made one of their last nine so looking for a hot hand Joseph can be that guy he was in the second half on Saturday packed on the Baseline trying to spin free shot clock down to four and switched in by nadir always seems to be around for the rescue for Miami yeah hes got that ability to be able to shoot the ball from the perimeter and thats one of the things that makes him so dangerous of course hes a monster when he gets the basketball in the paint 11 double doubles for the Miami star threepoint game Miner will swing it beakman back to him going in strong but no maybe a little too much momentum Jes had a number of opportunities right around the basket that they havent been able to finish in the paint going to be a violation its going to be an offensive foul nor shadir catching it as a shot clock goes down seeing the shot clock and then of course just trying to cool it off a little bit on the way back down may not want to cool off the shooting hand in this game though this is one where you might want to try to keep it hot because its been a struggle for both teams offensively Virginia shooting a blazing 333 while Miamis only 313 there not been a shooting Clinic Joe Bay picked up his first foul moments ago for Miami MCD slamming on the brakes heres Murray another guy who can hit a threepointer shot clock at three mcne yes with the shot clock winding down a twopointer and smart play by mcney to get to the midrange and use that size to be able to shoot over the top of a smaller Defender and Bley Joseph make nearly more than just a threepoint shooter long range and that clangs out it was in the cylinder for Nigel Pac but would not drop for him not much is for the Hurricanes after a pretty quick start with the feet and a slam by gun emphatic Slam by Ryan dun and a timeout Miami Music Isaac mcne knocking down the midrange bucket on the last possession for Virginia and it wasnt a smaller opponent it was actually a bigger guy Paul Jo B who was guarding him on that but you see mcney the concentration even as hes fading away keeps those shoulders square eyes on the Target and knocks it down making it look so easy and leading the ACC in threepoint percentage 47 he was 6 for8 against Syracuse he went 6 for9 against Georgia Tech thats a guy who can really get heated up and he is really the reason why theyve been better on the road because youre going to get the production from Ree beakman and Ryan dun on the road but when when when Isaac McNeely starts to show up on the road and makes big plays like he did at Clemson thats when you can win when You got three guys you can depend on to give you offense meanwhile Miami once again looking for consistency Joseph blocked by Dunn the top guy in the conference the outlet for Dunn on the other side will lay it in talk about end to end spectacular dunk and then he converts 9 ft Applause later and that gets him going inside John Paul Jones Arena the swing for Cleveland Matthew Cleveland looking for somebody to make a cut hes denied on the Baseline and throws it away right to mcney so the vaed Virginia Defense number two in the country is doing its work here and they able to do it off of the post trap on that possession and thats one of the ways that Tony Benn team has always forced turnovers and we talked about Miami and their turnover issues throughout this season Virginia tried to score on a second turnover in a rope shot clock inside five and the scoop shot by beatman just kept on going and nobody stopped him and four straight points off turnovers for Virginia the Ryan gun layup and now Reese beakman finishing at The Rim allows them to double up Miami 221 and an eight sip run here for the whoos Joseph handing off for the point guard pack off to Joseph theres that trap once again omir working hard to getting close on Buchanan to rejects it another SWAT for Virginia Pigman finds him man open its Murray sticking it from threepoint L another timeout Miami now Virginia doing a masterful job of turning defense into offense and they open it up Music 251 something the game started the game is started 322 remaining here in the first half in Virginia with a big time run here 234 hes suffocating him his right thats exactly what theyve been doing defensively to Miami popler to the Lane scoop wont drop omir tipped it got it back himself now well get a second effort crosscourt heres Poler and swishes in a threepointer they desperately needed absolutely needed that wle popper who really was a leading score for Miami throughout the nonconference avering over 17 points a game his production has not been the same in ACC play but hes dealt with the ankle injuries as well another guy who can really stick it beyond that threepoint line at 45 they may need a lot of those in the second half turned over here Miami comes away heres Cleveland into the paint strong cant finish it well how about Virginia getting back defensively multiple guys going to block the shot but yet no one from Miami Crossing half court and getting there to come up with offensive rebound when the shot blockers went after well you got Blake Buchanan at 611 The Freshman converging on the ball and Ryan Dunn who plays like hes 611 hes 68 but man can he get up and block shots pakman shot clock to two and thats going to be block Cleveland get out there to play some defense and here comes poppler with it for Miami they need a late run here before the half in a bad Applause way pack will stop pop and around and out it goes one and done Nigel pack has unlimited range he can shoot it from there but when things arent going well for you those are ones where maybe you want to get a little closer to the threepoint line and get a better shot on that possession yeah he takes more threes than any of the Hurricanes McNeely driving it and itll go down with that Shooters touch yeah soft couch by mcney going over the outstretched hand of omir and thats the thing when youre playing against Miami you can have your opportunities in the paint for as great as omir is hes not much of a rim protector approaching one minute to go before the break n shadir drawing a lot of attention Joseph shot clock to six slithers that pass to omir hell kick it back for pack shot clock down to one and switched in by wuga popper very important backto back baskets for wug POA knocking down two threes and now its a 10point game for Miami if they can get a stop on this possession and they score on the other end it can be some positive momentum going into halftime oh when you can figure out the personality of this Miami team this season let everybody know because theyre really all over the map Bean will draw the foul Cleveland didnt think so with 247 on the game clock and that was with nine on the shot clock so two shots coming Jim Lena an assistant coach here at Virginia under Terry Holland from 1979 to 1986 he has gone on as a head coach to win 740 games great to see an Holland wife of late great Terry Holland here earlier today she actually came and spent some time with Coach L and his wife Liz B number two drops that one in 297 and Miami to set up for final shot before halftime now Joe pack calling out the play and whistle with 98 only the third team foul for Virginia in the half so no one in foul trouble Virginia won the fewest fouling teams in the country nothing new there trying to bottle up the point guard pack and it comes free an opportunity for beakman to get a shot away right before the half did get it up there in time but it wont drop but Virginia with a re defensively and doing the job and as Tony Ben Bennett always says continuing to do the right thing pays off so underway in the second half heres pack with it Miami looking for a really hot hand in the second 20 the jumper on the way around and out by popper and kicked around Miami will get it back now they did have an outstanding half after trailing by nine on Saturday at home against Virginia Tech yeah they scored 56 points in the second half of that game and shot 55 in the second half but off to a tough start once again here against this Virginia Defense even though they got two opportunities with the offensive rebound mcney will catch fire and its in and out beond the threepoint line where he makes almost 50 nor Chad oir got hits and hes trying to Blink it away here and a whistle line a foul inside the opening minute of the second half and a Miami star having some trouble with the vision right now nor Chad omir omir just going for a rebound as Jordan Miner comes in the follow through afterwards incidental contact Im not sure if it was Ryan Dunn on the reach in that got omir but hes going to stay Applause in I think he can shake that one off RO with the foul for Virginia as Miami inbounds four strong to the Lane he hooks it but short coming in averaging 18 points 10 rebounds a game and if they are going to come back they have to do it with him number 15 but thats what Virginias been able to do theyve been able to guard a post presence oneonone with Jordan Miner in comparison to having to double when Miners not in the Applause game M be back for dun Quick Pass for Miner and its a small thing OB but I would love to see Ryan Dunn be aggressive instead of giving the basketball up so easily try to score now pack a bit too much of the whing dervish and threw that one away but in comparison to what Virginia has done Miami unable to take advantage of the turnovers to the dismay of Jim Lena you say well its 297 its not that serious a deficit but it feels like against Virginia thats 20 yeah with once they get you down its difficult to get back in because they stretch out every possession as long as they possibly can they use the majority of this 30se second shot clock and then end up getting a good bucket a easy bucket like that for Rees Beacon nice adjustment there to B that one in and now 3117 right away Jim Ls team in a danger Applause zone Joseph nothing there sealed off in the lane omir threw that one away picked off by dun that defense remains just watertight but Miami not helping themselves the turnovers and really plays that arent there trying to make those plays Jim Lena talked to his team about that at shoot around this morning and talk to them about rehearsing mental mistakes and weve seen that a lot here here to start this second half already multiple turnovers for the Hurricanes how about this 3 minutes into the second half and Miami averaging 80 points a game theyve get 17 and finally get their first basket of the second half but it took them three minutes to score on this Virginia Defense in the second half of this game and it takes wapa making a individual play to get it Applause done 319 18 and mcney for beakman once again inside for Miner this time he will make the shot and he could be a tough body to move Jordan Miner averaging nine points and seven rebounds over the last seven games in which he has started this now his eighth game and hes really been the turnaround for Virginia in this season giving them that physical post presence lets go to Angel gray hey guys I asked coach L niga how he could in his offense he said listen their defense is very good but we are passively attacking it we need an aggression that leads to intelligence not aggressiveness that leads to a bad shot so thats the happy medium of where theyre trying to find in the second half angel and Coach L told us earlier today what his quote was yesterday and it talked about playing against the pack line where you had to dribble less and shoot more threes but I know he wanted to make more of those threes as well Lena upset getting frustrated going back and forth with John gapy there shot clock down to three now down to one will they get the shot in the air and a violation a shot clock violation for Miami Jim Lena told us earlier today as he watched his team I thought going into to dickis house and hanging out with him and watching you know sweet 16 was a big deal I didnt know he was giving away a Porsche now see thats a completely different level of uh a different raffle that I want to be involved in right there yeah Ro on the drive will scoop it up and lay it in the sophomore from Milwaukee bolstering that lead for the Cavaliers hey guys I just want you to know court is pora pora I mean you do have nice things I just want you to have nicer things if youre going to put your name in the Hat for the raffle I want you to get the the Porsche angel from someone whos owned about 10 Porsches I think I can call him whatever I want touche my friend a block by D hes come up with a couple in the accs leader in that category and roie will bring it back out for mcney and set it up Virginia really putting a hammer on Miami tonight Miami has all of 19 points more than 5 minutes into the second half beakman swishes it in from threepoint Lup and I dont know if theres a more difficult team in America to come back on than Virginia especially playing in this building when theyre at home the crowd is on their side its a white out and Rees beakman knocking down the three ball everything for Virginia has been comfortable Miami have not been a great defensive team this year OB and theyre putting up zero resistance against Virginia when they have the basketball but Virginia is still stingy on the defensive end its been a difficult and frustrating year for Jim Len theres no question about it coming off a final four and the Magical runs that hes had next Monday the Cavaliers highlighting ACC Network mens basketball a double dip Virginia taking on pit right here and John Paul Jones Arena at s Eastern and Boston College hosting Louisville theres done with the slam up and over everybody and another timeout Miami the Cavaliers are rolling again at Applause Music home my sleep number smart B so smart it makes me better than Jamar Jim Lena can barely stand to watch as his team turns it over again you see the reaction from coach L because he knows whats going to happen on the other end its ree beakman to Ryan dun another highlight so much so that Jim Lena actually didnt even enter the Huddle for his team after the timeout he allowed them to talk it over themselves because Im not sure theres much else coach El can say and what can Miami do and on the verge of turning it over again nearly did and in fact they will so everything coming off the rails for larena it was hard not to notice that and Jim was like you know what Im just going to walk away because I may say something that Im going to regret and he went and sat down all by himself he went sat down and he actually was looking at the laptop one of his assistants was showing him a play as the team was on the floor trying to talk it out amongst themselves but youre right I think coach L didnt want to say the wrong thing so he just had nothing to say at that point hes been around a while the longest 10year coach in college basketball now after Cliff Ellis retired coach Els been on the sideline longer than any coach mcy will knock back another pair of points to make it 429 turning into a runaway here for the Cavaliers again trying to make it 23 consecutive home wins its the longest current home court winning streak in college basketball and Obie right now Miami in danger of some type of futility record when you they only have 19 points with just over 13 minutes left to go in this game only 19 points MC open from three but no the way he hits threes thats like a lamp for him 47 beyond the threepoint line downstairs and the Slam by Nord Chad oir but just not enough of that tonight for the kanes not by a long shot well the kanes now have to find a way to just some stops on the defensive end to see if they can turn it into the points Jim Lenas told us earlier today how his offense his teams offense affects them on the defensive end and if they can see it go through the basket itll help but right now they cant stop pren Blake buan and the Freshman leans in for two at 611 Cavaliers trying to go to 13 and0 this season at home a swing for nor Chad oir pounding it and lost it and commits a foul out of Applause frustration so here was the Huddle moments ago and theres coach L Jim arenda by himself like I dont want any part of whats going on in that huddle right now well and in all honesty at this point what is happening with his team coaching cant fix careless turnovers guyss not being connected we watch Jim lener we know hes one of the best doing this he talked to his team about dribbling less passing more moving cutting and they have done the absolute opposite of that against this Virginia Defense the reason now why they have 11 turnovers Miami with 11 turnovers or fewer as 110 this season however they have turned it over much more than that and Im sure thats not going to be their last for the game well it worked on Saturday in the second half they were tremendous and that ones going to Rattle home by Grove hes only hitting 50 from three theres a different story on Saturday against Virginia Tech he told them stop dribbling and they did and stopped turning it over its not been the case in this one as Joseph lets fly hell hit Applause it but again just 23 points up there for a Miami team that can really score and now Miami going to go Zone defensively to see if thatll work for Virginia try to slow them down a little bit but once Virginia gets hot especially in this building its hard to cool them off Groves that rattles in and out omir with the save on the Baseline its going to get tougher to for Miami as far as that schedule is concerned theyll be hosting North Carolina next Saturday theyve got Duke on February 21 they go to Carolina for the second game on February 26th omir up top but too strong and this is the point of the game where Virginia uses shot clock with this lead theyll move the basketball around and use about 20 to 25 seconds of the shot clock which often times make it so difficult to come back against Virginia when you dont get as many possessions throws again nice touch there for the 69 grad out of spok can Washington but Obi look at it when Gro shoots that basketball theres 9 seconds left on the shot clock which means Reen used 21 seconds of game time and also scores two points extending that lead heres poppler to let fly but cant connect Dante Harris the junior native of Washington DC missed a bunch of games with an ankle injury but hes a guy that can help them offensively quite a bit if hes 100 Miami now going away from the Zone matching up manto Applause man only played zone for a couple of possessions so Virginia was able to get good looks Pat flips it up hell draw the foul 951 on the clock 4923 Virginia in the Tony Bennett era 113 and2 when allowing 50 or fewer points that means theyve left 115 teams not get the 50 amazing to break into Tony benad era thats 15 years now Virginia Virginia 113 wins two losses when allowing 50 or fewer points and we were like who are the two yeah exactly not remember one game where Wisconsin and Virginia both scored under 50 Wisconsin was able to win that game but Angel gray when you look at this stat there have been in 14 plus Seasons as Tony Bennett has been the head coach at Virginia 115 games where they have not allowed an opponent to score 50 points Angel gray whats your math on that how many games is that per year okay lets see here um I would say about what is that 9 10 it was close it was actually 76 but well get we round it up and give it to you because theyre not always 15 season but angel can you imagine playing in a game and your team not giving up 50 points that many times yes like I think thats the culture and one of the things that I loved reading about Tony Bennett and how he was establishing what that really looked like at the beginning of the Season he said they had to learn what it was going to take to play at this level and I had to learn how to coach them hes getting everything out of them on the defensive end Miner cant get that one to fall but again going deep into the shot clock 4925 Applause Virginia so Wisconsin and Virginia Tech were the two teams that actually won those games out of those 115 air ball by jobay and itll stay on this end with seven on the shot clock 2012 I have to think back and see was Seth Green ber still on the sidelines at Virginia Tech to win one of those games Seth Greenberg was also at Virginias assistant coach alongside Jim Lara and that great staff under Terry Holland that we showed earlier outside for popper got to get a shot in the air underneath one and the shot clock finally got it up there the defense continues to have a strangle hold on Miami Virginia 9 and4 against Miami all time in Charlottesville 72 in this Arena at jpj lowest point total in ACC game from Miami 40 points back in 2014 and it was at Virginia 2014 was the turnaround year that was the year Virginia won the ACC tournament for the first time since 1976 when the gentleman down to our right Wally Walker LED Virginia to their first ever ACC Applause tournament and that was the year year that truly got things changed around in Charlottesville for Tony Bennett with Joe Harris akill Mitchell as the Patriarchs of this program pack pulls up and Pops that clangs away and a tough rebound there by omir and hell draw the foul too so hes at the line looking for a threepoint play and still not 30 points yet from Miami with 8 minutes left in the game and nor Chad at the line 79 coming up next on ESPN round one of this season flower Showdown under Dickinson number four Kansas they square off against cam Carter and K State that is coming up right after this one which has moved right along Virginia games 102 because they commit so few fouls they just dont turn it over under nine turnovers a game for the Cavaliers yeah 87 with is second nationally so and when you play against this Virginia team because they dont turn it over they dont foul much when you think about it theyre tough to beat anyway its simply about whether they make shots and they have made shots after that tough start one for n from the field theyve made shots in this game yeah terrific recovery early in the game for the whos batted Away by Harris that should not be underestimated theres my guy theres wonderful Wally Walker alongside the legendary an Holland wife of the greatest Terry Holland both here checking out a big night for Music Virginia Dre wish the womens basketball matchup of the night between two ACC schools coming up Thursday 600 Eastern on ESPN and the app number 12 Notre Dame battling number 15 Louisville again that is Thursday meanwhile here at Virginia it is all Cavaliers Wom womens basketball in the ACC is absolutely loaded youve got ranked teams all up and down the conference and shout out to the Virginia Cavaliers womens basketball program pulling off a huge win here at home over North Carolina a week or so ago in front of many of the alumni that came back to check it out well theres a huge matchup coming up next Sunday Yukon at South Carolina for South Carolina undefeated speaking of UVA alum n angel I know you got something to say about that you told me I couldnt talk about the Raptors here unless I mentioned be in that game Dawn Staley that is a a a great Legend but Im just letting you know womens basketball is definitely on the rise I know that everyones watching Caitlyn Clark and how she gets to be number one in points but the womens game in the Acca they have the most ranked teams in the country well thats a great stat 5127 here Virginia floating inside Cleveland got the pass up there its going to be laid in naoko the 610 freshman for two Jim Lara going to his bench a little bit here with about 6 minutes to go why not well and also working on his pressure but you got to be able to score to set up your pressure and thats been the problem for Miami still only 29 Points in this game oh we I believe we had North Shadow Mir scoring 30 plus last time we saw Miami wow how about mcne down on the seat of his pants to keep it alive and pman will draw the foul but they got that opportunity because of the 64 sophomore Isaac mcney who had gone down and watch this to tip it and keep it alive but youre talking about a guy whos a knockdown shooter this a smart basketball play knowing that he tips it back one of his guyss is going to be back there to pick it up reys beakman picking it up getting to the free throw throw line and Isaac mcne had a chance to talk with Isaac pregame want to introduce him to one of the great Virginia alums Charles rocken who like Isaac mcney from poker West Virginia and went to Poker High School in OB what do you think the nickname of the poker high school team is I would say it was uh not the lobsters what is it its the poka dots the polka dots I love that I love that keep it simple keep it simple not too much thought went into that but it works Watson into the game Christian Watson getting some minutes here its a very short bench though from Miami thats for sure whistle and a foul of 538 to go not getting a lot of help there just 12 bench points and that ranks 343rd out of 351 and you consider the fact that Bley Joseph whos now coming off the bench was a starter for the majority of the Season until kesan George got into the starting lineup because of injuries so the Ben is even Slimmer when youve got George unable to play only 3 minutes in this game and turning that Applause ankle played just four minutes a little less than that before the ankle injury that really disappointed a bunch of NBA teams and their travel offices because they sent their Scout year 21 Scouts a lot of them to see that kid yeah he is really priority number one Ryan Dunn also a potential first rounder if he decides to come out this season but kesan George was the guy that the majority of the scouts were here to see they were lined up along the sidelines to watch him warm up earlier today only did see 3 minutes of playing time young man 68 from Switzerland with such a high basketball IQ you can tell the coaches adore him abs abolutely do Jim lener was beaming talking about him and shoot around popper off Target a second effort will be up and in by Music noo a freshman from Toronto 5432 is 32 points for Miami early on Miami was playing very clean basketball they were making shots but it didnt last very long here Canon he likes that shot doesnt he and hes starting to get a little confidence going Jordan Miner has helped take the pressure off of Blake Buchanan who started seven games for Virginia now coming off the bench and seems a lot more relaxed as of late in this role Watson for Joseph Buchanan out to help guard him OKO denied and a foul here Canon one of those who went up to go for the block along with dun whos number one in the the conference in that category and those two have combined on a couple of spectacular denials tonight and that will send aoko to the line he help Canada to a third place finish in the FEA under 18 Americana Music Championship so the kids are on the edges of their seats because everybody gets bacon if in the second half the opponent here misses two consecutive free Applause throws and its bacon time ah the worlds a better place bacon for everybody I was told including the announced team oh absolutely just yanan with a Fall Away knocked around controlled Again by Virginia heres Groves Buchanan trying to keep that alive and hell commit the foul 341 to go in a game that has breezed along and all Virginia since about 5 minutes into the game on top Music 5632 remember base big night if Kansas State wants to shot Kansas yeah a couple things they got to focus on one is they need a 20 plus Point performance out of him he has four of them on the season theyve also got to cut down their turnovers hes had some issues as of late last time he had a 20point performance they won theyve lost four straights since back to Obi Cory and angel thank you very much well Jim Lara has been down this road a few times in his career not that often when he won 740 games and taken two different schools to the final four but you can tell hes deeply disappointed tonight his team has struggled so mightily to score not the first team that can say that coming into Virginia our ESPN NBA Wednesday double dip coming your way in Philly Stephen the Warriors playing the fourth game of a fivegame road trip taking on the Sixers at 730 then its out to LA the Clippers and the Pelicans NBA Countdown tipping off tonight at 700 eastern time Virginia in search of their 18th win of the Season trying to go to 9 and three in the ACC and we were talking about Tony Bennetts Office before the game and we asked him are you sneaking up on people a little bit well I think the CH time to get Virginia is gone and its one of those things to where Virginia has has had such a rain over the ACC over the past 10 seasons that when you get a chance to beat Virginia you better take advantage of it and I think that that time has passed because with Jordan Miner in the starting lineup Dante Harris back and tame Murray in the rotation this has been a different team when you consider the last eight games now and the defense is starting to come around to what the standards of Virginia are and theres been real Improvement here over the course of the Season getting better and better shot clock at 10 here from Miami AJ Casey into the game one of the subs again getting minutes here in second Applause half shot clock down the one and the block 5634 Virginia Bond going over the top buan into the paint again give him two more and we came on talking and Angel mentioned the nine newcomers for Virginia you see five of those newcomers on the floor right now and this is you know some this is part of their future for Virginia Elijah geru getting minutes as well as Leon vond and Blake Buchanan so Tony Bennett using these minutes wisely trying to develop some confidence and build even more of a bench as this season goes Applause along Applause Harris will run some more clock as we approach two minutes to go total command here for the Cavaliers Gert with a pullup pop that wont drop so kicking off our big Monday the Cavaliers a very impressive performance at home tonight theyve just been unbelievable here inside this Arena John Paul Jones Arena about to go to 23 consecutive wins the longest home court winning streak in college basketball currently but OB as we put this in perspective Miami right now with 34 points Miami averages 81 points per game so to be in a scenario where they may not score 40 under half of their average Im sure thats not something anyone would a pitcher coming into this game oh absolutely Miami coming off an impressive second half themselves the other day against V Tech as they came from nine down at the break to win but for Jim Lena completely different story tonight at one point it got so bad he just walked away from the Huddle and sat down and I understand completely because that is no theres nothing you can say at that Music point so 11 11 to go and Joe Bay the 67 freshman from France at the line its only appeared in seven or eight games this season for Miami you Canon will step off is this double Bon on Im not sure thats allowed do you get two were not going to find out here Virginia getting Bryce Walker and Tristan how into the game rice Walker is a manager for the team and getting a uniform this year for Tony Applause Music Applause Bennett Jo Bay on the drive sling and will draw the foul and he heads to the line so Miami to drop to 15 and8 and 6 and six in the ACC as we take a look now at our Capital One rewarding performance Rees beakman right in the thick at things from the getgo tonight as always just recently scored his 1000th career point he also came into this game eight steals short of a new Virginia record for Steels and Reese with 16 points seven assists in this game four rebounds and as you mentioned has the opportunity to become the alltime Steels leader at the University of Virginia and its important that he does it in four years Obie there will be no asteris if he gets it done in four SE our Capital One rewarding performance from reys Music Applause beakman so Virginia just 38 seconds away from going to 13 and0 at home this season Herre down the lane flipped it up after losing it and laid it in so the bench guys going to make the highlight reel tonight for Virginia I be that was about to be a highlight because Elijah gerw may be the best athlete on the floor and he was ready to launch on that possession somehow recovered just 38 points for Miami tonight averaging 81 points a game and yet did not get to 40 against Virginia who locked them up as they do so many on this floor six
