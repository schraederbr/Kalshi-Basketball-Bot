Patriot League and ACC and the tip goes to the Panthers Demarcus Miner with the basketball Miner finds Witherspoon and gets it inside to Corin Corin very similar size You see the battle back and forth turnaround jumper is good Corin leading this team in field goal percentage I like Pit giving him the ball early Every shots a good shot to him If youre shooting 66 every time he touches it its a good shot Good defense out front on Jaden Williams Basketball over to Spadone Good look down low and the shot not finished Ball loose on the floor Knocked out of bounds Will be Bucknell basketball Beijak with the miss We see Coran He had to work but was able to get that turnaround to go He had to work Thats working against a big body there kind of ran into a brick wall but was able to gather himself with the floater See Coran thats a battle were going to be watching all day long And theyre already going at it a little bit I like getting chippy early Both coming off losses They do not want to lose a backto back game Shield Spadone gives it up They try to get it down low and a steal by Corin Like K won that early battle is getting chippy Marco Miner general of this team Kick out in the corner Caleppa for three No good Rebound to Dorz Caleppa Yes hes hes a big you know hes technically a power starting power forward but he can hit that shot Hes very versatile You could sell that set that up perfectly for him in the corner Williams had a good give and go just needed a little contact to finish Did Biac the Bison their team they like to get things started down low as well They shoot the ball well from perimeter but they like to get everything started and predicated on getting good easy early baskets Threw it cheering 103rd career game here today Cummings with it Top of the key Two2 game early on Cummings will drive his floater goes Cummings had a injury battling some you know lower leg injuries early in the season Like to see him get back into his rhythm because he sure can score the basketball Working it in the perimeter getting the open three and the first threepoint attempt is good A shield from Spadone And those are type of shots you get when early on you know theyre throwing it inside Theyre running action to get easy layups early Sink the defense in and then you can hit them from perimeter after 54 Bison Witherspoon with it to seal up Ball knocked free but grabbed by the Panthers Kick out in the corner Little high for Cummings to get off a shot Kicks it in draws the defense Witherspoon fakes in the paint Caleppa Works down low and that one rolls out Good offensive rebound by Corhan and hes fouled as he tried to put it back Great offensive rebound Thats something Corin hes really great at has a nose for the basketball getting offensive rebounds But see here theyre swinging the ball And thats what happens a lot of times when you change sides of the basketball that quickly Its hard for the defense to react See Alipa down there trying to take advantage of a mismatch Corhin doing what he does best for the last three years Yes definitely Really doing a great job getting transfers in in this new era college basketball recruiting freshman really well Uh as you can see theres guy in the NBA named Bub Carrington He recruited recently He just does a great job recruiting and retooling every season And theyve got a top 10 recruiting class coming in for next year Williams And its one of those games where DeMarco Miner has a height advantage Its driving in as Dorz cant finish Ball off of Witherspoons hands out of bounds And the officials give it to the Orange That was a great job defensively by K You know sometimes its hard for the bigs to to guard full head of steam drives to the basket Did a great job walling up and forcing a tough shot So the Bison with the basketball 20 to shoot Its a 65 Panthers lead Both teams shooting two of four from the floor Bucknell trying to find Williams but good defense And eventually they inbound Spedone has it uses this very hard screen on Witherspoon but Witherspoon able to recover Work down low and offensive rebounds Panthers have their work cut out for them in the boards Beijak after the Doras miss Theyre really relentless getting the ball in down low Aman Doras not afraid of playing against the upper classman showing them that hey I got a big body too And Weatherspoon loses control of the basketball A turnover by the Panthers You see just working after the miss and Bak grabs the loose ball And that was great defense again by Corin but you got to secure the rebound If you force a tough shot his teammates have to come help him on the boards Josh Fulton is in for Bucknell And for the Panthers its Noas Indraitis Heric as Bucknell works it around the perimeter with 10 to shoot Williams pulls it back out Six on the shot clock Williams cut off Hes able to get it down low A foul and going to the line to shoot two is Gregor Burchich So puck now by Sim School Just another great recruiting class Jeff Cable does a great job you know building relationships with the players the parents the high school coaches He really knows how to him and his staff they know how to put together a great campaign to get players in Burchets makes the first and the second one is short And thats what hes doing this year Hes shooting 50 and made one of two Situs with the rebound for the Panthers Trailing by two now who can shoot the three Try to give and go with Cory Good active hands by Bucknell in the turnover Thats really been an issue for Pit uh this season Turnovers They have to limit those turnovers not give their opponents so many possessions Bucknell works it across the top and a steal from Cam Coran Brandon Cummings Kick it out to C Aleppo who drives hard to the lane He didnt want to get in there and take a charge on that full head of steam Caleppa just Im going to the rim Good strong drive Took him one dribble to get from the threepoint line to the basket to draw the foul Yeah BJ you got to get in there and try to take a charge Come on man And CPA makes the first free throw And heres a player for the Panthers that they need to get going as Barry Dunning Hes got all the physical tools Its just kind of getting that confidence getting that rhythm going See Aleppa misses the second and good positioning by Buck Nells Josh Fulton Alexander Pahutski against Indraitis and a drive down Hook shot right hand No good Ball is tipped out and Noas grabs it Another great job on the post defense from Corin Panthers trail by one working it down into Corin Heres the matchup against Dory as Corin Bounce pass it to Inditis Great pass Good little dime there from Corhin cheering Great back cut Good awareness seeing that his defender was helping on Cororehand He was able to cut back door Give a nice little basket Job incitis Jaden Williams 510 sophomore Bucknell makes everything run for them Gets it back and you see Cummings right out on him Blows by Tries to draw contact and make the hoop Didnt do either Or he drew contact but didnt get the foul Dunning with the rebound Here come the Panthers Up a point I was going to say Coran this year will shoot that three Geppea drives in Its caught in the air and its bailed out by Cummings 11 to shoot Good defense from Bucknell and a travel by Corin Good job getting the post down low He saw that their heads were turned As soon as the defenders heads turn you see Andraitis slashing in for the basket And you see the fan club growing here in Pittsburgh for Noasis Andreitis Right now its twoman band Lets see if the more threes he hits youre going to see that fan base grow a little bit Believe is the Lithuanian flag But a tight game 98 Panthers here with Bucknell Cree will check in at the next timeout Dor and back 10 to shoot in the corner Williams hands it off His three is pure Oh just a great action Good dribble handoff Shot clock was getting low but soon as they saw a good shot took advantage of it Great shot from Balooi Weve seen this game go back and forth early on 119 lead for Bucknell Andrew Situs uses a screen from Papakante and ball picked off and then the foul by Andrew Situs Again just another turnover unforced air leaving your feet on a pass Thats one thing you dont want to do Hes dribbling Im not sure what he saw but when youre making that pass you got to pass when you are on two feet Cant jump in the air to make those passes As you look at Looski coming off that screen in rhythm hitting that three Jacob Meechum is checked in Freshman from Pottstown Also in is Brandon McCree from the Bronx by way of the Hotchka School And Papacante grabs the rebound 119 Bucknell here first half in Pittsburgh Jeff Hthorn and Nick Rivers with you here at the Peterson Event Center cheering Barry Dunning Papa trying to get the hand off Does to Miner Nine on the shot clock Witherspoon thought about it Spin move in the lane Lefty shot and in Thats just a great move using his strong body feeling the momentum of the defender and spinning right off him for the basket And nearly got the steal on defense 11 all here early on Mechum Doras will shoot it from out there and now trying to establish position They got the two big men in there Burch travel cheering and applause A turnover for Bucknell in a competitive game here in Pittsburgh Its 110 all the time ever beating a number 10 team till they face Kansas and later would beat a number one seed in the NCA tournament Kante with 11 to shoot 11 all game here in the first half Witherspoon give and go to Conte Kante kicks it out Three in the corner Demarco Miner DeMarco Miner Great shot in rhythm Thats one thing hes done this year is improve on his shooting Talked to coach Cable at Shootaround He mentioned at Oregon State he was shooting under 30 from threepointer This year hes shooting a lot higher Thats because hes taking better shots A deep three No good First three miss of the game for Bucknell McCree hustling after the rebound And the ball knocked out of Minerss hand Actually a foul called against Meechum Its a great play Screen and roll action Good job by Papakante feeling that there was help behind him and knowing that his partner was right behind him Hit the three Panthers up three Bucknell now two of four from three Panthers one of two Dunning Jr Panthers work it around the top now to Conte Kante spins gives it back Kind of feel like thats Witherspoons next step is to take that three but he gives it up to Miner and Kante goes to the floor and a foul on Bucknell Its definitely his next step And you can see Bucknell going into the zone defense Theyre challenging They want Pit to shoot threes They want him to shoot from the perimeter They havent been shooting that well this year from the perimeter Thats what theyre trying to do Witherspoon needs to hit open shots and take them And Quinn Burgerer picks up the foul He just entered the game See him aggressively on Witherspoon who tries to drive baseline spins and lays it up and in That that spin move is nasty isnt it Second time hes used that move to get an easy bucket on the he wasnt working with a lot of extra room on that baseline Up now looks for an answer Theres the handoff Williams his floater from near the foul line No good And its Miner coming down with the rebound Panthers on a 70 run This is a big possession here on a 70 run if they can stretch this lead out Dunning drives the lane and scores Barry Dunning aggressive and a timeout called by Bucknell Jeff you said it earlier Dunning somebody He was at South Alabama He was a standout allconerence player If he can get rolling Pit will win this Maybe sometimes hes too nice Well he wasnt nice here Well great move here Great screen by K first and foremost but he needs to get more aggressive Hes used to being a leader team at South Alabama He was the leader He was the main guy Sometimes its hard when youre on a new team Roles kind of get redefined He needs to believe in himself and stay aggressive because he has the game in him They work it around over back to Williams cheering and on the shot clock and ball loses Burgers hand and picked up by Witherspoon and the three makes it a 120 run and Barry Dunning Jr right on Q Hes getting in rhythm If he stays aggressive watch him get hot He can He can score in double figures very quickly Doras loses control of it And heres Dunning again Dunning a euro step doesnt fall Tips the offensive rebound No good Ball grab by Bucknell Pit bench would have erupted if he finished that bucket Three straight buckets Waiting for him to have a breakout game Seems like hes right on the cusp Williams with a deep three no good And rebound to Papakante Pitch just doing a great job defensively forcing them to take tough shots that they dont normally take Usually Bucknell is a team that run that read and react offense and wait to take a good shot but there arent any good shots with this wall of pit defenders Corin now sees the size advantage Turnaround jumper No good Good defense by Burger McCree with the rebound Now they work it down low and the ball is on the floor and a battle for the loose ball The arrow goes to Bucknell job swinging the basketball Like Mark Jackson used to say hands down mans down Great shot by Dunning Hes getting excited You mentioned that confidence Maybe this that little stretch will give it something hes been looking for Bucknell looking to end a 120 pit run And they lobb it inside and Dorz is fouled by Caleppa Thats what Bucknell has to do They have to continue getting Doriaz involved Theyre just they really intertwine in the history of college basketball The Hornets head coach played cheering there In fact was in that game here and had one of the assists on a three by Griffin as a free throw is no good Charles Lee of the Hornets Of course Jay Wrights played in this building quite a few times Some spirited matchups back in the Big East days between those two schools Second free throw is good as there is Jay Wright with John Griffin He was there supporting his alma mater Uh however he was also there He coached at Hofra as well He coached Speedy Claxton at Hofster right there So supporting it So he wasnt rooting youre saying Yeah Yeah he he was right down the middle He was right down the middle Panthers trying to keep that offense going Three on the shot clock Miner drives the lane but has it knocked away Good defensive stand by Bucknell in that possession Jaden Williams Cree has it Kicks it in the corner Open three Rolls in for Beijak Thats one way Bucknell can get back into this game Pit theyre turning the ball over at a pretty high rate If they can take advantage of some of those turnovers and get buckets they can cut into this lead Ripak shoots it from 36 from out there Despite being 69 Papa oh nice spin move by Pope He just didnt finish McCree ends up with the rebound I think Papa was surprised how good that move worked Kind of lost his footing Overshot the shot And good drive by McCree His runner is good And a timeout now for Jeff Cable Jeff Cable will take a 30 second timeout Bucknell now lo before K Grease had eight points against Delaware this year as Panthers have it We see some fullcourt presser pressure by Bucknell Mari Witherspoon setting the offense to Cummings Panthers havent scored in nearly three minutes Dunning down low Cam Coran dribble Dunning spot on Three is good Dunning is two for two from three Dunning turned the microwave on Hes starting to heat up a little bit elevated right over him for a jump shot That was a confident shot Yes he wanted the ball in that scenario which we havent seen a lot of from Pit this year Williams just outside the foul line That thing was going to bring rain Bodies go to the floor and the Panthers come away with the basketball Witherspoon Hes going to drive and he was going to kick it to Caleppa but was fouled by McCree Korn doing a great job down low drawing to kicking Recognizing in that zone you know if theyre overhelping somebodys going to be open Why not give it to your shooter Eight points for Dunning Panthers lead by seven Inbounding the basketball inside to Cummings Cummings decides to set up the offense Now Witherspoon given go to Corin who gives it up to C Aleppo The ball knocked free and it will be pit basketball So you saw Corin like tap his chest Is that one pass too many Nick One pass too many and maybe rushed the pass He maybe could have gathered himself down low shot faked and then made the pass balance Witherspoon Witherspoon drives into the middle is righthanded shot Jeff Cable wanted goalending A block called and nothing changed Its 2417 still Bak gives it up as we see Beijak or excuse me Spadon get it back He misses the three Its been a little cold streak now for Bucknell Bison shooting 33 overall The Panthers 53 Whats keeping the Bison in this game are the Panthers turnovers Nice tear drop from Corin there I think theyre starting to figure this zone out a little bit Off the feed from Witherspoon Lead up to nine and looking to get it was Burchich and a turnover Cummings lays it up and in He He was surveying what was behind him Yeah he heard a freight train coming behind him He didnt want to get it blocked like Willis did the possession before And Burch 610 235 Bahooki looking to use the screen instead will go left side and is able to get a shot over Cummings and Cummings fouls him So Cummings getting it done defensively and turns it into offense Hes been doing a great job all season upping the ball pressure I know last year thats kind of something Cable tasked him with to increase his defense pressure That was a bang bang play there If it was revealable I dont know Id have to see a couple more looks at that That was tie go to the runner there and free throws no good Jeff pleaded his case Marco Miner is back in Josh Fulton is in for Bak Alexander Pahutski 65 sophomore from Ontario cheering Bahutki had a game in high school that he hit 14 threes a game And I mean you could tell by the way hes coming off some of these screens confidently shooting You tell he has that that unconscious switch 14 threes Thats a lot of threes Thats a lot of threes Some teams dont do that for a month And an offensive foul called on DeMarco Miner as Mechum was right in his grill and he pushed off a little bit Its a 10point Panthers lead He has what a problem he could cause at this level as well Bucknell trying to cut into a 10point Panther lead Pahutski comes free misses a shot and a foul on Corin pushing off on Burch One more till the bonus Jeff Cable knows out the defense Now the inbound play nearly stolen off the head of Fulton was able to get it back and work it down low But good recovery defense by Caleppa and he was not only able to knock it free but knock it free off Bucknell And pitch is doing a great job Theres no clear window in the for any of the passes Every single pass this entire possession was contested and tough So you think he had he fell down had to come all that way back Good hustle by the freshman Miner Good double team by Bucknell Corin has it though And his little fiveoot runner is good He loves that little floater Anytime hes within 7 ft of the basket you got to say thats going to be a high percentage shot of it going in Ski drives in Notices he has a height advantage Hes going to turn around and score on Brandon Cummings He took him down to the post I dont think Ive seen a guard take somebody from the post from the threepoint line First field goal in three and a half minutes for Bucknell The lead is 10 for Pit Brandon Cummings with 17 to shoot still Coran has it and just couldnt hold that pivot foot and turns it over And look at the guard here go down low Feeling the mismatch saying Oh you feel a little light buddy Let me shoot it right over you Over coming Yeah thats just trusting the guys you recruited have high basketball IQ There is that structure You know if youre looking at their offense it kind of looks like everythings a set play but everythings read and react and high basketball IQ And good hook shot no good foul And you saw a lot of movement as Doriaz will go to the line Pits doing a great job on Doria So far this game every shot seems to be really forced But one way to get Dorius into the game is by bailing him out with fouls Great action there Little curl screen in motion Draw the foul Foul on Dunning His first What do you know He admitted it Rare We should keep that highlight reel of guys that admit they commit a foul And the first free throw is good 611 freshman from Germany Need very much every single inch of that 611 big body Both free throws go down for Ammon Dory Panthers lead cut to eight as we approach the twominute mark here in the first half Dunning has eight points in this first half gets it back is not going to hesitate misses this time but Papa Keante grabs the rebound Dunning again hits it this time They call that two for a dollar When youre feeling it youre feeling it Love the confident right in motion shot Shooter shoot Doesnt matter what happened the last time If youre a true shooter youre going to keep putting it up Ski to Williams Theyre trying to find Dor down low He is battling to find position now has it top of the key on Dunning A corner three from Beijak is no good and a rebound to Coren 123 to play Pit up 11 Bucknell just really needs a stop right now They got to stop the bleeding Cam Coran no good A good look though And we have seen Corh hit that shot this year Corhan two of three from three not two of four Hes all over the place right now Plows and boom Okay thats the charge I wanted to see earlier Thats the guys in the court side That is a great charge technique Just wondering why they didnt have popcorn Brandon McCree averaging four and a half points nearly two and a half rebounds a game And rolls out Kante comes down with the rebound One minute in the half wither spoon with it Excuse me Dunning with it to Miner 15 to shoot Kante was going to come out and set a screen Got it Got it over to Dunning Barry Dunning Jr Best night as a Panther by far And with no hesitation when youre hot youre hot Feeling it Elevates right over him Didnt even matter if it was contested screaming Now running some offense cutting baseline McCree open three Brandon McCree hits the three to cut the lead to 11 Panthers will hold for a final shot Great answer there for McCree Now Bucknell just needs one key stops to carry some momentum to the second half Witherspoon ISO Were down to 5 seconds Screen Witherspoon drives in loses control HIS FLOATER IS GOOD Omari Witherspoon Tough shot What a first possession I think it kind of can jumpst start their energy again and start cutting into this pit lead Marco Miner had a pair of assists A runner by Cummings Heres a friendly roll That was a soft touch I think it hit every single part of that rim Lead up to 15 for the Panthers But now looking to get something going They had Dorz as he has it knocked away by Witherspoon He couldnt save it Cummings using that momentum Saw the defenders foot was high Cant close out recklessly against Cummings Hes a relentless slasher Has the presence of mind to stop and pop it Gentle kiss through the net And Bucknell will finally inbound As McCree was trying to grab it it was knocked out of bounds by Cummings and the inbound to Spedone He gives it up Now looking for someone to kind of get going And a foul called on Caleeppao Yeah I dont think that was Cppas fault I think she was just a bigger man in that one Post defense trying to get that early position and I mean he was just hes just stronger Inbounds here Ruit has it Open three from the corner No good And Miner comes away with it Third rebound from Miner Zeppa drives in and kicks it Witherspoon Open three Amari Witherspoon The rims have been kind at that end of the court Looks like the ocean on that end of the court throwing a ball into the ocean Multiple Pit players right now starting to feel it Williams drives in and kicks wide open three And that where as kind as the rims are at one end they are mean at the other And Dor goes down and a foul on Corin It was definitely a foul You know definitely thankless That was actually my first job as a young Did you really I was a referee I was an umpire Kind of our family trade My father did it My grandfather did it Got thrown into the fire early How was that It was fun Its my favorite job Ive ever had I love it Not a lot of people that would say that Yeah youre youre an ambassador to the game Dak kick over in the corner to Spadon as five on the clock and Caleeppo was able to get into the face of Dorz and he just couldnt get a shot off and you cant do what he tried to do Yeah I think he was trying to channel his inner Sam Young there but Sam Youngs just a little better Sam Young would keep his feet down and wouldnt travel You missed that at halftime Sam Young had one of the best shot fakes ever in the game And I dont think thats hyperbole as Cummings drove into the lane and was fouled I cant imagine like even at practice it was his patented move and uh Gilbert Brown whos one of the on the staff of Cable currently uh he had to suffer from that pump fake in practice He was he was always tasked with guarding him on that second team Sam Young guy who got him very commonly with that pump fake move First free throw good by Cummings The lead is 19 Sam Young a part of that Big East championship team Talk about pit history Of course Bucknells been to the NCAAs eight times and they are always a factor in the Patriot League and a foul on Spadone against Witherspoon And as you see 135 last year want to share the regular season title as the Panthers work it into the corner And they got some scores back They also have a player and youre talking about losing players as a foul down low You know when youre losing a player to Alabama from Bucknell and Im telling you what like thats a big loss Noah Williams ton of tight games They played in nine overtime games last year NCA record nine overtime games And thats battle tested Shows us a tough conference Theyre not scared of any challenge Much like West Virginia did to pit on Thursday The Panthers doing to Bucknell an 80 run here to start the second half after ending the first half on a good note And the lead is 21 Back door cut by McCree Beauty Great back door cut And thats really how Bucknell had success starting the game You know back door cutting taking advantage of Pit being overly aggressive They have to repeat that down the stretch here if they want to get back into this game Working that trap game up top Witherspoon backs it out with 15 to shoot Cors up Eight to shoot now for Witherspoon Number eight Kicks it Corner three in front of the pit bench Brandon Cummings That was just a great awareness and passing from Witherspoon there cheering He kind of he could have reverse layup it but very unselfish play Saw Cummings he didnt want the twopointer He wanted a threepointer It bec back cutting Soon as that defender gets that foot above you above the threepoint line you should automatically back cut And thats what he did there But again Witherspoon you saw the degree of difficulty He made that shot to end the half He could have reversed that and soft it up but three points is always better than two See Cummings looked down to make sure his feet were where they needed to be Style points And Caleppa grabs it Hes going to rise up for the righthanded flush Roman Sealeppa Might need to call in some guys and make sure that rim is aligned Thats a lot of force going through that rim And now hes slipped on the next play and picks up the foul Thats a full head of steam coming down You could hear the audible collapse of the rim See showing a little athleticism slamming it home Could just watch Posters are great You just dont want to be on one 5127 and Meechum has checked in He has the basketball Drives in Good kick and I think Kante got a piece of that shot by Burchich It will be Bucknell basketball 11 to shoot And that was another great pass and Burch just felt comfortable Thought nobodys behind him But Papa a known hustle player never giving up on the play Great block Dor gives it up Five to shoot Kick in the corner Dory is going to drive in Lefthanded runner No good Didnt hit rim Shot clock violation on Buck Nell It has been all Panthers here in the second half A 132 start for Pit led by number 13 with the vicious slam Theyve played against uh theres a different level here buddy And I I think hes good enough to to figure it out but those are things you have to go through as a freshman Little fullcourt mantoman from Bucknell Witherspoon gets it over to Cummings And Cummings is fouled as he got it back out to Witherspoon And the fouls going to be on Meech So no one in this game with more than two fouls except for Caleppa He has three He is not currently in the game For trying to spin into the lane and a foul called and that foul is on Spone Its number two You see John Griffin 24point lead here for the Panthers Cummings from the left side Front rim no good And a rebound to Burch and a optimum knock away right to Pahutski That was fortunate Meum drives into the lane and good interior pass but a better block by Papa Keante and the ball is knocked out of bounds It will be Bucknell basketball Burchett fighting for that position but good defense by Con This is definitely the best interior defense Pit has played so far this season really encouraging cuz the West Virginia game the interior defense seemed to be lacking So turning that weakness into a strength in just one game shows how you put the pedal to the meadow in practice and didnt let the last game affect your next game Bahootski slipped and the ball goes out of bounds Turnover by Bucknell Barry Dunning is back in the game A game high 14 points as Witherspoon able to lose Meech Give and go Dunning Dunnings not going to hesitate Barry Dunning off the bank When its your night its your night The bank is still open Dunning I knew it was coming off as soon as he came off that pinned down screen You could see it in his eyes that ball was going up Theres no chance he wasnt not shooting that Drive in the lane by Spadon He kicks it out Michechum is open from three This bank doesnt work for him Oh its closed for him And Situs cheering Kante gives it to Dunning Dunning Give and go to Conte Back to Dunning Why not Barry Dunning cheering Jr having a night here in Pittsburgh unconscious right now One of the best shooting performances weve seen in this gym probably since Blake Henson And the up and under just nothing falling right now for Bucknell Theyve had some good looks Just cant get it to drop Its an 110 run here Panthers outscoring Bucknell 192 in the second half Shot missed there and Bison come the other way Now if he would have made that threepointer this place would have absolutely erupted Spone down low and Burch drives and cant get that to drop either Its just long range short range nothing falling right now for Bucknell who is just one of nine in the second half and a foul called on Witherspoon Barry Dunning 20 points in this game Staying high and every shot just looks like its the same Its under control Hes elevating Seems like hes getting hit on these last couple threes I know the Bison are just deflated Even when we hit him hes making shots I think some of the greatest reactions in sports are bench reactions to teammates Autki in the corner No good Dunning grabs the rebound Watch with the heat check Minor cheering Papante 14 to shoot Gets back to Miner Trap coming and gets rid of it Selea Andrew Situs drives into the lane Up and good And the foul Indraitis wanted to get in on the party He wants a threepointer too but he wanted the oldfashioned way See if he can earn it at the charity strike And the Indraitus fan club up top here at the Peterson Event Center It has just been all pit here in the second half And free throw is good by the sophomore transfer from Iowa State Had 13 against YSU Did injure Situs has five here tonight Seea maybe got away with a little bit of a push Dory looking to get it to him Dory really working down low with Papa You got to love it the physicality and you said Papa didnt admit to a foul I dont think hes admitting to a foul I think hes admitting to something I dont know Its something else And quickly on Papa Keante theyre doing a shoe drive here on December 2nd Hes sending sho new shoes back to Africa because when he grew up it wasnt until he was a teenager that he had shoes and hes trying to help others out as Jaden Williams hits the three and a timeout for Buck Nell The Bison get a big three but the Panthers are in control 6030 is having himself a night 20 points Hes made it from three He started driving it inside He even had a banked three which is like when youre playing horse with somebody and you got S and he goes bank and you know its over But in live play those threepointers count and horse it music doesnt count when you dont call bank Barry Dunning 20 points a Panthers high for Dunning Averaged 15 points a game last year had 22 against Akran last season Hes getting close to that to Miner Papacante has yet to score The only Panther yet to score is Caleeppa Kicks out to Minor Nine still to shoot Good defense here from Bucknell A crossover by Andrew Sidus He loses control Miners got to stop and pop and everythings falling for the Panthers Everythings falling Yeah Been struggling from the threepoint line all season I think the lid just got blew off Multiple Panthers draining threes scoring at will trying to get something going And they look down low and see Aleppa And Doriaz has been going been going at it down low as Demarco Miner hits the three on the other end Yeah And hes a vocal spiritual leader of this team Its an experienced guard He wants to get in on the party too Great threepoint shot from Miner for Dorius cheering He makes the first Weve seen a lot of bodies on the ground Its not that Bucknell hasnt been physical Yeah theyre trying It seems like theyre running into some brick walls here being down 32 at the moment but theyre going to keep fighting to the end They got a long season ahead of them They understand the assignment Officiating crew taking a little time to discuss it with them Its been chippy all game I like that theyre both still playing hard They still care Bill cheering Coington Jr Clarence Armstrong and Isaac Barnett are the officials today And theres Moore the freshman And Morris is one of those energy guys Love to have him on your team Good to see him getting some experience out there definitely going to be a part of the future of this Pit Panthers program Keep developing him and find his role in this already pretty deep lineup Warhan just using his body to go inside Had it knocked free missed the shot Good defense by Ru Bishek Williams has only three points in this game See an off arm shove Witherspoon goes to the ground and Makk just couldnt control it and it goes out of bounds And turnover number 13 on Bucknell Its just one of those days Nothings really going right Everythings so difficult It really wears on you especially when youre playing the high volume the minutes that BGs been playing Its not their daytoday More Oh good move by Cummings who drives in Nothing called Shot missed Here comes Bucknell Spedone drives in Up and under No good Theyre letting him play They letting him play or the refs trying to get home early I dont know what Corhead the hand off to Moore We approach the halfway point of the second half Panthers in control have outscored Bucknell 257 in this half Cummings four to shoot High arching three That one goes in and out Spedone with the rebound Uses the screen and ball is knocked away Here comes Amari Witherspoon Witherspoon adding to the duck Hardy He scored on every single level so far this game Threepointers midrange jump shots tough takes to the basket and ball knocked free and bodies on the floor And man Dorz is going at it with Papa And then just a little talk between those two You saw it get a little out of control in the Pittsburgh Steelers Bengals game yesterday They wont want to see a cheering anything and look down low and a foul called on Corhen and tell you what Dory is for a true freshman Its a little chippy freshman Dorian saying Im not taking it Im not taking it cheering Panthers will play UCF on Thursday in Daytona Beach cheering Bucknell Oh yeah you just played pit Why dont you go play St Johns Yeah its not going to get any easier for the Bucknell Bison Head coach Jeff Cable working an effective screen on Bill Hobbrove right now calling the radio cheering as he has for oh just 52 years I believe Thats a legend Absolute Mari Moore Panthers up 31 Good opportunity here for Mo to potentially get some extended time here as a freshman A guy like Williams is just going to be in your face the whole time Ball knocked free and Witherspoon runs it down 10 to shoot Witherspoon crossover at the elbow A fader doesnt get the roll but will go to the free throw line He hit me See if I can do it twice Show him it wasnt luck Almost went in Got two Witherspoon with 11 points will get two Theres some disappointed kids Any Gen Z anybody 18 and under is upset at that free throw being missed right now Now did he miss that on purpose You know what He missed that on purpose Oh but this could nullify it And it does And Sinus 68 68 Maybe well start our own thing here The devastation kids faces all over America The devastation Hes going to put his shirt back on And and if you dont know this this 67 thing is a YouTube creation where kids just have their hands going up in the air and you know has many meanings Nobody knows what it is I think thats the joke though I think thats what it is Thats Yeah Tell them how you really feel Young Pit fans tell them how you really feel Nick we are blessed to work with an incredible staff and this team getting those shots for you We appreciate Jason and Tristan and everyone whos put this together Those kids are like All right Im ready for bed now Lets go Didnt get the six ruined And free throw is good for Meichum the freshman Mechums dad is a Pennsylvania PIAA referee As you mentioned your family doing a thankless job Good steal by McCree and a kick out Crossover quickly closed out on Mechum with 20 to shoot Drives the lane and I dont know if he was going up and under or passing Either way Inditis has the basketball He loves it to Caleppa That was a great pass I think Caleppa was surprised he had the vision to throw that pass or else he would have dunked it Good connection there for the two new Pit Panthers Cree behind the back and fades away No good Ball tipped and controlled by Barry Dunning Man its Barrys game today Everyone else is just a part of it 20 points for Dunning Corh runs it down and double dribble I I was wondering what they might call that Interus finds Caleppa with forcing them to try to make plays that they normally wouldnt Hands in the passing lanes like Mari Moore just cheering exhibited there Its really been a strong defensive effort All right For every time theres a free throw jinx just remember you jinx the steel almost to work perfectly Inbounds for Bucknell Just been a disastrous second half for the Bison Shooting just 13 Theyve had a couple of good looks amongst the Pit defense but just nothing has fallen They lob down low and trying to work every kind of move but cut off by Coren is Burchich Five to shoot Num stops pops from the baseline No good Coren grabs the rebound Number six Thats one of those boards where he wanted that stat He he wanted the rebound over Dunning for Andrew Sidus Andrew Sidus open He hits the three This one wont be as negatively received as the previous one Yeah its really just been threepoint shooting drills today for the Pit Panthers And the answer from Bucknells Jacob Mechum I have no doubt this Bucknell team is going to be a force in the Patriot League again this year Yeah they play hard from from tip to close Still playing hard still trying to run their sets and figure out their offense trying to figure out 22 and how to stop him Andrew Situs the turnaround No good Tip by Corin Tip by Corin Grabbed by Coren cheering And Corens fouled They used to joke about hit legend Sam Clancy that when he needed more rebounds he would just tap the ball to himself three or four times That was an example He wants that double double Going back up strong to secure the points Corin gets into double figures with the main free throw Coran averaging 148 Hes taken a big leap this year as last year was you know more of a secondary role some of the players had had but this year he he is the leader He is that guy Hes been the most consistent all season as Papante comes in that subs in for him Theres really no let off on the boards when Papakante gets in And you know with the situation with Sean Jackson Jackson out 611 someone they were counting on to be a force down low Its its really on Corhen and Kante to be big in the in the post this year for Pit Panthers bringing some pressure Mechum has it knocked away by Moore Moore as in Drew Situs Moore drives in takes it himself misses Caleppa Great steal Good strong take and its plays like that that can boost the confidence of a freshman I know hes going to be upset he didnt get that bucket but something to build on Maybe showed a little flash of what he can bring to the table to add to this great Pit defense And Dunning knocks it out of bounds 12 to shoot for Bucknell I just love the mindset Love the mindset of Pit Still staying in the passing lanes not letting off the gas Patrick OBrien has entered the game for the first time Junior from Virginia has the ball right now Dunning Spedone tries to create some room for a three In and out Ball is kicked right to Mari Moore Corner three Injured Situs no good And nice rebound by Pahutski And then Caleeppa fouled him And thatll do it for the freshman Fifth foul on See the freshman Mullen Watching him in practice like you can see it starting to hes starting to figure it out a little bit Mullen is definitely he has the whole package Hes got great footwork good touch feel around the rim big body Think if he keeps taking advantage of these opportunities he can be a good player to fortify this front court pit Ski with a couple of free throws as we get close to the fiveminute mark in this one Panthers kind of went on a run about eight minutes into the eight minutes left in the first half and then exploded to start the second half At the foul line is no good rebound to Williams Ski passes cheering up on the three with Dunning closing in on him applause and a foul down low and looks like Mullen picked up his first foul Everything will be a first for Kieran Mullen Do you remember those first Nick Remember a lot of those first A lot of those first A lot of its jitters But some of those plays sometimes can take the the pressure off when you show that hey these these guys arent as big as as they look Maybe I meant to be here And the second one no good as Papakante runs down the rebound And thats eight rebounds for Papa Kari Moro nice move down low and gets it to Mullen Talk about first Your first bucket being a a slam Way to be there Mullen And a quick three for Bucknell Andrew Situs grabs the miss from Visc Mullen wants it again Got to feed the man after that play Come on Its Its ridiculous Barry Dunning Jr For the first time in his career Jeff Cables going to have to tell him not to shoot Hes going to try to get his work in early I know he wants to get his alltime leading His alltime threepoint shots in one game is nine Hes at eight Theres the first miss of Mullens career Just wanted to get in on the party The Panthers have a big lead Stay together This is going to happen You might have a dip in the preseason but just make sure your teams ready by the time conference play starts The senior and first free throw is good Is now 13 of 13 from the line on the season Make that 14 of 14 Well see Almost perfect Didnt even hit rim You got to wait till it leaves his hand before you say it Krie Moore as you see what is Bucknell going to do Theyre going to pressure Theyre going to play hard to the end Burgerer gets the threepoint attempt and Dunning grabs the rebound So six rebounds on top of everything else hes done Again you like that from Bucknell And sometimes when youre down like this you can kind of use it as a as a practice Similate okay in your mind in the timeout say its a close game Act like its 0 or act like it youre down one you need to get a steal get a bucket can simulate those moments now that youre going to experience later in the season Rare miss from Dunning And working down low is Beijak and he is fouled by Dunning Its been four minutes since Bucknells had a field goal but they go back to the free throw line has eight siblings Wow Wow Its a lot of Christmas presents a lot of cards I mean like youre racing to eat cuz you dont want anybody else Yeah You must have got all the food growing to 69 You must have won a lot of those food battles See that trap Dunning Mullen Mullens just going to drive straight in Misses it Grabs his own rebound Ball knocked free Kante has it blocked by Dorius Mullen drove in there like a Cooper flag coming in to throw a dunk or that we saw earlier I love the confidence Moore creates some space and because he did that he picks up the offensive foul He really went for it all here This is one shining moment Im with you with the Hey lets just let these guys just let it rip Williams and down low Doras rightanded shot drops You see that Bucknell pressure post moves most of the game Those post moves he had those looks They were just going in and out or they were super contested Again that trap Andrew Situs is in trouble and foul Josh Fulton I believe is going to pick up the foul And again this is a good experience for the pit rotation as well Pit bench guys who dont get to play much you theres a lot you can learn from on that side of it too So when Pit gets to 80 points theyre normally pretty successful Yeah 80 is a key number for Pit When they score 80 points under Jeff Cable theyve been 50 and two 502 record when they score 80 points Situs misses the free throw Were under two minutes to play as Panthers will go to four and one on the season Foltons going to drive in and no good Dunning grabs the rebound Seven rebounds for Dunning Mullen thought for a second maybe hes just going to put his head down again and bull in Here he goes Kicks it out I thought he was going to pull up for three I know he pulled up earlier Situs is looking to get rid of it Gets the basketball back just inside the threepoint arc No good Dunning came flying in but couldnt grab him McCree the other way a twoonone Nice bounce pass to Fulton and Pucknell is you know finishing with a with a spurt here at the end of the game And thats good Thats something theyll take with them and theyre going to need it when they play 14th ranked St Johns A minute to play Moore has it cheering Mullen wants it down low A kick to Dunning Dunning for his eighth three No good Kante Baseline jumper is good First bucket for Kante Nice little baseline long range two from Kante And the assist from Dunning Maybe Cinderella turns to the pumpkin at midnight Williams give and go and and you are not going to see any quit in Dorius And the Panthers now can dribble this thing out cheering And Bucknell thought about the trap and John Griffin just said Lets let this clock expire Handshakes at half court Bucknells going to have
