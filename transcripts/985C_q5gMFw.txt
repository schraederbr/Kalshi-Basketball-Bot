will get things going pushing up one them early Ishmael Le to the hole and he travels on the way there good def defense by Bingington there I like the approach get out on the Freshman early yes he had a good game the last time around but we going to get right into him and see what hes made of starting five for the Bearcats simir Torrance taiu shinery Arman hered Dan pet cash and Tariq bigan first shot down and here come the Panthers trying to run in transition but held back by hered be his first person the length of the Panthers coming through thats their strength you think you got that little easy one dribble pullup no sir feder Rico feder Rico with the limp its that type of party around here these days feder Rico had his second career triple double on Monday against North Carolina t leget another Drive left hand this time no good rebound down to Torrance here come the Bearcats inside wide open hered he doesnt go up with it pit defense swallowed him up quickly torren working on Hinson a step back three this time and buries Music it simir torren to transfer from Syracuse spent two years with the orange the two years before that with Marquette experienced division one player in the power five heres Carrington back to back screens from feder Rico and theres Carrington and the Betty flies in his Zoo hes giving him a little lift too I like it little back and forth coming compete this is what you like to see out of your young your Young Buck Jeff cable told us that he was curious to see how Carrington would respond to the older length and physicality of the guards of Bingington this shot up by hered from the right side rebound down to Hinson panthers look to push again Hinson steps into this three he loves this shot no good this time so bub Carrington trying to pick up where he left off on Monday triple double this a good start Julius Ill tell you one thing you know he doesnt look like a freshman he looks very comfortable with his stroke but listen hes from Baltimore lets be clear he hes not hes not going to back down from anyone looks like taiu shinery liked what he had to say there early sportsmanship and competitiveness from these guys heres Le using his body to his Advantage cant finish again gets his own rebound out to Austin good ball fake and one dribble can hit Panthers looking active on the offensive glass heres Leed inside again still cant finish betterto Rico trying to put it down and a foul call Le cant buy himself a layup right now I mean hes getting there he has a composure great body control just cant get it to go through hes banging the one thing you have of respect is theyre getting the shots that theyre looking for he does not get the ball to go in hinston St with it just a little short but hes battling betterto Rico I mean you would like to see that one go but you like the aggressiveness from feder Rico there something that I know Jeff C and his staff wanted him to work on throughout this off season getting more comfortable offensively becoming more physical thats an sample of it there yeah he lives around that glass cleaning up for his guys just one out of two for feder Rico at the line Zoo trying to get loud simir torren controlling number 13 Chris Walker in green freshly into the contest Music down low here for balagan out to torren wants another three this time back iron Carrington three on two for the Panthers out wide here to Hinson looked like he wanted to throw it bodies hit the deck finally bingamon comes up with it is it a foul or a jump ball its going to be a tie up itll be Bingington basketball walking the sidelines for Binghamton is associate head coach Brian Johnson hes going to be the acting head coach tonight leville Sanders he stepped away from the program this week due to a family matter but Brian Johnson coached his team on Monday night and man did they come out and play hard on Monday against Northwestern yes sir they left for most of the game if it wasnt for some turnovers they were right there could have got stole a win at Northwestern steal by leot out in transition torren chasing leot finishes this time twopoint lead for the Panthers thats one thing they speak highly about leget is his defensive ability and what he brings to the table in regards to shutting the other team guards down good denial by auson here comes Carrington loses the ball in transition torren picking it up Panthers just two of eight from the field so far couple of turnovers as well down low for balagan Walker looking for balagan not there reversed into pet cash his first touch here in his hometown rebound down to the Applause Panthers B Carrington trying to go to work floater in the lane he head to the line here Julius double High screen with the one big roll another one popping Panthers just two of eight from the field so far but Ishmael leot looks active so far so body control out in transition ish Leed giving the Panthers a twopoint Music lead waa the new iPhone 15 with that amazing camera basketball program 18yearold freshman four starts top 100 recruit Julius I dont think anybody could have thought that in his debut hes going to put a triple double on the board you know and a great thing about it is he did it without forcing it its not like he was out there going for self or trying to get the rebounds he was just playing hard making the right basketball play if the shot was there he took the shot if his guy was open he made the right pass so he did it within offense and made it look effortless its the first triple double in division one in a debut by a freshman since 2001 that was Chris Thomas Notre Dame did that you could go for days and days about all the different you know historical references to whens the last time this this version of a triple double happen but regardless one of the things that I thought was so cool Julius is he was genuinely excited that his teammates were excited for him and thats what Jeff capable was most proud of absolutely you know the the bench was up and just as excited like you said just to cheer him on to get that um you know thats great when your teammates is rooting you on and are unselfish that way you know thats the makeup of the team thats going to go far in my opinion and thats to build on last season where this Panther team throughout the year came together with a lot of their older experienced players those guys are now gone but Carlton Carrington as a recruit watched them all last season and was keenly aware of the fact that these guys all got along hes already a part of it he just going to be bumps in the road hes a freshman still but you know hes going to fit in hell learn how to compete night in and night out its just the 2 second triple double in division one by a freshman in the last 15 years some of the other guys to do that Julius DAngelo Russell dearen Fox RJ Barrett just a few names throw him out there well that just means he going to get paid a lot of money if he keep it up its just one game lets all slow down thats what Jeff Cap says Ishmael Leed acrobatic finish the body strength hes strong getting to that basket composed with the Finish leg at the Rhode Island transfer was there for three seasons shinery working on Hinson here Lake Hinson quiet so far Walker deep three no good pit looking to push every time they get a rebound leot using the screen effectively the kick out Hinson stepping into a three cant find it hes getting the looks that he want theyll go down eventually we know hell keep shooting it Lish mayel Leed he looks like the most active guy on the floor right now regardless of him missing a couple layups and transition his upper body strength and just ability to get creative its amazing its a great element for this team to have being that they have so many bigs that can clean up if he miss that shot he might as well to stay you know keep the pedal to the mdle keep forcing the issue Jeff cable told us Julius that Le it reminds him of some of the old pit guards really competitive really physical great body control you know something about that for sure for sure mean I mean I think thats just basketball hes coming from the A10 I think a real underrated conference in regards to how they play their style of play he a very physical league so I think he fits in perfectly career highs in points rebounds assists Steals and threepointers last season at URI shot a really low percentage but Jeff cable said it you know that didnt worry us cuz with that team he had to shoot a lot here if he has some more Talent around him he doesnt have to necessarily do that he can facilitate a little bit more its going to part like the Red Sea for him who you going to help off of cant help off of hon thats for sure heres Jaylen low number 15 in white another freshman young guy for this pit panther team more of a true point guard maybe more so than Applause Carrington Leed wants a deep shot this time and buries it thats three three for Ishmael Applause legett composed I mean all the way around even low coming in he doesnt play he plays with a confidence like hes been here before and hes only a freshman so active Hands by GMO Diaz Graham and the Panthers coming the other way this time low is fouled by Evan Ash a freshman out of Charlotte North Applause Carolina yeah you go underneath the screen hes a veteran player he he know how to make you pay you going to have to fight hge do something but going underneath is not the answer thought the foot might have been on the line there well see if it gets reviewed later on but regardless right now ishma le with seven points three of seven from the field three rebounds already Blake Hinson another deep shot ront iron that time thats a contested three there Julius tough shot trying to get it going I think the easy thing to do is just to go to the basket he tried hell get it going no need to be pressed inside now fouled on the way up is Nehemiah Benson hes going to head to the line its a good dish inside for Applause Benson Benson at 10 points on Monday against Northwestern on four or five shooting ended up fouling out in that game after 17 Applause minutes well hes definitely going to have to be Applause active tonight giving up some inch inches Leed will sit down bu Carrington Jorge Diaz Ram stepping in Zack Austin will also head to the bench for the Panthers so coach cable going to the line up with both the freshman at the same time early why not right theyre going to have to grow up fast yes sir get prepared for ACC Play No spoon feeding over here huh Benson misses both now low is getting challenged out here by Evan Ash reverse now to Carrington Hinson they want to get him going a deep three and it rolls out torren deep pass up top to shiny he has to save it and were out and running once again hard foul at Mid cour by Walker got to stop momentum somehow there though its a good foul to take turn it over on one in prevent the you know easy look thats not something that they do a lot in a college game use those fouls the way that they do in the NBA well you only get five theyre a little bit more valuable shorter game its also a shorter game I mean come on I mean thats a smarter thats a smart foul in that instance for sure just his first personal and the way that Pits been pushing the ball you kind of want to see when theyre in a in a half court set Julius so far fit hasnt been able to really find anything taking a lot of deep shots looking to get Henson going he looks a little pressed a little anxious bring in will Jefferson Sid Hinson down here give him a breather as we approach the Under 12 media Diaz Graham nice strong offensive rebound by Will Jefferson the footb its a good sign for the Panthers Jeffers is back thats what what he do we dont have to call a play for him hell get the rebounds hell play solid defense very active and athletic second triple of the ball game for simir Torrance Carrington wants to answer cant do it foul on the floor Panthers by five here starting to find a stroke a little bit in this game Rufus hat legs threepointer from that segment there whether its foot was on the line think we questioned when it happened whether it was or not they reviewed it youll get a look here in a second they did end up making it a twopoint shot for Ishmael legot so now he has six points and the Panthers lead is down to four so for bingamon its their second consecutive power five game in about 5 days here they played Northwestern on the the road on Monday LED for over 22 minutes in that game Julius and they LED for by as many as 11 points in that game they just couldnt sustain that effort in the second half coach Brian Johnson told us he he thinks they might have got a little tired their effort kind of waned as the game went on you know that fatigue lead to turnovers and thats exactly what happened but you know playing these power five teams on the road is only going to help them they were pick fourth in their conference to finish and I think you know having those game having these games is going to do nothing but help them grow maybe they can finish up there in the top two they were within four points a couple of minutes remaining in that game hared played 40 minutes in that game torren played 40 minutes in that game Brian Johns told us we cant do that all the time and we were already seeing hes going deeper into his rotation tonight well somebodys going to have to show up other than sary torren cuz right now hes carrying it Torrance with eight points so far to lead bingamon heres a score by Benson heres the five leading scorers from the Northwestern game Five Guys in double figures shinery Torrance at the top of that couple of transfers into the program now just a twopoint game against the pit Panthers on the Applause Music road Jaylen low looking in the lane lobs it up here for GMA ball reversal Carrington Just Three on the shot clock and theyre going to call foul Carrington to the line strong penetration get to the basket solid defense by bingamon hes just putting on the floor making something happen getting late in the shot clock got to go in there like a man carington misses the front end you can already tell Julius is from the first 9 Minutes of this game that Bons half cour defense much more aggressive much more physical than North Carolina and the Panthers kind of dealt with that so easily on Monday this is a little bit of a different speed right now oh for sure you know theyre taking advantage of having that experience against Carrington and you know you can tell that they wanted to get right into him you know we know that you had a night young fell but this is were not going to just lay down this is college basketball we going to get into youre going to have to show us that you can do it again and its always different when you play a game like that and you end up at the top of the scouting report for for sure thats another thing being prepped he was probably right at the Music top Carrington now with four points on the night jge Diaz Graham will head to the bench Zack Austin back in Ishmael leot has reentered as well just an aant pass from pet cash nobody was home now le lobbing it up here for Austin Austin very athletic just couldnt hold on to that one thats what we were talking about earlier thats like when I lob lob up something for you and you finish it they were trying to do the same thing could it didnt the same thing but just not with the efficiency that you and I can do well see if that continues through the rest of the game or not and pek cash Walker leaning at the Timeline able to save it 10 on the shot clock for the Bearcats deep shot here for from Ash front rib Le it pet cash fighting for it now comes out to Carrington three on two for the Panthers to the corner Zack Austin for the Triple no good good eyes he was spotting up there for a minute he really wanted that one Panthers by three a step back from Carrington trains it little shake and bake for you Julius sir I see you smiling you like it sir with the counter you cut me off I could rewind on Applause you you know I think the freshman coming in so much more polished just because all of the games that they play every year in aou you know I said it before Im going keep saying it they dont look like freshman anymore leg it good footwork on the perimeter there driving carington step back yeah chandling has enter James Harden right there uh uh dance on him get his feet ready do you think buob Carrington can start saying I am a system like James no no no no you got a lot more work to put in but if he Hey listen keep it up and he will be a system just put it in his hands he hes not really making a lot of bad decisions whether its the shots that hes taking or finding open guy you even seen him slow it down one time when he felt like we should just run a play so I mean this is this guy is only 18 years old that were watching hes just going to continue to get better the thing that was amazing about Monday too is just how efficient he was 7 to 12 from the field its almost 60 four out of seven from downtown and he made every made the most of every opportunity that he had on Monday didnt force a thing Leed hits both ends of the one and one now Panthers by eight here with n and a half to go in the first torren strong Drive PTO Rico was up in the air now a kicked out and theres a three from Deep its Gavin Walsh a freshman out of Baltimore Maryland Brian Johnson already going deeper into his rotation tonight makes it a fivepoint game Zach Austin High Point transfer for three back iron feder Rico good hustle to get around round Walsh this one from Deep theres Hinson hes starting to wake up yes he is bingamon is going to have to get pet cash going in some way shape or form he hasnt even taken a shot yet shinery finds the front of the rim leg at a high dribble nice ball reversal to Carrington halfway down and back out now feder Rico going back up couldnt find the rim Torrance nobody picks him up into the lane now the kick out Walsh wants another triple finds Applause it fivepoint lead for pit got to find those Shooters in transition smart move by torren to get deep kick it Applause out Carrington wants another step back leot good offensive rebound driving all ball going the other way off his knee fivepoint game here Julius Gavin walls coming off the bench hitting a couple triples yeah you know hes getting open for his guys they getting the penetration what can you ask for we need somebody to pick us up they found the guy Music Splash we love our house its on a great block Treeline streets the neighbors are observant far and theyre missing a lot of easy bunnies down low due to that defensive contest from Bingington well it wasnt going to last forever you know Binghamton is a more experienced team t came in new head coach a lot of new players this team is a little more familiar with each other so defensively theyre going to have it together great play out of the timeout there Torrance feeding shinery for a layup threepoint ball game Panthers dominating right now on the boards they were plus 30 on Monday heres Hinson nice back down and finish over shiny that is a mismatch right there theyre going to have to figure out how to not let that happen again shinery on on Henson on the Block is just not going to work out torren onehanded pass revers into the corner shinery looking still into the post again for torren they like him down there tipped out by Leed Hinson starting to wake up yeah I dont know how this switch happened I dont know if they started out this way but no thats Mouse in the house right there its Blake Henson at 68 230 on shinery 66 195 deep into the back court Leed its like a deep pass in a football game cant finish it for the n one Music Applause yeah he thought that you was going to be able to easily throw it in the back court but leg it wasnt going for it and hes playing defense on his guy the entire way being physical with pet cash in the early going those two guys have mixed it up quite a bit leot trying to make pet cash have a difficult homecoming tonight I get the leading score for the Panthers with eight makes it nine filling the stat sheet already nine points five Applause rebounds its very tough offensively and Applause Music defensively zo a little quieted right now just a sevenpoint lead for pit reverse layup swatted Away by Austin came out of nowhere heres Walsh working on feder Rico turns it over leg it into the corner Hinson wants a triple gets it its a great sequence right there nice block by Austin 70 run over the last minute for leg could have forced that up there early he was patient and let it develop in transition to find Henson in the corner for that three his defense and his awareness in transition is off the chch torren trying to cut into the largest lead of the game cant do it good read of the screen by by Torrance now finding Leed in the middle Lefty finish starting to get it going biggest lead of the night and a 90 run for pit over the last minute Applause 44 now this guy here he has some Hops and hes just one of those guys 3D guy transition finding a guy you always know you can find Henson out there spotting up for the three Le it finishing it off n90 run for Music pit theres never been a better close start from the field for pit missing a lot of bunnies seems like they found their Rhythm here in the last couple minutes I think it started on the defensive end you know locking down getting the Ste getting blocks and getting out in transition finding their spots and being unselfish with the Applause basketball couldnt decide what he wanted to do there now hes fouled by feder Rico was is definitely giving him some some solid minutes with his activity but legot on pet cash you know I was saying pet cash has has to be more aggressive Leed is not is not letting this man breathe hes all over Applause him Torrance in the lane nice finish over Carrington torren looks composed and he should be a lot of D1 experience for Applause him first guy in the double figures for Bingington now lean continues his hot night 14 now for Ishmael lean strong move thats a grown man move right Applause there Torrance now leged again seems like every time time we look up leg it has the ball spin move and a dish to feder Rico oh razzled Dazzle from the Panthers thats an excellent finish excellent penetration good answer there from shinery quieting the crowd shinery with five now I think this onew punch with Carrington and Leed they just compliment the you know each other very well and add in Blake Henson while youre at it cant find a bucket there its amazing through two games it feels like we havent talked a ton about Blake Hinson heres pet cash his first shot attempt cant fall but Blake Hinson is is the best player on this team yes and was last year maybe unexpectedly but its amazing that through two games here were talking about the young guards more than were talking about Blake Henson well I think hes I mean hes doing what he does which is space the floor he hes attacking the basket its just Carrington is so pois and with coming off this pick and roll and making decisions to ball this in his hands a lot Henson with a drive and finishes in the long run is going to pay off a lot for Henson having these guys able to penetrate and shoot the basketball B Hinson now into double figures great cut there Arman Applause hered solid find from shinery 11point ball game is we nearing the three minute Mark here in the first half of the Peterson Event Center thanks for being with us Kevin wheeler and Julius paage with you tonight feder Rico cant hold on to that pass pass now torren hared has it knocked away heres Zack Austin in the open floor what does he do with it the twostep to the rim swatted by shinery but itll be a goal Music set 11point lead for bin Ishmael lean with 14 finding the big man this time put him in a spin cycle with the dish hes to little tap your head this for him on Monday he wasnt the guy that shined so brightly it was Carlton Carrington but tonight it seems like leg it night Julius yeah hes looking like the more experienced guy thats for sure you know defensively getting steals he has three of them and just getting out in transition being strong with the basketball either finishing at The Rim or finding his guys in open spots what do you like about his game specifically I think is you can tell the way that he come out here and hes addressing this guy hes bright in his guys face hes not letting him breathe and then hes just confident going to the basket he has that trip that every teams need that every team need from the gar position ball was loose pet cash comes up with it and wall shuffled his feet but youd expect that for M leget coming from a guy who last year averaged 16 points a game was the best player on his Rhode Island Squad he looks like a leader out there and hes composed doing it and its a great compliment to have when you have two freshman you know point guards coming in um we you know pit expect them to have a up and down season but this is a guy that you can you know almost bet that hell be a little more consistent feder Rico goes over the Applause Music back feder Rico now with two as we wind down here in the first half Here Comes guo Diaz Graham the twins had a solid game on on Monday Julius tonight a little bit quiet from those two yeah you know they was stretching the floor was able to shoot it get to the rim a little bit even defensively sliding their feet showing that they can play out on the wing it was Jorge who put up 14 on Monday night heres Ash able to bury it deep shot cuts it to Applause 10 got to get a stop on the other end for bingamon pit has hit seven of their last nine from the floor and now guo shuffles his Applause feet was a good Applause thought yo Diaz Graham Five Points on Monday five rebounds this is Brother Jorge that out shine him a little bit on Monday and last year was the other side of the corner where it was guo who kind of bursts onto the scene named this year to one of ESPNs top 12 potential breakout Applause players Walsh wants another three leg it down with a Applause rebound the crossover to the whole Lefty no good its a nice move though Little Tim Hardaway killer crossover right there and hes got 14 hes five of 11 and all six of his shots that hes missed have been in within 10 ft down there being contested yeah but hes staying Applause Music aggressive off of Diaz Graham looks like he took a knock there missing those shots is not making leg it shy at all hes continuing to attack you know whats interesting you see this a lot the way the games are officiated but the way that he attacks the basket with as much force and aggression as he does you almost think that hes not getting some of those foul calls because hes so body controlled if he looked a little bit more out of control maybe hed get another foul or two I dont think he want to bank on the referee making those calls oh for sure I wouldnt Bank on it I tell you that but he gives the illusion that hes not taking in and absorbing contact but he is MHM Carrington deep three he falls down heres pet cash down with the rebound Torrance running wants to find his running mate in pet cash a good find here to Walsh look at that up in under cant find it Leed deep pass here to GMO doesnt know what to do with it at first but he finishes with the left had to get his composure take his time everybody got a little ansy for a minute there 15 seconds to go in the first bingamon will hold for the last shot Brian Johnson tells him to go Torrance down low for Walsh on the left side Tapped Out Walker two to shoot goes up with it and it goes down cuts it to eight points good finish to the first half by bingamon much in the paint its been the guards that have been driving and getting in there just like leged is right now fade away for Henson he cans it first play right at the second half go ahead and get your guy going early the dude will shoot from literally anywhere anywhere unbelievable anywhere and you cant you cant be upset about it as a coach cuz he hits it at a 40 clip he definitely has the ability to get your team going whether its with his play or his personality shinery nice Baseline pass there cant find the bottom of the bucket was hared now Carrington pushing bub Carrington coming off a triple double on Monday got knocked off balance foul on the floor lean and Hinson little twoman game second relocate off the penetration Henson moving from the wing to the corner turn your head youre going to lose him nice out of bounds play Carrington in Rhythm there cant find it shinery looking up top hes going to challenge feder Rico its blocked Le it into the paint to the rim and hes fouled and the Panthers in transition on Monday were really effective you see a little bit of it there off the defensive player from feder the defense hes getting up there with two hands to contest that shot the ability to get up there and contest without fing his spectacular something that the pit Panthers havent had a lot of in the past heres a great move by Hinson there with the rip through and the step back drawing a foul Music Blake Hinson second Team all ACC in the preseason the line fundamental ball fake right there Julius I know you appreciate that 100 get the guy in there hes leaning in he reached down thats a veteran move right there first one goes down for Hinson now matching leggeds total with 14 to lead all scores Hinson quiet start but shooting 50 from the field three of seven Beyond The Applause Arc whats amazing about Blake Hinson we talked about what he was able to do bursting on the scene for Jeff cable last year Jeff cable told us you know hey theres going to be a different role for Blake Hinson this year his voice carries differently in that locker room and on the floor everybody looks to him now for that leadership or maybe last year they would look to a guy like Nelly Cummings or jamarius Burton its not that case anymore yeah he was the under radar guy that we didnt expect it from but from the first time I saw him right in the layup line in warmups you can tell that he had a personality with him that can definitely get the troops to to to follow his lead hson wants another finds it Blake Henson coming to life in the second half he hasnt a shot that he didnt like Hinson at 13 on Monday already with 18 now transition get it up before the defense get defense get back and set up I mean the two things you love about that is the ability to catch and shoot so quickly and its the elevation on the jump shot too where hes able to shoot over basically anybody batted around inside off the drive from AED now Benson good for Benson for two cuts it to 14 under 18 to go in the second half Applause go this pick and roll is going to be complicated B caring in and he has something to say after the shot and he picks up a tech and you see taiu shinery hes hes smiling over there they started at each other from the start tonight and heres a teachable moment here you like this right Zach Austin Ishmael leet coming over and saying all right all right young guy he may be getting a little carried away the first in the first half he did it you know its John the guys are competing but you know after every play you cant keep taunting the guy but you love to see the competition in a Competitive Edge on a young guy P cash gets the first free throw off the tech after having a triple double you know that theyre going to put their best guy who think that he can stop you hes going to come out here doing whatever he can to try to stop you and get into your head so when you make something happen you got to let him know I I love shinery just immediately smiling and looking over to the ref saying Hey do you hear that you hear what this guy say saying to me thats great stuff hey Ill take it for game number two of the Season you see some of that competitiveness coming out tonight so technical on Carrington lead cut to 14 now shin and Carrington matched up again Benson with a drive on feder Rico great cut there by Torrance lost it back up now swatted by Austin in transition go the Panthers three on two out to Henson chooses not to pull it to the rack and he finishes oh Blake Henson hes into the 20s now and the Panthers are alive the Oakland Zoo loves it and its a 16point lead after getting hot from three Henson decides to shot fake put it on the floor and finish at the basket defensively this is what you call a double block right here when two guys get a hand on it hence to getting the crowd into it were used to him getting shots off getting points rapidly in the second half whether its from the corner from the wing or putting it on the floor setting it up with the three the young fell is eating 10 points in the first half in 14 minutes of play 10 points in this second half in just three plus minutes of play looking very active its like he had some of that secret stuff in the locker room at halftime he he came out raring a go he been following Apex Dan is it Apex Man Dan on Tik Tok cant be talking about Dan pet cash right now yeah I dont think Dan pet cash is going to want to make a tick Tok about this game right now not at all Torrance no so now Hinson with his first 20point game of the year had nine of those last year and he keeps it going just battling to the rim that time its its just a lot of real estate that you have to cover because hes at least two big Steps From the threepoint line ready to catch and shoot and you have to guard him out there once he put it on the floor he has you have so much you know room that you have to try to cover its impossible wide open shot here for leit drains it great find from Carrington Ash to the rim nice strong move leg it now with 17 Hinson with 22 lets go lets go lets go lets go oh thats Mouse in the house right there you going have to double team that one Hinton to the line hit up 19 biggest lead of the ball game Le it continuing as a hot Music night why wait all month long hson to the line here to get us going again and you look at this Julius all of division one last year players with 15 or more points a game six or more rebounds a game and 95 or more total threepoint makes just Brandon Miller the number two pick in the NBA draft last year and that guy Blake Henson that is some great company some wonderful company for for your future you know Im showing that to every Scout I can find you know whats amazing about it too you know hints and tested the NBA draft Waters got some feedback they said he needed to change his body get a little bit more strong lose some weight and he did exactly that over the summer Jeff capable praised him for his commitment to doing exactly that and changing his body he looks a little bit more slender a little bit more active Henson is going to be okay he can also test the NBA I mean the NFL Waters if he wants to they might tell him a different story they might want him to beef up a little bit but Im sure he can do anything he puts his mind to hed be a great tight end absolutely maybe a Applause linebacker into the paint for feder Rico the rip through stepping to the right hand just couldnt get it off the Applause glass 21point lead now for Pit Walker no good foul on the floor here its going to be on Hinson so itll stay on this end hinsons first Applause personal its a lot of contact in there hes in the air referees catch it all pit with a heavy margin plus 16 on points in the paint 26 10 lot of perimeter jump shots coming from bingamon now its kind of suffocating inside with the length and the size of Applause pit Carrington and Hinson carington a step back Applause three what can you say its the right re coming off turning the corner countering hes playing solid D is not that hes not actually there just that kingon is stepping back and making a shot theres Ash with three the thing thats amazing about Carrington is how smooth he looks doing it its not like hes making any drastic movements like the the contrast of legot hard Cuts pivoting Carrington just looks like hes floating out there right now yeah this is why I like the two of them together oh Carrington back to back triples I dont think he lik that technical foul that was CAU on hes saying that I can just do it with my play okay he got the memo Carrington efficient again tonight 50 shooting now 15 for Carrington at 18 on Monday a solid D great counter step back take it and make it and then again just coming off the screen reading hes going underneath hi behind the screen he know he can make the shot knocking it down how do you feel about Carringtons shoes low tops the green they look comfortable more than anything I was looking at them in the pregame G it looked like you know its like some running shoes yeah they look like something that hes just comfortable wearing so you know some guys got to have the brand new ones I couldnt play in brand new shoes youre getting blisters off of that oh man yeah got to break him in Carrington look at that and one B Carrington unleashing some Fury in the second half the older guys grab him after that bucket three consecutive baskets for bub Carrington use his body to get to create some space on a step back its a good contest got him on the arm I didnt really see anything too dirty he might have got upset from shinery kind of getting underneath him there causing him to foul Applause Carrington converts the n one matches his total for Monday and he comes off the floor big hand from the Oakland Zoo for Carrington whats the teachable moment right there from Jeff cable I mean its if anything keep your composure but I think hes doing that I think hes just a little you know oh fiery right now and that will be to Ash wow just get going third triple of the night for Evan Ash Ash is trying to give him a puncher chance 24point Applause Music game Deo Diaz Graham has has it fouled by Walsh so three guys for the Panthers in double figures tonight Hinson coming to life here in the second half with 24 Carrington exploding here in the last couple minutes Leed carrying them through the first half and this is the type of balance that Jeff Cs got to look for sure you know what makes it hard to key in on one guy theyre all getting it efficiency efficiently thats its within the offense you got to love it that it doesnt look like any guy is trying to basically do it all himself its going to make the the game a lot easier for jeffris for Austin Diaz Graham Applause twins if Im Ash Im going keep shooting though hes the one guy that got it going either from three or going to the basket blocked by Diaz Applause Graham wash trying to get in there use his body but Diaz Graham has the length meeting him up Applause top walls trying to challenge Jeffs foul theres vorge Diaz Graham and will Jeff going up trying to meet Walsh at the Apex got to have much respect for Walsh to get a shot block and then go right back in there like a man and attack the basket oh man thats dont shy away thats a 26point lead foul right there cuz that that is all ball my Applause friend you got it in slowmo yeah youre right youre right cuz when I when I saw it it was like yeah he he got him he got him how about Walsh though coming in 11 minutes here didnt play at all on Monday six points couple of big threes but hes looked aggressive in his minutes making the most of his time trying to earn more I think he gave him a spark for sure Jaylen low into the ball game now just five minutes tonight with Carrington and legot cooking in the back court the way they are low hasnt had to do much misses the reverse layup deep Corner pass here that did not look Applause Music good what a surge from pit here in the second half theyve made eight of their last Music 10 five of the 30 for pit come from those two guys right right there Blake Henson and Bub Carrington theyve been amazing here in the first 10 minutes of this second half inside outside presence your freshman your senior leader I mean if they can keep this up its going to be trouble in the ACC and you add to that Ishmael legot who kind of controlled things for p in the first half and kept them afloat and hes got his fourth career double double with 17 and 10 tonight five assists to go along with it along with some Stellar defense on pet Applause cash unbelievable pass to hook Diaz Graham down low showing off the vision fourth assist for Carrington just more of the same for bub game number two of his division one career Ash again for three and pit doesnt look like they want to slow down at all they want to keep the effort up Jaylen low a corner three battling down low is jeffris itll stay with Applause pson Lo is getting good Applause looks this a nice find off the pick and roll head up whether is scoring it passing it the Poise down low for Torrance it rolls out to Carrington he slow it down this time Jeff Cap wants to run some offense what I was saying is low is getting the shots that I think he want hes getting good looks at the basket just want to see a couple fall for him from one twin to the other and he air mails it but it will stay on this end as Walker couldnt handle the air Applause ball its a good time with a lead like this to get Jaylen low some minutes didnt play much up until this second half here now its just six minutes on the game young freshman for Jeff Cable number 15 in white him and Carrington expected to play a big role on this team this year I think its been hard to actually get them minutes with the play of Lega and Carrington low to the rack foul on the floor but again hes getting to the basket hes hes creating open shots theyre just not falling for him or to the line or had 14 points on Monday career high was perfect from the field five of five from the floor three of three from three ball land and thats his first point tonight Bingington with three turn turnovers in the last two and a half minutes that gives him 13 on the game and 14 points off of those turnovers for pit Applause I know you talk about it all the time in defensive creating offense and I think as soon as pit started to turn it on you felt the energy obviously with some shots starting to fall but it started on this end with them perimeter defense sucking into the middle there in the lane making it difficult for bingamon to get in there and thats what Jeff C always held his hat hung his hat on excuse me as that defense defensive side starting with legged on the perimeter like you said but even if you get beat you have feder Rico feder Rico the DS gam twins even Austin to protect you if you get beat off the dribble so you can be really aggressive Hons back he goes to the hole cant get it to fall but hell go to the Applause line in a game like this Julius youre up 30 youre at home one of the big things that Jeff cable told us was that hey we we cannot listen to the hype of a 50point win from Monday we got to make sure we keep working how do you do that and maintain your focus here in a 30point game with 10 minutes to go I think it come from your senior leader you know I think just him not being satisfied with what they did last year wanting to do better and understanding that is games like this you have to continue to build because youre going to see better competition than what you have today in the ACC carington gets a hand as he goes off 18 points for him three rebounds four assists six of 11 shooting Hinson now with 25 Mak get 26 with a friendly roll 80 run in the last two and a half for pit you know its one thing to come out and actually be putting a better Talent on the floor but when you are going against competition that can pun back how are you going to weather the storm you know so its still a lot of things that you can tighten up even if youre up big blocked by low but I think hu might pick up the foul here yes he Applause does shiny knocks down the first this stuff ever bother you shooting free throws well if you look at at the statistics the answer would be yes because the teams that operate on stunk as a team shooting free throws I think on at home they get so quiet that was an annoing thing for me yeah its a little better when hes just noisy youre not the opposite of what youd think youd want quiet yeah yeah Focus its a lot worse when its quiet cuz then everybody hears it if it hits the Applause rib torren has it taken Away by Henson low in the open Applause floor now he has it taken away by pet cash good hustle on the floor now ped cash on the floor again itll stay on Bons end man you got to feel for Dan pet cash tonight coming back to Pittsburgh Pine Richland guy played on this floor in the whiel Championships its the second time hes played on this floor with Bingington had five points here as a freshman back in 2019 playing in front of family thats Bob pet cash head coach at Pine Richland wife his wife Kristen is here Stans mom brother Andrew is in the crowd as well tonight he won a patriot league title in 2020 hes a member of Boston Universitys basketball team and heres Dan pet Cash playing with Pine Richland right here on his floor yeah it could be a little you know stressful or tight you will get I remember playing against playing in front of my dad for the first time and I dont want to talk about it how many free throws did you miss that lets lets just say lets just say I understand damn pet pet cash I understand your pain well have to log on to his Tik Tok with 100000 followers after the game see if he has anything to say about it Applause Henson no good 26 for Applause Henson over the backboard for Walker Applause pitball coming into this one Brian Johnson told us that theres a lot of hype in Bingington around this team backtack years into semifinals in the America East tournament they expect to be better this year in their own conference increased win percentage each of the last couple of years under LVL Sanders they got some older guards here that I think you know the talent doesnt necessarily match in terms of bit but theres some pieces there and well talk about it more when we come back theres never been a that theyve been gaining over the last few years Julius under LEL Sanders and theyre excited about it Brian Johnson told us a story he said hey I was in CBS the other day I was wearing my Bingington shirt and I got people coming up to me saying hey go Bearcats they theres some following in Bingington and theyre excited about the talent they brought in this year Im familiar with that feeling you know the fans get real Rowdy once you start you know looking like youre improving and start getting some wins so you know Im happy before its an exciting time to be there especially to be there when you know youre part of the foundation of getting that getting a program turned around you know you wont be forgotten for a long time backto back appearances in the conference semifinals of course they bring in simir Torrance this year theyre excited about what he can bring to the team called him a magnet of positivity an experienced D1 player at Syracuse and Marquette before coming to Bingington they get Arman hered back of course time shinery looks good so in the aec they expect to Applause contend Stewart heads to the bench took a knock here looked like they collided a little bit on the dribble handoff oh yeah caught a shoulder there from pet cash oh hands up up Applause Music Ash catch shoot little Baseline drive and drag right there Ash has had a couple Big Shots tonight leading all the Bingington scorers with 13 now keep an eye on hered hes uh got four fouls right now low with a three ball front rim hared pushing the ball now Ash want it he was leading the charge there up the floor they pull it back into the half court now Applause Walker foul on the floor 30point ball game Blake Hinson has 26 points one shy of matching his career high and its so funny considering how the game started had 10 points in the first half in 14 minutes just exploded coming out of the locker room and thats the type of streaky shooting that he can he can supply and they his teammates feed off that energy especially in home games when you got the crowd to to to boot as well hes definitely a guy that can get it going getting subed out right now I wonder you think hes going to get the Im Im one Im come on Coach Im two one or two away hey they were all they were all so aware the other night of buck Carringtons triple double and how close he was you think theyre aware of him maybe getting a career high you know when it comes to your career high we can care less a triple double is a lot you know is much harder to accomplish well let you get that one but for this one well I got to tell you I think my career high was like four points so uh I dont know what that feels like I certainly know dont know anything about a triple Music double GMO step back feeds it to low wide open three here for Jaylen low still too strong so low cold from the field tonight 0 of six hared to the basket here and hes fouled so so pit has suddenly gone cold here oh for the last six from the field over the last 5 Applause minutes still very patient getting the shots that they want just not falling at the same time Binghamton getting the looks that theyre that theyre wanting and getting to the free throw Applause line Stewart working on that eye after taking the elbow from pet Music cash Max Sims will get a little time here late in the second half he comes on Stewart still getting worked on massud Stewart the sophomore from Philly now youd think Julius with six minutes to go Carrington and Henson probably done heres guo wow High arcing three for guo Diaz GR thats a true stretch four for you thats a sevenfooter with the ability to stretch the floor and theyre going to have to play that way if pit wants to go anywhere this year the twins are going to have to play a big role not just from a perimeter standpoint but inside as well defensively huge block from Austin theyre going to give him the basket Man Austin comes from the backside of the defense and has done that three or four times tonight he can definitely get up there and block hes very athletic out of nowhere and hes not the only one oh thats a tough one but in a game like this you give him the basket and hell trade it back here Zack Austin the high point transfer Big South honorable mention a year ago known as a high flyer very athletic Jeff capable thinks that hes going to be a big impact for them this year but wants him to kick some of his bad habits stop relying so much on his athet atticism and be a little bit more fundamental they say if you dont use it you lose it so well he can say whatever he wants jef C about not wanting the athleticism but then he makes plays like that from the weak side defense like all right Ill take Applause it yo from the top of the key Music again couple of triples in the last minute or so from guo with under five to go pitch trying to push to 100 once again they had 100 in their opener on Monday Applause night its the first time pit had 100 plus in a game since 2016 and the 48o win on Monday was the ninth largest margin of victory in pit history heres guo with his second triple penetrate draw Kick for the open three what are you going to do you have to pick your poison you have Diaz Graham twins that can shoot the three Henson that can shoot the three carington that can shoot the three Leed that can shoot the three I mean where are you going where you going to get your help Applause from pit at offensive school records last year in threepoint field goals three threepoint attempts they look to continue that this year 28point lead for pit here four and a half to go with the Applause Music peak well why dont you just take a seat are you kicking me out North Carolina 100 points shot 56 from the floor a lot of the same here tonight Julius despite the slow start yeah and it it doesnt come doesnt look as if you know the the pit team is is doing anything out of the ordinary theyre sharing the basketball theyre letting their Defense Force turnovers thats leading leading to easy points they you know I mean the most impressive thing is just that they look like theyre in Rhythm already know knowing exactly where each other Applause is okay huitt with a fake behind the back now he gets it back into the lane finishing is Michael hwit Jr Music pit shot 40 in the first half theyre up near 60 for the second Applause half huitt Jr just a ball of energy coming off the bench Michael huitt Jr wants to get in on the action

nit Florida and then whoever wins the Baylor Oregon State game so some challenging nonconference games coming up here Florida G Coast Julius gave Indiana a run for their money only losing by six the other night yes sir its about to get r real a few tuneup games and then its time to get serious time to get P get prepared for January when you roll right into conference Play Its No off nights how important do you think those early season tournaments are on on neutral courts to see what both teams really have on on both sides cuz you know you can have teams come in and you play on your home floor and youre comfortable when both teams are uncomfortable in neutral sight what does that do for teams I think its a true test to see where you really are you know obviously you know games like this is where youre basically rolling out the best talent so you should win this but against a quality opponent is early you get to see what you really need to work on and where you have to Applause improve low to the basket bat it around itll go the other way so Ill put you on the spot right now what does this pit team have to get better at in the next month you know right now they look like theyre clicking on all cylinders I dont I dont think they showed a real blemish and these two matchups that theyve had you know youre going to have ups and downs you know this a game of runs I think theyve been pretty solid maybe free throws last game they didnt shoot the the ball very well from the free throw line and today they did it much better so 76 tonight theyve improved in that area man I certainly didnt expect to hear As across the report card from you right here you got nothing we have to take into consideration also that you know um theyre rolling out you know a a team that I think a lot of a lot of teams are going to match up not too well with with three seven Footers for the most part sure I think defensively theyre really long Austin is really athletic they can switch its going to POS a problem against a lot of teams and you think about Carrington too the size that he has as a point guard at 65 Le it just so strong with the ball so many weapons right now youll see as they start to play tougher competition you dont know until you start to get into thick ofier schedule can especially young guys can they sustain that success throughout the course of the season and that was the question mark are the young guys going to be able to step in and and give quality minutes and have an impact on the game the depth you know we can see that the Diaz Grim twins you know put some size on theyre stronger theyre not biting the dust as much as they did last year so you know its a more confident and comfortable team hit with 87 points its a good number for them when they score more than 80 under Jeff cable theyre 25 and two since he got the job six years Music ago Sims too strong off the backboard under two minutes to play here at the peak hwit I love it now low low still cold from the field just one of eight now and the one came on a goal yes great point they didnt want to see they dont want him to see they dont want him to see it Go in Applause no air ball from the corner Jeff cels going to call a timeout here for Subs were going to bring in KJ Marshall and Von Applause Music Applause Stevenson KJ go KJ lets go KJ KJ Marshall the senior Jeff capable loves KJ Marshall theres a lot of team spirit in him and hes a leader regardless of the fact that he doesnt get a ton of minutes great pass underneath and its hwit everybody has an impact on the winning though in practice you need all of those guys to show up and be ready to play regardless of how much time theyre playing on game day so pit with 189 points through two games it looks like their offensive prowess that they were able to sustain from last year has carried over to this season at least through a couple of games but defensively tonight holding Bingington under 60 points holding North Carolina AT under 60 points thats probably something that Jeff cable would rather talk about for sure and I think it just come you know the the confidence and understanding that the front court has you know the length Diaz gaham have feder Rico Austin is a shot blocker even though hes not a sevenfooter hes still a shot blocker it allows you to play you know with more pressure on a perimeter so you know maybe the trip to Spain is helping them maybe they you know it look I mean seriously defensively this team look like you know they they know exactly where each other are going to be where the help is coming its a great point I mean he talked about it a lot with us it seemed to be very important for them as a whole to go to Spain and and do one of those trips together bring these guys together the culture that has been established from last year we asked him like how does that feel to see that its its still happening you know this culture that you fostered from last year and hes like its amazing that I dont have to really do anything like these guys have formed it themselves and you see some of the images from the summertime but its impressive the turnaround thats happened under ACC Coach of the Year Jeff cable yeah nothing but dinners together playing together practice together it doesnt get better than traveling the world with your teammates and spending all day its a great opportunity for you to jail and it look like you know its paying off and they genuinely like each other is what Jeff cable made sure he made a point to say is that these guys enjoy each other you know its not just theyre playing together you know off the floor they all hang out they enjoy each others company and that translate the winner do my brother have my Applause back inside dece for bingamon they hit Music 60 Pits going to dribble this out shot clock is off big hand from the Oakland Zoo and the faithful on hand man theyve seen a dis what a display of basketball in the first two games of the season for the Oakland Zoo here Jeff capable loved it love the energy on Monday and it carries through on this Friday night not a lot for the Panthers to complain about nothing that you can really pinpo on
