sixth meeting all time Clemson has won the last four in this series and Florida State will control the opening tip a SEALs team that lost on December 21st to NC State had two weeks off and they recalibrated couple of double digigit wins entering today and jir Watkins third leading score in the ACC gets it started as we look at starting lineups for Clemson CH Hunter has been on a tear 19 a game over his last six Ian shefflin is second in the ACC in rebounding behind Stanfords Maxim Reno and johonny Wiggins Brad Brown L says he is the exactor if he can raise his level of play it raises the ceiling for Clemson and Hunter answers Watkins and that was a big concern for Leonard Hamilton last night talking to him not only does Clemson throw the ball inside really well but they can really shoot it from the perimeter so you almost have to pick your poison on what youre going to try to defend you saw the starting lineups for Florida State Malik Yan coming off a 20 and 10 game a freshman faquin Davis had a careerhigh 10 assists last time out heres the big guy llin over Taylor Bowl Bowen and one thing that we have seen with Leonard Hamiltons teams they switch one through five so you got to find your match up at Clemson no question theres going to be a lot of onp purpose ball screens by Clemson to try to get the match up they want that time they saw that Victor lockin had the smaller guard on his back great job on the recognition and throwing it inside for the easy jump Hook off the glass B Bowen 16 points in the win against Miami on Saturday or on Wednesday using the shot fake shot clock at two and theres lockin with the rebound Florida State a team thats going to pick you up 94 ft the entire game make or Miss the second tallest team in the country so a lot of length they do a great job of disrupting and not letting you get into your offense sh with a size advantage on the 61 Davis down low instead Hunter lines up a three boy hes been sizzling 19 of his last 35 from downtown yeah Chase Hunter has been playing as well as anybody in the ACC and even though hes able to knock down that second three Brad Brown now a little frustrated right there his team not able to recognize the MIT match get the ball inside to sheflin but theres going to be a lot of possessions like that where its just going to become oneonone basketball you got to make a play against your man there is Davis freshman from West Baltimore now Watkins he and Hunter a little back and forth early they both have six pretty good display of shooting here from both sides to start this one and jir Watkins Chase Hunter both been playing well as of late and picking up right where they left off their last time out Watkins averaging almost 19 a Game Hunter averaging more than 17 a game SP my time inass Zachary along the Baseline out to shefflin that one way off did not hit the rim and Florida State will push Davis accelerates out of control Taylor B Bowen Watkins wants a scream now hes got a mismatch shot clock down to seven Yan with a feathery touch inside top Junior College prospect that was in the portal this off season yeah that was pretty good defense there by Clemson and johy Wiggins at 610 in his own right moved his feet pretty well just a better move sometimes beats better defense Zachary no lockin follow not there stays with it that was issue against Louisville Clemson struggled to finish at the rim and Victor lockin not going to get a much better look than that but nonetheless able to retain possession on the offensive rebound Hunter with Watkins all over him and we get a foul but we will step aside so far jir Watkins Chase Hunter little back and forth in the early going Music cus students having a lot of fun I saw snowmen being built lot of sleds out there a lot of the students though um figuring out how to sled maybe a bunch of firsttime sleders out there never seen snow before they did change one of Chase Hunter threes to A2 in the break his foot on the line so the score now 87 Florida State on Music top sheflin did not practice yesterday back spasms Zachary as it knocked out of bounds last touch Clemson Zachary the BC transfer sheins been now battling and monitoring that back most of the season its turned into a reliable piece the last two years weve got the two long youngest tenured head coaches in the ACC today Leonard Hamilton in season 23 Brad Brownell fresh off that Elite 8 in season 15 Yan again going hard to the rim and gets rewarded you know 10 years ago if you would have said that Leonard Hamilton and Brad Brownell would be the two most tenur coaches in the ACC Im not sure what what I would have believes you but Leonard Hamilton has done an unbelievable job during his time at Florida State and both of these schools historically obviously known as football schools but these coaches have done an amazing job building and sustaining these basketball programs just incredible to watch and and just two unbelievable coaches that year after year seem to have their teams playing at a high level come the end of the season and the challenge not just for these two but veteran head coaches everywhere is youve had success doing it one way for a long time and both of these coaches have been able to develop guys over the years Brad Brownell was more in the transfer market before it became a bigger thing but certainly Leonard Hamilton has now had to adjust you cant have guys on your team three four years but when you look at what brownells been able to do with this team a reason people are bullish on Clemson David is in so many ways theyre a unicorn in college basketball theyve got four guys on the team who play major minutes whove been on the team for three or more years you just dont see it any no you dont its the exception instead of the rule where five six seven years ago it was a complete opposite but guys like Chase Hunter Ian shefflin its been a huge reason why Clemson has been so good and has has had as much success as they have had last year just a couple of possessions away from going to the final four I mean an incredible Elite run because hes had guys that hes gotten here hes developed them hes retained them so a huge credit to Brad Brownell and his staff for keeping these guys together and hopefully having another great run in the NCAA tournament like they had a year ago foul was on locking his first Watkins with six poked Away by Zachary shot clock didnt reset clock at one Davis from half court and thats a shot clock violation I thought when I spoke to chase Hunter yesterday one of the most refreshing things he told me he said one of the reasons I came back was a chance to get this program to the final four for the first time you heard that all the time before you dont hear that anymore sixthe guy who spent his entire career with one program yeah like you said its literally unheard of this day and age and you know now everybody seems to be a little bit more concerned with what their nil numbers are going to look like instead of making a good run and getting to a final four so kudos to chase Hunter for having that quote unquote old school approach to the game Watkins near the Paw and that goes over the backboard jir Watkins entered the portal in the off season flirted with the NBA and then took part in the combine even worked out for a handful of teams in the feedback he got improve your outside shooting and improve your reads through screens and it was interesting talking to Leonard Hamilton last night about the progression of jir Watkins and he said obviously hes improved on the court significantly especially over the last month or so but his Improvement in the area of leadership has really been remarkable because this is such a new team with 10 new pieces were going to get an illegal screen here on Victor lockin because this team is so new and so many guys jir Watkins is one of the only returning veterans and so hes had to show a lot of leadership as we take a look here just a little double drag screen and Victor lockin just not getting his feet set trying to get out of the screen just a little bit too early but its really remarkable where Leonard hson said I didnt expect that have to be replaced in a team with 10 new guys but its almost become the Norman college basketball but to his credit and his staffs credit hes done a very good job with it this team seems to be trending in the direct Direction this time of year second foul on lockin looks like we may get another illegal screen on the cross screen going against Florida State there one on Florida its on Justin Thomas and again Justin Thomas the flip side of it hes on his fifth School in five years well traveled you know Clemsons a team offensively that has a lot of movement a lot of motion off the ball with their offensive sets but against a team like Florida State a great play there by James Zachary to get to steal on the rebound and lay it in but anytime you play against Florida state theyre just going to take you out of what you want to do you almost have to change your game plan but Clemson has done a pretty good job so far of handling that pressure and taking care of the basketball yeah you see Florida State theyll run 9 10 guys at you you and the only starter out there for the seminal he faces up over Wiggins forced it Swinton blocked at The Rim Yuan drops it in number one in the ACC and field goal percentage Im sure Leonard Hamilton when they watch the film will say youre not number one because of that shot you took on the Baseline right there but good job on the second effort staying with it and getting the easy put Music Applause back Hunter guarded by Justin Thomas using the shefflin screen he gets the switch picked up the dribble shot clock down to seven Wiggins down low shefflin kicks to Zachary they open three its good their way waiting on his threepoint shot to come around 40 plus last year below 30 entering play today and confidence is all thats about Brad Brownell said anytime youre open if you dont shoot the ball in practice youre going to have to run up and down the court under quick Sprints see a tough B the way there from Jerry D but Jaden Zachary its its shooting is is an amazing thing you see one Go in all of a sudden you may be Off to the Races but that was a great kick out that last time by Ian shefflin jayen Zachary able to knock down the three Z was three for his last 18 from three coming into the game but was two for five last time out in the lost to Louisville the Boston College transfer out to Hunter guarded by The Freshman Swinton Zachary catch release too much Thomas fouled by Wiggins well Jaden Zachary has not shot the ball particularly well this season but knock it down the corner three after the great kick out from Ian shefin Clemson with an early onepoint Music deficit 21st they lose to Louisville then two weeks off between games and new team lot of new faces Leonard Hamilton went back to the fundamentals the basics the week leading up to their first game back they had intense shooting drills and its paid off 52 in their last two games now Devils Advocate David says okay you beat Syracuse and Miami today becomes a litmus test to see how far theyve come no question on the road against Clemson a borderline top 25 team near the top of the ACC whos a very good defensive team in their own right but Florida State basically hitting the reset button in between the end of 202 24 and the beginning of 2025 but whatever they did worked because they have been playing like a different team on offense these last couple of games six of 11 from the field after the basket by AER maluk heres Dylan Hunter Chases younger brother kicks to Dell Jones The Freshman who knocks down the three just his ninth triple of the season and his minutes have been shrinking over the last six weeks thats a good sign well and a good job that time coming out with the simple just driving kick like I mentioned it earlier against Florida State you have to just go oneonone and beat your man and when Florida State helps you got to be able to kick the ball out to the open guy on the perimeter one area where Florida state has struggled in ACC play is defending the three and that time just a great example of driving kick basketball by the Tigers and Clemsons a very good threepoint shooting team how about dang thats two tough contested shots that hes knocked down yeah Jerry D making it look easy with the Baseline fadeaway jumper you mentioned it the second time just using his size to shoot over the smaller defender in Jake Hy breeder Dan guarding Zachary extra pass Hunter wide open Splash well Clemsons doing a great job these last couple of possessions of getting a paint touch anytime you get the ball in the paint against the seminal the defense is going to collapse because theyre trying to protect the rim so hard that youll be able to kick it out great pass that time by Ian shefflin Clemson four of seven from three 38 on the season Thomas looking for help Deng thought about it comes back to Boston Holt shot clock at three Holt called for the offensive foul and he just extended that arm there trying to get to the rim he pretty easy call there by Ted Valentine but Florida state is such a unique team in the way they play defensively its so hard to prepare for you see the good move here by maluk on the but on the other end Jaden Zachary see Ian Che could have gone up with that but he knew there were three guys in black shirts in the lane and you got a wide open shooter and Dylan Hunter at the top of the key great kick out for the easy three using the shot break thats hide breeder Here Comes Music Swinton backing down Dylan Hunter Baseline turnar around no tipped Hunter had it through the contact Hunter down the lane hes blocked maluk and out of bounds to Florida State one Florida State Boston HT just being a little aggressive there and anytime you extend that arm thats going to be an easy call for the officials Dylan Hunter doing a good job pushing the pace and transition but maluk with the great block and goes off the foot of Christian Reeves and seals doing a pretty good job so far protecting that Rim C just able to knock down a couple of Threes to make up for it its one thing for Florida State to run 9 10 sometimes 11 guys at you then you see the size and thats a Leonard Hamilton thing he wants big players its the third tallest team in the country and theyve been in the top three The Last 5 Years Holt leaning in too strong Zachary spins away this is one thing Clemson can look to do today if they get a clean rebound is get out on the break two threes for Jaden Zachary finding his group from deep and thats got to be a very welcome sight for Brad Brownell and this Clemson coaching staff seeing his confidence start to creep up a little bit you mentioned in the loss earlier this week made two threes against Louisville and so far here early Ons got two of his own today Watkins going one on three and hes blocked by Reeves who is Applause Music grimacing Clemson in the midst of a 60 R coming into this game the Clemson Tigers knew it was going to be hard to play a half court game you got to get out on the break when the opportunity presents itself and how do you do that you get a clean stop a clean defensive rebound and get the ball up the court and get it into the paint Jake KY breeder great job getting a paint touch kicking it out to Jaden Zachary knocking down the three Clemson was five threes already so far in this basketball game shooting the ball well sharing the ball and thats exactly what you have to do against Florida State seminal a small sample size but in Florida States four ACC games teams shooting 39 from three its been a little bit of an issue and now Florida state will pick up full court Taylor B Bowen defending the Baseline Applause when you mentioned it earlier the length not only do they have 610 611 post players their guards are 65 66 67 they just make it so hard because theyre so active with their hands getting in the passing Lanes getting to flexions Hunter machetes through the D turned away at the rim and case in point the size of Florida State but a good take though by Chase Hunter being aggressive trying to get to the Lane thats Chandler Jackson long as 10 seol and hes got his first two his numbers in the four ACC games only about four and a half points nine a game in nonconference Jones his second to three and the sixth triple for Clemson in the first half and talking to Brad Brownell one of the things hes referenced several times over the last couple of weeks is hes got to get more production from his bench so Dell Jones coming into the Game knocking down two threes at that takes so much pressure off the starting five to carry the load for the Tigers a very welcome sight skip pass into the corner that doesnt go for Applause Music Music Davis shot clock inside of 10 Chase Hunter off the shot fake Applause true and that is just a big time move there by Chase Hunter seems very simple but just the recognition to know that Florida States going to challenge every three so just that slightest shot fake and just a quick little side dribble to get it off before that secondary defender came Music in Watkins Now using theot not fake Yan down low over sheflin for two boy hes got great touch around the basket Leonard Hamilton had nothing but High Praise for Malik Yan he hes been a little different than most bigs theyve recruited in the past most of the bigs are great Defenders great shot blockers set screens roll to the basket for lobs Malik Yan is an incredibly skilled offensive player you mentioned it the junior college player of the year a year ago and you see why right there started his career at Old Miss as we get a Applause foul and Zachary is still down underneath the basket foul is on Watkins he got hit in the Applause face well Chase Hunter right here just with a great little simple sidestep dribble knocking down the three on the other end Malik Yuan we mentioned how skilled he is offensively just easy spin move Baseline pretty good defense there by Ian shefflin but a good finish off the glass they will take another look at that last foul the previous play is Applause Music underw I think the students behind us voiced their opinion loud enough to have the referees go look at that one let take a look here good job there by Ian shefflin of screening off his own man to allow Jaden Zachary yeah clearly contact there across the face know its always hard to judge intent and thats one is it unnecessary and excessive no unnecessary Music you could see where this could turn into a flagrant one yeah I dont I dont think it was deliberate I I do think jir Watkins was trying to make a legitimate play on the basketball he just got screened off to where he couldnt reach that far but you said unnecessary maybe the Difference Maker in this one wheres our rules expert Matt Austin when we need him for something like this huh this is where again that subject activity comes into play and were going to get the verdict here from Marner and Ted Valentine momentarily Florida State two two in conference Clemson 41 lone loss coming to Louisville the foul is on number one black has been upgraded to a flagrant foul and again usually when you see that contact Applause the when that contact happens above the neck and shoulders difference between flagrant one and flagrant 2 flagrant is flagrant too you results in an ejection and you know unnecessary Ted yeah I think you said it unnecessary is the word right there that I would highlight because I I do think it was a legitimate play on the ball I dont think he was trying to take Jaden Zacharys head off for anything so I think the officials got that one right and Jaden Zachary will get two free throws here just made the first one and Clemson will retain possession of the basketball 89 free throw Applause Music shooter Duke won again today behind 42 points from Cooper flag they have clearly established themselves as Goliath in the ACC the clearcut number one maybe the best team in the country David I think Clemson with its continuity the guys coming back and the pieces theyve added this is the second best team in the ACC I agree and you know we mentioned that they only have one conference loss at Louisville on Tuesday and over the last couple years see great hustle here by Clemson Im not sure Dell Jones saw the shot clock reset I dont think he did cuz theres no reason why he would have taken that shot otherwise but and the Hustle by Zachary to knock get away and then the helping hand to bring dayquon Davis up well lets not forget Kentucky came into this building earlier this year in December and got beat so Clemson has spent time in the top 25 Duke obviously seems to be the cream of the crop like you mentioned but come March when the regular season is over I would not be the least bit surprised to see Clemson right near the top of the standings Davis cork screws inside it comes to Wiggins Zacharys got 10 to lead all scores like that Music match Zachary on the bigger Yuan draws the defense Hunter on the drive the kick Zachary catch release and rolls out youan snares the board and a good possession by Clemson though another paint touch good kick out by Chase Hunter and Janes Zachary confidence I said it earlier is an amazing thing that shot looked really good leaving his hands just didnt get the friendly roll Taylor B Bowen kicks it back out Watkins has it roll out when Florida state has not had a lot of success so far in this game on the offensive backboard shooting under 45 for the game but only a couple offensive rebounds to show for it off a turnover heres Music Applause Watkins chefin in the passing Lane it comes to Davis careerhigh 10 assists against Miami Last Time Out Yan puts it on the floor triple teamed Davis left it short theres an offensive rebound B Bowen and he turns it over sheflin lines it up back Music iron no shortage of pace in this game so far in this first Davis the aggressor rewarded Daquon Davis even though hes only a freshman he doesnt play like a freshman Leonard Hamilton was giving him all the praise in the world last night talking about how he brings it every single day in practice had 10 assists to one turnover the other night in their win at Miami yeah in the previous game he had 18 points against Syracuse here he comes again the lob Taylor B bow and finishing Above the Rim the sophomore from Jericho Vermont who grew up skiing on Mount Mansfield and how about division by dayquon Davis the true freshman seminal trying speaks for itself 42 points today they may be the best defensive team in the country and its just incredible how difficult they make it on that end of the floor and John CH has done an unbelievable job and Cooper flag is certainly someone that uh lets enjoy watching him because hes not going to be in college much longer you dont think nil money keeps him in for another year I dont know he may be able to get more than some of the rookie contracts out there might he might hes leading Duke in what seems like almost every category putting together together not just a banner freshman season one of the great freshman Seasons By Any ACC player theres Wiggins with a chance for a threepoint play talking to Brad Brownell yesterday he said chony Wiggins a junior been in the system for three years there is still a lot of upside there if he starts to find that ceiling it changes the trajectory and the ceiling for the entire team you can see the potential I mean the athletic ability for being 610 can guard on the perimeter can shoot the three and a great job that time by his teammates of recognizing the switch with the smaller defender in Chandler Jackson right there just his ability to turn and shoot over smaller Applause Defenders see here he is switching out on ball screens moving his feet keeping guys in front of him Watkins tries to get it inside he does its maluk and the Freshman has his Fade Away roll out rebound wiggan Music how many guys 610 can do that Coast to Coast off a rebound how effortless was that by Johnny Wiggins just said Im going to keep it do it myself great job coming to a jump stop getting his feet under him and another turnaround jump shot making it look easy Davis for three battle for the rebound Thomas takes it away Applause Music Watkins with a shot clock at five it will stay with Florida State but less than two seconds to shoot and Clemsons doing a very good job in their own right of switching everything defensively one through five when all the guys on offense are all the same size you can go ahead and do that cuz youre not really at a disadvantage anywhere need something quick its dening and that did not hit the rim shot clock Applause violation quit cry now Clemsons done a very good job so far in this first half of taking care of the basketball Florida State leads the ACC in Block shots and steals so very accustomed to Turning other teams over but the Tigers have done a very good job for the most part of handling the pressure from the seminal thats been standard fair for Leonard Hamiltons teams and before the shot a whistle it is against Clemson Ian shefflin called for the moving screen his second Victor lockin has been on the bench over there for Clemson almost the entire first half after picking up the exact same screen and almost the exact same spot on the floor just cant move your feet when the defenders trying to get under the screen no argument from Brad Brownell on that one so Clemson is going to have to try to survive this last minute with a little bit of a smaller lineup on the floor locking only played six minutes cheffin to the bench miles Foster checks in double digit score the last two years at Illinois State and Monmouth at 17 of the season opener hasnt done much since and picks up a quick foul so Davis will head to the free throw line he has been perfect at the stripe in the New Year 10 for 10 did you just give him the announcer jinx theyll get Wiggins on the foul thats his second D if he misses this hes hes not going to forget it that you just said that just so you know all right youre good doesnt exist heres tomorrows ACC Network womens basketball quadruple header three top 20 teams in action it starts with Duke and Virginia we end the day with Miami going up to Syracuse Applause the Jinx just died one of the few times Florida state has been able to set up that full court press but Clemsons done a good job once you get the ball in bounds it usually Retreats pretty well but then once you get the ball over the half court line just the length of the seals just something you got to deal with another whistle we get a foul both tonight at an Eastern after hour mens basketball triple header it is the nothing but net crew thatll break down the day in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every game Justin Thomas picks up his second foul for Florida State will step aside with 43 seconds to go in the opening half Music Applause both teams have shot at pretty well in the opening half Florida State 46 Clemson at 50 the difference Clemson 7 of 14 from three yeah that is the literal difference here in this first half and Clemsons done a good job you got to give them credit every time theyve gotten the ball in the lane into the paint into the orange area theyve done a great job of Kicking It Out Florida State so long and such a great shot blocking team youre not going to be able to finish at the rim with a lot of success so Clemson has done a good job of driving penetrating and kicking out to the shooters match up here for Zachary against Yuan between the trees blocked out of bounds and thats what exactly what I was talking about right there youre just not going to have a lot of success getting into the lane not only is the guy whos guarding you going to try to block your shot but youre going to get two or three other guys coming in as well the defense just converges so hard on the ball you got to be able to kick it out of the rotational players for Florida State the only one under 65 is the Freshman decoin Davis hes 61 like a little ption on this Hunter Fades hits man that is a tough shot there by Chase Hunter he had Jaden Zachary open in the opposite corner but wasnt enough time left on the shot clock to make the pass just a tough little fallway Chase Hunter has just been playing lights out for Clemson the last couple of weeks Davis ran into foster now picked up by Dylan Hunter and were going to get a push and that puts Florida state in the bonus Dylan Hunter with his first foul that was pretty good defense there by Clemson dayquon Davis may have gotten away with a travel and as physical as this game has been in this first half thats a tough one to swallow there for Brad Brownell but nonetheless dayon Davis going to the free throw line try to cut into this ninepoint tiger lead itll be a one and one for the Freshman from West Baltimore Miss Music is Clemson here electing to put Victor lockin back into the game with those two fouls obviously theyre going down on offense so and Im worried about him picking up a foul doing something defensively both free throws good for Davis six seconds left in the half this is where Florida States length makes it hard to get the ball up the court theyre going to go with this 221 34 core pressure just try to keep the ball in front of them slow you down with only 6 seconds left in the game excuse me the first half Zachary turbos across half court Wiggins along three and thats how the first half ends Clemson because of the weather sledding Florida State cant defend lock him down low seminal looking for their first quad one win undefeated against quad three and four they dont even have a quad two win Clemson has owned this rivalry of late and Yan picks up the foul his first Victor lockin had a very quiet first half picked up those two early fouls but you see the set coming out right away trying to get him going and you mentioned it earlier that is something right there that Clemson did not do well against Louisville on Tuesday in their lone conference loss was finished at The Rim that time Victor lockin with the threepoint play 61 center from Russia transferred in from Cincinnati lockin Taylor B Bowen Watkins had a couple of early threes then did not score and the open open half B Bowen lets it go no rebound Music Wiggins Wiggins shefflin and lockin all picked up two fouls in the opening half long three Wiggins Applause boom well you always wonder when a team shoots the ball really well in the first half can they continue it coming out of the locker room at halftime and I guess johy Wiggins answered that question right there that was deep five or six feet behind the line at least good start here for the Tigers maneuvering around Wiggins and able to draw the foul if thats lock in its his third it is not the start Victor lockin wanted here in this second half you see Wiggins that is thats beyond NBA range right there and not a great shooter percentage wise but obviously very capable but its an amazing thing confidence amongst a shooting team one guy gets hot and it becomes very contagious thats big right there for Victor lockin picking up that third foul here just a minute into the second half after picking up that threepoint play to kind of get him going so certainly something to keep an eye on here lets see if Florida State tries to go inside to Yuan with locking out Watkins probing took a shot to the face on the drive hes Reckless come here you mentioned it third foul there on Victor lockin but Ian shefflin also has two and we see Jaden Zachary just needs to be a little more at the ACC logo right there some coaches refer to it as the nail but you got to discourage the drive first then get out once they kick it to the wing for the perimeter shot second foul on Hunter who almost came up with the steal so they get a push and we dont tighten up tighten up Applause good job there on the underneath that bounce play by Dylan Hunter of reading where the pass was going thats a scouting thing right there and unable to save it and a couple fans getting up close and personal look but no beverages spilled on the court it appears it looks like Dylan Hunter may have had the spillage on his right forearm and do you get reburst for that or is that the cost of attendance I think thats just there should be a disclaimer on your ticket that says if youre sitting here keep your eyes up and your keep your head up and your eyes open Zachary Music weaving he had 10 in the opening Applause half Zachary has it stolen away heres Watkins crowd wanted to travel its knocked out of bounds by shefflin pretty good defense that last time by Florida State dayquon Davis was just all over Jaden Zachary Florida State obviously trying to turn up the heat a little bit defensively and make Clemson a little bit more uncomfortable Yan down low banging against shefin off the window doesnt go ta to Wiggins well thats what Florida state has to continue to do with Victor locking on the bench with three fouls Ian shefflin has two in his own right so hes not going to want to pick up that third obviously Im Florida State I continue to get that ball inside to Malik Yuan Hunter out of control but bailed out by the Applause Music foul Taylor B Bowen picks up his second foul and Dylan Hunter Junior from Atlanta Chase his younger brother only played nine minutes on Tuesday in the lost to Louisville matching the season low he can defend and play three positions can back up at point guard one of those glue guys on this Clemson team coming up next UNCC going to NC State 400 P pm Eastern on accn Virginia Tech at Cal that game in Berkeley at 6 Eastern NC State kind of getting to that point where its getting late early for Kevin Keats as back rivalry game you never know what to expect in those matchups but youre right it we were talking about it earlier the opportunities for Quad one wins as you start to get into later in January and early February going to start to diminish you got to take advantage of them when you have them Florida State looking for its first field goal of the half and its Chandler Jackson who delivers and Brad Brown now gone for a travel right there Chandler Jackson caught that ball on the run but a good straight line drive to the rim I have a feeling you can see Florida State try to attack that Rim a lot more here in the second half especially with Victor lockin on the bench with those three fouls Hunter the sixthe senior playing Bully ball against Jackson and he just picks and chooses his spot so well does not force the issue on offense is so effortless scoring the basketball just never gets sped up Florida States a team that can really speed up and Chase Hunter just plays it his speed when the drum beat gets louder his heartbeat get slower Watkins step back on shefflin doesnt go hes missed four straight after making two threes early and if Im Leonard Hamilton I dont like that shot right there from jir Watkins you just had success getting the ball to the lane on the drive dont bail out by shooting a step back three the foul is on Watkins we see here just a good straight line drive took the contact nice little Bank off the glass and I know its easy when youre down double digits down 13 to try to get back in the game see a great finish there by Chase hun the little postwork on display to try to shoot threes to make up that deficit but you just got to chip away at it theres almost 17 minutes left in this game you dont want to start firing away with the threepoint line too early sheflin with his first points of the game the averages 13 and almost 11 yeah and a quiet offensive night so far for Ian shefflin but four assists and one turnover in that first half facilit for the Tigers we will step aside Clemson has opened the second half on a 102 run breath for a minute to make sure he got up okay but doesnt snow very often down here in South Carolina so you got to love seeing the students take advantage of it you had a observation during the break um did he have the the piece of cardboard the wrong way yeah he needed almost he almost had a portrait he needed to turn it landscape to get more of his body on there I mean I know hes probably not a little bit of a novice sled there but uh hes from Austin Texas yes there you go yeah the only thing hes ever really sled in probably was Applause dirt Davis mellin Around the Baseline then turns it over out Wiggins knocked one home from there earlier in this half doesnt pull the pin Hunter thought about it now hoist and Music connects I just am amazed watching Chase Hunter just the tempo and the Rhythm that he plays with as a nasty Collision going to get an offensive foul there on dayquon Davis who may have taken the brunt of that keep an eye on that when we Davis remains down near the Florida state Applause bench well Chase Hunter continuing his hot shooting thought about it the first time a little hesitation jab step knocking it down Clemson trying to run away with it here a little John Music the current play is under review just wait till the end of Applause it remains a common foul heres another look he and Chase Hunter Collide they get the foul on DeQuan Davis really could have been called on either player after the previous plays confirmed a legal screen against black number five yeah just kind of an awkward play there dequon Davis wasnt trying to set a screen he simply just pitched the ball ahead it was almost just trying to go to the corner and just almost an inadvertent Collision but we were talking about during the break thats the fourth illegal screen called in this game you dont see that very often maybe one a game to C4 is pretty unique but nonetheless kind of just an unfortunate break there for dayquon Davis good to see Davis back up hes on the floor he was down for several seconds following the play freshmans got six points today four of them from the free throw line the wiry Wiggins to his high school teammate shefflin shefflin was open Zachary doubled and were going to get another foul its going to be on DeQuan Davis again and Clemson that time was trying to get the switch to get dayquon Davis on Ian shefflin and then post up Ian shefflin but Florida State decides to trap the ball screen you see right there Davis just making contact with the left arm of Jaden Zachary good call there by the officials just a little too aggressive on that ball screen defense but this is a crucial time we were talking about it a few minutes ago this is a crucial stretch here over the next few minutes for the seminal this game either could get out of hand or they make a run here and theyre trying to do so on this possession Yan finishes the alleyoop on the pass from Thomas and one of the few times in this game where Florida state has been able to turn over Clemson not only turn him over but then convert it into points on the other end yeah in fact those were the first two fast break points for Florida State shefflin two points today didnt score in the first half Yan got in the passing Lane it will stay with Clemson seven to shoot Florida State doing what they do best turning defense into offense the good hands there by Justin Thomas getting out on the break and a great lob pass to Malik euan seals trying to make a run down 16 here in the second half thats how theyre going to have to do it with their defense expect pressure as well shefflin no good another rebound by Malik Yuan Applause nearly turned over a lot of dribbling by Davis B Bons been quiet today Thomas Baseline kick Davis no good rebound Wiggins good look there yeah great look maybe one of their better offensive possessions of the half just nothing to show for it but a good driving kick and cant ask for a better look from three than that if youre Leonard Hamilton Wiggins launches Watkins snatches it and thats not the shot Brad Brownell wants especially so early in the shot clock right there you Nifty inside and thats a fivepoint swing right there that at a Tempo three turns into a basket on the other end so Florida State not going away leard Hamilton just trying to find the right combination plays 10 guys like we mentioned trying to find the right five how about Dylan Hunter off the spin cycle and again contributions from the bench Dylan Hunter just put his head down and Brad Brownell mentioned it yesterday at practice we got to win our oneon ones and thats exactly what that was right there Y in Cyclones to the rim how about the footwork from Malik Yuan catching the ball at the threepoint line in the spin move pretty easy to see why he was the junior college player of the year last year just extremely talented offensively his middle name too fits its Flex hes got 133 today to lead the nolles six of n from the field hunter from 15 and we get a foul down low its on Florida Music State pretty easy to see why Leonard Hamilton and staff are so high on mik Yan great catch there in transition with the Finish then the face up move from 18 ft good spin great finish on the other end Florida State just has to find a way to put together a couple stops they theyve got a stop here a stop there but they need to put together three or four stops in a row and this is not the guy you want to send to the free throw line Chase Hunter at the line playing in his 150th game for the Clemson Tigers today thats the most in school history and if you think about Brad Brownell whos been at Clemson now in his 15th season Hunter has played in almost a third of the games Brownell has coached in at Clemson well when youre as good of a player as Chase Hunter is Im sure Brad Brownell is completely fine with that he probably like to keep him a few more years if he could well Brad Brownell had a lot of praise for Chase Hunter yesterday he said this guys heard all my speeches hes heard everything I have to say hes been through every type of practice and hes still the hardest working guy in practice and as a sixthe guy who knows the program and knows the culture was Thomas knocks down a three he becomes an extension of this coaching staff in an age when you have transfers and turnover hes the one that goes to the newer guys hey this is how we do things here at Clemson we practice early were on time this is whats expected of you keeping culture in continuity its the hardest thing to do in college sports right now especially with the turnover but to have a coach like that on the floor is just so invaluable oh and he can do that too that time he missed it looked good going in hell get another chance and knocks it down I was just about to say I was thinking to myself there is no way hes going to miss two in a row with that good a look but a great job there keeping the ball alive on the offensive backboard great kick out by Dell Jones Chase Hunter just firing on all cylinders today offensively and our fifth illegal screen of the game Applause incredible a maluk The Freshman picks up the foul meanwhile Hunter with a 20 point game you see what hes done in the last six hes picking up where he left off seven for 11 from the field four for seven from three hes among the ACC leaders in field goal percentage and hes a guard and one of the best free throw shooters in the ACC as well so just having an unbelievable final season here at Clemson for Brad Brownell great pass want to take this team to a final four as locking stuffs at home and Clemsons lead balloons to 18 and that was the exact same set Clemson ran first possession coming out of the locker room just that middle ball screen and you had Chase Hunter lifted you cant help off of great pass there by Jaden Zachary and a good finish by lockin Zachary getting into the body of Deng and picks up the foul you mentioned to chase Hunter trying to get this team to a final four and if he shoots the ball like this offensively they are going to be very difficult to beat come March Music e e e e Music entering today jool lardy projected five teams from the ACC to get into the field Louisville kn KN off Pittsburgh today so youre going to see some change there for Clemson if they hold on and win it doesnt really help them a lot you look at the teams there at the end considered Wake Forest in Florida State now what Florida state has going for it David they dont really have a bad loss the problem is they dont have a quad one or a quad two win and I think theres a lot more value put on the wins the great wins compared to the quote unquote bad losses and we mentioned it earlier there just arent going to be a lot of opportunities as we go on throughout the season to get those quad one wins so when they come available you just have to take advantage of it but Clemson today has just played lights out so far in the first 30 minutes of this game and you know we we mentioned it at the beginning of the game Leonard Hamilton one of his biggest concerns was Clemson is a is a twoheaded monster you can throw the ball inside score inside and they can really shoot so what do you do well Victor lockin and Ian shefflin have a combined nine points but theyve made 10 threes thats how you make up for it which makes him just a really really difficult team to defend ding rebound lock in who has been on the bench most of the game with foul trouble we told you about chefin the back spasms didnt practice yesterday its been an ongoing issue even though Ian shefflin only has two points he has five assists and only one turnover in this game so almost a point forward really helping to facilitate things Davis Carells but Florida state did so well Wednesday against Miami was move the rock been harder to do today but that time they crashed the boards they havent had many Second Chance points either no they have not Clemsons done a good job on the backboard but that time Jerry D just going up and getting it putting it back in but its this end of the floor just have not found a consistent answer for how to guard Clemson particularly this young man Chase Hunter defended by Thomas Chase to his younger brother Dylan offensive rebound Clemson and thats about the third or fourth time here in the second half where somebody just tapped the ball to keep it alive that time it was Victor lockin give Clemson another possession Dell Jones was wide open calling for it they got it to him a little late and then on the drive its knocked out of bounds by Florida State and youre just playing with fire when you give a team like Clemson three cracks at it before you get the possession of the basketball back see Victor lockin just keeping it alive and it hits AJ Swinton while hes standing out of bounds wrong place at the wrong time I guess Jones knocked down a couple of Threes in the first half drives kicks Dylan Hunter rebound by Justin Thomas Dan boy hes got a good looking game Jerry Deng the sophomore transfer from Hampton averaged 10 points a game last year shot almost 40 from three and hes really been keeping them in it offensively here these last couple of possessions hit a couple tough turnarounds in the first half Hunter blocked and thats where you just got to be careful challenging the length of Florida State at The Applause Rim Jerry Deng trying to keep the seminal in this one by himself offensive rebound just goes up and gets it with the easy putback and the next time down great extra pass and just ready to catch and shoot knocking down the three so seals not going away just yet Deng has nine Clemson has missed its last six Florida state has made five of its last seven and it looks like theyre going to get locken who tried to wall up Yuan and sometimes when things just are not going your way defensively its just one of those days for Victor lockin pretty good defense but you see right there he he brought his arms down just enough at the last second right there if he just continues to stay straight up in his plane thats not going to be a foul but it was just that slightest little bending of the arms bringing them down to draw that contact on Yan so its four fouls on the Russian and Yan misses the front end Malik Yuan came into the game shooting 70 from the field in just conference games overall 59 which is tops in the ACC at 20 and 10 last time out against Applause Miami locking back to the bench hes only played 11 minutes today Applause he just 14 points for Yan to go along with six rebounds hes been the best player on the court for Florida State today and they need to get more from jir Watkins here over these next nine minutes if theyre going to have a shot and coming back on the road well theyre going to have to try to create a couple of turnovers get a couple steals to try to get out on the break and score a couple easy baskets their full court pressure has been nonexistent today nice move no finish for Dell Jones Watkins on the bench for Florida State YN is fouled he saw he had the match up with hiy breeder went right after him well he just keeps going back to that spin move he goes One Direction right here goes left gets cut off by the defense his footwork is really really impressive for a guy that size being able to face up and put the ball on the floor and get to the Lane and Florida State dont look now a chance to cut this lead to 10 just under 9 minutes to Applause Music go ACC PM with Mark Packer weekdays at 4 Eastern is right here on accn and the ESPN app you ever been a Packers basem I have not but it looks incredible on it is hes got all sorts of memorabilia paraph if you ever want to learn about the history of the ACC just go to that basement mini Museum Chase Hunter right now getting a quick breather on the bench I have a feeling Brad branell is going to put him back in as hes sitting over to the table with a media timeout coming but Dell Jones wasnt a whole lot going there for Clemson offensively Jaden Zachary with a near steal the Del Jones who shot the ball well tonight knocking down another huge three was just kind of a dead possession for the Tigers pretty good defense there but just with a little step back and again the bench contributions for Brad brownells team have been extremely important in this basketball game something hes been looking for over the last couple of weeks nine points for Jones Chase Hunter back in jir Watkins still on the bench for Florida State Music Applause Music Yan doubled on the Baseline Jackson down low to Deng who drops it in hes got 11 a little bit of a breakdown there that time by Clemson defensively see full or excuse me Florida State picking up the full core press but again Clemson doing a good job of throwing the ball over the top dont have it bring it back out good decision here by Jaden Zachary yeah they practiced a lot against the Florida state press trying to mimic it yesterday well thats what makes it so difficult is you not only do you not have a lot of time to prepare for it but unless you do it every day its almost impossible to simulate but Clemson has done a good job yeah you just cant find 68 69 610 guys on your scout team Jones left it short a three makes this a ninepoint game and well get a blocking foul on Zachary Applause just when this game looked like it get might get out of hand to get away from Florida State good ball movement here by the seminal trying to cut into this 12point lead just under eight to goir Watkins reenters the game with 713 to go only six points he came in averaging almost 19 a game and he has not scored in the second half now all six of those points came in the first couple of minutes of the basketball game he knocked down two threes and nothing to show for it since but a guy like him with his scoring ability could get hot in a hurry so you got to be careful you dont want to come in and try to do too much too quickly but you still got to be aggressive and play your game both teams are in the bonus Watkins posting up Zachary help from Hunter Watkins leaning in the tap back is coralled by Dylan Hunter up ahead to chase here Clemson that time going with the double team on Watkins as soon as he caught the ball on the post forcing that tough shot oneone fight Hunter against Chandler Jackson Zachary with 10 to shoot shot clock at four Zachary over Jackson gets the home bounce he sure did that was 29 seconds really good defense from Florida State forced a tough shot Jaden Zachary just got that friendly roll hes got a dozen Applause Swinton dengs been a bolt of energy Off the Applause Bench shot clock down to five Yuan from the Baseline Watkins that never hit Rim its a shot clock violation and Watkins had no idea and good defense that time by Clemson when Malik Yan caught the ball in the block there were two guys waiting when he tried to make his move and forced him into that tough fadeaway jump shot yeah seems Clemsons plan right now is hey were going to double Watkins were going to double Yan if the other guys beat us so be it well Florida States only made 43 pointers so far in this basketball game you mentioned it during the break only making about six per game coming in so Clon seems very content to try to keep that ball out of the lane and dare Florida State to shoot from the perimeter he got enough bricks Music today Watkins defending Hunter two of the top scorers in the ACC Wiggins Maneuvers down low against D oh Chanty Wiggins little Dipsy dooo well in the size and length of Florida state is not going to affect Chanty Wiggins around the rim he is 610 the best athlete on this Clemson team dang trying to answer a little bit of a flex set that last time by Clemson not something you see very often but they knew Florida state was going to switch it so they purposely rolled Chanty Wiggins back to the ball just great execution that time they go right back to Wiggins same set just the other side of the floor WI Wiggins knocks it down hes got a dozen well thats why you can see the NBA type potential for chony Wiggins just at the size but the athleticism and the touch thats the third time in this game hes showing the ability to shoot that little turnaround jump shot and you look at whos on the floor for Clemson the two hunters sheflin and Wiggins its a veteran group that has played a lot of ball together those are four guys whove all played three or more years together as Florida State a chance at a threepoint play yeah you just see the little Baseline Flex screen they knew Florida state was going to switch great job by chy Wiggins with the shot fake you know Florida States going to leave their feet to try to block everything and then that next time nice smooth little turnaround jump shot see that graphic right there Clemson pretty hard to beat when Chanty Wiggins chips in in the scoring column meanwhile Watkins got his first two of the second half he hit those two early threes Florida state only has two threes since then you look at the time you look at the score nolles are going to have to knock down some shots from the outside to get back into this game theyre going to have to get some stops on top of that Clemson with 67 points with over four minutes left to go in this game and tigers will certainly look to take the air out of the basketball and trying to get the ball into Wiggins there there who had the mismatch Chase Hunter launches and hits did almost a half MJ shrug he gets a deposit slip that got a piece of the bank B but things are going your way they continue to do so Watkins tries to answer that hits the back of the rim and it comes to Zachary off the rebound and Clemson can extend to a 20point lead with a basket here Chase Hunter it has just been that kind of day for Clemson getting all the rolls at home on the rim Dylan Hunter grazes the side of the rim Zachary to shefflin the up the under rebound Yuan up ahead to Davis on the breakout Hunter the block Zachary the corner three check please Applause well Chase Hunter is doing it all today for the Clemson Tigers getting the friendly roll and then with the defensive play of the day with a chase down block Tigers rolling at home Music second guy has to be in a lot of pain his head snapped back hard on that thats the luxury of being 18 19 20 years old bounce back what if you and I tried to go out and do that you dont think we bounce back like that done 60day iil Watkins from the Baseline and he will shoot two this is a CL team again we know Dukes the team to beat in the ACC but with all the returning star power the veteran experience you look at again guys like Wiggins Chase Hunter Dylan Hunter shefflin theyve played in big games what you watch today was a team that very much took a businesslike approach lost to Louisville on Tuesday youre about to bounce back with a resounding win against the Florida State team that was pretty hot well this is what you would expect if youre a Clemson fan a brad brano coach team coming off their first conference loss like you mentioned come out the experience they have you just knew they were going to bounce back and obviously it helps when you shoot the lights out 13 to 26 from behind the arc doesnt hurt anything but just a a very very impressive performance here by this Clemson team the challenge for Clemson they have a stretch now where four of the next five will be on the road and then a threegame home standand with Georgia Tech Duke North Carolina but in those stretch of road games at Georgia Tech pit is a chance for a quad one win a loss there doesnt hurt you as Davis fouls Chase Hunter you got Syracuse at home Virginia Tech on the road and C State on the road when youve been in this league and years pass if you lost to a middle of the pack ACC team on the road it didnt hurt your resume thats not true this season its not when the ACC was sending nine sometimes 10 teams to the NCAA tournament you just said it losing to one of those team on the road just it didnt hurt you but it this year because the ACC just is not as deep as it has been four maybe five teams looking to get in you just one of those losses on the road could potentially knock you out of the tournament so you have to go on the road and handle business and on the flip side of it when youre one of the teams at the top that can be a resume booster for teams trying to make their way into that conversation youre going to get their best shot that means Clemson Duke Carina pit you throw SMU and Louisville in there for Music Applause Music Nows is still staying aggressive tra in that Baseline post touch there forcing the turnover and keep in mind too most of this game has been without Victor lockin who as of late has played very well so Brad brell when he watches this tape is going to be very pleased with his team especially his bench Dylan Hunter Dell Jones guys coming off the bench contributing then when you got this guy right here shooting the ball like he has been its going to make for a lot of fun nights for the Clemson Tigers shot clock at two Hunter beats the shot clock well I wouldnt have been surprised if that had gone in a lot of it has he is five of eight from three before that shot so five of nine eight to 14 from the field 25 points for Chase Hunter The Chefs Kitchen letting Florida State have Applause Music Applause it are getting a very welldeserved hand from this near capacity crowd here at Little John I tell you what obviously Cameron Indoor the dean Dome a lot of places in the ACC very tough to go play have a great reputation but this Arena when they when the students are here and into it and the fans are into it they have a good team like they do this year this place is a very very difficult environment to come in and play well Dell Jones one point away from matching a career high Richard freshman ASA Thomas five in white has checked in for Clemson as well Music out there with Hyde breeder and Miles Foster snatched out of the air by Yuan Davis pushing Watkins has time to line it up boy just hasnt been his night and the Layin by hide breeder crowd wanted a dunk probably the right decision youve been sitting over there on that bench for a while youre cold if youve been playing the last 15 minutes maybe one thing but probably the right decision not to pull a hamstring right there trying to dunk Yan working on Foster 40 seconds left youan still playing hard and Hyde breeder the former Air Force falcon comes away with it ran into B Bowen Thomas will let it Applause fly and two shots for Davis I know I Applause only well we talked about it earlier Duke obviously the cream of the crop so far in the ACC this year Clemson trying to keep Pace right behind him but maybe the surprise team so far this year in the ACC Louisville we mentioned it earlier with a great win today at pit so Cardinals having a very surprising great year makes the ACC even better and theres going to be a team in this league like Notre Dame last year young team that gets better and creates chaos late in the season following our game will get you to Raleigh UNC NC State big rivalry game per usual and then Virginia Tech cow to cap off our triple header and David Im not so sure that team may not end up being Florida State they got a lot of young pieces coming together they have shown flashes theres Talent theres length theres depth they just havent played a whole lot together which again is a problem that a lot of coaches have in college basketball dont be surprised if this Florida State team a couple of weeks from now starts to find its stride and it starts to make life miserable for some of the upper echelon teams in the league well and I think todays result was is more of an indictment of just how good Clemson is no doubt not so much how much Florida State struggles Applause Taylor B Bowen with his team down 20 plus tries to throw it off the glass okay Im just happy for his sake that he didnt miss that but not not many teams if any are going to come in here and win in this building with Clemson playing like this and this crowd is just going to be really difficult Matt Kelly the walkon had it stolen away the basket does not count its Bookkeeping on a weekend where it snowed
