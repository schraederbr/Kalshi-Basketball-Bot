of Florida last Wednesday in the ACC SEC challenge officials tonight LOD rers Bert Smith and Courtney green beaks control the opening tip it is bopy Miller one of four players who average 16 plus for Wake for its the only team in the nation that can say that this ruer team last year did a really good job of shutting down Lake Forest and what Ruckers does well defensively it takes away what you like to do their preparation is one of the key things in their defensive success no Fon Reid in the starting lineup for Wade for ruter they dont have a single player who averages 12 a game its a balanced scoring effort as they turn it over Andre Hyatt the teams leading score Gavin Griffiths The Freshman makes his second start coach they see Griffiths as someone who could potentially be a 15point per game main player as you look at the starting lineups for Wake Reed will come off the bench Zack Keller getting the start at Center Carr coming off a big game last time out against Florida with 22 Yeah I one of the things that ruckies really does is they Scout you very well and try to take away a lot of the things you like to do in your sets and they do it with their full Fort pressure thats a basket by Keller Lake in its last game only got seven points from players outside of the big four of Miller hild Salis and Carr Hyatt on the drive got tied up we get a held ball call possession arrow to ruers one of the things Ruckers would do offensively they like really like to space the floor and they like to dribble drive you thats going to be tough against wake because wake really plays the gaps you saw HTH right there and that Gap taken out away Griffiths three no good rebounded by car Miller can push Salis lines up a three and knocks it down thats what wake likes to do they like to get out they like to run they like their transition they need their transition to really work well for them tonight they dont want to get into a half court fight with this Ruckers team H it from the outside and right now for Steve pels Ruckers team coach defense is at of the offense the offense has been inconsistent through the early season well Ps team most of the time they the defense is a little bit ahead cuz thats what he lives off of so well and he does a great job defensively in the preparation and the guys understanding their Concepts you look at what ruter has done defensively this year among the best in the country in several categories last year it was the top defense in the Big 10 and wake has an defense that can score with anybody Noah Fernandez stepped out of bounds to transfer from UMass I dont understand why the why players dont understand what that out of bounds line is that is happening an a lot more this year than ever before a few years ago when they moved the arc back we saw it a lot in the corner yeah everybody tried to for the spacing so that they can get dribble penetration hildr Catch and Release to strong and the rebound to ruers Scarlet Knights struggled on the defensive glass last time out griet the Baseline Drive he turns it over here comes wake the other way H so good off the bounce gets the two its going to be important for Wake not to turn the basketball over they dont want to do anything to throw fuel on the fire with wake far transition Fernandez no good a rebound by hildr he had 18 and six last time against Florida working on the Freshman Griffiths a good defense there by gav griffi hilu is that guy guy that does a little bit of everything he can drive it he can knock down the three but the biggest thing he does is he gets the other players involved there there is Fon Reed you heard the Applause in the background the much B HED transfer from Gonzaga Steve Forbes told me last week coach he raises the ceiling for the entire season and for this entire team as poopy Miller knocks it down well coach for are really excited about getting him uh and being a part of this ball Club what he had not just on the court but off the court too with his leadership Music Applause you know one of the things I would tell you when you get smacked the year before and Ruckers really did a great job defensively against this way far team you remember that and Im sure coming into this game way fars has worked on some specific things to take advantage of their scoring opportunity wake off to a sizzling start Steve P wants a timeout another three by Boy Miller weight five of six from the field three of four from Beyond The Arc Fon Reed is checked in and cam hillworth never checked out third meeting all time between ruter and Wake Forest and when these two played last year it was not much of a contest ruter winning in a blowout fashion over at Jersey Mike Serena AKA what was formerly known as the Applause Music Music Applause rack that one no good from Austin Williams Ruckers eight possessions one for four from the field with four turnovers Millers had the hot hand early Reed tips it Applause Music Applause back okay rers has not been able to set up its press defensively Fernandez contested shot Reed with his first rebound is a demon Deacon one of the things way car is doing though in their secondary break theyre really trying to space the floor to give themselves some driving lanes and also be able to pass the ball inside you saw the pass there by Reed whos also a terrific passer in the low post and high post and that went off of the knee car it goes to Ruckers one of the things Ruckers did last year they really worked hard to take Carr away and not allowing him to have a lot of looks cuz that young man is a very very fine Music shooter they changed the call so went off of ruers and he goes back to wake Music underneath coach Forbes is really good at setting up out of bounds plays and he likes to set up some things where they can take advantage right away of a quick basket its almost like a special situations in Applause football instead of turnover three on two for workers wake getting back in defensive transition another Miss from the outside rebound coralled by the Scarlet Knights and they almost turn it over thats one of things wake for is really going to have to do theyre going to have to hold their home on the glass because if they dont do that that Ru is going to be able to score in transition theyre going to be able to score uh offensive rebounding especially kicking out and trying to knock down a couple threes Here Comes Williams driving dish almost lost it thats the one they call jike jichael Davis Simpson long through and Coach right now rers just not getting good shots well they havent the ball has not touched the paint its very difficult to be consistent offensively if the ball does not get into the pain area def Le and his first basket as a wait for stepen Deacon and a chance for a threepoint play and it came off of H and thats the thing I talk about HFF does so well is that he gets other people Applause involved there you see him beautiful pass right there Reed used his body to protect the ball and was able to get a a potential threepoint play so Reed goes to the free throw line Junior originally from Richmond Virginia started his career at LSU then Gonzaga and Hunter Salis both former zags on his team the free throw good and as good as these guards have been Miller Hil Salis I know cars are stretch four Reed gives you that true seven footer who can do so much from the low post he keeps the defense honest um you cant load up when only one person because you have to be able to guard him cuz he can post you at any point in time I really like the space in this W far team of plan right now the spacing in the pace of the game w six of nine from the field Parker freericks in gold in the Freshman of the Applause game found the drive a nice floater its a 130 Run for the Bea beacons you dont do that very often against this Ruckers defense Im telling you because they do a really good job of plugging the gaps and not giving you driving L wol Deni at The Rim but we get a foul wol gives rutus a physical presence inside hes really good on the offensive glass played football a lot in high school a lot of people thought he was going to go to school on a football scholarship but he gives him some physicality down there that is really necessary especially in the Big 10 you just saw three Forbes and know we mentioned with Reed coming back today the other reinforcement hes hoping hell have back it maybe a month or so is deari Monsanto coach Monsanto had the knee injury last year in the game against NC State hes one of the best Shooters in the ACC theyre hoping late December early January is a timetable I tell you what thats going to be scary for the ACC cuz he can flat out shoot it and adding the pieces that they added with Salis coming over who can really handle the ball you see them initiating there theyre going to be awful tough offensively to be able to handle and Steve Ford just does a tremendous job junior college coach paid his dues hes he the basketball lifer uh he just enjoy to be around rebound Tracked Down by pist the Applause swed Simpson really came on to the end of last year for ruter he was a freshman a season ago pom the Lefty from the corner that was a good shot by pom but again the ball never touched the plaint thats a awful tough way to live trying to be able to score without the ball getting in the paint either on a drive or a pass first field goal in about 5 and A2 minutes for ruter as the tear drop Falls for Applause Music Applause HRI again stting on the perimeter griffi contested and the rebound to Frederickson Applause Salis the defense he does a great job of breaking down the Deep hes the best oneonone player on that W forest team whenever they need a basket they run some action to get him on a clear out or he can dribble drive Music it everything staying on the perimeter for rter as Palmquist knocks down a three his third and fourth threes of the season coming in the Music sequence they just the ruers is not even really looking to go inside as of right now theyre just really being content to moving the ball on the perimeter and I dont know if there something that they saw in the scouting report that that they feel like thats the best way the tax far Steam Away Sal freed up by the screwing from the lead belongs to ruers wake up by 11 and the Fon Reed era has officially started and won for the Big Fellas with you on a Wednesday night coming up after us we send you to Little John second game of our double header undefeated number 24 Clemson hosting South Carolina the SEC ACC challenge or the ACC SEC challenge whatever you want to call it its over but little paletto State rivalry follows us here on accf and and that that one will be a good one South Carolina is is undefeated and Clemson is playing some of the best basketball in the ACC right now great this just a team that looks very connected and obviously in PJ Hall theyve got one of the best bigs in the ACC wake has done a really good job defensively so far recognizing some of the things Ruckers is trying to do theyve taken away their inside game and made them basically a jump shooting team so far five turnovers now for ruter to just three field goals and offense has been a struggl at times for ruter this year they have been winning games on the Str their defense and coaches said at least that a lot of times they get frustrated when theyre not when they dont score uh after playing really good defense and and they have breakdowns with that so thats one of the things hes really working with them doing concentrating and staying focused offensively and itll click hqu picked up the foul his first team Applause second Music Applause little action right now for R back there is Reed headed to the bench long three boy Miller no and were going to get a Bou on ruers underneath yeah g just that push one of the W players in front of him hell learned that hes not going to be able to get away with that thats just a flat push that young man has a bright future H off the catch and shoot coach Forbes is noted for his out of bounds SP getting a quick basket off those out of bounds sets high back and downhill D Keller comes over to help W from the Baseline and I dont know where that was going yeah watch this this is a set play its just a back screen right there H comes off of it gets the lob and scores it but you know right now I think Ruckers has to kind of settle down and figure fure out some other ways to attack this Wake Forest defense I think theyve got to get the ball inside either dribble drivve or throwing in the low post this is the ruers Press they like to pick up teams full court they havent shot it well early theyve turned it over which makes it hard to set up a big component of their defense Salis looking for Music Applause help Marion cannot connect Music Applause Fernandez the other way the basket does not count for floor Fernandez really likes to attack the basket hes probably been best in transition and hes the guy that kind of ignites him and gets him running began his career wiah State then UMass where he was one of the top guards in the A10 and now at r Massachusetts native Hyatt leading score for Applause ruter now theyre playing through the post a little bit horei goes to that little hook offensive rebound po too strong oh we get a tie up another held ball possession out the ruers but they got two really good looks on that possession probably and and that makes it much more effective they you see Omari right there and then because hes got the basketball he gets attention which creates weak side offensive rebounding opportunities its wake who had the possession Music Applause arrow Miller using the Keller screen dips under and hes got eight you know a lot of the coaches talk about and we talk about the top those four guys scoring a lot of points for away I dont necessarily see anything bad with that I think all four of those guys can score a lot of points no matter where they play because theyre capable offensive uh players and it just makees this wake offense really really difficult to guard especially in transition look at the speed of Miller and hes able to get the foul call one of the things Ruckers is known for is their transition defense they do not give up a lot of transition points the two things they do is dont give up a lot of transition points and not put guys on the foul line coach really harps on that a tremendous amount of time and uh they just have not been as effective defensively today as they normally are Keller knocks down the open three and thats to your point its got to be on The Scouting Report he can knock down that shot and again thats a ruus strength whos understanding scouting reports and taken away a lot of the things you like to do the well traveled Austin Williams hes on his fourth team he gets the two started Marist two years there three seasons at Hartford did not play last year at FIU you know Miller coming into this way for team as really the team is really taken to him hes been the quarterback and the leader although theyve got other guys hriff can play some point but they work better with Mill at the point Central Michigan transfer boy Miller led the triple and scoring a freshman and this time he just rips it away and then gets tangled Applause Music Applause up Wake Forest building off that Florida win has come out hot shooting 60 from the field born in the wild rare off the court for ruter tonight they get a commitment from Dylan Harper the number two player in the ESPN 100 hes the younger brother of former ruer star Ron Harper Jr and Coach right now ruter has two of the top three recruits in the country committed to play in is scataway this is a historic recruiting class for ruter Best in program history right now looking at a top five class Ace Bailey is the number three player when you look at the history of this program it speaks volumes to what Steve pel has built in his eight seasons with ruter well without question and you know Ive seen coach on the recruiting trails in the summer hes got a great staff there and uh all you got to do is go to uh the rack and uh that place is jumping and its a very difficult place to play and uh I know theyre really excited about this recruiting class of rers those guys are still a year away from joining right now ruter looking to dent a 16point deficit theres Reed left it short remember ruter last time out got into a big hole against Illinois got close when halftime showed up but were not quite complete the comeback Illinois pulled away in the second half Amore banging with Reed and gets the jump hook to go see but you know you cant wait till the six minute Mark and go to a more I mean I just think that even if he doesnt shoot the basket ball he creates attention defensively that you can get help and get other people open shots and weight just went right inside I mean it its just you have have to get the ball in the low post Five Points now for Reed his first game of the seasons Fernandez jab step and nicely done knocks it down for ruers his first field Music Applause Music goal wakers learning to play with weed pretty easy and he open up car yeah its going to open up a lot for this offense which is dangerous given what theyve done without him offensively Reed against omore didnt really have much of an angle and thats one of the best defensive post players in the Big 10 without question he was he was very much off balance from that shot High posting up Reed came to help Hernandez so quick off the BS hes got for see thats what I like and thats the way Ruckers play you see Fernandez I mean he he didnt settle for the jump shot he got the ball in the paint you make the defense collapse you get a chance to go to the foul line thats the type of pressure you have to put on people defensively especially on the road HRI over to Miller weak side rebound by Carr and he gets tied Applause up car really improved uh hes become much more a physical player I think this year I saw him in Charleston uh and he really played well there theyve asked him especially early without Reed to play the five quite a bit hes really a stretch four by trade but shows he can bang down Music low I tell you with he and Reed theyre going to have two formidable post guys that are going to be difficult to guard cuz both of them can step away both of them now playing pretty crial inment little heat check from Fernandez rers have made four straight or M and thats going to be a tra you know I I I think he anticipated the contact instead of catching the ball more and buying the defense and then scoring watch Carr right there see the physicality you know he creates his Applause space coach they letting them play its like the old Big East I wouldnt go that far back now but that was I coached in that old Big East that that that that was a different animal but they are they are allowing to play and the only thing coaches ask towards consistency and this officiating cre been consistent Salis draws the foul the G zaga transfer they hope he can be their next impact guard they had Alis Williams coming over from Oklahoma was ACC Player of the Year Tyree applebe last year from Florida led the league in scoring we remind you Sunday womens basketball double header here on accn first of noon Florida GF Coast in Duke followed by Kentucky and number 18 Louisville we wait for us has come out this first half and is let Ruckers know that theyre not going to shut them down like they did last year Im telling you when you take it when you take a loss like that that sits with you for a while players dont forget coaches dont forget and this way clam has come out and play with a lot of purpose and Coach you would have to think if you saw the video that wake for us posted it was an emotional moment when Fon Reed was granted his eligibility from the NCA X theres got to be a domino effect on that for the other guys on the roster oh without question because he practices with them and they see what he can do day to day and they know he adds a certain not just and again the coaches constantly St its not just his basketball its his leadership its the understanding of the game its being a good teammate and those things just make this way far team better Miller from the Baseline had his shot Music blocked ruter starting to heat up they have made five of the last six but wake still leads by a dozen say youre looking for the perfect present you might try looking at the perfect the waiver needed as a twotime transfer from the NCAA and Steve Forbes announcing it to the rest of the team we were just talking about that when you have a player with his skill set and his potential the guys know what he has boy that can lift an entire team and weve seen that early in this half well we have but also this W for team is a team of built on culture and W farest team is very close the4 has done a great job and so it meant a lot to them for as much work as hes put in to be able to play nice play there by Carr another terrific inbound display call by Steve Forbes to beat the shot clock Hyatt its another three hes got nine all three his field goals from Deep you know hes a streaky shooter and when he gets hot it really changes the dynamic of this Ru offense and this is a very important time for uh Wake Forest because they played a really good first half they really want to go in the halftime with a working margin and not let Ru cwl back in this thing too close s on the drive tied up and hes going to draw the foul its on Simpson first and thats one of the things Ruckers does defensively they really come over weak side help and shut down driving lane they dont give you a free run at the basket every shot at the bask his challenge pardon me thats actually Simpson second foul so he heads to the bench has not scored yet and three pass to Reed against omore who had eight blocks left last time out and omore just picked up his second foul Reed is very physical Bo he does not like the the the physicality hes telling the referees that hes the guy banging me not me banging him and thats what P was saying its funny to see big guys go at each other now its a throwback you just dont see it in basketball like you used to weed hasnt played in a while so hes anxious to get on the board accp with Mark Packer Taylor tanom weekday from Marks Charlotte studio in his basement its at 4 Eastern well keep talking about the college football playoff all things ACC right here on acc and Taylors of Florida State Alum so Im sure shes got a lot to say these days theres Fernandez whos made some nice plays at the controls for ruers Hs got nine to lead the Scarlet Knights driving Baseline throws it up giving him 11 to lead all Music scores hayatt has really had a hot hand but hes been very aggressive whenever hes gotten the basketball he looked to penetrate and try to create scoring opportunities workers within 10 wakes largest lead was 18 drive and kick hildr gets space left it short offensive rebound Reed no good its knocked out of bounds last touch ruter with Maran going for the rebound you know its funny how one guy can change the dynamic of the team re coming into the game has made great far much more physical as a basketball team poopy Miller follows his Miss and turns it over high up ahead no good by Davis W in for two on recors gets to within single digits 108 to go first half time out 3729 wait Mo Buffalo huh yeah Purina One yeah I used to feed Purina One but then I read the ingredients oh yeah yeah its right there chicken rice flour corn gluten meal whole grain corn chicken by product meal whats in blue debone chicken chicken meal brown rice barley oatmeal yeah but those ingredients cost a lot more blue is only about 50 cents more a day thats not too much for my Music Chester with Perry Clark and his Rob coach what has allowed ruers to get back in this game attacking the basket uh they changed their philosophy early about the first 10 minutes they were settling for perimeter shots uh after that they really started getting the ball into the low post they started driving the ball more and to became much more aggressive and its allowed them to get back in this basketball game Ruckers has made four of its last five field goals theyre on an 188 run a weight led by as many as 18 and a half hildr using the read stream he can knock that down not this time rebound wol Fernandez got that great first Music step wol over Reed Baseline J is good and its a two possession game with 30 seconds to go in the half W has really stepped up both rebounding the basketball and creating some low post treasures and that is help to change the flow of this basketball game HRI off the bouns kicks the re that doesnt go Mar and the follow and it belongs to wake 3 and 12 seconds to go on the game clock wers played a really good first half but I know coach G would wish that they were maybe a little bit further ahead because they have really played well and pretty much controled this first half final ticks Reeds going to have to put it off he does and it doesnt go wake got off to look for ruers to try to attack like they did at the end of the first half gits the Freshman with the three and the rebound cored by Applause Applause Reed Corner three by Salis noow Reed was looking for the putb instead out of bounds you know its interesting now wake is learning to play with two legitimate big guys and thats no disrespect to the other guys that were playing it but you know Reed just gives a different dimension both with his physicality and the side so you know with he and car you got two legit big guys that can play inside and outside the Hustle by Boy forc him to turn Applause over and Coach its one thing to do that in practice its another when you do it against live competition for the first time oh without question I mean and uh its interesting because I I really think that this Wake Forest team offensively has a lot of weapons shot clock winding down hilr contested too strong tipped out heres Miller on the drive and it rolls in hes got rers done he give up a lot of offensive rebound more could position down low and puts it in over the car its almost been like Omari they havent really found him in this game they havent figured out how to utilize him in this game like they do a lot of times in their other game um they havent really hit him in a lot of pick and rolls they havent really tried to thr to him in the low post Reed for three thats the one thing that hasnt worked for him he go for three from Deep Simpson the two fouls in that first half with a nice move at the 10 and ruers down by as many is 18 at one point now with in four first basket for Simpson Salis the teams leading score 19 a game driving on the true sophomore Simpson balance and thats what makes him such a tough player to guard he really is but rucky has done a pretty good job of shutting him down and youre one of the Le defensive teams in the country you have the ability to take certain things away and theyve taken solid away Hyatt gets bailed out by the foul hell get hildr his first big time drive right there and again we talk about attacking the basket and there thats what you like to see uh that kind of play out of Silence cuz thats what hes able to do clear aside you let him go oneonone and normally good things happen to you Andre hayatt at the free throw line for ruter 50e senior Ts leading score one of the tri captains and tonight hes busted out of a shooting slum hes got 12 on the night four five from the field he was just five of 22 last two games hes three of four from deep and had come in getting just three of his last 14 from downtown you know this game is really I think important to wake fars CU this would be a quality win against a quality opponent a team that probably will be in postseason play and it will not only help wake far it will help the lead Reed missed the Lefty hook now sets the screen for Salis Salis off balance Reed may have gotten his way here comes Simpson rers can make it a onep possession game Simpson from the elbow 4138 and he has really gotten hot uh they have tremendous hopes for this young man when he he him coming in they think he can be one of the most prolific scores that theyve had there at Ruckers in a while and hes really stepped up tonight Miller able to draw the foul if thats on Mor thats going to be number three they get Griffiths its his second you know Amore just not really gotten in the flow of this game I think um the physicality that been played in that low post with the banging and all like that has kind of limited some of his offensive opportunities and with both car and Reed is taken away from his ability to dominate on blast Im sorry I was going to say omore is an old school player in the sense that this is a kid who turned down opportunities in the off season to go elsewhere even go pro and Coach you dont hear this too often the reason he came back for his fourth year at rups was to graduate with a degree and I wish you hear more of that CU thats an important part of college hes a Dean list student majoring in information Technologies closing in a th career points with ruter third in the country in blocks this season Is got a dozen through the traffic and able to draw the foul Music rers has closed this deficit supp for the scar night the strike when we get back this is gamechanging research that help save lives you can join the fight against cancer by visiting vorg 100 of your donation goes directly to cancer research Applause Music get another held ball off the free throw Miss its going to go to wake but ruter is within one possession after Hyatt hit a free throw 4239 in what was once an 18point game and now they can get their defense up and they become a lot more aggressive when they go to their four defense Simpson went flying no Applause call reached in re is a terrific passer one of the things rers does defensively they take away your threes they really do a good job taking away those looks heres the drive and Dish they closed quickly on hildr Miller has it open three offive rebound read fresh 20 excellent ballc from the outside it always happens whenever you have an offensive rebound it always see thats the easiest way to knock down a three you get the defense in Trans in transition in a scramble mode Simpson no tipped up batted out to Davis ruter really struggled rebounding the ball against Illinois last time out minus 28 on the glass the Scarlet Knights in that game had 18 defensive rebounds Illinois had 19 offensive rebounds as the Scarlet Knights get called for a Trav wake does a great job of moving the basketball uh theyve got really good passers and they step up and they knock down the three and thats what theyre going to have to wind up doing being able to knock down some threes and I think part of the reason Ruckers has gotten back is because of the fact theyve limited wakes offensive opportunity to shoot the three a wake today just five of 19 from three hit a couple of Threes early not much since rushes with the Press its forcing weight to operate you see where they are they half court theyre extending them offensively down finishes with two hands and thats the dimension for Reed that he brings with r te because he can we can isolate him one onone and he can finish players thats also the danger of pressing out and giving this offense space over far knocked out BS by W great spacing right there Reed uses his body and able to finish at The Rim you see how he seals off the defender so he can finish and theres no weak side help because they raised the weak side and thats a shooter over there coach Im telling you its going to create conflict once wake gets into the ACCC youre going to press out on these shooters respect these guards and youre going to let big number four work oneonone with room down low its a its a dangerous gamage well it is for the opponents and one that coach is really looking forward to uh because this weight team is really efficient offensively when they can get that low post scoring like that we havent talked about we havent talked about car being able to pop up to the foul line and knock down threes there thats a long two from Alis and om couldnt Coral the rebound Friendly Fire rers got to with three and wake has responded the lead back up to eight you know ruter has flowed in and out offensively as far as getting the ball into the pain area they were very successful with it for a while and they seem to have gone away from the last couple minutes foul on Austin Music Williams I love when players are given officials clinics on defense you never did that as a coach they never listen to me they never listen they just said per go to Applause now offensive rebound and hes able to draw the foul wake is not a team you want to put into the bonus through the double bonus they are an outstanding free throw shooting team 80 as a squad and that is the third team foul on ruers and that is something thats against ruers DNA you know they really like to take away what you like to run they really like to not give you threes and they really like not to put you on the foul Catch and Release the fresh is of Steve forb says is one of the best Shooters hes ever signed eight unanswered by wake Fernandez blocked from Applause behind what is gone back to trying to space the floor and and dribble drive to attack the defense ficks knocks down the three at one end coming over the top on the Music Applause other omore too strong rers is gone more three minutes since its last basket wake gives it right back Davis to Fernandez through the contact off the front rim and he will get rewarded with two shots but thats okay thats the way ruy wants to play they have to continue to attack like that and uh get to the foul line and thats the way that they can cut this lead they got him back in the ball game the first time they can get back in it the same way its Kellers first its only the fifth foul that lake has committed an entire game tonight at 10 after our Men Basketball double header but nothing but net crew breaks down tonight in the ACC with highlights an analysis all the mens games and a look ahead at the best games on the schedule in the coming week its right here on accn Coach I know were going to be watching the game that follows us as well Clemson and South Carolina a couple of unbeaten teams and obviously time P State rers well it is that game means an awful lot there in the state recruiting wise and just Pride so its going to be a really exciting game Clemson is really playing well the win over pit I I really impressed because thats a really good Pittsburgh basketball team HRI for three the rainbow gold carrying a rebound right now rolling the offensive glass Sal from the outside in and out rebound snatched byi Fernandez machete through the defense and hes got two shots the foul on Kelly Parker Frederickson The Freshman from Bixby Oklahoma knocking down the triple for the beaks great spacing they they you see e with the dunk right there then you have fredon knocking down a three they really do a good job of spacing the floor and when they space it like that it gives them more driving lanes and they can also dump the ball into the low post Steve Forbes team one of their Achilles heels was rebounding today plus six on the glass more importantly 13 offensive rebounds to ruer seven and Coach a 162 edge in second half a second chance points well theyve been really aggressive and uh would you say getting a guy El could have a little bit something to do with that now I mean because it just changes the whole dynamic of everything I think that this way for team it also feels like youre turning in what was a relative weakness in rebounding to now at worst neutral possibly a strength well yeah again hes making him a physical team because because of his physicality everybody else is stepping out they see rushers with their pressure and thats one of the things that they do really well to try to control the tempo of the game but that young man right there it makes a huge difference in the way wake fars plays basketball as he gets more and more comfortable with his new teammates and when you look at the landscape of the ACC and specifically the big men in the League this year what sort of impact can Eon Reed have Music uh huge because because of his physicality and because of his versatility uh you know he can play inside he can play outside he L his feet real well as ruers is knocking down another three right there if if ruers can shoot threes like that theyll get back in this basketball game they need their guards to step up and really start to attack the baset there you see a a dribble Drive kicks it out and thats where you can make some hay shooting the three you got to get some penetration you have to attack the basket collapse the defense then move the Applause basketball Fernandez after hitting the three just picked up his second Applause foul the game of runs and now its ruter on a 70 run Hernandez has 11 points in high it Leed the way and now thats two more give him 13 and this is the closest ruers has been since very early on Fernandez Lov to score the basketball its its nice to watch guys that like to score and can Music score he plays with fearlessness ruers got a firsthand glimpse of that a few years ago at Mass had a game winning three against ruter and now Steve pel says you can do that for us one of the things that Ruckers theyre not going to theyre not going to back away I mean theyve been in these type of games before Coach P has done a tremendous job there at rers then this has got a long ways to go this is not over right Applause Music now well missed by Miller 82 free throw shooter Here Comes Reed checking back in for wake you know we talk about roles changing you know Millers role now changes with Wake Forest because now hes got a legitimate low post player to throw the ball into so now hes got to give be able to do that and also get CAU his shots because hes really been a factor throughout the course of the season so you know as a point guard hes got to recognize the weapons that hes got in his schol box and hes got to be able to disperse the basketball to make him effective whats the adjustment you have to make as a coach because now youre also coaching a different version of your team well I think a lot of it is done in film work I think a lot of it is done and just how you game plan and take advantage of matchups which has become even more important as the season goes on the good news for Wake is Reed while he was waiting for that NCAA waiver was able to practice with the team Maran against Griffith freshman on freshman and he see sometimes what happens to freshman they get they get too deep and you cant get in a position to where you drive the basketball take the ball so deep that you dont have Outlet or cant either finish at The Rim or kick it to someone thats my Music fear when you cant Music swim you dont want to go too deep stay in the shallow Music Applause end herandez gets free launches that would have tied it ruus very rarely gives up easy baskets they do a good job getting back in transition when I when I talk to people I asked you know a lot of times teams do that they they dont they dont send everybody to the glass they get two three guys back but Ruckers will send guys to the glass but its just a point of emphasis by coach you know no matter what we do what we run we have to get back we dont give up easy transition baskets meanwhile hildr at the free throw line he is 29 of 32 entering play Sunday womens basketball double header on accn Florida G Coast at Duke at noon followed by Kentucky and Louisville for Steven deons looking to string backto back quality non Conference win B Florida last Wednesday up five now on lers Scarlet Knights two losses this year to Princeton and Illinois they have a win against Georgetown this is a game with the result impacts not just both teams but both conferences late in the season Williams on the drive another rebound by Reed almost had it taken away down rebounds for Fon Reed Miller New Jersey traffic able to draw the foul and thats one of the things Millers able to do he really is tough with the basketball hes physical you know hes small the sizewise but hes able to get in the lane and finish there and I just think that you know hes really has been the leader of this basketball team and the way the guys have stepped up and kind of followed him has been something that coach has kind of hung his hat on Noah Fernandez picked up his third foul wake is in the Music Applause bonus it is going to be very important for Wake to finish this out defensively theyre have to and be able to St this team is going to be very agressive I to be driving the basketball a lot more as we go Applause down and that represents for wake a growth opportunity we know they can win with offense and theres Reed showing off the defense the block at the Applause rib Salis off the bounce drops it off for Reed one more comes back to Miller the three great spacing on the floor the ball never Stu they move the ball around late far team is very defense to offense you can set it to Mozart boy Miller is third three hes got 17 wake entered play as the only team in the country with four players averaging better than 16 points per game car today only has four but there is now a fifth beetle in Winston Salem coach I tell you what Mr Reed has stepped up and hes made his presence known that rebounding the basketball being a factor and uh it just gives them one more tool in the two box offensively to be effective two points away from a double double in his deeps debut wake in the midst of an 80 long after ruers got with him Applause two look for Ruckers to try to space the floor and dribble R Williams he gets Tied Up Down Low Trav thats the help defense from Reed 741 to go in regulation Lake Forest by Music 10K should be a good one that follows Us South Carolina at Clemson Tigers the number 24 team in the country undefeated as are the Gamecocks that game follows us tonight here on accn Wake saw their lead dwindle to two the DS have never trailed in this game theyve led by as many as 18 and then theyve used an 80 run to give them some cushion for ruter you know you mentioned it earlier its kind of been inconsistent it comes and goes the offense in waves and they havent really been able to get over that hump and and pulled it even well they have not you know theyve gotten back but defensively I think this is where Ruckers has to step up and really make this stand download a re the double does some come the tip in by car and the foul you know weve been talking about this but we just give them a different Dynamic I mean normally you see car shoot threepoint shots and floating around the perimeter now hes hes underneath because Reed is collapsing the defense and hes weak side crashing and hes getting tipin the whole dimension of how wake has been able to play up to this point has changed and its all because of Reeds presence in that low post Fernandez picks up his fourth foul youre right that entire play is created because hayatt we saw him should I double should I go in the moment he does you leave the weak side over open and and I just think that you know this weight team is evolving you know and I think tonight is the first night of of the evolution but um I like the chemistry I like the way that they share the basketball and uh you theyre going to be a tough out now you got basically the balance of December to get comfortable playing live games with Fon Reed and then conference gets going really in Earnest December 30th with Virginia Applause Techs defense on Mory has been Stellar as well has just four points tonight hes got to give it up Hyatt contested three front rim battle for the board Williams block Ry Miller accelerates the other way Miller to the basket C plus the foul Big Time drive that time by Miller and thats the transition you know weit is able to get easy baskets and normally this Rucker team does not give up easy baskets like that look at the aggressiveness going after the rebound block and now on the push out Millers taking the ball and hes attack in the rim and hes able to finish Ruck just does not give up easy go ahead coach no the Ruckers just doesnt give up easy baskets like that you I talk a lot of coaches about their program and thats the one thing they said they just dont give up easy baskets and its a lot of it has to do with with weight for our team it was 50 48 at one point weight with the 140 Blitz high its three for that one comes to Miller ahead to HRI off at The Rim Applause Hyatt has 13 only two in the second half Ro deflected Millers hands are everywhere I like the way this W for team can change defenses and now you know Salis goes to the point hes initiating they take Miller off the ball help coming from H coach with the addition of Fon Reed tonight we have just seen a team go from a finesse team to one that can play now both with finess and with physicality without question I mean they can they can disco but they can also play a little Jazz so I mean they they they are really versatile and the thing is I mean they you can tell this team likes playing together the way they share the basketball theyre very unselfish Miller a little tear drop as your coach what are the signs you look for when you want to see unselfishness from your team sharing the basketball thats first and foremost giving the ball up to a guy with an easier shot congratulate your teammate I mean um and playing defensively together it is a Wake Forest Avalanche 16 unanswered and the DS have regained an 18 point Advantage USAA yeah they have awesome rates on coverage for our car home and stuff she has a lot of stuff dad a lot of cool stuff honey but USAA also has banking credit cards and loans plus advice and other perks only for emergencies thanks Mom and its all in one spot so we know shes all set because weve got USAA USAA more than you might think for the military community and their families ruter Trail by 18 in the first half got two at 50 to 48 since then all8 forced 16 unanswered by the Demon Deacons ruers has got more than 5 minutes since its last basket theyve missed their last eight shots well yeah High it carried them in the first half and really initiated that run but theyre playing with some R is playing with some young people I mean Simpsons is going to step up and hes going to play well for him Grifford is is a freshman hes a really really good score he he is struggled here in the second half and so but you know you expect this sometimes on the road and then their defense has not turned into easy opportunities for wresters that that they normally get and so you know now this is a learning experience but this is a fine basketball team and Im telling you if weight can hold on this win will mean a lot later on in the season because this R team is going to beat a lot of people for ACC fans who havent follow the rers and the P this is a team that really is in its best stretch in almost 40 years theyve been to the ncwa tournament two of the last three seasons 500 or better in a r 10 in four straight Seasons theyve had four straight winning seasons something they done in about 30 years on the drive get blocked to coach oh by the way you might as well get your licks on ruers right now because as of now two of the top three recruits in the country are committed to the Scarlet Knights oh let me their program is in really really good shape and that gentleman right there is one of the outstanding coaches in the in in the business and he just does a great job not just in developing his team but also developing young men he played his college ball Steve P did at Yukon and his first year with the Huskies was Jim Calhouns first year at Applause Yukon now I can tell you hes got story anybody that plays for Coach C he is one of the finest coaches but he he does not hide his feelings in a lot of things so that LE you with a lot of stories all right so now you got to give us your best C story I got to tell you when I was at Miami our football team had just won the national championship and they were introducing them at halftime and it took a little longer than what coach koun wanted and he was about to tell his team to go in there and interrupt their celebration and I said Jim Im not so sure those guys really want to interrupt the Miami football team and take them off the basketball court and he and he deferred to to uh discretion discretion sometimes the better done today theyve got everybody involved and its made them a better basketball team and you can tell the chemistry of a team when they look for their teammates they get easier shots and thats exactly what wake has done see the ball never sticks they move it to the open guy guys a shot ready because theyre anticipating it and its been very very effective for this Wake Forest team today we have seen Steve life back of this program Griff misses trying to get back to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2017 and again theres a lot of basketball to be played theres play up ahead at the end of this month and obviously into the new year but with Eon Reb back wake and Steve Force got a huge piece to the jigsaw puzzle and if deari Monsanto can come back and just be a shooter thats another weapon for this team and the Demon Deacons become a very dangerous out in the ACC and most likely in March as you look at the upcoming schedule with the deeps you talk about him just being a shooter thats like telling a fat kid you got to like cake I mean he loves to shoot the basketball now I mean that hes got a big smile he cant wait to get back and be a part of this just to clarify was not fat shaming Santo one of the best Shooters in the ACC and they were working on him becoming more of an allaround player but again the way this team is constructed that guys a microwave he can heat up quickly hoping to have him back at the end of the month or early in January you know the Wake fors program historically had been to me a family type of program I mean Tim dcan you know a family type of guy I mean he loved the environment there Chris Paul loved the environment there you know and and theyve had a lot of you know really outstanding players have gone to wake and it is a its a family type of environment and coach for fixed that and it created this team and that kind of image where theyre talented but they but theyre family oriented they play well together they do the little things they care about each other and hes just done a fantastic job that L hes come in 19 wins last year 25 wins two seasons ago 23 conference the last couple of years and thats going to be out of bound joh Miller good defense there by jich Davis yeah and again we talk about this Ruckers team they got a lot of young pieces and you talked about whats coming and uh but the pieces that they have is really good enough to play um you know have an opportunity to play you know in close season and you this will be a learning experience for them and because they played against an awful good basketball team tonight Davis gets the basket they get Miller with a foul earlier Davis now have to at that point in the game right yeah but referees always want guys to be friends man you cant compete against somebody for 40 minutes and then want to be their friend I mean you you you cant you got watch what you say you got to have sportsmanship but to get guys to try to be friends after after you played against them for 40 minutes is a very difficult job and these officials are really fine officials that we Applause have now Ruckers team that came in giving up less than 60 a game thats given up 71 now to Wake Forest and Eon Reed in his Wake Forest debut offers a double double 10 points 12 rebounds and maybe more than anything his defense on omore was outstanding omore has not been a factor tonight he is not and the physicality that he brought and the other thing I like the way its affected car I mean you know car has not been hunting threes hes the post area hes been offensive rebounding hes been posting up and so its really changed his game its going to be interesting to see down the line how cars maturity and how they really work together because I think youre talking about two Co guys that really have the ability to score yeah before Reed again the struggle for w Forest had been on the glass and the games that they had lost their rebounding deficiency showed now last time out against a very good Florida team even though Florida was missing their starting center the gator had a lot of size and wake outrebounded Florida by one tonight plus nine on the glass against ruers but more importantly 15 offensive rebounds and theyve got a 216 Edge in Second Chance points and the other thing is I mean defensively I I think that this W forest team has stepped up and played pretty well I yeah I theres no question the game last year has been on their minds it eats at you um because R really dismantled them and took them out of everything that they wanted to run and they were determined you can see after the beginning of the game to come in and execute offensively weight in this game never trail from the outside hes a terrific shooter in his second three of the season but his reputation a sharp shooter R freshman from Music Buffalo time six to go you coach is still coaching I mean this is just December hes still coaching and there going to be moments that theyre going to have where hes going to explain to him this is how you have to do things this you have the way you have to handle things you got a young bunch and but this is a really really good MO and they got to get back in Action this weekend theyll play SU Hall in what is technically a neutral sight game at the credential Center thats a big Jersey rivalry ruers and SE Hall I tell you what theyll be ready for that and and I can understand his love of Defense havt been around Jim C because you know those Connecticut teams were very very good defensively and you talk about rebuild that Jim did in Connecticut that has continued to today is just amazing now take whatever Benchmark you want over the last 25 30 years plus and no ones got more titles than Yukon you know and and and when Jim first got there I mean people didnt even know which scores were was and I mean he just did an outstanding job with that great loving personality that he has when you drive up there youre going through cow past just to give you an idea of how hard it would be to recruit to a place like that he not only got good talent he got great talent and and and the Loyalty that that he created by all those that played for him were on his staff and everything is just amazing and his Hall of Fame induction I mean it was full of Comm CH from the corner you think of that first title in 99 with Eline and Dick BOS Rip Hamilton knocking off Duke in one of the better Championship Games weve seen fell down this really good win for L and uh coach fls has to feel really good ly Miller out the Applause two theres a three hes got 23 his four threepointer two points off the career high and Lake Forest with an impressive effort at home tonight theyre tough to beat on this floor the demon deons with a 16 consecutive home win 24 straight non conference home win and coaching their last 40 games at the Joel theyre about to be 35 and five you know I mentioned some of the Wake fars Grace I got to I got to name our own Randolph chers cuz he was a very special Applause de somewhere that ACC T of crossover still Music lives another good one Mugsy BS I mean you didnt put on the Flor around that guy but Im just telling you this is way CL has always been a very special place and the people that have come and played here and the way the fans have treated their players with such a respect and its just been a love affair CH launches called The Rebound and thatll do
