theyve been scoring at a high flip at the start of this campaign well Tobin Anderson if you follow those teams like I have over the years they do one thing they go up and down the floor and it starts with the guards and Robertson Singleton both both played for Tobin Anderson at stack and he brought him with him and so far so good at the division one level for those two fdu is in blue pit is in the home whites Helen Miller will throw it up at the air ftu controls on the road and were underway from Pittsburgh fdu team coming in at three and three this is the top scoring team out of the Northeast conference last year a conference turn of the championship Was Won by Bryant so its its moves to the America East Roberts the key guy in and outs theyre gonna play with confidence theyre not afraid they went on the road to Loyola Chicago and took them to overtime they had the game pretty much sealed Loyola made a desperation shot at the end of regulation so this team is going to come in here tonight not intimidated in the Pitts starting five they want a lot more production out of Nelly Cummins the ball handler hes a transfer from Colgate here along with Elliot whos been big at the start of this season five to shoot your question Tim is this one goes long as how does the length of hit can test against fdu well theyre gonna have to contain them in the in the half court off the dribble because those guards will do that Singleton misfires and this team was built around Huguley and its a healthy addition for him just his second start for this pit team look at a rebound after that 11 win season last year again a straightaway triple foreign from the top and its not where they want his bread to be buttered but if you dont plan from out there he can make you pay golf of a fourpoint win over VMI pull up J is good for blygen hes third on the team in scoring its a lot of depth of scoring for this fdu team under Tobin Anderson in his first year its a D1 head coach coming from St Thomas Aquinas College after he was going to throw multiple presses at you hell Run and Jump theyll press in the full core and threequarter Court as well that is a theme of Tobin Andersons teams is that full court press but Pitt has been used to that in playing games against VCU and of course press Virginia in West Virginia under Huggins Music theres Roberts trying to get on the board and does thats the issue that Pitts going to have because FD really does a nice job of spacing the floor they move the ball they move it off the catch off the pass and also on ball reversal if you dont close out properly they will take you into the gaps off the bounce Roberts that student transfer on this team over 1500 points at D2 school at St Thomas Aquinas second most points in the NAC they go to hugely down low unfinished business for him in and out for Elliot that time all in nicely there and put back home by Hinson thats where you may have an issue tonight their guards have to get involved on the backboards an eye on that rebounding figure as this one goes along fell on this end called by milliner up that 11 win season but on the bulletin board he told us to shoot around they needed to improve shooting this is his most experienced team hes had since hes been here yeah you dont know where when to get your shots against the defense and all that comes with practice practice game work and they have not been able to get a consistent group together on the practice floor starting with in October when they they got going with practice and they look like theyre getting whole and but the schedules not getting easier the games are coming rapidly starting with this one tonight which is a scary one for Pitt time to shoot for f to you again out of the corner nicely done by Moore also another player coming from St Thomas Aquinas and that is a theme to keep in mind as this matchup rolls along multiple players coming from that D2 stop of Tobin Anderson and his staff hes trying to break out of this footboard press to scrambling press its hard to simulate in practice but the size of Pittsburgh should be they should have an advantage to be able to throw over the top against the pressure four to shoot here for Burton with the ball from 15 lets just say on this under the floor here for Pitt Music man Tobin Anderson in his first year leading this fdu team coming from Saint Thomas Aquinas where he was for the last nine years if you take a snapshot of the last five years for Tobin Anderson of any coach out of New York he compiled him the most wins out of it D1 or D2 coach in the last five years hailing from New York City well everyone in New York knows Tobin Anderson is a grinder hes a guy that just has worked his way up through the profession started D3 at Clarkson was an assistant at Siena as well head coach at Hamilton College so hes worked his way to have this opportunity very happy to see fdu going in his Direction he deserves it theres Elliott the transfer for Marquette as the shot clock winds down here for Huguley double team there that was stripped by Roberts hugely with a nice Hustle but it will be a shot clock violation that will bring us to our first time out well welcome back to hugely here at Pitt its his second start this year but his Panthers are down by two early on really going here at hits they have definitely been bitten by the injury bug this year so hugely is a guy that missed almost six weeks Burton didnt play last game of that win over Alabama State and Jeffersons well were told is going to miss considerable time well hugely it is the big key they need all their pieces of course when youre trying to dig out of get your program back to where you think you need to be and I think they have the pieces I like their team its just that they have to get used to playing with each other and right now theyre having a problem getting Euclid but the baller throwing the ball at the high post or the top of the key and fdu is just getting up in his chest that last possession he just tried to put it on the deck very much a new look team for pit five returners eight new players of those five returners three were starters last year and hugely of course LED pitton scoring last year cash again over 14 a game fdu again very deep into the shot clock and Nelly coming going because thats what Jeff cable and the staff want to see him flourish more so that he has the previous games and Burton drains a triple yet again you lay off a little bit he can make you pay with that but youre youre exactly right Cummins need 623s last year for Colgate and so far this year hes three for 20 and he was huge for Colgate in fact they won their Patriot league tournament Applause he went to the NCAA tournament and actually lost to Wisconsin but had 20 points in that NCAA Tournament game hes going to be big for Pitts continuing this season for the Panthers Applause problematic for pitch though they score on one end with bird with the jumper and get beat over the top and transition do a better job of sprinting back and that time they threw over the top against the Press but they just couldnt finish the opportunity from Midland Pennsylvania its a its a homecoming of sorts of a Beaver County native in Pennsylvania went to Lincoln Park High School in Cummings playing nearly in his backyard well its happened and were talking with Jeff Capo about it before I mean you grow up and you really really want to go to a program I mean he grew up idolizing Pittsburgh didnt go to Pittsburgh went to Bowling Green when the Colgate wasnt recruited by here until this past year and you know sometimes you get to a place and you put so much pressure on yourself that you dont you forget about just playing basketball I think Jeffs doing a nice job of coaching him just saying Nelly Cummings you need to just go out and play play your game dont worry about anything else dont worry worry about where you are just go out and have fun and play the game then I think everything will settle in for Cummings if he starts thinking that in that direction so for this fdu team two starters have scored along with two bench players more still out there for this team keep an eye on Lamont as well he could shoot it from the outside too you know in Blue on the ball here Roberts a trouble and throw it away to Burton theres Cummings For Thread its a pit team thats shooting a lot more threes this year than they did the start of the season last year its a percentage that needs to improve they were dead last in the ACC shooting last year this year shooting just a hair but about 50 but Jeff Capel says the says this year does two and three records well theyve got to get better looks though theyve got to make sure they space the floor and get their looks in their within their offense I think thats key when you watch Pitt they sometimes get out of their offense or the shot selections a little too quick see the numbers theyre great on paper but theyre taking more again on that Big Board was they needed to improve the shooting and experience that theyre getting from the transfer portal schools from around the country out of bounds play by pit freeing on Pinson on the outside he had a lot of time just to Lock and Load expensive and holding a fourpoint edge theres lamotes theres it up here its obligent please pull up for him they do a really good job after you of driving into the gaps with their head up and then pivoting on two feet and just turning to the outside looking for the open man trying to slide into an open area on the perimeter the BMI gaming the last game they had more of that Relentless press full court but getting back here against this team with older lengths Left To You Down by two as Graham coming in for the first time got stripped Roberts over to lamote for three way off oh Applause my God Cummings trying to get on the board from three and will Music IE Cummings that Jeff cable brought to campus just a guy who can run the team but in transition if you back off him he can knock it down hes the biggest Skies making his six starts now that time for Roberts one of three from the field hummings again backtoback trays its lamote with the board Music foreign Music in the start tonight for him hes back to back buckets for him and hes down by three right now to this pit team well Pitt is having some problem guarding fdu in the half court because theyre switching one through five and that time you saw he has Graham get caught on a guard he did a pretty good job of sliding moving his feet thought he took one in the chest or maybe even in the nose but it didnt go his way good looking player he and his brother coming out of Spain IMG down in Bradenton Florida the great program down there they were coached by Jimmy Carr former excellent college basketball coach as well Associated coach Tim McGraw is credited for getting both Jorge Diaz Graham and Guillermo Diaz program the twins weve all home in our first half good job by Pitt attacking that press driving into the Gap and then finding the open man the open trailer before fdu could match up on the perimeter sleep for the Panthers here at sixth they really do a great job moving the ball you have to have your head on a swivel if youre not in a stance Guardian fdu is going to be very difficult from the weak side because theyre in constant motion they use a good spacing look like uh Cummins maybe walk but theyll get them with Fowler yeah the foul is going to be that time on blush into his three and three at this start hit though the nice resurgent up by three if youre a third game plan coming in was about threepoint shooting getting shots within the context of their offense nice out of bounds play on this set but also attacking the pressure to score dont be hesitant use your size for over the top and drive it into the gaps and look for Open men and so far its so good for Jeff cable this shooting continues not only tonight but down the road pit will be a different basketball team and earns going to be one of those guys Tim that has to continue to step up second on this team in scoring Yeti did not play in that win over Alabama States but injuries aside for Burton Henson and also Cummings they can light up from three theyre gonna turn some heads of the ACC well its one thing you look at your stats after first few games of the Season you say well we kind of are who we are but Pitt is not who they are because these guys that they have in the proof of their guards Cummings Burton Vincent Elliott they all can make shots theyve made shots previous times in their career so as a coach you just hope they can break out of it or you got to get them in the gym more or you got to set them up theyre in better spots to get more open shots more confident looks on the court whats the challenge ahead for Jeff Capel now at his fifth year for this pit team last year they win six League games and you know weve mentioned that hes been admired with a lack of consistency in practices and in lineups but when it comes to game action is reticular not just on the office you know when you take over a program that was Owen 18 the previous year youve got some issues obviously and so youve got to dig out and Jeff capels a proven coach at Oklahoma long time assistant for Mike shazewski and when you have that youve got the right coach but when youre trying to dig out of such a deep hole you cant have bad luck and theyve had a ton of bad luck whether its something thats been selfinflicted with having guys whos got trouble off the court but most of it has been with guys with injuries and the injury part you cant help and you you just gotta hope that that doesnt continue right now they look like theyre whole and I like their basketball team you know 2015 national title with Duke seven NCAA tournament appearances that ACC Championship in their tournament 2017 as well another look down here well this is all a part of getting your team better getting them to play in these type games they did a good job against Alabama State I dont care who the opponent is youve got to just run your stuff and build some confidence as you get towards December now theyve got the ACC Pick 10 challenge theres a game against Northwestern and then obviously theyre going to dive into the league soon enough so the league looks really topheavy in the ACC theres some bottom teams that you can get so you gotta just try to crawl your way up to the middle and win those close games and stay healthy right here Music its Diaz Graham who has really been thrust into more of a playing time situation without hugely in the lineup of course back for this game and Burton too theres been a slew of the players from this pit side that happened to play a little bit more minutes to you has not gone to the line so far down by five with the ball switch everything on the perimeter one through five Tweety nearly walked heres Roberts called the two points looking for a four rejected there by Diaz Graham nice job ideas Graham not only with the block but moving his feet against the smaller guard and William Burton working up top its Burton who wants it he has Graham with three simply gets Singleton more into the game here for this fdu team hasnt scored so far Tim O of two second on this team and scoring on cue takes it right to the rack they space the court and thats what happens when you get caught in switches and he is Graham trying to guard a little guard on the perimeter who can really handle the ball whos got good space around him thats really a mismatch Applause unreputable competition and losses to Michigan and VCU but they were in those games about the 14th minute in the second half against Michigan they were well in that game the same with VCU lost that one by four Virginia was a great start to the game but then Coach Cape will said they panicked a little bit a big board down low for Emmanuel Paul going up here against fdu and spit Corral that oh Manuel price should have taken his time but here you see he has Walker gets beat off the bounce and then the double block hugely helped him out when you look at these guards and Singleton is just too quick off the bounce and you got to give him a little space out there but if you give him too much space he can knock down the shot Tobin Anderson again son of a Hall of Fame coach in his own right and Steve Anderson Hall of Fame in South Dakota also uh the star of Iowa high school basketball 2 Tobit of course learning a lot from his father in particular a lot of ball dribbling skills I know you youve seen him at a lot of camps in this fivestar camps in Robert Barnes uh ball handling videos for our teams back in the day theyre not outdated you could still learn a lot from taking watching him Coach or looking at his videos and you know I watched his team warm up tonight and they all went into the deep ball handling warmup Music against Piero Racine coming into action for the first time another look at the Cummings Drive is just a strong guard that time he just gets whacked across the face Applause 16 fails Tim on this fdu team Applause accm with Mark Packer Trey Boston and Taylor Tannenbaum theyll talk football will also have the latest from around the conference weekdays at four Eastern right here on acc Network and the ESPN app Music theres football getting ready for the last slate of game before fall season college football playoffs Applause about the playoffs you got the FCS playoffs its gonna be very good this year the ACC Big Ten challenge coming up in mens college basketball foul away for the ball here against Pitts its going to be against Cummins thats his first in the team second for Coach cable Steve what do you think of the start so far for Peter up by five theyre handling the pressure theyre doing a good job theyre not panicking theyre sharing the basketball theyre playing pretty solid defense uh a few theyre making them work the score except on that one they got very fortunate on the switch but Music manual at that time Ward tried to salvage The Possession foul called again against Diaz Graham Good Work Down Low by Joelle Emmanuel theyre gonna go to the charity strip for the first time tonight at the 8 45 Mark well Joe Emmanuel missed the easy one on the screen the screener play but bench not happy just with the toughness and the lack of total effort and John Moore up on the glass and three pit players are kind of watching and Emmanuel and more were battling the biggest team that fairly Dickinson has faced to this point they did lose in the opener in a in a tough match up Tim that we were talking about early on against Loyola Chicago they were up well Chicago hit up a buzzer beater to force overtime hit a three very late with less than two seconds ago and they lost by six and OT in that opener heartbreaking loss they thought they could have won they probably should have won theyll learn from it and they but they gained a lot of confidence that they went on the road and performed like that against a quality team and I think thats that confidence that night see it tonight as well Cummings was looking for a second three Here Comes Singleton running the point this time Roberts off the ball here on the bottom of your screen for fdu could tie with a three Music coming to a nice job on Roberts at this point Singleton to Baseline Drive and lost it Singleton and Roberts though they are a load to guard out of the perimeter just sure its low to the ground they play low to the ground they can handle it with both hands theyre strong theyre confident they can get all the way to the rim but if you back up theyll knock down the three turnovers a piece its a pit team thats trying to minimize those turnovers averaging near 16 turnovers per game this being the six for Pitt this season Birds looking for his third three Applause Music Roberts pushing see how he and Singleton are totally in sync with one another Elijah also has had a nice start to this game at the bottom of your screen for ftu or Applause its doing a good job guarding the ball contesting thats what they need to do though and completely won we went a whole way to him thats his seventh point of this game you can see those good shooting numbers for him down low yeah Roberts or whatever is seen over to Huguley the tandem scoring here for Pitt a couple bad shots in a row possession wise in the half court probably not the best shots Tobin Anderson wants his team to take in both of them resulted in Easy buckets for Pitt biggest lead at seven here for the Panthers nine points for Huguley in the game Roberts got it off with you if thats on the Kickball well stay on this end but on the other side and how about this impressive start by Huguley a healthy addition back in the Life youve got us good play good defense first to avoid the pressure but then the big fella can get out and transition what do you like what do you like I like that matchup fish can uh kind of took one on the channel against Arizona State I like the Indiana Carolina game thats the one I would pick I could go to one I could ever get a ticket but Ill have to watch them yeah Mike Woodson starting to find networks yeah doing a doing a great job at Indiana this year third turnover there on fdu Trace Jackson Davis and Xavier Johnson Miller cop have been starring for Indiana how about Michigan State this year with Joey Hauser and Tyson Walker here the low loss for Tom izzos team a onepoint loss to Gonzaga turnover there on pits gonna go back to fdu hanging in by seven to the dismaya hair pulling moment for Caples team Kevin milliners eyes must be a lot better than mine and why wouldnt they be but he was right on the call but Im at the good angle here it didnt look like hugely stepped out of bounds I thought you may have anticipated that call the owner joined by Doug sermons with his fifth consecutive final boards head Valentines head Final Four score NCAA championships hes officiated Valentine on call has the call away for the ball and hes confirmed right now with sermons its like the Calls gonna go again Singleton well I think theyre trying to confer who was fouled or whos going to the line or whos on the line no one wants to step to the line its going to go against Huguley its gonna be his second Mars in there hes uh good looking player Sean Moore yeah he is his nickname affectionately is fuzz player coming from the previous stop for Tobin Anderson trying to squeeze in between Elliot and googly googlys bigger body got him you were mentioning those those ACC Pick 10 challenge games that Virginia team two top 20 wins coach Tony Bennetts team beating Baylor and also Illinois by seven and nine respectively an unblemished start for UVA into the wreck that time there for Hinson theyre called this end though the military has it Someone I used to not happy with that call just a little loose ball loose nothing out in the middle of the floor everybody was kind of scrambling for it and they somehow came up with an fdu foul Cleveland was John Roberts its gonna be a oneonone situation here for Craig Diaz Graham from IMG Academy Islands Spain as well from the freethrow line last year second in the ACC weve seen some amazing fans across the ACC and now we need your help this winter ACC Network wants to experience each sport from your spirit sector to snap a pic or take a video tag it with the hashtag all the devotion post it to your social you might see it on the ACC Network I know Tim Welsh our entire crew for the Peterson Events Center in Pittsburgh Second meeting all time between these schools the first time since 2008 that one against ftu heres Burton again Cummings driving Baseline just without time nicely Inside by Almanor the offensive end but they really need him to shine moving forward for this nights team step back for more from three short its a hustle play by blijin so quick to the basketball their guards get involved with the rebounding especially if youre taking a lot of threes actually made the extra pass to Hinson in the corner shot clock under three this time yet again Almanor gets on the board here for MTU pulls in within four good recognition by fdu that Almanor had Nelly coming down down in the mid Coast Area just caught it and turned shot right over him Im gonna trap here and force another turnover as Cummings throws it away Applause Music for the most part Pitts doing a good job of spacing the court throwing over the top but here on the double team doesnt use an escape dribble it just kind of backs up and doesnt wait for his team to get reorganized Tim at the five minute Mark Nike some Bandy CL in November of last year the noncontact injury is in here and playing this year for this pit team on the ball here at a marvelous game theyll show you in just a moment what he did against Alabama State Applause Burton trying to take two on the floor will be a oneonone situation yeah so Bandy is Richard senior from Indianapolis Indiana he started his career in Miami Ohio last year Torres ACL he had a 17point performance last game and hes key from three for this pit team hes very key because they need some depth they need some depth out there not only for the continuity of their basketball team but to just get everybody in Rhythm they need somebody to come in Off the Bench you know Santos has got to hit some shots Federico will help them down the road if he comes in as a backup center I really like to develop a Jorge Diaz Graham hes going to be a very good player a guy that can roam inside step outside can make shots and also a very good skilled passer Japanese made over 200 threes in his career spaces the floor nicely for this pit team because after you down by five you can get inside nice move again by Al Menorah scored backtoback buckets that snapped nearly a four minute drought for this nights team down by three likes when Hughley is not guarding him and hes going to work now against some smaller players and good job recognizing and getting himself open on the Baseline Cummings breaks out of it there to Elliott foreign was tipped away nicely its a fifth turnover on Pitt no sin tried to put the ball down with his back to the basket in the lane was looking for the tie that time and wrestled up by Diaz Graham a hit in whites and Im just gonna play here and slow the pace the time hits Biggs have made that mistake with their back to the basket they dont see the help side coming and they put the ball on the deck youre putting it on the deck heres Elliot good positioning down low he got his own Miss thats gonna be a travel that time one passing game for this fdu team the knights are hanging in here a nonconference action theyre down just by three to the Panthers kills in the last three or four possessions see the first of the NBC in those bottom two numbers and of course turnovers per game and at a plus 37 clip it is only shooting a pallet two of their last 13 what looks need to change for Coach capels team here against Tobin Andersons unit well theyre having a little bit of problem with Guardian in the half court as well theyve got to do a better job on the glass to try to get out in transition if they can just get them to miss a little bit more they can get out in transition dont have to face the pressure but doing a good job theyre a very confident group on the offensive end and they havent let the size of pit bother them that much I heard Pittsburgh 315 to go fdu was down by three in blue Baseline Drive for Cummings with the reverse nicely done thats a good job by Cummings with his head up he was waiting for the help that never came on the backside its five points for Cummings lets continue just three of their last 13 but thrown away by blysian Bandy giving that up but he coughed it over well stay on this sense as Doug sermons to drive that Baseline and previously after you did a good job of closing him out before he got a clean look at The Rim but should be playing with a lot of confidence tonight finding his rhythm on offense its gonna be a walk that time on Blake Henson he saw that last possession though when sabandi couldnt deliver that pass in transition that has been one of the issues for Pittsburgh their assist to turnover ratio is not something that will get it done in the ACC they have to do a much better job of finding the open man and turning it over less driving here for more and start to this game the votes really gave it up kickballs is Ted Valentine you set the shot clock here to 20 by rule Ill tell you the inbounds plays it looked really good really for both units but especially for Tobin Andersons team well you see the disparity there with the the poor numbers shooting they clearly know that Pitts going to switch on all these screens on the interior so theyve got to be careful that fdu doesnt slip some of these screens that time they did a much better job forcing into the perimeter Applause Music another field goal inside met that time nicely by Burton Pinson on the break go to 2V1 but his pocket was picked there by Singleton seventh turnover on the Panthers again a twoonone opportunity pit cant deliver and they turn it over on top of that defense there but he has Grand to yank the Baseline Drive right here for Singleton nice ball here and its gobbled up here for Pitt yes Graham with the left hand that was smooth Bondi did a very nice job of slowing down as he got towards the lane had his head up and then he has Graham the finish at The Rim like a very guardlike for a 611 player hes got five only two points over the seven turnovers for this fdu team Applause his burden bird running it around to Henson bald movement here so Bondi was short that time from three trying to remnants of the last performance work he did have 17 Off the Bench allergic about 16 minutes per game Music so youre trying to prove those threepoint shooting numbers which are still a little full and less than a minute to go on our first stance they hear from Pittsburgh job in the half court with the switches contesting from the perimeter one and done listen short ly not the best shot that Jeff cable wanted Blake Henson ball never moved from one side of the floor to the other kind of begged into the defense one pass and up youre right theres been stretches where this spit team is climbed to up by seven or eight he was hanging in there with that four shot selection thats gonna be an offensive foul thats how my grant Singleton taken there by Cummins a little bit of frustration there by Grant Singleton but even a better play by Nelly come hes just drop step moved his feet and took it right in the chest and nowhere to go here after holding the ball out and get a good shot at the end of the shot clock Force the turnover second time out here three straight they square up against a Miami team looking to get bull eligible back here at the Peter City Fence Center shot clock is a plugged tail end of this first half but trying to led to their lead going into the locker room twoman game at the top with Burton and cummings coming off the high screen or a down screen coming up Hinson at the top Burton with five seconds to go hes met by Alma North 36 here theyll have to push with fly to try to beat the horn no call and that will do it for half number one as pit will go to the locker room at home leading by seven oh ped did a good job of just kind of protecting the ball times they turn it over they took some quick shots but for the most part their defense was Rock Solid and they got out in transitioned and their size gave ftu some problems host of turnovers here on this big team with seven in this match but Tobin and tried to beat it with the pass and not off the dribble against the Trap and that Pacino press was from D2 at St Thomas Aquinas where they got to the Sweet 16 in D2 last year multiple conference championships for Coach Andersons team is looking to apply what he did to D2 all that success over to D1 at fdu Applause last year a team just went four and 22 this fdu team as we start half number two from Penn a good Culvert coming out of the locker room by Jeff cable just getting the ball down to John Hughley he has that big size advantage over on Almanor on the box 11 points Roberts trying to get going and does successfully thats only a second made field goal so far onsign has a call away for the ball here on Huguley Applause yes its good well go here to Pitt Sarah hugely responds because the bulk of his points Tim came in the early going but then they waned and the ladder stretch at half number one well their watches minutes as well and Im not keeping them out there for deep stretches and here again stepping on the sideline turns it over yet again the eighth turn over here on Pitt back to fdu put them in the Northeast conference to the dismay of Coach capels team but for Tobin Anderson Mary Mack is picked to win the Northeast conference Bryant went up last year they have moved to the Americas Mount Saint Mary has navigated to the Mac as well hes gonna be out of play that time for Sebastian lamotes well thats where the size of Pittsburgh can bother you Im a dribble penetration theyre doing a good job building a wall here ftu is going to come at it with the full court trap the first pass does well and Company to break out of that working a lot on that and shoot around and face that a lot in that West Virginia and VCU game so far they were ready for it against this fdu team by La modem will stay on this end and how will that serve when it comes to NAC play for Tobin Andersons team with that full court press well itll be great I mean the thing about it is that theyve run it since last May yeah the day after Tobin Anderson got the job he was in the gym with this team implementing his system so theyre going to be a welloiled machine by the time they get to conference play they started navigating inside stay tuned we got the clearance with Tobin Anderson to get to the gym just implementing his system right away to Tims points and a technical foul here I took sermons all over that hes gonna go against Hughley who wanted a foul right away on the first possession he kind of gave Doug sermons The Look then on the next possession down low he was chirping about something thats when Teddy Valentine gave him a nice subtle warning and now Doug sermon says thats it no more warnings Two Shots here for Roberts hugely its its been start and stop for him he missed six weeks due to a knee injury lead Pitt in scoring last year only played in two games coming into this matchup in Michigan and last game Off the Bench against Alabama State good to see Roberts unless you to get on the board sermons with the technical and Doug sermon hes not like your Junior High Principal hes more like your Prep School Headmaster and hes going to give you only one chance and on the second one hes gonna hes gonna give you a little bit of a slap on the wrist eight final four for Doug sermons the last nine years working with Ted Valentine Kellen milliner for making Georgia under his main nicely good connection that time for Almanor first three of the game give him seven three or four from the field thats first good luck and they ran the pick and pop that time and Pitt did not do a good job of rotating out to contest and down to a fivepoint game here for Pitt at home Music Cummins now time over to Elliott a straightaway triple yes oh thats good offense and thats thats a wellschooled cap corp set right there Connies doing a good job keeping his head up drew the defense in and kicked it back out to the open perimeter player he was a 41 threepoint shooter at Marquette but thrust into more minutes different from the Marquette situation here for Pitt Roberts in and out that time well it is important for Elliott to feel confident he just gives him another weapon on the outside a guy whos very capable of making shots Music thank you TS Graham Applause Mouse called though on Almanor strike the stride with Jorge Diaz Graham of Spain and here they run a little pick and pop on the side little dribble handoff actually and you draw two Defenders Roberts draws the two Defenders and see Elliott spotting himself up not just standing still when Cummings drives on the Baseline moving himself into an open area s Graham from the corner found this way good positioning by Henson down low to the dismay obligent we thought that that strength and the length of the Interior would go the way a pit with the size advantage in this one that time fdu had good inside position on the block out and but the weight room one out there Tyson just couldnt handle instance Henson again a transfer from Iowa state did not play off last year started his career at Ole Miss thats the game film that judge had to go off of tend to shoot here for Burton clearly the game plan for Pittsburgh in this half has been get the ball inside be patient dont settle for quick jump shots from the perimeter Im gonna put it on the floor and Drew the contact call and no one of the referee is all over that call there against Burton in the game Elijahs gonna come out here Emmanuels going to come in for fdu teams up by 10 here at home Singleton with only two points looking for five there it is with the drag backed up he d be worried about the dribble penetration and didnt get a hand up on the offensive player Music for an escapes out of it a good look inside to Elliots positioning that time Down Low by Almanor to slow the pace here for pitting the half court set Diaz Graham pulls up yes is Grant does a really good job of sliding into that open area making himself a big Target with a quick release freshmen are really high on he and Guillermo his twin brother thats a foul called Diaz Graham takes it again oh stretch for him Grant Singleton here on the little dribble handoff he sees that hints and backs up and he says thank you very much youve got to get closer to me Ill knock it in Music Applause theyre trying to throw over the top too and as we just pointed out Diaz Graham not only flashes the ball well he finds himself in the back in an open area where he can just catch and finish nine points three or five from the field Almanor yet again looking for a second three Singletons got it almond work go for two on this trip Diaz Graham all over the place here for Caples unit confidence is just growing with this young player started on Sunday where he plays very well against Alabama State and continuing tonight fails of the four its not going to count here for Cummings but a sensational stretch for Jorge Diaz Grand to start half number two hes been taught well the Youth of Spain theyd work on the fundamentals coach well at IMG and now finding his way in the ACC Music ah no hits coming off a twopoint win over Duke in college football Miami though with young and Parish Junior big in both the running in the passing game but how about Robertson Singleton trying to get going here in the second half to keep fdu in it yeah they have to get those guys going but its easier said than done because pits doing a very good job of just containing their guards and getting out for the most part and contestants Cummings out of the timeout strong Dave Littleton Welsh or entire ACC Network crew from Pittsburgh Second alltime meeting between these schools fdu isnt it here on the road Applause Music coming in at three and three this year off of a fourpoint win over VMI its trying to stream backtoback wins as well that was Tim nicely John by Henson and its 2V1 Henson takes matters into his own hands and have that just a great presence of mine quick hands on the steal thought he might pitch it to his running mate Burton but its great body control the last six from the field theres more jetting inside with the right hand the strong on it just work by Racine to keep it alive but sermons I think is going to reset the shot clock here listen with the quick hands and just on that little loose pass on the perimeter smelled it early and good finish in transition with the power to the rack he might have taken off a little bit too early there but he extended to the room especially in the beginning Music this is when so did this hit scoring just over 17 points per game six rebounds per game as well down low cost that time in the interior by Cameron Tweedy a rotation player theyre going 10 Deep with the rotation here for ftu and for Hinson again hes had to fill the void of hugely and others who have been in and out of the lineup and hes done well coming from Iowa State hes done well and you know they have good bodies they have they have a lot of guys you know they dont have a lot of depth at the guard spot so keeping Cummings on the floor is very important to run the point but theyre really nice job of handling this pressure with 11 points and another 2V1 situation with hit breaking that trap pass theres many variations that youll see from fdu with that full court pressure at least theyve done to escape it there for pit well you cant overthink it when youre going against the Press you just got to get into your spots and then be aggressive reverse the floor and try to beat it with the pass over the top speed right now here for Pips Applause yet again this has worked well in the corner that time Elliott for three nicely done put me behind the back hugely who had the rebound and finishes the play jamarius Burton just ultimate tough this first a good extra extra pass to Ellie and then follow it up on the Miss with the fancy delivery behind the back to the big fella Left To You Down by 17 their largest deficit a timeout called by Tobin Anderson but Burton and Company have been clicking while Burton can play a lot of different spots on the floor thats why hes so important the veteran with a little flare Welsh and balance scoring led by Hughley with 13 but how about Diaz Graham Off the Bench with 11 four of six from the field hes been all over the floor for Jeff capels team well when you talk to the coaches today from Pittsburgh they all really were glowingly complimenting he has Graham and as he gets more comfortable and gets in the weight room you can see just the athleticism the skill level and also the basketball High basketball IQ he has actually made the Spanish national team for the under 20 championships Jorge actually was a last cut but both were competing for those under 20s and the credit to worry what hes done as a freshman to be really high on him moving forward here in Pitt country the coasters are barking at him a little bit from the bench you can hear from here about opening the ball jumping in the ball and thats probably the biggest thing that adjustment one of the biggest adjustments he has to make is defending the constant quick players out on the perimeter that hes gonna have to defend it especially if they play this switching defense soon here at the 153 Run fell away from the ball here against fdu to go against Almanor good stretch at the tail end of half number one era Diaz Graham the twin brother there of Jorge both again coming from Spain and what IMG Academy has produced Timo tool the associated coach and credited for finding those guys and bringing them to the kids well the pick coaches and Jeff cable and Company really put together a good game plan on how to attack this pesky fdu defense and thats one thing power basketball under control in the second half really doing making a conscious effort to get the ball into the paint single to trying to break the 173 run that was tipped nicely done by Moore to keep it on this end for fdu with Tobin Andersons team and how they adjust here trademark of his teams over the years the old back tap you dont have to be careful of the ball so thats time for more getting part of the game Tim when fdu was hanging they were dwindling the shot clock but in half court sets right shooting though is winged a little bit right at the interior defense a pit and also the switch is up top on the perimeter get hugely inside hes double teamed quickly I saw a lot of double or triple teams last year five to shoot Bondi a good move no its going to be an offensive foul gonna go to the opposite way no basket for Nike sabandi I thought fdu probably extended themselves a little bit by trapping hugely all the way in the corner and sabani did a good job of keeping his head up but fdu rotated took one in the chest Music were inside everyone with former head coach of Fairfield University Tim OToole Im I dont know last month we saw Columbia from the ivy league upset this Villanova team NJIT has already played three biggest opponents they played him very well certainly Villanova cannot look past the Highlanders tonight no way theres an old saying you respect all but you fear none you only need to learn that lesson once when you get steak that like Villanova did to Colombia UCLA learned that lesson against Cal Poly what Villanovas done is theyve gone on a 40 run lately theyre going to focus on gaining momentum and how you do that is by taking care of business against NJIT tonight now hard to believe that was a decade ago didnt really recognize that guy with Timothy I wrote it down I just wrote it down Tim OTooles been teaching me stuff my whole life and uh going back to when he played at Fairfield but respect all and fear none Im gonna have to use that I cant use it tonight unfortunately its too late but uh Tim OToole Ill tell you this much as player as an assistant coach as a head coach on Wall Street now back as an assistant coach he fears none hes feared not what a tremendous assistant to have around by yourself by your side every day he is one of the alltime best a really tremendous basketball mind Music plays it all at one speed Dave 100 miles an hour and you better play at 100 miles an hour if hes around you or else you will hear it we would certainly run through a wall for Coach OToole just more as the shot clock was to Emily nice play by blyjo and a strong start to the game for after you but was quiet at OToole course before the being an associate head coach of the Capel here at Pitt was formerly at Cal and also at Stanford among a host of schools as Tim documented its a pleasure to call that game 10 years ago part of our ESPN broadcast Factory belongs theres no doubt about it hes a coach hes a Coach and hes a guy that um he was a very good coach at Fairfield did a good job there and um I know Jeffs really happy to have him here at Pittsburgh because hes like having a head coach next year and one of the tough things about being a head coach is sometimes you dont have a lot of people to talk to about what you were thinking as a head coach and Jeff cable has that not only and Timmy but the rest of his staff have a lot of experience as well including his brother said away that time of Singleton heres pit yet again Applause push the tempo a lot fdu thats worked out for capels team has been shooting very well in the second half lets take a look at the pregame earlier tonight from Timo Dwight again this is a guy that certainly dont want to get in his way at all and shoot around you imagine if he was catching the subway and you were in his way hes trying to catch the subway to get to work at Wall Street and start making money for his clients if you got in his way hed knock you right over right Im sure Music one of the great basketball mines in the coaching ranks its gonna be another turnover here on fdu 11th Turner but a test of the staff that coach Capel has brought here to pit you know tool bylin Brown who had the Scout for this game of course the brother oh Jeff and Jason cable also on staff here its got to feel good about the way they play tonight not only X and O wise and intelligence wise but sharing the back of all cleaning the game plan good solid defense not letting the quickness and the pressure of fdu rattle them at all Music the field starting to compliment him with 147 so far Applause anyone is it on the deck and squares that time over hugely nicely done hes uh he said can you move up all day and night if youre a coach because its right before Thanksgiving youre playing an opponent from a smaller conference you know as a coach that they have a lot of ability you go to Loyola and take them to overtime you know you can play so youve got to be able to convince your team that they can do that and so far so good for Pitt although fdu will keep coming at you and welcome to the game of Brayden Reynolds he talked about this for a while hes a freshman hailing from this area played at Western preserve High School too much hugely inside for Coach Gables unit and a timeout call hes moving around is looking healthier than hes been in a while and the thing I like about hugely keeps it high and finishes High Music from coach capels unit he was only leading by seven and for Tobin Andersons teams trying to stay in it and trying to trying to keep up with the pace that pit is matching up when theyre breaking that full court press well theyre just cant match their size thats the problem the traps are good strong traps but when youre six five six six seven going against these guys that are five eleven six one all you have to do is just step back be strong and you can throw right over the top two in one situation hugely again compliments of Burton in an offensive foul call its on hugely thats gonna be his fourth foul all right uh whether this was a good call or not and not sure but I do know that Burton probably shouldnt have given the ball to hugely at that point and youve got your big strong Center come flying in and you see the other Defender there watch out for that especially with the injuries theyve had but theres really nowhere to go he should just take it its an unselfish play but he probably should have taken the ball to the room himself theres the Pittsburgh native Reynolds 24 in blue coming in off the bench Chartiers Valley trying to score here with the reverse nicely done welcome home Braden Reynolds his job is just patient and found an angle with The Gap but Pitt continues just to be break this press Seaman finishes at the cop s yeah unable to get any good traps to make tip feel uncomfortable but they keep coming back in transition with Roberts thats his first three of the game thats one of the big things for this pit team is trying to deny Dimitri Roberts tonight only with eight thank you shooting Tim in this half Applause layups and open threes right now confidence building and the Press can wear you out peskiness depth but size can wear you out as well and thats what Pitts doing after you thats a handy nearly sure to get a 50 clip this year again coming off of that ACL tear that side like him a year ago all right to the rack that time for lamotes as Graham was in his way yet again for the Panthers strong on both ends of the floor here for Jorge Diaz Grand theyre doing a good job of building that wall around the basket without fouling just talked about the shooter and the spacing the switches on the perimeter really look well and test to the length also in the interior nice could be called on the floor here Almanor as though another referee is all over that 6 11 to go in regulation it is up by 15 looking for their third win of the season Music Thanksgiving and as for today CC schools he got three ACC schools in the top eight in the college basketball its a team hit that pick the Finish towards the bottom of this conference but you got some Heavy Hitters at the top well but its doable they can stay healthy I like I like the way this team is constructed especially gonna get some of the younger players involved I hope there on Singleton download in the restricted area continue to see that Jorge Diaz Graham is building confidence within the coaching staff and within himself and then he belongs out here on the floor and the nice thing about when hes out on the floor hes a young player but hes surrounded with a bunch of veterans so he doesnt have to do too much you just kind of fit in out there you can see theyre confident in his game because they do look for him out there on the floor mentioning some of those schools how about number one North Carolina you know last year National weathers up to Kansas and the job that Hubert Davis has done a chapter about well best job he did is keeping all his guys not letting him go to the NBA and thats the first piece of a lot of this stuff dont lose transfers or guys to the NBA early in Carolina is the real deal but Virginia so impressive this week as well top 20 wins over paler in Vegas also Illinois by nine right under what else doing a great job out of the Big Ten theyre fighting Illini too so on Thursday Duke of take on Oregon State Charter with a nice job is roach Mitchell played really well for the Blue Devils Applause I count it there for Cummings oh here we go we got the old flop technical thats important its an emphasis by the officials this year its a Class B technical fail should be one shot here Urbans like poor Elliott you kidding me yeah got a six hour bus ride back to fdu tonight in your corn your corner flop now lets all go against Henson in the game against Michigan another look again here this time how big he gets up to use Roberts do you think there is contact you can fall down and trip over yourself without being a flop and thats where the officials have to have better judgments than on that call I mean thats thats a bit much theres almond oil not guaranteed Kevin milliner would not be calling that in a ACC game in the middle of February about five minutes ago in this one two of the last five from the field Miss Cummings lets strip that sign here comes after you Singleton he takes a Bondi good work by Elijah to keep her to this sand and well finish with the left hand pressure fdus not going to let off Im gonna keep trying to get better notice the top scoring team in the NEC and fdu super funny Wagner St Francis Brooklyn at the top of the early go against the season with a triple team there trying to Slick that pencil at it has to happen right there and thats a good teaching point for Jeff cable and gets into the film room tomorrow is you know Henson got jammed up at the foul line he actually was Triple team and when that happens you know youve got to open guys in the perimeter but they have to get her or get open where they can theres a good passing angle or Henson can find them and he has somebody to outlet to for a quick three Applause Music felt Colton stay on this end by Elijah I think its been a bright spot in this game for fdu despite the disparity it felt hold on Hinson found the second half here for Pitt a lot of times not just Hinson but probably as well especially for this big team last year you know that was the point of that business for a lot of ACC teams to converge on him down low so guys like Henson Cummings Elliots and well see like you were wanting more depth out of the bark Position will that come to fruition to improve to this six Mark with League wins last year a good move inside for Blasian yet again coming off the screen and the one thing Dave that you start to establish you see this for pits by Pittsburgh you play the early tough schedule but you start to find out who you are and you see tonight Jeff Capel has shortened his rotation to about seven itll take us to a timeout 10 with 350 to go into regulation its all Cummings and pit at home to the dismay of fdu welcome to the gun show 10 fresh off of running up cardiac kill to the upper campus here at Pitts its all the Panthers at home over fdu theyve had a lot of balance scoring tonight under coach Cables team headlined by Hughley coming back into the starting line this is what you want and Jeff cable spoke to us about that earlier we dont have a guy like a guy that go get a buck a go score six eight in a row hugely certainly could do that but you gotta hes gotta have help and they have to have balance not only with the Five Guys scoring but balance where theyre getting their points and not just relying totally on the three or on oneonone or pick and roll basketball or just going inside humidity they have to have a good balance and I think this team can do that with Burton and Henson and Elliot and cummings they all have different types of games out on the perimeter and then theyve got the big guy inside who can finish off at The Rim said mentioned 11 with that 3404 from the charity stripe for this hit team on the verge of getting their third win and consecutive fdu by the way is in a eightgame road trip next Monday wont be until December Roberts is tied up there lets stay on this end the alternating possession Roberts is fearless just dribble drives into the into the trees in there he bounces off the big guys and we can get to the rim that time he just got knocked down after you continues to play very hard tonights been a tough night for him with eight points he was that first guy thats over Anderson said he needed to get on this team to D1 and Roberts I should try to keep it on this end the call here against Pitt to work that time by Almanor as well lets see whos going to make Pitt guard him for the last 329 were gonna keep going to the rim and they called that a twoshot foul Music and Josh thats why Ted Valentine right now is looking at sermons Applause I think fdu is going to be fine in their league its its a good conference and Wagner looks like theyre one of the stronger clubs again this year they were in the championship a year ago against Brian Brian as you mentioned is in the America East now so Applause Music actually first in the league when they came over into the NEC led by Joe Gallagher you see the road trip to follow and match up in Philly against St Joes that next home game again in Decembers next NJ IT for fdu and its very reminiscent of last year starting up on the road youve got to play a lot of road games early you get the guaranteed money to help run your program and basically its just a survival month and a half and a half got to make sure your team gets better and if you start getting blasted on the road against the power power five schools you just got to make sure you dont lose confidence and keep your team together and you can see that Tobin Andersons team has all of those qualities Applause for a lot of folks might might know the fdu name I just went to the NCAA tournament in 2019 when their first NCAA Tournament game in the first four over Prairie View a m and then lost to Gonzaga that was a big one to see if Tobit Anderson can make some noise around league play and also their conference tournament in that one bid League Cummings hands it off the Hinson who lost it in stride worked by blasting game and they scored by savandi as well with an extra effort well stay on this end for Pitt with 210 to go Ive told many isnt trying to give all of his players that experience of playing on this floor and yeah I understand yeah three of these guys and one of them was recruited to go to division two so you have four basically division two recruits out here playing for fdu and they certainly dont look that part they look like a team that will absolutely challenge in the Northeast conference on the left side working with Burton with a pullup from 15 and gets the gratuitous bounce well thats why Burton is so tough at 640 but hes got the big strong body hes under control and has a real good middle range game its been a lot of this bag of results in the ACC to start how about Louisville have lost the first three games each the first three by one point it hasnt happened quite a long time but Louisville Florida State as well has been having some mixed results Lowells got major issues I mean she saw them play last night and earlier today Texas Tech just buried them by 32 out in Maui so theyve got some uh work to do work to do the problem with and weve seen it here in Pittsburgh Jeff Capel is a proven winner but when you take over a program thats spinning the wrong way even if you have great tradition youve got to have some good fortune moving forward because the negativity can surround a program and really bury you now I think Pitts overcome that if they can just stay healthy this year I think they can get into the middle part of this conference but Louisvilles different story right now they they uh theyve got a long way to go up next the matchup against William and Mary looking forward to that challenge against Northwestern and Chris Collins team and then its not the gauntlet of the ACC I think Kevin Keats is also doing a fabulous job state right now unbeat at the top I like those early December ACC conference games theyve sprinkled in there better be aware of it its going to hit you quickly theres some good games in that first week of December after the ACC Big Ten challenge is having a nice start for the wolf pack along with Joyner for Coach Keats his team a twopoint lead here I like the old days where Jim the famous Jim Valvano said that you know were gonna play all the directional schools the Southwest Northeast colleges early in the first two months people play everybody these days KJ Marshall came in very late trying to beat the horn tweet he has the loose change we just cant do it you cant play soft schedule throw in the season anymore itll really hurt you when you get into conference play and well hurt you in March when youre trying to get a bit ask it there from blasting game 68 seconds to go in regulation for this ftu team is going to fall to three and four a good effort especially in half number one closing it to within seven but pit for shooting if youre just tuning into the tail end of this one its 76 the Midway part of the second half ties the season high with 80 so far for this pit team you know when you know coming into this game you got to think what will it take in your eyes to get back for Coach Capel to those Jamie Dixon days when they were going to NCAA tournaments with ease well clearly it takes good recruiting thats the first piece of that and theyve done a good job I I like the group that theyve put together here and its a different a different way than when Jamie Dixon was here I mean Jamie Dixon did a great job of recruiting New York New Jersey Philadelphia Washington area and those kids wanted to come play at Pittsburgh they wanted to come play in the Big East they wanted to play in the matter in Madison Square Garden so now its a different cell youre selling playing a different conference but youre still like you still have a great program to sell and create University Big Time Arena tremendous coaching staff and it just theyve had bad luck they really have with a lot of different things mainly with injuries good for it by Federico Federico coming in late with 45 seconds to go they call them twotime objectionally yes that is his name twice Applause to make substitution 80 fish coming in Applause on the cover of the game program today and comes in gets a bucket and Sophia nice memory for him heading to Thanksgiving his third game this year for Marysville Pennsylvania short the hallway that time for Sean Moore they might even be able to sneak home for a little quick Thanksgiving and that will be played during dinner thats a tough move in the lane across the fish and others especially Marshall too and putting all that hard work in and getting some minutes here at the end of the game so a good win here for Pitt is going to prove to three and three string a twogame win streak here and this 22point victory over ftu at home and an aggressive second half for Coach Staples unit very impressive because of the fact fdu tried to impose their will to try to get pit to play their way Pitt wouldnt have nothing of it they attacked the pressure with ease in the second half and had an exact game plan were going to get the ball in the paint and they did that and also got back on D and really did a good job contesting the three
