he provides a post presence for them for Notre Dame this is going to be a key matchup for them keeping Clinton post out of the paint and forced Boston College to shoot the ball from the perimeter and we are ready for tip at Conti Forum Notre Dame with the same starting five weve seen and now all 15 games this year and they win the tip and will start with the basketball Mike Roberts Brian OConnell Kip Kissinger our officials tonight for the first game of the new year for BC and Notre Dame JJ Starling the standout freshman gets it to Nate lasheski the opposite of a freshman super experience playing in game 140 tonight the Irish and efficient offensive team coming in at eight and six but Owen three in the league under five on the timer for Starling who fires and hits the first basket tonight that kid can play top of the list for Earl Grant defending the threepoint line thats a good start for Notre Dame Boston College has to do a better job of defending the threepoint line uh Notre Dame that makes close to nine threes per game Music is here with BC and this right here though individual moves step back we do have some NBA uh execs in this building tonight uh they really like this Preston for Notre Dame showing off the step back three early on they can leave at the under fourth timeout at this rate hes got great size as well too Makai Ashton Langford answers with a midrange jumper to put BC on the board he is the heart and soul of this Boston College team uh theyre going to go as far as he leads them beautiful pullup jumper that time off the head fake Applause Notre Dame off the loss to Miami 7665 no shame in losing to the Hurricanes right now they are the best team in the ACC in the standing still undefeated BC trying to bounce back from a loss at Syracuse and Drew I called that game uh uncharacteristically Notre Dame had a lot of turnovers in that game nice move Nate lashesky Scoops at home the uncharacteristic performance from the Irish 17 turnovers was a season High yeah and Miami capitalized 25 points off of those turnovers and you know Coach Price said look we just threw that thing all over the place uh give credit to Miami but really his team a veteran team he knows look they got to take care of the ball against this Boston College team thats very physical on defense that was a Miss from Prince Ali Bay The Freshman from Minneapolis his first look tonight coach Bray actually said hey were going to get you guys helmets Courtside because we threw that thing all over the place against Miami as darling goes off the window five quick ones for the Freshman he does not look or play like a freshman uh one of the better freshmen not just ndacc but in the country great great body control that time with the Finish this is DeMar Langford brother of Makai Ashton Langford who missed the teardrop Notre Dame ball up by five as we come up on three minutes into the first half here at Conti heres Dane Goodwin and some lasheskis experience Goodwins played 141 games now in his career tied for the most in program history and he is a great shooter you give him space he will make you pay well Im just going to put it on record defend a threepoint line Earl Grant said that about five times but when we were talking to him at the suit around he said look if we dont defend the threepoint line against his Notre Dame team its going to be a long night BC throws it away cormack Ryan takes it the Irish have started four for four its a 70 run Starling feeling it five early points for the diaper Dandy that time denied by Ashton Langford Goodwin has the Miss Lefty Runner wont go and Notre Dame misses for the first time tonight Christian Langford in attack mode bumped hits the deck hard and he will shoot a couple Ford has the only two for BC well try to add some and this right here though the Freshman of Starling really uh having a great start for Notre Dame we saw the step back three and I mentioned some of the NBA Scouts that are in the building and you look at his numbers pretty impressive a third in uh scoring among ACC freshmen I think the big thing for him though uh hes Manning the point hes playing the point hes playing off the ball hes got great size and I think thats the thing that stood out to me when I saw him for the first time in person at that Miami game hes got a really good build for a freshman and theyre really high on his future at Notre Dame 64 200 from Baldwinsville New York not far from Syracuse latest High School ballet La Lumiere School in Indiana you see the big seven footer number 12 in white Quinton post still coming off the bench for PC made a season debut at Syracuse on Saturday New Years Eve and college picks up their pressure and thats again their cognizant of what happened in that Miami game Miami was able to force some turnovers with the oppressor ys three wont go Notre Dame team that typically takes care of it really well but as we said last time out did not against Miami and Earl Grants team will be aggressive post nice feed down low and the Finish is there from CJ Pena and thats what they missed with post not only does he provide an inside presence he can shoot the ball Im picking pops but hes also an excellent passer from that high post area Goodwin from the corner thats too easy Applause a Dane Goodwin we were at shoot around today didnt participate stood off to the sideline hes dealing with a little bit of a bug hes got two threes looks 100 this could be his flu game I mean he was killed over I mean we didnt know if he was going to make it through shoot around let alone uh play in this game and he really did not look good and certainly its huge to have him in of this lineup and right now Boston College breakdowns all over thats just way too much air space theyre giving the threepoint shooters for Notre Dame or Mac Ryan tried to get involved he missed another great shooter the Irish have four guys above 40 percent from Deep this season post has been active Off the Bench this is Jaden Zachary also a great shooter for BC post bullying his way down low and scores a soft touch for the seven footer and thats a great recognition by Jaden Zachary he could have easily shot that three on the kickback out repost them throw it back down low and then post really nice soft touch post making his presence felt early with four points and assist and a rebound a sevenfooter from Amsterdam is a huge Boon for BC coming back and Notre Dame with the smaller lineup I think if Notre Dames in man they got to put post uh no pun into the back down low and the post and let him get some paint touches the jokes right themselves five on the shot clock for Demar Langford gotta go turn around jumper post up above the trees again creating problems for Notre Dame on the glass and well take our first time out almost six minutes in Dane Goodwin looks 100 percent six minutes in against Boston College Mike brain his 23rd season as Notre Dame head coach and listen its really unshorted territory historically for them to start 03 in conference play but in recent history they started oh and five a couple years ago Mike Bray knows that his team has the medal to bounce back meanwhile Earl Grant year two here in Chestnut Hill a lot of success at College of Charleston and you already see his Program start to take on his identity yeah that identity uh pretty uh he said defensively look we got to be physical and we want to go low possession games and theyve taken on that identity I think the big thing for them right now against this Notre Dame team theyre gonna have to make some shots Notre Dames been playing a lot of Zone to start this game off theyre trying to force a Boston College to be a perimeter oriented team AJ Starling Started Hot that ones an air ball picked up by his fellow freshman Ben Allen Lubin who gets fouled on his way to the basket and he will shoot the first two for Notre Dame one of the best freethrow shooting teams in the land and Alan Lubin The Freshman from Orlando a consensus fourstar recruit number 74 in the ESPN 100 Music Applause Mike gray calls him a positionless basketball player Music and he is another freshman a talented young player as you said theyre really high on his potential and youre right Notre Dame thats one team you do not want to put on the freethrow line theyre 80 from the line this year best in the ACC sixth in the country Lubin split him there high point lead for the Irish over six minutes in his Pena goes to the hole and gets tackled and he will shoot a couple and what a beautiful pass by Makai Aspen Langford thats a great pick and roll the pass was right there almost the and one situation but its all set up because of the pass by Makai Ashton Langford its a great sign for BC weve seen some good ball movement from the Eagles early for the numbers for the season theyre 350th in the country in assist rate Pena knocks down the first and I think the big thing for them they got to try to get out and get some early offense you can see the strategy for Notre Dame uh they watch film from that Syracuse game but theyre going to get a heavy dose of Zone and also speak with Coach Mike gray said look we got to create bodies in the paint we do not want them to get any dribble drives force them to shoot the ball from the perimeter post has been a pest on the offensive glass Goodwin comes away with it you saw Goodwin check back in this is a sevenman rotation for Notre Dame blubin was down on the other side and he is hobbling so as I say that they dont have a whole lot of depth and this would be a big problem if Lubin cant go and good sign of sportsmanship post tried to help him up Im not sure if he landed on post ankle but they were tangled up lets see here hmm oh yeah post went landed right on him yeah thats tough right there and that is unfortunately hope that young man is okay I certainly did not look good a promising freshman Matt Zona checked in the free wouldnt go for Trey Works Zona 25 in blue averages 17 minutes per game playing in his seventh game this season as Zachary hooks a pass to post and thats money six points for the seven footer and thats great patience uh that time by Jade and Zachary again Earl grants talked about this passing up uh shots to get a better look for your teammate unselfish play that time by Jaden Zachary thank you Zona down low got it off glass points number three and four this season for Matt Zona and were seeing some pretty good ball movement on both ends thats nice action that time by Notre Dame and the postentry pass again really on point all Zona had to do is Catch and go up with it entry from Ashton Langford sailed for post out of bounds itll stay here with BC as Marcus Hammond stepped on the Baseline and here were going to see really unselfish play look Zachary could have easily shot that one up get a better look for your big and then right here this is nice postentry pass seal them by Zona and then all he had to do was catch Lay It Up beautiful offense at that time by both teams most takes a seat you know he wants to play 30 minutes a game but they will Tim in played 17 at Syracuse in his season debut a couple days ago Lamar Langford back in there for BC right back to work from the freethrow line thats pure hes got great elevation on his pullup game and back to your point about post uh Earl Grant said look its uh its a learning process for him trying to figure out but whats not a learning process is that guy right there Dane Goodwin thats a breakdown Again by Boston College they cannot give him that much air space hes wide open from the threepoint line another sniper Mason Madsen for Boston College the Cincinnati transfer left that one short good one by the way is three for three from distance three for four overall I mean Im gonna go back to our earlier comment we did not think he was going to make it past shoot around he was killed over not sure he was going to be able to play tonight and hes come out on fire for Notre Dame Lamar Langford not really a threat to shoot from Deep just one of 11 from Beyond The Arc this year his brother Makai certainly is though he shows off the range Music thats a great sign for Boston College and Makai asked Mike actually hit a couple against Syracuse almost to the similar spot wide open and able to get it to go trying to get Notre Dame out of that zone Applause heres Godwin with a shot clock at six good one attacks good ball movement lacheskys Gotta Go words with two teardrops from the foul line and the rebound yanked down for Boston College by Devin McLaughlin the Retro freshman from Georgia McLaughlin gets it and cant finish Ashton Langford what a feed goes to waste good win ahead of the pick and that Lefty finish goes 11 points for Dane Goodwin fourpoint swing there and absolutely uh tough break Earl Grant knows its a beautiful pass by the chiasp in Langford just a missed dunk that time by McLaughlin I think Ashton Langford was already celebrating on his way down to the other end Hudson left alone theyre really trying to exploit that zone with three pointers that time came up empty across the Midway point of the first half ham into the hole Lefty finished no its a few trips in a row where theyve laid some bricks right now theyre thats what Notre Dame wants again they know Boston College the team only makes four threes per game uh right now Boston College settling dont mind off a couple of swings uh but early in the shot clock contested threes thats not a formula for Boston College now last in the ACC and threepointers made and threepoint percentage outside the top 340 in the country in those statistics is warts missed it and here comes Ashton Langford for BC in an up and down game with very few breaks so far and now we get one thats lots of contact on the rebound McLaughlin tied up with luccheski but Dane Goodwin we thought he might throw up and shoot around and said hes throwing up triples and knocking him down Ashton Lankford has performed and his the quality of looks I think thats of concern if theyre contested youll live with that right here dribble Drive Works beautiful offense by Notre Dame thats a breakdown uh thank good when the guy came into this game shooting 44 from the threepoint line uh hes had some wide open looks early on and as you take a look at the most games played a veteran uh part of the unit for uh Mike gray and hes the leader right now 141 games played that guy has been around college basketball hes seen it all he is an Iron Man coach prey told us this morning that Dane Goodwin probably the toughest guy weve got we were saying is he gonna play tonight a shoot around he looked like he was about to bomb it symptoms of the flu and Goodwin looks totally fine tonight at game time I mean you cant really appreciate how bad he looked and shoot around I mean it was uh you are not exaggerating in terms of that but uh certainly he is one of the tougher guys on this team his fellow experienced teammate Nate lecheski will shoot folks every Sunday afternoon weve got womens basketball right here on acc Network in the ESPN app this week the game start at noon Eastern were featuring these two Haley van LIF and Louisville theyve won six of seven they host Pittsburgh at two Eastern and its Notre Dame and North Carolina Sunday afternoons are for womens basketball on acc Network about the Notre Dame women inside the top five now in the AP poll Charlie cream has moved them up to the Top Line in his Bracketology you know Ivy has it rolling and its just fun to watch and thats going to be a good one though right here top 25 matchup though and this one right here uh Notre Dame changing up the defense that time giving a little threequarter court pressure and then now they drop back into their Zone and Boston cause thats how theyre gonna have to attack it right there Zachary on the dump down offensive foul as thicker staff steamrolled Cormac Ryan and thats a great job of selling it but he did go lower to shoulder right idea by Boston cause right here Jaden Zachary and he load the shoulder easy call for the ref to make and now thats a missed opportunity for Boston College that time you have TJ Victor staff with the smaller quarterback Ryan down low in the post really no need for him to lower the shoulder right here just go straight up like we had the same takeaway from shoot around as there was a lot of intensity from Notre Dame you could tell that they do not want to move to 04 in the ACC especially defensively thats where we see it I mean Mike Ray greetings was hey look we need one tonight and there was no hey whats up we need to get a win tonight they were locked in shoot around they understand the importance of this they got to get a win nacc player darling how did he finish that off the wrong foot seven points for the diaper Danny he is showing off the complete game that time little Runner uh off balance thats a beautiful move he showed the step back jumper three he is really an impressive freshman a league Bay working hard down freshman at right there grown man move d by a leaf Bay and I like that by Boston they were settling for jumpers in the last five minute stretch to get the ball into the paint thats who you are do not settle for jumpers Starling back to work got the mismatch against the sevenfooter post missed the three and here comes Demar Langford keep an eye out for 10 in white alipe who just scored he could be a real X Factor for this BC team a fourstar freshman Madsen tried to get it to him knocked Away by Notre Dame and Cormac Ryan which takes us to a timeout a sixpoint lead for the Irish JJ Starling has seven The Freshman leading Notre Dame on the road at Boston College Music they had one earlier Fenn Allen Lube in the promising freshman you never like to see this no certainly uh thoughts and prayers with that young man never like to see this right here and oh lets hope that that is nothing long term for him being out yeah he walked off the floor went back to the locker room a Mike Brays team an injury is the last thing they need to see they rarely use the Deep bench its really a seven man rotation Dom Campbell is eighth in minutes play the averages 22 per game theres Prince alike Bay another promising freshman thats impressive touch from the 67 Minneapolis native and thats twice now uh theyve gotten him isolated thats not showing off a little Runner and youre right beautiful touch and they are so high on this young man great body and that time showing off Cuts around the rim good win dropped it off for Zona whos playing extended minutes in place of Lubin missed the layup Ashton Langford trying to set it up for post Music a whistle and too much contact down low and this right here again nice job of not settling uh by olig Bay he could easily try to pull trigger on that uh long jumper dont settle a little head faking and show off your floater game and thats something Earl Grant talked about look passing up contested shots and trying to get the ball into the paint that was the focus coming into this game do not settle we must dominate the paint Trey wurtz back in for Notre Dame replacing Sona who picked up the foul there against post you see him working on lashesky has a couple inches and 20 pounds on him but post threw it away Notre Dame ball three turnovers against BC none for Notre Dame and thats all set up though by spacing Boston College they got to do a better job space so you got two guys cutting in the same place right here you got to have uh one cutting either at the Baseline and up by the foul line area weve got two guys basically cutting to the same place Music quartz had space one more luccheski from the corner that swirls in and out Zachary will push it tayden Zachary tough finish through the trees first two for Jaden Zachary I think tough understatement that one right there could be a difficulty off the charts Jaden Zachary that time great upper body strength and I think thats key for them get out and transition up before this Zone can get set up for Notre Dame for Mac Ryan from the midrange saw Zachary get on the board and said Ill do the same first two points for the grad student from New York Applause the Irish back in the zone again Boston College a team that struggles to shoot last in the ACC and threepointers and percentage this year one for four from Deep tonight a league Bay will attack in the spin cycle Goodwin called for the foul Music Boston College settling into how to attack this Zone thats twice now theyve gotten a ball to Elite Bay at the free throw line and him again not settling use your size advantage and try to work it closer to the pain Earl Grant talking with the brothers Langford along with Jaden Zachary Court over there with a head coach Prince alibe The Freshman from Minnehaha Academy teammates with Jalen Suggs and Chet Holmgren never heard of him Gonzaga Bulldogs who went top five in the NBA draft heres our Wednesday college basketball doubleheader right here on acc Network in the ESPN app Kyle filipowski a number 16 Duke in Raleigh to take on to quavion Smith and NC State at 7 Eastern and its off to the dean dome in Chapel Hill for big cot love and Carolina hosting Tyree Appleby in Wake Forest should be two great matchups with some of the conferences top teams how about Kyle filipowski by the way hes now at the point where he gets the call on the promo I had a chance to call their first game and you could see early on but he did not uh play like a freshman he has become a matchup nightmare for opposing teams first Notre Dame turnover a little too much dip on the chip on the pass from Goodwin to lashesky thats the first one I believe for Notre Dame and you can tell that was an emphasis after that Miami game we talked about it 17 which led to 25 points off the turnovers for Miami theyre normally one of the better teams year after year of taking care of the ball under Mike Ray post down low right back to work and he just makes it look easy thats eight points for Quinton post which ties a season high in this one game at Syracuse on Saturday and another nice postentry pass that time Makai Ashton Langford uh he has stoned some really nice bounce passes that have led to some scoring opportunities thank you Starling step back oh yeah JJ Starling is showing off his full skill set with 10 points in the first half right back to post and hes in double figures Applause Mike Brays got to be thinking how does that happen yeah thats before transition D and again heads up Boston College uh theyre doing the right thing get out push the pacemaker Miss try to get early offense Goodwin in the post Music I want to fade away Dane Goodwin Outside Inside he can hurt you and that time Boston College stayed home Langford a really good Defender it didnt matter Dane Goodwin thats a tough post move on the turnaround Eagles have made five shots in a row a lot of them from Quinton post who goes back to work that fade away might have been affected by lacheskis defense its a tough assignment for 14 Les schewski one of six grad students on Notre Dames roster lacheski can stroke it thats that ones short man you might see the effects of trying to deal with post on the other side when he shoots it on this end yeah banging around with the seven footer that one was definitely a little short nasheski takes it away this time another PC turnover with three minutes to play in the first half Notre Dame by four you can feel the urgency from both these teams Eagles one and two in conference Irish Owen three starlings been aggressive again the finger roll goes and thats better recognition by The Freshman a couple times he got isolated with post he settled for a jumper that time little head fake hesitation and thats three times in this game now he is shown off beautiful touch on the little finish Zachary Lefty finish goes hes a Savvy player he is and I like what Boston College is doing theyre running him to that high post area against the Zone letting him operate hes got the option to either shoot it drive it or kick it out Jaden Zachary says he watches a lot of film of Jalen Brunson and Fred fanfleet when you watch his game you can kind of see the osmosis and yes sir 15 first half points for Dane Goodwin in his flu game and Quentin post not happy that time switching off he did not want the guards to switch that time users find the heads and thats a mismatch good recognition by Notre Dame Irish take it away again five turnovers for the Eagles and Coach Brady uses a timeout Dane Goodwin by Dane Goodwin something about playing Boston College this is the fifth time hes played BC in the last two years in his previous four games averaging 17 against the Eagles yeah he definitely likes playing against them got it going early right now uh really efficient hes done it inside in the post and then hes got some quality looks from Beyond The Arc thats going to be key for Boston College fighting that up they got to make it a little bit more difficult for him yeah Applause thats the 41st meeting between these two Notre Dame leads the alltime series 2713 theyve split the season series each of the past three years Hammond turn around Lefty Stroop Marcus Hammond is on the board Music again no Ben Allen Lubin for the last few minutes after he went down with what could be a lower leg injury The Freshman whos part of that seven man rotation Notre Dame using Matt Zona 25 in blue heres TJ bicker staff for BC Zona on the help and Bickerstaff scores through it thats a nice job by Bickerstaff playing through contact Music you see coming up at halftime Kelsey Riggs and Talon cuff well take you through in the studio well have an update on Jamar Hamlin the Buffalo Bill safety who collapsed in a scary scene Monday Night Football last night in Cincinnati and Demar is a guy with ACC ties so everyone in the Sports World and especially so here on the ACC Network were thinking of the former pit panther and Pittsburgh native thoughts and prayers with that young man his family certainly hope he is going to be okay and be able to make a full recovery between the shot and the game clock is Goodwin is back in there for the final offensive possession of the first half for Notre Dame a gamehigh 15 for the grad student thats it up with Marcus Hammond Hammond with three to shoot lost it taken away by Pena five to go for BC Hammond got a piece but in transition a foul against the Irish and it does go against Marcus Hammond just the fifth foul against Notre Dame so no shots yet for BC Earl Graham will take his user to lose it timeout and well step aside for 30 seconds Eagles Try to dial something up to cut into the lead before halftime next Music fansville presented by Dr Pepper a category 5 wave has broken containment for breakfast something is coming oh no its the wave I refuse to participate in this wave what is this the 80s next season prepare to cheer Dr Pepper the one fans deserve well this week well have the first nothing but net of the season in fact every Thursday at 10 Eastern right after our womens basketball doubleheader the nothing but net crew breaks down the night in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every womens game plus look ahead to the best games on the schedule in the coming week that is coverage you can only get one place right here on acc Network in the ESPN app so you can watch anywhere coach McGraws got to be happy with how Notre Dame women have played this year number four in the AP poll and also what the Notre Dame men are doing here at Conti Forum against BC Mike Grays team leads by six with under four seconds to play in the first half key for Boston College right here three seconds but get a good look Jason Madsen can shoot steps in midrange or goes and that is how the first half ends Applause BC trims it to four at the break weve got a great one here in Beantown the score 3834 lets get you to the studio Fenway yesterday what a scene here in Boston Ashton Langford denied Notre Dame with numbers JJ Starling kicks it works for three you bet and thats the part of starlings game I think the progression from The Freshman could it easily try to shoot a floater right there kick it out towards for a wide open three thats excellent transition offense and a great read by The Freshman first points for Trey wurtz now all eight Irish who have played have scored Zachary cant respond rebound to Starling who had 12 in the first half Cormac Ryan no hesitation rebound Demar Langford Music you know langfords been quiet only two points on one of four shooting last time he played Notre Dame he had a careerhigh 23 in South Bend last year an overtime win for the Irish Prince alipay fires too strong Ryan came flying in and the rebound will belong to the Irish and this right here great read start with the defense and then Starling you can see the progression from The Freshman not a settling for a floater that time dribble DriveIn transition kick it out uh you cant do it any better and thats again a smart play by The Freshman guard for Notre Dame I find a shooter and Trey wurtz who had 35 Plus this year is actually one of the lower percentages on this Notre Dame team a bunch of snipers for the Irish Dane Goodwin he was caught in traffic there got it out to Starling right back to Goodwin with five on the timer full rush for the Irish words triggers and Barry buried the Notre Dame bench and that is a really demoralizing Boston College gets Notre Dame deep in the shot clock and thats a contested three by words Ashton Langford oh for three to start the second half a 10point lead for the Irish this is their largest lead tonight Notre Dame Owen three in conference play Goodwin says why not Applause just first missed from downtown now three for four Zachary feeds it a league Bay Three Irish defenders in the vicinity and Starling ends up with it thats great team defense uh by Notre Dame thats something we saw them working on and shoot around doubling they knew look any time the ball goes into the post theyre going to try to double Starling missed that time and usually we were thinking it was when Quentin post would be out there the double team but theyre doing it no matter whos got the ball on the Block and I think thats part of uh because Boston files again they know theyre a team that does not shoot a lot of Threes or shoot it well theyre fine with giving up jumpers they just dont want to give up anything in the paint you take a look right here theyre almost doubling before that Balls even thrown right there again you can see lesevski one two three guys around the ball thats great team defense he missed their first five in the second half and Makai Ashton Langford ends the drought with a deep two but talking about the defense suck I mean you see the urgency and the intensity you said it the first thing coach Bray told us when we sat down with MSA we could really use one and theyre trying to tow the line between desperation and urgency it feels like they found it so far yeah and theyve all been close games even at Miami game as you take a look at another charge by Les fesky and thats twice now trying to set a ball screen uh hes picked up fouls thats not good foul in particular uh we talked about the depth issues for Notre Dame uh but back to your earlier Point uh coach gray knows look they could easily be two and one three and L those are some close games I called the Miami game look uh they had some stretches in there where theyre within two three and they did some uncharacteristic things with their turnovers but youre right they need one on the road tonight yeah there are three losses in ACC play a onepoint loss to Syracuse a onepoint loss at FSU and then the 11 Point loss to Miami but thats a little bit misleading that was a close game throughout it really was and you take away the turnovers theyre probably winning that game Zachary in attack mode Quinton post is in there has the offensive rebound Ashton Langford fires another again post seems to get a fingertip on every rebound opportunity a Notre Dame has it Applause or Mac Ryan with two points just three shots so far for the grad student that zone is in there with lucesky on the bench with two quick fouls here in the second half JJ Starling through contact couldnt finish Demar Langford the board for PC Langford to Langford Makai down low for McLaughlin good finish a great footwork all set up another really good post entry pass that time by Langford and McLaughlin nice little reverse pivot and finish Music mclachlton only played a couple minutes in the first half hes an early Contender for Sixth Man of the Year in this league Applause Music with five to shoot Hammond starlings three wont go how to bounce off with Zona Boston College basketball evenly matched his high level basketball team yeah nothing really uh pops out obviously you take a look at points in the paint uh Boston College leading that battle uh but I think the difference in the first half a Goodwin uh got it going uh early for Notre Dame and the threepoint shooting Boston College only one threepointer one of eight Notre Dame has made seven seven of 18 I think thats the big difference in this one kind of to be expected when these two teams match up Quentin post draws the foul for Boston College well weve seen some amazing fans across the ACC and now we need your help this winter ACC Network wants to help experience each sport from your perspective so snap a pic take a video tackle with a hashtag all the devotion and post it to your social you just might see it on acc Network just like you see Makai Ashton Langford score a couple more for BC to cut it to four and theyve both been off of out of bounds underneath thats great uh execution by Boston and the screening uh by The Bigs in particular post on that last one uh thats a great a job of executing their offense foreign against BC on the floor easiest way to get your teammate open go set a good screen post nice screen no help by Notre Dame and again thats twice now on that out of bounds underneath that time on the left side a Makai Ashton Langford able to come off clean and get a pretty high percentage shot short Baseline for this best game was against Virginia Tech a huge win for BC in overtime against a Hokies team that was redhot coming in another foul against the Eagles away from the ball drawn by Goodwin thats true on Devin McLaughlin jump ball Goodwin versus McLaughlin and the grad student tracks it down in the backcourt Dane Goodwin playing in his 140 first game in a Notre Dame uniform tied for most all time with Rex Pfluger who played for the Irish for at least like 1516 years and one of the great Shooters Defenders for Notre Dame and you know Mike gray talked about Dane Goodwin hes like look the kids never missed the game hes just an Iron Man one of those quiet leaders but hes a guy that can score on all three levels really impressed with his game and hes about as tough as they come some really good names on your screen there by the way fluger said 2015 I think its actually 1915 to 2020 when fluger played not one of the one of those guys who was so good for so long that just felt like he was there forever theres Hammond swings it out cormack Ryan whos got a pure stroke that one came up empty wurtz lachesky look at the ball movement for the Irish good defense from Ashton Langford but hes whistled for a block and thats all set up the spacing and ball Movement by Notre Dame right here all set up dribble Drive extra pass and close out yeah thats again that could have gone either way but I think because the spacing in Goodwin was already moving and movement towards the basket again thats just a great example of the spacing and ball movement that Notre Dame has on offense okay good one inside and out draws another foul missed the bunny but hell shoot a couple Dan Goodwin has been a magnet for fouls in the second half thats at least four that hes drawn either away from the ball or on it and this is something they did going back to the Miami game where theyll just isolate a good one down low end to post if they like a matchup uh hes a guy again he can score in all three levels weve seen the threepoint shooting came in shooting over 44 percent but uh his strength uh hes the guy that will go down low in the post as well too apart the staff coming in for BC taking out Devin McLaughlin and Goodwin with the game high 16 and in case youre just joining us Goodwin battling a bug right now he didnt participate in shoot around he kind of stood off to the side at one point he was keeled over and and I thought it was more likely that he would bomb it in that moment than play tonight but hes been outstanding okay were Boston College right now Notre Dame and man I try to get post or bicker staff a touch in the paint thats in Langford has been bombs away in this second half post after the volleyball touches picked it up and missed Bickerstaff had it for a second gets it back no look to post out of bounds Notre Dame ball well right idea uh but Id like to get them in the post off some movement right here okay scramble situation bicker staff trying to do a little bit too much but thats where they need to be offensively in the paint shooting from the perimeter certainly has been a struggle for Boston College theyre 11 from the threepoint line and its been a common theme all season for them Zachary with the effort out of bounds Notre Dame ball Music Applause fade and Zachary a great story under recruited out of Wisconsin spent a year at Juco Chipola College in the Panhandle in Florida as lachesky misses and Langford goes up for the rebound Zachary last year his first season at BC super efficient now hes up near the top of the scouting report as post misses Zachary hasnt been quite a sufficient scoring the ball but still a great leader for this BCT yeah great story and uh hes a guy again the coaching staff early on but going back to last year they were just so high on what he brings to the table to them defend too wurt Scott by him but post with the help of course the miss Demar Langford euros they see just three of 14 from the field this half but locking down defensively still trailing by just five thank you tend to shoot for the Irish Cormac Ryan on the back door cut grad student to grad student a Savvy play as lacheski found him beautiful setup that time all because uh Cormac right you have to respect the threepoint shot of Notre Dame nice pass though by laceski Music Applause Ashton Langford from distance with the left hand no Yanks down the board for Notre Dame mentioned the experience on this Irish roster six grad students is the most of any team in the country Goodwin is one of them hits it to Marcus Hammond a grad student transferred in from Niagara letski all alone top of the key of three no vaseskys been busy but struggling to score just one of six and now oh of five from Beyond The Arc and that right there is a break for Boston College thats a wide open look for luceski oh whos a pretty good threepoint shooter I think hes just fatigued go from banging around uh with Quentin post its a great call not a whole lot of depth for Notre Dame also down Ben Allen Lubin who left with an ankle issue Jaden Zachary Cashes in his first triple tonight makes it a fourpoint game its there you dont mind that three off a pretty good ball movement the ball went left to right and then a skip pass Applause Notre Dame has been there in Boston College to shoot those all game Hammond with the response Applause Marcus Hammond coming right back at you the grad student from Queens and he is so key Mike gray talked about the importance of him uh being in the lineup thats a big three for them but I think uh his floor game huge for Notre Dame thats a seven point lead for the Irish Midway through the second half BC has struggled to shoot the long ball tonight Jaden Zachary just hit their second Notre Dames been stroking it eight threes including that one for Marcus Hank Brian Boyle of the NHL and also those little sparkies on a school night attending a night game here at Conti forum and its a good one BC Trails by seven against Notre Dame through Carter Malcolm Huck could be our entire crew thrilled to be with you for a crucial one for both teams Jaden Zachary has been in attack mode in the second half up to nine points tonight trims it to five okay great uh directly missing again not settling for a jumper of that time had to clear a lane thats a tough two though in traffic for Jaden Zachary foreign Applause out there for Notre Dame hes played sparingly this year but injury issues for the Irish as Ben Allen Lubin is out for the rest of the night with an ankle issue out of bounds off of Notre Dame PC ball and this is all set up Zachary right here hit a three before now they have to run out at you on a threepoint line and he made that one look easy thats a tough finish yeah coach Earl Grant was telling us a little bit today that life is different when you go from fourth on The Scouting Report to first or second Zacharys dealt with that this year again going to the hole drops it off TJ Bickerstaff through contact well shoot a couple and last year with Zachary I think the big thing really unknown we talked about him the very a little known about him not highly recruited coming out so its kind of under the radar coming into it and took a look at the numbers right here for Boston College hes going to be key for them to close out this game I think the big thing uh knocking down some perimeter jumpers the strategy still has not changed for Notre Dame they want to keep Boston pallets out of the paint and TJ Bickerstaff is one guy you got to keep away from the basket Big Time basketball fans will recognize that last name his uncle is JB Bickerstaff head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers his grandpa Bernie Bickerstaff a long time head coach in the NBA now in the front office with Cleveland and speaking of the Cavs you see Donovan Mitchell last night my goodness 71 points I mean I dont care what level youre at bitty junior high high school college but you do that in the NBA game man he is fun to watch I think hes like the seventh player ever to score 70 plus in an NBA game Wilt Chamberlain probably did it like six or seven times of scoring right now a little drought for a boat teams Nate lashesky ends the drought for Notre Dame I was only a second twopoint shot attempt of the night lacheskis 0 for 5 from Deep two for two from inside the yard yeah thats good recognition again just break off your play isolate luceski down low on the Block and showing off some nice touch known as a post guy but that time in the block for Notre Dame Tamara Langford that was tough rebound Prince alike Bay and the Freshman puts it back up and in chesky not really known as a post scorer they had a guy in Paul Atkinson last year who was and he could really initiate offense from the post feels like theyre missing that this year yeah I think also very good passer as well too yes he could score but he was a good pass there I IQ guy so certainly they miss his presence I think a lot this year foreign a couple big losses for them along with Blake Wesley a first round pick a league base Skies to retrieve it and put it in and make it a possession game points tonight Mike Ray will use the timeout Conti Forum starting to feel it 7 15 to go a threepoint lead for Notre Dame Prince salip Bay with backtoback buckets its starting to get hot at the nut hey Ive made this a onepossession game great work on the offensive glass right here this is their identity Boston College uh grimy uh get in the paint to do your damage and dominate thats something Earl Grant emphasized uh this afternoon and shoot around in in this last five minute stretch thats been the key in this game right here theyve been dominant in the pink when it comes to this BC program grimy is a term of endearment Earl Grant preaches gritty not pretty Dan Goodwins baby hook wont go three eagles flying up for the rebound a league Bay came down with it see if they feed the Freshman again with under seven to play in the second half and whatever it is if youre Boston College right now you have to have either a dribble drive into the paint or try to get post uh posted up and let him do some damage uh do not theyll settle for a jumper Zachary curling around the screen midrange jump shot and thats what they did Huck settled for a jumper but it stays here with BC and a fresh 20 on the shot clock and its Timeout on the floor we will step aside still a threepoint game here at County forum in Notre Dame leads Boston College by three Eagles have the ball Prince the league they scored the last Four Freshmen 10 in white whos got it now Hayden Zachary at the controls heres tomorrow Langford Jr under 10 to shoot as Mason mats in the Cincinnati transfer dumps it in Quinton posts the seven footer from Amsterdam is fouled on the floor Basket doesnt count but you can see uh the shape of this plane it was all along trying to get a post right there in the paint a good job of sealing that time by Quint post thats three fouls against Nate lasheski Jaden Zachary fouled its Ray Wertz and thats the seventh foul against the Irish in the second half that was a shooting foul anyway but now BC is in the bonus well a little uh under talked about thing Quentin post has set some good screens that time a little rub screen off the handoff uh to Jaden Zachary and hes freed up both Langford and Zachary for some pretty clean looks foreign most easily the biggest player on the floor yeah and hes cleared out space for them to open up some driving Lanes Music Zachary split him 10 points got his own Miss slicked up top for post and the sevenfooter couldnt Corral it Notre Dame in a hurry works for three swirls out three eagles with 10 points even Zachary post and Makai Ashton Langford whos on the bench right now for Earl Grant how to imagine hell be back in there soon with six minutes to play younger brother Demar with the basketball now foreign Music quick move to the hole you bet we are tied at Conti Forum under six to play beautiful offense spacing was there post cleared out that time and in a loud Zachary uh to operate on the Baseline a 70 run for the Eagles pretty good crowd for a Tuesday night here at Conti Forum with the students away on winter break and theyre getting loud now spun right into post fans wanted to travel as Starling chews it up and buries a tray his first three points of the second half coming up big time its easy to see why they are so excited about this freshman quiet big first half and thats a big time free shot clock winding down thats a tough break though for Boston College Applause already down to 10 on the shot clock post going back to work Goodwin brings the double nice skip pass Zachary in attack mode whistle and a foul against Goodwin its right here not bad defense by Boston College shot clock winding down probably not a good help though by a Demar Langford the one guy you dont want to leave in that situation right there although he struggled in the second half really no need to help now should that have been a travel against lecheski yeah it was hard to see if he came out he was knocked out of his hands or he just lost it I think the referees felt like it was knocked out of his hand nonetheless all right lets see right here hes dribble Drive yeah yeah and that angle right there again Mighty just lost it after the initial tap but nonetheless thats a tough break every Point crucial here is Zachary again splits the free throws hes only 24 at the stripe tonight an 84 foul shoot around the season Notre Dame by two under five youre at Conti form crucial game for both teams Irish Owen three in conference Eagles one and two heres Cormac Ryan hounded by Mason Matson news not sure about the foul call on the deck grimacing a little bit Cincinnati transfer picks up his first Applause that was a sixth foul against BC in the second half so the Irish will go 11 on the next one heres Cormac Ryan splashes a tray cormack Ryan with a name like that was born to play in this game makes it a fivepoint Irish lead and thats uh I think By Design they put Post in the high ball screen uh they know hes coming back he does not heads and Ryan makes him pay a league Bay cant answer Starling up top for the rebound and they whistle Jade and Zachary for a foul so thatll be the seventh against the Eagles and Starling will shoot one and one and right here again Quentin post flatten out in uh coming back uh hes got to understand Cormac Ryan coming off oh you got a hedge on that one or shell to help and then this right here not a good foul by Jaden Zachary again they got two guys there he secured it I certainly do not want to put a Notre Dame on the free throw line in that situation Starling is 69 foul shooter in his freshman season nice touch on the first right foreign folks dont forget about Sunday womens basketball on acc Network game start at noon Eastern were featuring these two Pittsburgh and Louisville cards are hot and then Notre Dame and Carolina two top 25 teams doing battle Sunday right here on acc Network one for two for Starling six point Edge for the Irish under four to play as BC go for offense here Zacharys had the hot hand in the second half host can shoot from there big man misses a league Bay offensive rebound fouled on his way back up and the Freshman from Minneapolis will shoot two when we come back buckle up this is an outstanding early January basketball game its for Dane Goodwin and JJ Stahl and thats been a difference in this game Port Notre Dame Mike Frey at halftime talked about if we can score it these two guys have done that for them uh that one deep into sock clock and a deep three for the freshman and you take a look at the numbers 16 and 16 for Starling a good win and of those two guys that provided the offense for Notre Dame Prince olipe at the line for BC The Freshman from Minneapolis who is a finalist for Mr basketball in Minnesota last year at Minnehaha Academy averaged 28 and 12 teammates with Jalen Suggs and Chet Holmgren point game and right now Boston College picks up their pressure and Notre Dame struggled with at the end of the Miami game Ive been an issue in this one against Boston College theyre back to their normal ways theyve done a pretty good job taking care of the ball only five turnovers after 17 against Miami last time out a season High JJ Starling The Freshman draws the foul it is a block against Jaden Zachary whos incredulous as he gets helped up Earl Grant not happy with that call thought it was late hes got the jacket off right now lets see um yeah now again if anything I think its a noncall because it was almost after lets see um and I think because Jade and Zachary tried to move out of the way it almost like he tried to slide out of the lane that got Earl Grant to pull the jacket off thats a big ball finally not able to capitalize on the first one Laughter by the way watch Earl Grant over on the sideline he looks like he could still play theyll get in the defensive stance too especially now that the jacket has come off Jayden Zachary foul uh he has shown great body control through contact all in the second half this is all set up by a beautiful crosscourt pass by post Im not sure how he got that one through take the hit and finish thats a big time uh and one situation for Jaden Zachary Peyton Zachary so crucial for this team on and off the floor after that loss to Syracuse on New Years Eve he called up his coach Earl Grant around 10 30 and you could just tell he was upset feels like hes not playing as well as hes capable of this year maybe hes busting out of his slump hes got 16 points tonight for BC and half of their points this half to make it a onepoint game Cormac Ryan with a Step Up and Under oh yeah foreign Applause experienced guards shot making down the stretch threepoint lead for the Irish Applause Zachary looking for a shot sets it up Makai Ashton Langford a league Bay has been great in the second half double comes Elite base shoots over it and scores oh Prince the league man looks like hes been playing in the ACC for years I mean thats a double team just raised up over really two guys not bad defense by Notre Dame thats just a tough contested too by the freshman this is a great game as we come up on two minutes welcome to everyone just joining us JJ Starling block Ashton Langford is down in a heap on the floor and the officials will blow it dead Meryl Grant wants them to take a look at this and see if there was maybe an elbow yeah and again he went down immediately and hes bleeding oh man lets see oh yeah now again I dont think and again I think the thing is intent uh thats not a wild elbow thats just a guy again uh Makai Ashton Langford up in his uh space it wasnt a wild uh elbow and I think thats the key thing theyre going to look at uh the intent was it a basketball play and in this situation right here again hes just trying to get away from him really its not again it wasnt like it was a I mean if he could aim his elbow like that on purpose thatd be impressive yeah you know theyre showing it on the Jumbotron here at Conti Forum watch it watch it regular speed the officials coming over and telling us just a basketball play ER and I thought that would be to call after looking at it again the whole thing is you can see intent you can clearly see her right there uh hes just trying to get away from a kayak from Langford one of the better Defenders uh in the ACC and Music watch JJ Starling here the Freshman for Notre Dame checking in on Ashton Langford love to see that look looked inadvertent To Us by the way no one ever says advert is advertent a word or is it just inadvert thats not in my vocabulary that might be into Drew Carter vocabulary not mine but certainly good to see him be able to walk off thank you so Ashton Lankford on the bench for now with two minutes to play a onepoint lead for Notre Dame the Eagles have never LED tonight they can change that here s Demar Langford makais younger brother find Zachary Madisons dangerous from downtown pulls it up midrange and BC leads for the first time tonight Applause probably their best offensive possession as well to boss one left to right as Mike gray is going to get a timeout Auntie form is on its feet well step aside for 30 seconds do not go anywhere what a finish in store in Boston Eagles by one Music on an eerie fansville by Dr Pepper said you want a new coach right behold the coaching Charisma 33 dry hit the hole dont dance what do you pick you dont it picks for you thats the international soccer coach Dr Pepper Dr Pepper the one fans deserve Austin College leads for the first time tonight Makai Ashton Langford a little bit banged up BC without one of their better players comes down and scores Mason Madsen yeah its a beautiful pullup again dont settle for the jumper off of excellent spacing and ball movement probably their best offensive possession uh allnight shot clock winding down and they take the lead on that right there dont forget our Wednesday college basketball double header here on acc Network that is Duke and NC State and then Wake Forest and Carolina should be two great matchups with some of the conferences top teams all in the state of North Carolina all right Notre Dame with the ball here out of the timeout from coach Bray what do you expect I put right now Quentin posted some type of eyeball screen uh I go Starling or Dane Goodwin let them go to work on that ball screen uh with Quentin Post in there again thats been problematic for uh Boston College Applause Notre Dame down to one timeout BC still has all three here in the second half under 90 seconds to play Pete laceski picked up his dribble gets it to Marcus Hammond the Niagara transfer Hammond runs the screen and roll they get post on the mismatch Hammond cant take advantage a league Bay The Rebound with BC up by one and thats not a bad look again off the ball screen that they add Quentin Post in Hammond had a pretty good look and you get the switch uh thats not bad uh just unable to convert in that time uh Starling on the bench for Notre Dame well you called it huckstradamus you said lets get Post in a little high screen action they did and Hammond with a pretty good luck yeah and again you know in that situation right there you have a seven footer out on a guard uh you can question it again maybe you want them driving youre in a bonus situation uh not a bad pullup its a pretty good look on the other end right here as you take a look at the game summary uh Jade and Zachary huge and the second half were Boston College really I think he had like a fiveminute stretch where he put Boston College on their back quit and post we talked about it the importance of having the seven footer back in the lineup for Boston College hes almost in a double double the leaders Goodwin and Starling Starling on the bench for that last possession uh thats when were into ways hes played although hes struggled a little in the second half uh certainly uh hes a guy that could be a playmaker for them to close the game out you mentioned Jane and Zachary taking this game over as the Eagles came all the way back to take their first lead at 6261 alipay was outstanding as well yeah the Freshman was as billed right here the ball movement but Matson not settling for a jumper nice little head fake 12 into his pullup jumper that was huge uh for Boston College right now though Im going right back down same thing again dribble drive but try to get quick post a down low in the block for eligbay uh do not uh settle a 4A jumper or a contested jumper if your boss to college look whos back in there Makai Ashton Langford 11 in white talking with his big man Quinton post right now Music Applause Jaden Zachary well start with the pill right to the hall Jane and Zachary scores again hes in high eight and three four Mac Ryan calling for a screen Zachary hounding him foreign for the Irish Ryan with the mismatch against the sevenfooter post shoots for three no good out of bounds BC ball Jade and Zachary implores the fans here at County forum to make some noise oh not a good offensive possession by Notre Dame right here though uh this guy we talked about it uh hes put Boston College on his back uh in this second half another dribble Drive No Help by Notre Dame to that previous possession for Notre Dame thats not a good look Cormac Ryan to keep contested three how about Jade and Zachary I mean its been admittedly at times struggle for him from an efficiency perspective compared to last year a 48 from Deep last season just 27 this year tonight really not messing around from the one of two from outside the arc and hes six of eight from inside and Earl Grant weve talked about it uh the phone call he got he took it upon himself he was really upset with the way he played in that Syracuse game a loss of Fort Boston College and uh he took it personally and Earl Grant said look uh I was kind of happy uh he thinks that uh he cares so much about this team winning and uh certainly I think hes redeemed himself after that Syracuse game the performance hes put on in the second half tonight six point second 67 difference between the shot clock and the game clock and Notre Dame fouls right away and BC in the double bonus will shoot two Jamar Langford Langford just a 67 percent foul shooter this year 14 of 21 scouting by Notre Dame you identify uh who you want on the foul line you talked about it uh Demar Langford 66 from the free throw line youll live with that if youre Notre Dame put somebody on the free throw line that you think can get a Miss for you well Langford answers the Bell on the first been a quiet night for the Junior from Worcester thats just his third point one of six from the floor but he can make it a two possession game here Applause if you had some words with his coach Earl Grant coach Grant is out there on the floor himself sixth defender in the Press BC made six consecutive free throws at this point they lead by five foreign Goodwin who fires cant hit Prince Ali Bay the rebound foul Notre Dame and the Eagles fans can taste it now well on that last possession Boston cause they switched everything every ball screen pinned down uh they were just switching Notre Dame had some time thought this was a little quick for Goodwin in that last situation again I still think if post is out there if you get a switch on him isolate and then either go to work off the drive or try to see if you can get a clean look 13 points for the Freshman Prince a league Bay again he has struggled at the stripe this year only 47 percent hes now 45 at the line tonight Earl Grant talked about the importance of Clinton post back in the lineup for them and how he learned from that Syracuse game how he has to adjust his rotation he felt like he could have given guys uh more minutes and the guys need to get used to playing with the seven footer I think theyve adjusted pretty good in this one 100 run for BC seven point lead under 15 to play Cormac Ryan attacks no dane Goodwin cant follow it up again they missed Goodwin has it again clock is dwindling on the fifth try Notre Dame scores to cut it to a fivepoint game but 42 seconds left Im out Notre Dame that is their last one well it seemed like there was three or four maybe five offensive rebounds just alone in this one uh theres one two theres a three four and uh five right there so again a great job if Notre Dame staying with it poor job though Boston caught four guys standing around uh but still right now in this situation if youre oh Grant youre up five uh youre thinking look you must inbound the ball do not turn it over uh if youre Notre Dame you got to be careful if they face guard uh you got to be careful with Boston College running somebody long for a layup looks like Notre Dame has no body back so it looks like Boy Scouts could if they want a ransom body long if theres no safety for Notre Dame baseball pass to his brother Makai who puts the finishing touches on a BC win Applause ston College wins The Holy War 7063 they close it out on a 174 run and the Eagles are 500 in conference play uh theyve trailed pretty much the whole game and Earl Grant talked about what their identity is a gritty team that makes it difficult for the other team uh their defense but Jaden Zachary in that second half I think that was the key for Boston College uh what a great offensive performance for him uh contested shots and then defensively he was really good for Boston College to pose off this game an allaround performance for Boston College spearheaded by Jaden Zachary with a season
