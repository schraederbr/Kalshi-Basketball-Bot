on the first possession Wes we talked to Coach Keats earlier today and we talked about the matchup with post and he liked diara on post more so than Burns defensively look at burns on the scoop and it rolls DJs an early for NC State against what theyre doing offensively well with burs is such a unique player the way he plays he doesnt look the part but hes such an effective and efficient player he can spin you get body to body on him like got to the rim found a way to score hes a really unique player in this league Zachary whips a pass toward post he lost the handle on it itll belong to the wolf pack youll notice NC State is wearing jerseys today that hearken back oh 50 years to the 1974 National Championship team that tremendous group of players and team will be honored here at halftime 50 years ago the wol Pack won the national title theres Burns its four nothing and I I Im telling you Wes this this young man is a really good basketball player he was outstanding all last year but a little more up and down this year but hes a hard matchup he can pass highly skilled hes a really good basketball player again things that he does is just hard to prepare for and he first two baskets thats whats happened here against BC mton terrific young player sophomore red shirt Boston Colleges big issue here early is theyve only gotten one chance at a shot yeah well thats not good because you dont want NC State to get on those momentum runs especially at home with this crowd with a 74 National Championship team here theyve got to find ways to score the ball hasnt been good these first few possessions yeah theres already enough electricity with that you add to it with good play early and all of a sudden BC might be in a world of trouble heres oconnell starting for the seven straight ball game for Coach Keats transfer from Stanford oh that had no chance mlon blocked it the away and here are the Eagles turning away the w for the first time and you in transition offense youll see right here double drags Matson turned it down but they will get in single drags double drags meaning theres two players there or if theres a single drag one player but all the time post will be involved in those screening actions with the pick and Pops Baseline inbounds the post and ell reached in slapped it out of the hands of the big fella post his energy got to get going right now first back first play that coach Grant had great back door cut they glocked him through at the post got it block right there is kind of B bobbling with his hands hes got to get his energy for BC to win this game they need post to be at a high level change for the wolf pack Ben Middlebrooks comes into the ball game Burns gets a quick break for Kevin ke and a four nothing wol pack lead this is claudell Harris J terrific score who transferred from Charleston Southern working against morel heres horn and the wack trying to flip the floor DJ spots up really good defense there by morcel I thought he was a really good defense and then you look at the transition which NC States as good as anybody in this league on playing in transition offense great pull up there by horn continues his momentum from where hes been playing last few games Marner calls a foul on Quinton post I believe and if so thatll be the first on post as you get a look at Kevin Keats 129 wins in his NC State Career and now better than 200 in a career that spans right at a decade and now an offensive foul called at the other end thats on Morel Ted Valentine Mark Justin Porterfield on the whistle here today in Ry the great thing West sitting here I got the opportunity to criticize the referees getting in trouble so thats whats one of the advantages being on this side of it but look backto back offensive fouls there North Carolina state was trying to run they call it an ion action to get horn a shot heres mton turning with the right hand post the rebound BC gets a second chance hell try and back down with the right hand and there goes Quinton post to work I think the game plan for Coach Grant is weve got to keep going into Quinton post from start to finish hes got to get going hopefully gets his energy going with that first basket heres DJ horn trying to find some working room and BC collapse all over him Josh to force the turnover and I tell you what thats what they do defensively they really pack it in the paint they really try to guard that paint and Zachary who they do post up right here on the offensive end he is a very good Defender as well tough and hard got slapped around diara finally cleans it up 62 in favor of the p horn for three thats way off and mson clears the rebound mat five straight dou fig games for Earl Grant club aaging right at about 15 and a half a game in that stretch Zachary tried to go to post it away to Morel BC cant get out of it own wayth turnover by The Eagles doesnt matter what sport it is west turnover hard to win games when you turn the ball over like that after the morel Miss mlon offensive foul Morel stepped in draws the first from outstanding coach has done a great job with the program and trending continually in the right and theyve got a good basketball team it Jen Zary scores Buck for the Eagles Zachary is such a key for BC for Boston College hes tough hes hard noosed he they theyll post him up on the offensive end hes hes kind of their the guy that wears a hard hat on that team and the working boots and just does all the Dirty Work tough hard no player armman Mighty trying to take starts out of DJs andson helped with the dou team the Eagles running again kick the corner and what do we have deflected out of bounds so itll go to Boston Boston C turns it over again already now six of them for Coach Grants team it doesnt matter if its football West basketball Hockey baseball gymnastics will cross if you turn it over youre not winning the game scoring Dr of almost three minutes here for the wolf pack burs with the left hand mton gave it a shot and last Touch by Boston College saysed Valentine ask for a little help there in West if Im North Carolina State and Kevin sitting there at the head coach youre kind of youre youre frustrated because the many possessions that Boston College has given us right has given NC State if Im Kevin ke Im thinking to myself man we dont have we got to have a larger lead than what we have right now heres Burns fighting through and a h b well keep it with a wolf theyre not taking advantage of the opportunities that Boston College has given them on those fre exra possessions well Kevin Keats took DJ horn out during the break oconnell has returned Jaden Taylor by the way the transfer from Indianapolis on the floor heres burns up strong against arm Mighty Third Field go for DJ Burns W DJ Burns gets to that angle on his right shoulder over his right shoulder hes really hard to stop hes all about angles everything in everything in the post is about angles we welcome those of you who started your day with ACC womens lacrosse with Clemson and Duke were in Raleigh at PNC Arena where minutes gone NC State off to a good start Boston College has turned it over six times and DJ Burns has got six of the wolf pack eight with Josh passner West Durham we welcome you to PNC Arena on a celebratory day for NC State the 1974 championship team having their 50th reunion theyll be honored here at half time youll see part of it in our coverage on acc Network heres DJ Burns back to worky left it arm Mighty the sophore from Toronto picks up his first its the third on Boston College Josh one of the things weve seen here in the first almost seven minutes of play Boston College turning it over Inc State not able to take advantage though no you look there and again great to be with you w for the fans here what a legend and honor to be next to westerm here but youre right BCs got six turnovers North Carolina state theyre only up four they should be up way more right now the issue is North Carolina States got four turnovers themselves points in the paint theyve really tried to establish Burns attacking getting over that right shoulder with Burns and those angles you can see the points in the paint right there see how the game continues to go post has been in and out a little bit just with his play hes checking back in so see how that goes with his there in the front court because Kevin and NC State are trying to establish Burns in the paint couple of substitutions you mentioned post Donald Han J onto the floor he wears 13 for the Eagles and sos Chaz Kelly thei hes D zero to join Harris meanwhile Brion pass has checked in for the wolf pack his playing time has gone up here recently he joins horn middle Brooks diara all on the floor here so Burns will take a break ahead of the under time out hell go tos bench with of NC St 10 here coachs mentioned after the gameuse one of the few he was frustrated but one of the few players he was happy about was Brion pass so well see if he gets a he can play like he did against Syracuse in this game pass played 10 minutes the other night against Syracuse heres an entry pass for Quinton post hes fouled from behind by Middlebrooks first on Ben Middlebrooks the Clemson transfer second on the wolf so a new possession new shot clock 20 seconds for Boston College a lot of the out of bounds base out of Bounds at Boston colge runs are designed to get the ball into post theres a three from Harris and diara whos a terrific rebounder pulls it away horn who has been unbelievable of late six games of4 or more for the wolf pack pass back three twoo strong diara kept it alive post will run it down you can see in transition here Boston colle will continue to run a lot of drag screens or playr post Quint post at the high post almost like five out and have him be the initiator because of his ability to pass mton looking for post middle Brooks right there heres post little softway left it horn on the drive against Harris hell leave it for Dis three nope and the rebound is hand second accer Donald Jost in thatll get us to the under timeout assist yet so we got to stop turning the ball over here for both teams been an issue right now and I know both coaches feel the same way about that Jaden Taylor on a hard drive Burns tried to keep it alive and did but its a league Bay that comes up with it he fires a lead pass and Matson scores how about that turn of events for Boston College in 94t Wes Matson since hes been inserted in the starting lineup over these last four games has been at an extremely high level for Boston College hes obviously an elite shooter but hes doing other things as well too sure is here is Taylor for three first three of the Ball Game Belongs to Jaden Taylor and it was the first assist of the game Boston College went to go double Burns Burns was able to make a direct pass on a strike nothing but the bottom of the net great play there by burns on being able to find the open guy off that double Josh He averages two and a half assists the game one of the things I keep hearing in our travel around the league is how good a passer DJ Burns is for what Kevin ke needs absolutely and and the thing that he does he doesnt catch it directly at the Block its more in the long post so the the the scheme or the strategy is where do you double do you double them they call it double or Monster whatever you want to call the terminology is it at the dribble is it at the Block and then thats where becomes the issues and now he knock down Im a big fan of this young mans game I think hes really good hes unique player hes a different player than anybody is like him in this league and hes a very very hard match up hes pushed the lead to its largest of nine here in this first half so while DJ Horns been quiet DJ Burns has been early for the Eagles and the rebound of the one and the Eagles the floor here is Taylor hor has but a single field goal heres Burns going to work hell kick it for horn theres a three away got it the best threepoint shooter in the AC is DJ hor and a for and you can see the gravity that what happened with going to burn everyone got sucked in and they kicked it out the horn he got an open three a great another pass by by birds 12o lead for the wolf pack just like the DJ is going to work in when we listen we are unconfined free to travel the worlds inside our minds where time moves fast stops rewinds so let us take this kicks horn kicks at the horn and finds an open three Burns was so confident he start down the floor back door layup from Madson Earl Grants team on the board just their fourth basket though and its back to a 10point game great out out of timeout execution there by Boston College they needed that basket to stop the run good call there by Earl Grant on the execution out of the timeout Burns and post collide DJ Burns hit the deck heres Taylor for three thats offline Burns has the long rebound left hand stick back too strong scramble inside diara couldnt finish at the offensive Applause window kick ahead for a league Bay sophomore from Applause Minneapolis see right now BCS they trying to theyre trying to get the post but diara has done a great job fronting post to take the ball away from on those plays Prince Al League Bay knocks down just his fifth three of the year he was four of 31 before that one if you notice Kevin Keats told his guys to short close dont close out flying at him give him the three and he made it pay him off they follow the Scouting Report to get it a shot that ones on the coach huh well they were following the numbers the numbers said he wasnt going to make it I just wanted to see how far you were from the bench youre not that far yet foul on the Block I think that is Clinton post and thatll be his second so post now has two fouls Josh with 828 to play in this first half that is four on BC you leaving I there coach Grants taking him out right now I would probably like to leave him just because with the lead right there I just think the way Burns has been wow they theyve struggled against and Quinton post had some parting words for 10 Valentine you dont want to mess with Teddy Valentine thought for a moment that uh Valentine was going to te up Quinton post he did not that would have been post third foul by the way heres Burns tried to skip it across it hit Harris in the head and heres Zachary at the other end he missed the layup knocked out of bounds last Touch by the wolf P claudell Harris took a I mean he took one in the Noggin here on Burnss pass that was like a Tom Brady throw literally in the Super Bowl with that speed that he threw it at with burs I mean you can see it right here I mean he threw it it got oh it got uh deflected on that and hit him right in the face burs was trying to find on the weak side slot because thats where the double came but the deflection with the hands there caused it to get the Harris to get hit right in the face with the ball those things sting and hurt oh clell Harris comes out of the ball game Nick gato the eagle trainer goes right to him Applause so Zachary hand Al League Bay Madson and Armani Mighty this big sophomore from torado who gives it to Zachary his shot altered by morcel recovered horn under eight to go in the first half you can see the transition there drag screen to try to get horn an open three okon the recovery heres horn right back diara tees up another one sure 11 three of the year for mohamd diara from France hey Wes talk about a luxury at his size to be able to step out and make those shots hes got a hes got a pretty form thats a thats a great thing to have for NC State diara 11 of 32 on the year he is one for two Thompson was Michael Jordan before Michael Jordan is a fact Michael Jordans favorite player growing up with David Thompson D took it away from the Eagles and heres horn DJ horn has shown some flickers but he hasnt caught fire yet here today but Fort FRC State Burns has picked up on that slack and that hasnt been the case as much in the last few games theres some of what DJ Horns been putting on the board though right as were talking about that he hits a tough contested two and thats what hes done over this stretch of these games where hes hit 25 or more its been on just different ways of scoring not just stand still threes hes found ways to drive it midrange threes its been a complete player lead is 12 for the pack Donald Han Jr whose dad was a star at Virginia ball got deflected heres the turnover Jaden Taylor trying to race for the basket through traffic and hell oh look out Madson came down and I think his foot caught the shoulder of Taylor oh that could have been real tough underneath the hoop for Taylor instead the foul is on hand itll be his first five on the Eagles now watch Madson come down oh top of the hit oh my goodness he Taylor got his forearm there to protect his face right as that knee came down but let me just say this its another turnover for Boston College on the other end West thats nine turnovers already 10 excuse me hes had a 10 turnovers already Im already one down on that goodness gracious its just too many yep for for Boston College and when youre playing against a team like NC State who can explode in scoring bunches youre youre youre just gifting them with extra possessions not giving your chance to set your defense up to really guard which Boston College is a very good defensive team they guard the paint but the turnovers dont let you allow you to set your defense up at all five points here in the first half for the butler transfer Jaden Taylor he had 18 the first time these two schools played back in early December Chestnut Hill you see with post not being in offensively it changes the high the five out action Zachary 3 got it Jaden Zachary five points for the young man who had 20 in their first meeting hes averaging 11 against the league ell for horn here and did Zachary get a hand on it might have turned over by the Wolfpack heres Harris whos been very quiet early hell skip for Madson three ball itll spin around diara the rebound that the other end there that was a huge three by Zachary to kind of just cut cut in the lead theyve been struggling to score Boston College and that one just rolled in and out got a great look for Matson Taylor travel drugg the pivot foot nice piece of officiating by Justin Porterfield a wolf pack turnover will give it to BC Josh how important the last five and a half and does Earl Grant bring Quinton post by well you know look I I you dont want to get the lead so stretched out where you dont stay within Striking Distance so you got to be careful about that and offensively theyre so much better with post on the floor because they like to play the five out initiate things through him he can score at The Rim he can pick and pop hes just such a hard matchup for the opposing team so it really determines in these next 30 seconds to to a minute do they stay within Striking Distance but that doesnt help whatsoever continuing to turn the ball over and gifting North Carolina State literally just possession after possession Burns is going to get back in the ball game to replace middle Brooks here and here comes DJ Burns is that a terrific first half so Wes you saw the pressure there by NC State but usually they would have at the top of the key there Quinton post to reverse it in the play through without him on the bench that just takes such an integral part of their offense out Burns squares on mcglockton Harris will pull it away Eagles shooting 33 here in the first half and the ball got kicked itll stay with DC as poorly as Boston College has played offensively with turnover shooting right to only be down 11 is you know theyre they need to be very grateful for that because they could easily have just been extended this lead by a 20 25 Point situation based on the amount of extra possessions and how Boston College is not scoring so that will be interesting to see can they stay within Striking Distance over these these next five minutes heres Zachary Elite Bay mlon working on burns now boy Zachary turns and left it short good defense by Taylor hes got horn with him Jaden Taylor and fouled on the play foul is going to be on Matson I believe itll be the first on the senior from rockchester Minnesota number six on the Eagles so it it was an airball so it left it short so it allowed NC State to fly in transition offense which theyre theyre theyre as good as anybody in this league in getting out in transition and Boston College who is a good defensive team who who coach Grant they they practice transition defense theyre big about that building a wall but when you either have a turnover or a tough shot and has an airball like that you dont allow your def defense to C to get set and then youre in a twoonone situation there and Taylor gets to the free throw line six in the first half now for Jaden Taylor NC State by the way five for five at the line and six for six as Taylor knocks the free throw down to give him seven wol pack fourth best free throw shooting team in ACC play at 77 and after every made free throw if you watch North Carolina state is able to set up the Press cause pressure on the BC and with post not in to be able to relieve some pressure at the high post thats where their offense can get a little stagnant and maybe a little out of syn Kelly tend to shoot and the corner mlock in a long three offensive rebound hell feed a leag bay for the hammer second field goal for Prince elag Bay it was the Miss but NC State started leaking out trying to run in transition without securing the ball first that drives the coach up the wall Taylor for three and the boxs out of rebound for Parker and were going to get a foul called underneath here and that will send it toward the Eagles but well get a timeout its 11point lead State on a nice throw on the inbounds pass Josh to set up the bucket well out of the timeout NC State pressed Court manto man and had nobody back Burns was back but he was kind of up by half court great throw behind great pass by Burns as well too there on the back door cut Dennis Parker the bucket but really good press Break by Earl Grant the time before out of the timeout for that press break were able to get the basket mlon plays with a leag bay Harris Matson and Kelly and there goes Prince of League Bay and one I tell you what he has come off the bench J hes got nine to lead the Eagles and a chance for double figures off the foul Prince has been really good and is a back door passer but watch burns look at Burns hands theyre all down by his side there is no ball pressure so hes caught in no mans land hes not ball pressuring hes back off hands are down and they allow to drop the back door pass and I tell you what else and theyve been okay without Post in the game right now but its allowed Burns to guard mcglockton on the perimeter where coach ke didnt want burn be guarding post on the perimeter so its a but its actually worked in right now the favor where Boston College has a run going offensively sophomore from miniapolis elag Bay now has 10 off of Earl Grants bench lead down to eight its been as big as 14 oconnell through traffic lost it and a whistle and foul its going to be on Chaz Kelly itll be his first that is seven now on BC so one and one or two shots actually here for the Stanford transfer with 259 to go first half and and if you see here on oconnell there was no passes it was the there was a lot of pressure by BC they couldnt run their action so oconnell just said okay Im just going to take it myself its not what coach Keats wanted its not OK connells game like that but he did get to the free throw line dont forget a triple header of womens basketball tomorrow BC and Notre Dame get a start at noon then its 200 presented by food line how about Carolina Virginia Tech thats where game day will be tomorrow as well the castle in blackburg and then State and Duke finish it up from Cameron at 530 its all here on acc Network and always available on the ESPN app first two points for Michael okell and the lead back to 10 for the pack very important Boston College stays within Striking Distance before they get to half and right now they are theyve got to try to get it within single digits the B thing going into half Kelly a spot up two first bucket for the sophomore from Houston Chaz Kelly impressive what Boston College has done with Outpost in the lineup offensively right now just on the fact alone of them being able to stay within Striking Distance the amount of turnovers the lack of shooting as you mentioned Prince has been the key to it and theyve had some other good shots and NC State hasnt taken full advantage of the opportunity horn along two well hes been on fire West that is nine in the first half for DJ horn who has not been as uh active offensively as I thought he might be well but hes but hes hit those arent easy shots right there I mean those arent your feet set theyre coming off of dribble handoff people call it Zoom action which is dribble handoff type of action and hes sticking them Madson meanwhile continues to shoot it well hes got seven his first three of the day Matson can flat out shooted again these last four games with Matson being in the starting lineup hes been outstanding Taylor a three banged around Matson going to commit the foul and three free throws coming for Jadon Taylor off Mason madsons first foul here with 94 seconds to play in the first half Im curious to watch this replay here on this foul Matson was helping inside that pick and roll yep thats a good call by the official he fouled him its the right call what happened there if you saw Matson he was playing inside because on the roll by Middlebrooks and diara when they were rolling to the rim especially there with midd Brooks that forced Matson to come over and he got so detach from Taylor in the corner and the close Ting was just his balance his rhythm his gravity forced him to run into Taylor Jaden Taylor Josh has got seven of seven line shooting and a threepointer for 10 points hes been horn in this game that what Horns been the last few games and now with those two guys playing together like this North Carolina state if they continue to play at the level they need to they need moreel to play better as well too they get Burns going they could be a difficult out in the tournament theres Harris and that was last Touch by the pack itll stay with the eagles with 115 to go Kevin now in year seven and look at how we got a reset around Madson Kevin no longer defending like he did in his playing days at faram I dont know I dont think he defended back there either hes a better Coach than he is as a player trust me oh you know that feeling dont you I know it really well and Kevins done a great job here at MC State hes an outstanding coach hes won a lot of games has had great players but this a last minute seven West this is critical for Boston College they just cut it to seven Taylor hit the three free throws off the foul in the corner three theyve got to get it into single bites going to half Harris quiet first half continues he is scoreless hes the 18th best scorer in the ACC and Claud El Harris Jr has nothing so far in today horn working on mlon stop Fall Away sure by the way thats 11 for DJ horn in this first half and a foul will be called I believe on horn on the reach its his first great shot by horn and you can see here the shot and he makes a really tough two but the issue is after he scores he starts celebrating in Boston College is coming down and transition and he puts two hands on him and theres the foul but that was a heck of a shot under 40 to go about a 17second differential Matson Kelly standing three three nope diara will give NC State the last chance theyre going to use a timeout here and call something draw up for out a timeout yeah so well get a timeout taken by Kevin Keats 12point lead for the wolf Rick patinos game tomorrow theyre going to he I think because what coach St Johns playing Ukon I dont know whats going on but I think because they he had some words the other day about his team he bring Luke hanock over here and let me tell you what I call Luke Hancock back in the day wow Luke hanock was a great player too now great shooter shooter and Joel We Cant Forget Joel Barry Jo National Champion he was outstanding but Jo Barry MVP of the tournament in Washington the last time it was there won the no ones as good as Kelsey RS thats it they Trail Kelsey horn at the horn spins out on a three rebound from mighty and thatll get the teams to the locker room well NC States got three and double figures including DJ horn hes got 11 Jaden T deficit theyve got to maintain with the Striking Distance I keep saying that they got to try to get it down to single digits and Chip Away Harris a three and a foul will be ticketed to diara on the offensive rebound by Quinton post because of the crowd they got a good crowd here obviously the the celebration of the 74 team if you start something momentum going and North Carolina start North Carolina state starts getting out and transition and getting some easy basket its that the league could really expand in a hurry it was oconnell not di the foul first on Michael oconnell obviously first on stay here to start the half Madson will try and draw the Eagles cannot three bounds away out of the corner pck in transition with Burns heres horn and whistling foul off the ball and I think Matson got caught up trying to defend Burns in a mismatch so it was a PO it was a ball screen and post and Matson switched Matson ended up on burns and you see on the Bas side of bounc go right to Burns but you see here on the switch and mats is trying to front but Burns is just too big for him down there and then Burns had the quick Miss there on the out of bounds base out of bounds and transition here for BC Zachary the catch and score little early life out of the Eagles Seven for Jon Zack look there there is no 12point shot so when you only way to get back into the game is you got to get stops and then you got to run in transition and get good looks and thats a good start for Boston College oconnell just inside the head of the circle rebounded by post and theres Madson kind of on the move he cut it Loose hes had two good looks this half and three now is morels threepointer look good first points for Casey Morel his 283 of the the Year Josh Wes for NC State to be the team that coach Keats and all the fans want NC State to be they need moreel to be at a high level and with them losing the two guards with with with Smith and Joiner last year they need him to step up at a high level every single time they play offensive foul on Zachary another look at Casey Morel a veteran player now started his career at Virginia and a great transition offense in Rhythm he was working on those shots early when we were here really early he was out there and he was making him over and over and over hopefully that gets his confidence going so he can get hot for the rest of his game heres horn what kind of I thought he was going to make it and now diara with 13 to shoot heres horn its Donald Han defending horn will take him to the basket into traffic with a right hand scores 13 now for horn you challenge him hell challenge you back Josh W and you know what the shots hes making if you notice its the drives and its the reverse pivots hes using his pivot foot hes using that pivot foot a lot to get those shots and theyre not easy shots but theyre scoring walk us through this here cuz its a good point about his scoring creativity you can see what hes doing hes getting to the rim to the Lane area but hes stopping and hes using the pivot to try to get the defense off balance those arent easy shots but the ability to use the pivot foot to get himself some distance against that Defender score I think we just saw the third foul on Quinton post and thatll be number three now in this second half on Boston College that is not good either for Earl Grants team Quinton post by the way grad student from Amsterdam in the Netherlands and Josh as I understand it he cost you a family vacation one time he sure did I was at GE and one of the reasons why Im sitting here next to you and not coaching in the league is because Im sitting in Florida with my family Quint po has taken an official visit he wants to come to Georgia Tech and Im like lets do it I have to leave my family vacation to go be on the official visit with Quin post but he doesnt say hes coming to Georgia Tech so not only do I miss my vation of my family he doesnt come to Georgia Tech and because we dont get him Im sitting next to you R now I love sitting next to you a loss on a lot of fronts Jos Id rather be coaching it with with him as my Center heres mlon off the this he couldnt finish the family vacation however might be your wifes issue heres diara cleaned up o all going the Wolfpack way here in the second half NC State starting to pour it on theyve outscored BC 92 to push it to a 19point lead and a foul I believe on diara here and it is if I could have gone if if I knew that nil was going to eventually happen I wouldnt have to done lead the family vacation I just said Quinton heres a couple hundred thousand and well just why dont you just say yes to Georgia Tech forget the official visit but were in a different time and age did you know Wes with with college I just like the story about he cost you a vacation yeah he sure did and I I wanted to go up to him today before the game and said hey can I send you a bill on that can yeah how about the back end of the condo re I lost the condo rent for three days my wife kids were not happy with me but hes a really good player he obviously started out at Mississippi State he end up transferring and going to Boston College theyve done a really good job with him hes a really good player but Ill tell you right now Wes this is a danger zone for Boston College like if they dont get some stops here and start getting on a run offensively its going to be its going to be a long afternoon for them lead was 12 at the half and theres a three ball by horn Harris gathers for the Eagles heres clell Harris still looking for his first basket and has it down and if you notice in transition Burns got spread out trying to guard post diarra diara was out too far out and he just had a wide open Lane unobstructed to get right to the rim with no contest there by NC State Boston College has to try to get more an offensive transition for them to try to crack away at this lead Burns backing down on post reverses back to the left hand and mlon the rebound of the Miss there they need to be going in transition you can see Burns is tired they need to really attack put pressure on the paint right now especially you can see Burns is winded yep and Middlebrooks waiting to spell him at the table heres post Fall Away with the right hand missed everything mlon trying to clean it up he couldnt so Burns is going to stay on the floor heres state in transition with Morel trying to hit the fallway and does five for moreell all here in the second half Quinton posted a last time down Burns was exhausted and he settled for a fade away jump shot when he should have just gone attack to the paint try to either B get Burns a foul or score the basket but he he settled and allowed Burns off the hook Harris on the L for post diara blocked it out of bounds post goes down I hope he didnt twist an ankle we get a timeout and BC will have the ball but trailing 17 one timeout see the right foot there you can see his right foot Twisted on that spin on the Baseline thankfully hes back in the game but those things can swell up in the evening or even tomorrow so they got to make sure he has constant treatment but he the good news is hes playing right now back in Harris forced it up against Middlebrooks and hes going to get the foul on Ben and thatll be middlebrookss second its the third on the wol pack here in the second half post has got to be the guy if BC wants to make a move hes got to be at the Forefront right youre looking right now with post right now Wes hes one for six hes got eight rebounds but he hasnt done anything offensively and they need him to score and I dont think hes taking great shots either I thought hes rushing things and um you know hes got to be better in this in these next few minutes for BC to hang around dont forget 800 tonight following another womens lacrosse match Virginia Tech and Louisville will have nothing but that full breakdown of the day in the ACC as you see PA Del Hera hit them both Kelsey Rigs of course anchors are coverage three all in the half four now for Harris you know Wes going back to Quinton Post in that ankle you know I can see both his ankles are taped and I know theres a lot of discussion do it does taping work or not work but maybe that saved his ankle right there the taping good job by the trainer on the taping job to not have anything more than maybe a light scen Morel hes got seven all in the second half now we talked about it Wes before the game he was out here early shooting making every shot and I really think for North Carolina state to be a tough out when you get to the ACC tournament morels got to be a guy thats thats another score along with horn m glockton a strong move and a foul called and its on horn second on the grad transfer from Raleigh four now on the pack here in the half there was a side ball screen there and what happened was Boston College had action on the other side so North Carolina State kind of got ball watching hugged up we call it they got hugged up to their man on the weak side on the backside and that allowed for mlon to have a straight line roll to the rim and thats where the foul came Devon mlon has had two double doubles this year in ACC play comes in averaging 13 and seven against the conference he is scoreless so far theres his first point and a little pressure offered by Earl grants Club here you know if you remember last year West with Smith and Joiner those two guards for NC State how good they were thats what they need horn and morsel to be this year for them and especially as they get to the ACC tournament here is Taylor back for diara and a foul on mcglockton will be his second and I go back to last year because those guards theyre a tournament team those guards were so good and the way NC State plays they need those guards cuz that really opens up things for burns as well too so thats where morels got to be a guy thats got to be consistently at a high level and as long as horen can stay at that level you know this West You youve seen basketball longer and Ive been alive and I say that cuz you look great I mean that you dont look a day over 30 all right go ahead but you know this youve got to have great guard play yeah to win and to win in the ACC tournament is going to come down to how do the guard shoot the ball they got one one of the two hes got four dont believe the passer hype Im just saying you do look good all right 17point game heres post the matchup has really not materialized at all early foul trouble on post hand for three hell ring the bell 21st three first points of the year or first points of the day for Donald Han Jr thats been an issue with NC State this year in being able to hold on to leads theyve Lo theyve lost a lot of close games theyve won close games but youre right now you got to just bury BC if youre NC State you the more you let him hang around the more they can kind of creep back and all of a sudden the momentum shifts Taylor lost it on the dribble with five to shoot heres middle Brooks he juggled it now its finally stolen heres Claude L Harris a path to the basket in Middle Brooks was going to give no free will be on Ben Middlebrooks and and Harris really hurt his right hand on that on the net he got his stuck on the net there like he slowed up Harris Crow and Ry the fouls not for the block the foul is on hitting Harris in the head after he blocked it and then you can see Harris got his right hand stuck in the net well see if it affs his free throw shooting right here three for three is Harris but if you notice there he slowed up right on the he should have just gone full speed and tried to get an easy baset maybe even got an and one but again going back North Carolina state is allowing Boston College to kind of just Reep their way back in and hang around and eventually the energy and momentum can shift towards back to BC and then all of a sudden its a different ball game thats been an issue with NC State this year on being able just to close things out Taylor works his way in traffic heres Middlebrooks post stepped in nicely and now were going to get a foul on post against Middlebrooks for the push I believe yep and that is four on Quinton post and with 1249 to go Earl Grants got an issue here now taking him out Devin mcglockton for Quinton post in the BC order post just has not gotten into any sink flow Rhythm just hes been out of sorts all game long in this game both ends of the floor trailing by a dozen when post left the floor diara another three wow mohamd diars two field goals today are triples Wes hes got a great looking shot and again talk about an added weapon and a bonus if he starts making those threes on a consistent basis talk about the floor spacing and what can open up for NC State 610 Jr from France adding to it and theres a league Bay who was BCs leading scorer in the first half off the bench again and been pretty productive hes got a dozen league b saved them to this point of not letting it get so out of hand for the scorer based on the scoring morcel working against hand long two at the front spins out for Casey Morel and that ball got knocked away Zachary tried to keep it alive here is Taylor loose a dozen for Jaden Taylor Harris eight and 1 half gone in the second half Zachary bounce pass to mcglockton and fell off the front rim Taylor a standing three great Tay thats where NC States at their best coach Grant is going to call timeout get across half courts trying to stop the momentum and you can just see here the moment menum has tottally shifted to all all the way to NC State look at this dunk here on the 5050 loose ball the Taylor with the dunk and then in transition nothing not even anyone near him by BC nothing but the bottom the net Taylor has been outstanding when youre great your game does the talk in the ACC well the review by this officiating crew took what was originally a flavorite one its been upgraded to a flagrant too so Deon mlen is ejected from the game severity of the contact here and their estimation didnt make a play on the ball and of course middle Brooks had left the floor he was already in the motion to go dunk the ball and in that sense its an upgradeable situation Earl Grant doesnt agree de mcglockton doesnt but nonetheless thats the way it stands so motons day ends with 105 for to play and and I want to give a shout out to the North Carolina State coaching on the bench one of the new rule changes is anyone thats not a player is allowed to leave the floor to make sure theres no issues and they when that happened all those guys made sure everyone stayed on the bench there was no issues we did not want a fight or anything so credit to them to making sure their players held back there was no issues everyone got separated and we can continue to play basketball and nobody was hurt 20point game now for NC State its their largest lead of the day now watch horn here on these on this out of bounds right here coming off that stagger TR stayed on a seven nothing run here to push it to 20 Mighty defending middle Brooks heres horn now Mighty trying to help DJ over the big fella left it on the rim middle Brooks The Rebound right back for horn soft jumper nope bounds away and the rebound for Madson this uh this 20 plus may not come as easily as some others have for DJ horn today that ball got knocked away last Touch by the pack but but credit to NC State they havent had that they havent needed him to be the hero today right theyve had guys like Taylor morels played the probably his best that hes had in a long time Burns has been really good diara making threes so credit to the other guys at NC State stepping up and helping horn in in this in this situation Kelly putting it in Play heres Madson off a r screen of a mighty and a three thats good and a foul on horn so madsons going to get a chance at the fourpoint trip how about that well what happened there if you watch it watch Burns defensively hes off and then horn goes underneath the handoff and then he tries to go over the second one hes too late and again because of that his body takes him into the offensive player but it started with the lack of of Presence by burns on that handoff action he was just kind of standing there as a statue so here now Madson knocks down the fourpoint play and its back to 16 just when you think its about to just pull away and be overtime when I say overtime like game over like its over you got a little life Morel back R Miss of the three under 10 we go watch the UCLA Cut here thats a screen off the elbow coming off with a staggered screen theyre trying to find Matson on on for a three on the MISD Direction good defense there by in Music state Kelly out in the midcourt area against horn and a reach in foul on DJ horn thats four on horn with 931 to go maybe a little bit of a press there by horn thats seven now on the wolf pack you know you see right here Wes I mean Horns in there but you can see his hands both hands get on the ball on his body and I just think thats on automatic the officials are going to call I mean horon was pressuring he was moving his feet but once you get your palms two Palms touching the offensive player 90 of the time theyre going to call an a defensive foul unless of course I was coaching they dont call that and thats why back in the day with you and M Packer the index card I was always we were the very lowest on the Proto pole there a pacle appreciate the fact you got the index absolutely at darn right the index card that said a lot that told the tell the story on the foul in terms of your Saga yes yeah 9 minutes and change to go burns with Armani Mighty defending B away nope on the rim Matson the rebound tough shot for burns going over his other shoulder hes most comfortable going over his right shoulder he went over his left one that time didnt have a good angle a league Bays got double figures today he and Madson the double figure scores for Boston College Kelly left the three short Jaden Taylor automatically to burns with Mighty defending look at DJ square around diara tries to keep it alive does MO right back at him draws the foul and thats going to be on our Mony Mighty well a couple things there number one but defensively on the other side of the ball they got lucky Kelly got a great look Burns again in that dribble handoff action he was so far off just kind of hanging around you know just upright like a St like a statue right and then defensively they went under he was trying to give him some room to go under but Kelly got a good look and then on this side of the floor burns came back to over his right shoulder missed however diara was right there for the offensive rebound first effort and then a second effort to get the foul called but again right now the momentum is obviously with NC State but the issue is youre letting BC look its still 16 points its a long way to go for Boston College to creep back in the game and post is not even in right now but you just dont want to let it hang around cuz a couple threes made by BC can change the the flow of this game Thea two for four at the line both misses by the wol pack today at the free throw line belong to muhamed diar NC State elsewise is 17 of 19 continuing a pretty solid characteristic of this basketball team for Kevin ke Zachary a long three oconnell had a shot at the rebound tell you what Michael oconnell at 62 Josh has got eight rebounds today you know what hes kind of been quietly has just done his job and hes been a tough hardnosed rebounder and the one thing for a team to be successful I think a number one indicator of that of your toughness of your team is guard rebounding and oconnell has showed that today he stuck his nose in there and have come up with tough hard knows rebounds look he hasnt done maybe some other things that dont always show up in the Box Score but hes had toughness plays that has allowed NC State to have the lead that they got Burns Taps his own Miss hole 14 for DJ Burns you can see the explosiveness again going to his left over his right shoulder and then the second effort by Burns to get the put back ball Away by hand rebound Taylor Stripped by hand and the stick back wont go another rebound for oconnell there yep theres oconnell little saw Fall Away off the Jump stop for Michael okon same type of move that horn makes obviously thats caught by coach Keats and staff using the pivot foot to create space three ball from Zachary at the other end or its a two its a two so nine for Jaden Zachary just ahead of seven minutes to go still a 19point game under seven to play foul line heres Burns working on Mighty look at the Dig Down from Han there defensively Josh absolutely Boston College thats what they do defensively protect the paint but he still was able to get to his Buster from you uh from jpj today in Charlottesville do you know North Carolinas not won in Charlottesville since 2012 wow thats a wow but I can understand hard to win there thats why that pit win that they had at Virginia was a heck of a win obviously Tony Bennett defensively is really hard to score against them yep thats that thats why I said Virginia is needs to be in the in the discussion about being a blue blood over this last decade or so cuz theyve actually had had more success than Duke Carolina in the ACC over this last 10 years terrific move by Matson so Carolina Virginia and Duke and wake how about the top four playing one another today of the 35 games left when we started today in ACC play there only 35 games left in the regular season heres Burns there are four games four featuring the top four thats it wow now if you want to dig in a little bit to Clemson pit NC State there are a handful of other games but the last if you you were to go to the standings today theres a pull up by Matson oh my goodness Mason Madson now four straight for Boston cin and its an 18point game with 540 to go if you go to the standings today Duke Carolina Virginia right you like them for three of the four double buys I I I but the next one wake Clemson pit NC State Florida State are all within one game win or lost colum thats thats a crazy St and I would tell you Morel a d and Morel there we talked about in the first half that Iverson cut they ran that the very first play of the game and got the offensive foul NC State had but thats called an Iverson cut over two people at each a person each elbow and he was able to get an angle and get a basket Donald Han Juniors knocked down a pair of Threes here in the half go ahead to answer your question on that I think the Virginia North Carolina game is a huge one today cuz I think theres still some hes in North Carolina can they make that Deep Run in the tournament and I think this obviously whats going on right now the Wake Duke games got humongous ramifications for Wake I I just think the ACC tournament I dont know how you feel West and more so there with another bucket but I dont know how you feel I think its sort of wide open do you I mean maybe not for the second half of the league but for the first half and its going to be a great league and I want to throw in an opportunity in DC get your tickets I think you go to what ACC do yeah the acccom you find a way to take its going to be a great tournament matsons on a burner on a burner yeah but who do you see the I mean is it do you think in that top half anyone can pull out win it like I wouldnt sleep on Virginia just yet either well Im going to give you some information here in a minute on how the seating can sometimes be misleading as to what happens at the tournament here is Taylor Or Parker rather on the drive and burns and a reset of the shot clock for the wolf pack long break over there for horn by the way as Burns scores DJ Burns now got us pretty exciting our star stories today are brought to you by crush and guys who are crushing it Jaden Taylor in double figures Off the Bench Josh for a third straight game and then DJ Burns and DJ horn helping out too yeah no Taylors been a big big addition this this afternoon I mean he gave them that helped him get that lead stretch cuz horn had not really got going early part and it was the one that got going was Taylor y spot up by hand and Middlebrooks the rebound for the wolf P Wes I would love for you to finish your thought just on the ACC on my question to you about the ACC tournament yeah I its a its an an interesting topic especially in the last couple weeks of the regular season and it speaks to the long history of the event NC State of course knows what a celebration in our nations capital looks like 1987 vinale negro was the MVP of the tournament at Capital Center in Landover when the Wolfpack beat Carolina in the finals on a Sunday afternoon heres Madson at the other end he strong has come into the game a 68 freshman who they really like out of Charlotte heres post back on the floor out of the timeout as well post just post has not gotten hes been all out of shorts all from from the tip Donald Han Jrs got nine all in the second half I Josh it speaks to the way teams get seated the top seed has won the title 32 times okay thats 46 of all the ACC tournaments ever staged however recently thats not been the case its only happened eight times in this Century the top seeds won the tournament now Leagues expanded all those things in those 24 years theres a turnover but as you look at the top standings heres the updated eight top eight now heres the way the ACCC looks with the top eight okay Carolina Duke Virginia wake then you see Clemson pit NC State Florida State its important to note last year Duke was a four seed in 2022 Virginia Tech was a seven seed I mean Georgia Tech won the title Josh yep you remember that that as what we a four seed that is correct I mean its amazing how the seeds kind of play themselves through the event well I and I also wonder and I want like what you think about this sometimes the double buy is not always the advantage because teams have either played one or two games youre playing and you can come in a little cold and if you remember Wake Forest a few years ago lost in Brooklyn to Boston College knocked him out of the tournament they were the five but they didnt so they W in a double buy but they got a buy BC played the night before yep and they and they beat Wake Forest and kept wake Force out of the tournament so theres not always a guarantee a single buy or a double buy is an advantage for you always I I totally agree to win the tournament y you want to get the highest seating you can for the regular season but yes it doesnt guarantee a championship rarely do you see Tuesday carried to Thursday however Wednesday carries to Thursday but Virginia Tech was a seven seed in 2022 they beat the two seed Notre Dame in the quarters on the way to the title now remember they beat no they beat Clemson they beat Notre Dame they beat Carolina they beat Duke thats an unbelievable run for Mike young part that also speaks to how the tournament can be that way absolutely and part of that as you mentioned is they got to play a game and kind of had Rhythm before before each before each some of the teams had played and that allowed them to get into some thinking you know look right now that was going back and forth both teams espe for NC I think taking their foot off the gas a little bit Boston College are trying to press to keep Yeah final minute we got a 13point game here you DCs been on a bit of a run theyve hit three of their last three from the floor and NC States Gone without a field goal the last two and a half Wes NC States not going to be an easy out in the ACC tournament I mean look theyre not going to be an at large bit theyre going to have to win the automatic qualifier right but if if they can get tailored as play play at a higher at a high level like you did tonight if they can have more cell excuse me this afternoon if they can have more cell play at a high level if and then you got horn obviously playing as good as anybody in the league and then Burns I mean they can be a sneaky team in the tournament States got some games in front of them Josh Kevin keatss team will be N9 and seven in the league after today theyve got at Florida State on Tuesday night only meeting of the regular season in Chapel Hill next Saturday thats a quad one Duke in this building a quad won and at pad I shouldnt say they cant get in that if they win these next four they might be in that large well I mean theyll put themselves in play but to your point about NC State they have an inside outside combination that can win a TN and Morel is 23 Burns is 23 horns older I mean theyve got its not like theyre a young team theyve been older guys and if they can if their guards can play at that level they can be a they could be a hard out by the way Georgia Tech Miami standing by on East Ro Malcolm Huckaby and Coral Gables well send you directly to the watsco center for the canes and jackets Miamis lost five straight and six of seven they got drilled the other night where Duke by a lot Ill see if they can it will be interesting they can bounce back this afternoon and and and Georgia Tech has been a tough out theyve had some really good wins yeah Damon STM has done a really nice job in year one there as well too but I know Malcolm Hucks loving Southeast right now you know he lives up in he lives up in the Northeast an and Malcolm hucke if they wanted to win today they needed to make sure they got a marked light shake from the baseball stadium before they started the show today thats all Im going to tell you because this time of year when Kanes baseballs going on and Miami plays a home basketball game you owe it to yourself to go get a mark light shake before you come to the basketball game like a 400 starts perfect you can get a milkshake and you come back and get ready for the basketball game game only you would know that thats you should learn if youre going to sit over here you need to learn the value of a mar Im hungry I started asking where do we get the food here I thought we got to be in the media you got a good spread of food wheres the food no no Im hungry Brion pass from Reedsville North Carolina knocks the free throw down Quint post fouls out on a frustrating day and Boston College will head home for a couple of games the Eagles get Virginia on Wednesday night and pit next Saturday as Madson drops another one hes going to finish with 21 pretty strong performance here in the last 10 days for Mason Matson terrific win for NC State celebrating the 74 National Championship team Josh great to be with you thank you been
