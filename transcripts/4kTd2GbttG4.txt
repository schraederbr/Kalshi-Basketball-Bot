hes coming off injury that kept him out for the entire season last year for the orange played his first game on Tuesday at Tennessee hes on the bench now this is Davis inside a 10 of the shot clock VES angles to the rib and nice move by kesn realized he had a smaller more on him and all he had to do is Bully him and get to the basket for finish Music Carlos Davis couldnt back it down safety valve and more got it right back with seven on the shot clock trying to put the shoulder into the other Davis got the the shot away score that basket Tom Davis has been that guy has a blade for Syracuse giving him the offense getting down playing a little bully ball and watch he in Tay Davis go at him mean basically is patient little turnaround Davis gets him right on the elbow for a possibility for the and one so now Tay Davis with his second personal foul has to go to the Irish bench ji comes in for him 14 in green jier Davis back at the free throw line and completes the old school threepoint play he has scored the last seven points for Syracuse and hes approaching his season average per game of Music 87 IMS all the way across catch and release for three kesy conects and great set up by IMS for Syracuse to have to for make a decision to stop that penetration gets it over kesi kesn is coming off the bench giving uh Irish a lot of offense early about seven points for kesn averaging just four points per game to start the day Davis cut off on the Baseline Moore with the shot clock at seven lamin operating out of the corner against ji shury had the help orange turning it over in the traveling violation and good defense by realizing at lamin not only is going to try to to Dime his teammates was the ball in the floor was physical on and forcing him to that turnover inside of N9 minutes to go at our first half of the 58th alltime Music meeting Syracuse leads the alltime series 3423 certainly goes back to the days of the Big East when both of these

Syracuse is one five of the last six meetings lampin awkward attempt he hit the deck Jai scooped it up alako shury three ball and a fight for the loose ball ji and lampin both hit the deck and a foul

five on a couple of occasions that is JJ Starling hes got the cast on the left hand missed the game against Tennessee this week it happened in practice an awkward fall tried to brace himself and this would have been his first game back playing for Syracuse here at Notre Dame started his career at Notre Dame and Marcus B who last year when the teams played Syracuse won at the dome but Burton had 28 points in that game hes out with a knee injury for the fourth straight game and its a huge adjustment for both coaches when you start to open up ACC play not having your best players but so far we got a good game I think that Syracuse has done a good job of being able to get downhill and in for the Irish I think that kesi has coming in and giving them some huge points off the off the bench kesn has nine points and that leads Irish in this first half shot clock windling down to five for Freeman trying to go against G on the Baseline lost desperation shot theyre going to rule it a shot clock Applause violation good defensive possession by Notre Dame if youre Syracuse you got to get a little bit more continuity with this group on the floor because lamin is not in the game and then this is one of those things that who can you give the ball to could go get you a bucket Marcus Burton on the bench with the knee injury was hurt in the game against ruter in Las Vegas on November 26th 12 days agoo flip on the Applause Baseline so Roper couldnt connect orange back the other way along the Baseline and stepped out of bounds Orange has not LED so far in this first Music half told you about these teams playing close games last years game was at the Dome and that was a win for Coach ays team 8885 in late February of last season theyll also play again this year January 18th and that will

down there little chippy early on a Saturday morning marovic was in there Brian also Garett sundra foul was called against M stroage well you see both teams too this is a huge opportunity for Notre Dame man Syracuse you open up the ACC play you want both teams want to be able to start out with getting this victory for Syracuse you want to get one on the road and for Notre Dame youve been away from home for so long you want to be able to wrap up this game especially without your star player boss on the road at Georgia for the Irish on Tuesday in the ACC SEC challenge went the way of the SEC although the ACC Clemson and Duke had big wins in that ACC SEC challenge against top five teams in Kentucky and you see Braden strwberry stepping on out of bounds line for Notre Dame he started out strong they got to find a way to get him some uncontested looks four points for sh and that includes a made threepointer on three tries Carlos quick release front rim alako three on three situation Roper could not Advance along the Music Baseline rooper open for three Off the Mark batted around and taken by lamin Applause Goen Dame has missed its last five shot attempts Syracuse has missed its

of Zen prior to the free throw deep breath and good work just 43 of the season for Applause lamin Syracuse struggle from the free throw line Brian on Tuesday at Tennessee just 12 of 21 one for the

Carlos eyes on lampin the whole way 37 shooting for the orange in the first half 41 for the Irish from the floor collectively 3 and A2 minutes to Applause go shury little jab step to get some daylight actually it was a double draft the first time Freeman didnt bite he said going give you another one you give me a little distance Im going to go ahead and knock it down truberry allows the Notre Dame to have that lead up to seven Music Music the ready Applause Music Applause Applause take Music Applause Music Applause look at both teams and for Syracuse theyve been able to do their damage in the paint already 12 points in the paint and I love the fact that early on taking advantage of the mismatch is trying to get downhill and Eddie Lin has been one of those guys that they basically they try to get him going but Notre Dame done a good job of being able to double team him he does a better job of being able to read it and theyve been swarming him all afternoon long 12 points in the paint for the orange over three from long distance lamin has three assists as well Applause lead is seven largest in the first half Jer Davis misses the shot Alo wants to slow it down kesn running the Baseline has 11 points his season high is 12 came against North Dakota kesn trying to add to the total over the defender not enough Freeman the rebound and the outlet Chris Bell is one of guys I think for Syracuse you got to find a way to get him going you see the penetration and finish by Carlos seems like Syracuse anytime they can get a stop but help them four points now for Applause Carlos this is Tay Davis at seven points in the first four minutes none since trying to work with kesney they collaborate Davis over top of the defender and with the front rim and going to the freee throw line and you talked T Tay Davis up that last time kesn didnt have anything and then watch how hes able to get down there and seal Freeman doesnt go up a m immediately tries to get into his body absorbs that contact for that finish and thats one of the things I think for Notre Dame you got to give Tay Davis more touches allow him to misat take care of those mismatches shury out IMS is in for the Irish Davis at the free throw line missed his two previous free throw attempts shury to the bench with seven points and a couple of Applause threepointers kesn sneaky on the Baseline got it back I think theyre going to get Jive for the hook on on Freeman second foul on ji both teams in the bonus so we stride to the free throw line for the orange ji comes out for Coach Music shury five of nine from the line for the orange in the first half two of six for noted aim on free throw attempts J Lees with five rebounds to lead the team Donnie Freeman Applause struggles at the free throw line for both teams in this first Applause half loo got two defenders in the air eyes tried to come out of the corner Tom I thought that Alo had an opportunity he got down there and then Syracuse did a great job he should have shot the layup Syracuse did a good job of being able to recover and I think right now when you look at just a little bit over two minutes got to find some way to continue to get to the cup try to carve into that sevenpoint no to Dame lead that travel the sixth turnover of the first half for the Irish Bell Freeman into the paint sundra defending fou his call Freeman to the free throw line yeah Freeman did a good job of being able to catch himself realize he had the oneonone match up no one was coming on sun Music Freeman so far from the line of the game 0 for three stay tuned for todays halftime show presented by Subaru love its what makes Subaru Subaru the debut of SMU and first half highlights and stats from the first 20 minutes of our game between the Irish and orange not a lot of love from the free throw line for these teams Brian and and missed opportunities especially for for Syracuse he do a lot of good job do a very good job of getting to the basket you got to capitalize on those fouls and knock down some free Applause throws six of 14 from the line for the orange in the first half teams are combined eight of 20 from the stripe sixpoint game Notre Dames been in front the vast majority of this first half with a minute and a half have to go kesn oh Look Out Below you see kesn decid to take flight youre a little late 13 points Jr kesn in the first half the last two of the thunderous variety spin move and the Layin Lucas Taylor for the orange nice move by Taylor a little Up and Under and the Finish still reeling over that dunk by kesma Taylor the senior in transfer from Georgia state gets in the Box Score IES trying to save it on the sideline and how many times have we seen that in this first half Brian and Notre Dame still leaves the door wide open for Syracuse with those turnovers and again when you look at less than a minute if youre Syracuse great opportunity now to continue to get downhill you want to spread out Notre Dame try to continue to get those penetration Carlos Davis Taylor who had the last driving bucket finds Freeman got bumped on the way Applause up chahar defending for Notre Dame I think that that play started off with Carlos continue to Pro forced to help by Notre Dame do a good job of Kicking It Out Taylor not satisfi me satisfying with trying to throw it up and gets it over to freem First foul on chahar Freeman back to the free throw line freshman from Washington DC 69 205 out of the IMG Academy in Florida can draw coach Atri and the orange to four with 395 seconds to go in our first half sundra is

comfortable things are a little easier he said absolutely not every night in the ACC a challenge of the utmost order Freeman draws the Irish within four draws the orange within four about an 8sec Difference game and shot shury roadblock at the free throw line got it back with the shot clock at five to sundra try from the corner comes up short theres only 7 Seconds to go for Carlos trying to

great defense by Roper you thought that Carlos was going to get there for that open shot good recovery for him Irish trying to snap a fivegame losing streak they won their first four games out of the gate Shrewsbury had the shot reflected Tom you see starting the second half both teams coming out amping up the defense but Im curious to see who can get separation offensively first half ined in a lows scoring Affair 44 shooting from the Irish in the first half roer Davis lines it up misses the target out of bounds into Syracuse Music four of 15 for Coach Shys team from Beyond The Arc the orange yet to make a three 0 for Applause four they made six threes in the loss of Tennessee down the lane contact and a foul was a drive from Freeman and Freeman puts his head down and goes in you think Tay Davis does a good job of being able to lock him up but looks like that may be three watch the penetration again you see what looks like Tay Davis getting all ball ends up possibly being his third foul Freeman to the free throw line weve said that a little bit today now four of eight from the stripe for Freeman eight points for Freeman Davis with his third personal Freeman finally gets both of those to go but if Im major in alry I tell him continue to try to put the pressure get downhill because he hes being able to draw contact Davis carving his way around lampin fouled by the big man hits the deck on the Baseline second foul on lampin thats Davis his propensity to get to the rim and get to the free throw line and I thought it was interesting we spoke with Michael shuber talked about T devias and how hes grown from last year to this year getting those rep more comfortable with being that guy seemed like hes found a knack from getting to the Applause basketball coach shrewbury in a conversation with Eric Lewis joined by AJ s Jeff Pon as our officials transfer from SE Hall second year in the Notre Dame program for Tate Davis hell come out and be replaced by sundra leaving with 11 points for Applause Davis also with the three fouls hell take a breather Carlos tried the kick to Freeman goes out of bounds thatll go back to the Irish I think Carlos thought that Freeman was going to make a dive cut there and he opted to flare again one of those things again on the road youve got to Value the basketball you cant have those unfor forced turns shrewbury Applause Bell out of bounds thats off aim and Chris bill so far not being able to find find it from downtown thats the guy I really think that they need to get going need to get him to go rolling he has yet to

say for a guy thats struggling to get his shot sometimes getting to the basket or getting the free throw allow yourself to see the ball to go in can allow you to alleviate a little bit of that anxiety of not being able to get it going early Wednesday on inside the NFL our Pros take a look ahead at week 15 matchups Fe the bills and lions coach bellich gives us his game plan as we hear Chad Johnsons

make no mistake 58th alltime meeting played last year at the Dome a win for the arm they last played here Brian and South Bend these two teams December of 2022 and that was a onepoint win for the orange 6261 Irish would go on to win prior to that the season before February of 2022 they had a 10point win at home games are always close last nine decided by 10 or less Carlos tribl and Dy and Carlos was was able to get by him because lamin did a good job of sealing ji Carlos being able to prob right down and gets right to the basket senior from Brooklyn New York J Juan Carlos for Applause two shot clock is at five shrewbury to the double team the chai fumbled it away way into the corner and that is a shot clock violation hey great defensive possession by Syracuse and last time Shrewsberry had lamin by himself they come out to double him get the ball out of out of his hands forces them into a turnover youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State youre in good hands we are in Notre Dame Indiana the Irish campus Freeman got got it back from Carlos angles to the rim and scores Tom Carlos has done a great job in this second half of being able to carve up the middle you see Syracuse is the first lead and the Irish take it right back off the right hand of Bron shrewbury yeah if youre Taylor you cant allow Shrewsberry to be able to set his feet like that and get that uncontested shot you got to close out and have active hands on him Bell trying to feed it inside cup catch for lampin on the Baseline and he lost it out of bound back to the Irish so Syracuse had the lead for about 3 seconds and then Shrewsberry decided hey Im going to take matters into my own hands again what youre finding out is that both teams starting to find and navigate their offense a little better so Davis comes back in with his three personal fouls 11 points for Davis 10 for shury kesn has 13 shury has three M threepointers in the game hes up to 26 M threes for shury on the season and that leads the club kesn got it back driving Baseline on Bell and there was a bump Bell picks up the foul his first will take a timeout in a twopoint game Irish and orange Hilton Garden in Hilton for the St and Tom has been JR kesi he came in that first half it was an ultra R graic you got getting to the basket finishing going to the upper room early Crea him some excitement already 13 points and three Music rebounds kenni averaging just four points per game coming into the game his career high is 18 hes done that twice the Junior from right here in South Bend Indiana 67 guard incredible leaping dunk late in the first half as well Jr kesn had double doubles and back toback games last year still on the lineup for the Irish they have possession loo and Applause shwy Davis is four or five from the floor shury is open thats a three and you saw Michael Shrewsberry basically saw Tay Davis and he said to to Jaden Shrewsberry come run that pick and then what he did is he slipped Tay Davis took two guys get shw bear wide open three 13 points for Braden shury approaching his average of 152 per game Orange going inside with bell and a foul on the play and we talked about the fact that with Chris Bell you struggle for a while and you get to the free throw line see a couple go down now wonder if this is something thats going to unlock him in his second half already four points in the second half early constantinos picked up the foul his third sent Bell to the free throw line for the Syracuse Applause Orange surprisingly Brian its a program that has not been to the tournament since in 2021 so theyve been Spectators the orange although last year they put together a 20 and2 record Davis in midair lost control potential two onone Bell to the rim off the front rim Carlos the follow two onone opportunity you see Bill not being in a finish Carlos staying right on top of it Syracuse doing a good job of having good defense tur into offense in the transition it is a onepoint game as AO goes flying loo did a good job of being able to sell the contact by Chris Music Bill second foul on Bell coach shb team last year with 13 and 20 7 and 13 in the ACC they were 98 at home overall last year Applause no one is punted out of bounds we may see some punts and passes in a couple of weeks right here on campus for a playoff game for the Irish its a good chance theyre going to host the playoff game in the new 12 team college football playoff and when a year for the ACC you talk about Notre daming we we spoke earlier about Clemson and SMU going at it later on tonight Syracuse under Fran Brown in his first year also went N9 and three and beat Miami at the dome in the final week of regular season play so a good year for the orange on the great iron as well Davis inside for the orange and Davis comes back and picks up where he left start in the first half I think that that little area right below the free throw line realizing he can get there and play a little bully Ball action so the last time the orange took the lead in the second half they were up for 10 seconds and last time you see Tay Davis caught both lamin and Davis falling beneath that screen you cannot allow him to be able to touch that far in the paint and not contest that shot the lead right back to Notre Dame Davis lost it inside to T Davis Imes pass deflected by Taylor out of Applause Music bounds Freeman is coming in for Syracuse to replace lamin chahar for the Irish number Music 21 HS jabbaar that one came up short and went out of bounds back to Syracuse trailing by one officially Syracuse has led for 24 seconds in the second half and what youve seen in the second half is both teams finding a way to ramp up their offense a little bit more you knew that in his first ACC games you know that not having your best scores youre going to have to find a way to to score both teams have been up and down with that throughout the entire game onepoint Irish lead about to cross the 13minute threshold remaining in our second half Giant Davis against ji lost the handle Dives for it that one kicked into the back court now front court for the Irish Davis steps around his Defender hey how about that Davis play again gets that turnover looks like he was out of control gathered himself with a little bit of a step through to be able to come back and extend the lead to three 15 points for Davis after 14 on Tuesday at Georgia Freeman behind the line bounces off the shoy up ahead Shai couldnt handle the pass he was wide open back to Freeman tough catch and bounce Freeman basket and foul and Freeman starts to play on both ends hustles back prevents n Dame from going to you see Adrian Aly do come over and give him a some love you see Freeman get to the basket for the an one IES picked up the foul Freeman to the free throw line five of seven from the strike this Music afternoon Donnie Freeman old school threepoint play and when we talked in the open for Syracuse who was it that was that need to stand up with not having JJ Starling Donnie Freeman has stepped up for the challenge you see right now both teams locked in at 43 all 14 points for Donnie Freeman fifth time this season he has gotten a double digits in scoring for the freshman Applause spins off the rim and chai comes in double fisted J does a good job of following the ball Tay Davis goes in draws two guys and then big guy just runs in flushes it for the putb Freeman got it from Carlos right at chai foul call in the midair contact things are heating up inside purcel Pavilion its a twopoint game may be cold outside partner but we both both got it inside here you see both of them going the first Irish after they LED 3026 at halftime this foul a moment ago to the left is Tay Davis keev jaai defended on Freeman and they assess the foul to Daviss for and thats going to be huge for them because T D Davis has come back in this first game and actually more in the second half 15

Irish six of eight from the floor has a couple of rebounds now four personal fouls hes the first player in the game to get into serious foul trouble Freeman at the free throw line a smaller lineup for

ner Dame having the small lineup Syracuse opting to try to take advantage of the mismatches you see Notre Dame having a smaller defender on Donnie Freeman put him right in the Music Applause post its

Davis elbow hey why not why not J Jer Davis has been cooking and then Carlos realizes that hes got a guy thats got it going gives him an opportunity to give him his sweet spot cuts the lead to one Davis started the season in the game against Le Moine for the orange at home with a double double 22 points and 12 Applause Music boards contact and a foul Lucas Taylor has picked up his third its a onepoint Irish lead shury leads the way with 17 points for Notre Music Music D Financial Security for more than 150 years and we talked about for both teams you need people to step up and for Syracuse

came against Cornell braon shury hes got the four threepointers Brian and nine attempts nobody the ACC attempts more threepoint shots than Bron shury and I dont expect that to change as the season goes along and and I think that when we talked earlier with Mike Shrewsberry talked about the fact that hes en encouraged Jaden to work on his midrange game you see that on display as well last year Shrewsbury made 78 threepointers second most among division one freshman ja is at the line Applause Music Applause try with a nice touch the free throw line You think that Michael Shrewsberry would try to take advantage of those mismatches when you get the smaller Defenders switching on Drive give him a touch in the paint gu now with four points great pass inside Davis oh man how about Davis again that last play Taylor did a great job of being able to penetrate and get the ball right over to to Davis Davis has been the guy watch the penetration right there forces the defense to come over

and SMU its first game of the ACC thats to follow us Tom brenaman and the AllAmerican from duke Mike jinsky will take you through game two we got work to do 620 to go in game one if our season starts off like this Brian I cant wait for the rest of the year and I agree with you you see Carlos still probing there if youre manao you got to lock him down right there one coming up short for Music Davis ji flashing GI inside Kea Ji flexing foul and one we talked about that earlier if youre Michael shuberry you give your big man opportunity to get into a a little guy like Freeman when I say little guy he says you more Flex on him he said young fell you going to get into the weight room eighth lead change in this half the J at the line Applause D doing a good job of being able to finish and for Syracuse Carlos has done a good job of being able to probe and you see stopping a play stopping the play for a second the shot clock just a second ago read 30 theyve adjusted it accordingly were rolling with 544 to go in the second half theres number 44 lamin shuffled the Music feet lamin did a good job of being able to back J down but that last time taking twoo many steps right now n NE Dames done a good job of being able to buy Shrewsberry some time as you see Tay Davis come back into the game with those four fouls shury doesnt get the bounce Freeman over top of everyone for the Applause rebound seven rebounds for Freeman Carlos other end perimeter ball Applause movement Freeman against Davis oh nice move and you saw Freeman go ahead realizing that davidss got four fouls cannot afford for the foul backs him down gets the little contact finishes close off the bank second time this season 20 points or more for Donny Freeman H it against Cornell as well in a win with 23 Music points Alo trying to calculate the angle fouled in the process and utilized the glast for Alo and good shot BYO because he realized he had the defender trailing him best time to try to get that Hill is on the curl action is to turn the corner loo doing a good job of being able to attack the rim with opportunity to put the Irish up three third foul on Lin puts aako at the free throw line now four of seven from the line Alo Shys team as we mentioned Brian theyve lost five in a row their last win November 19th at home against North Dakota 7558 played some close games in a multiteam event in Las Vegas lost to ranked teams Houston and Katon and also ruter in overtime that was the game where Burton was injured point guard sophomore and freshman of the year last year in the ACC is on the bench and missing his fourth game for the Irish preseason all ACC selection Moore stumbles handoff shot clock is a two for for Carlos needs to get to the rim ji rejects it and its a shot clock violation and great blocking help Side by J thought that Notre Dame did a good job of being able to contain Carlos in the penetration J on the weak side watch this penetration shot clocks going down Carlos gets over J comes over big Fells like not today young fella get that up out of here another here at home but that that loss of the five games outside of Elon is a little skewed because when you look at who Notre Dame was able to play you talk about ranked teams in Katon and then also Houston they lose an overtime game against a good Ruckers team and now great opportunity again because again you want to open up the season uh with a win especially at home after being away for so long they also won mid November at Georgetown 8463 after losing in overtime at home against Georgetown last season Syracuse on the turnover great Hands by Carlos coming over to take that ball away from T Applause Davis Syracuse will also play Georgetown this season thatll be December 14th the 100th alltime meeting between those programs shot clock to 10 for the orange and Davis kzn sagging down defensively Davis over chai heres the thing Davis realized he had the bigger giant he was like he not a problem well take my time Im going to bully you get a little jump hook over my left shoulder Davis and Freeman have combined for 40 points and shury comes right back with the roundhouse Hook from threepoint distance and Syracuse with a huge mishap you cannot leave Braden shrew Shrewsberry wide open allow him to set his feet to knock down that three 22 points for Shu five made threepointers in the game as he rips the ropes for the Irish M aim by three deep into the shot clock for Freeman rims out foul called against Syracuse we take a timeout with 255 to go and a threepoint lead for Notre Dame against Syracuse Neely sharpshooter for the Cavs well have it for you Tom brenaman and the AllAmerican from duke Mike jinsky will have the play byplay following us so ja is at the free throw line 6360 in a back and forth second half was a fourpoint halftime lead for Notre Dame his production in the second half has been huge for Michael shuberry just on both ends of the floor and you know what you get as a rim protector but theyve been able to get some offense and then hes been clutched with knocking these free throws down the second half until I say that he hadnt missed from one until that still a fourpoint lead for the Irish feel like you got to give Davis a touch here hes got hes been the guy that every time you give him the rock hes been able to come up with something Applause Music big or you could go to Elijah Moore for the Syracuse first made threepointer of the game Brian Im not kidding we just looked that up Syracuse had made a three in every game since 2014 there was a game against Holy Coss that they did not make a three they made a three in every game since and now it is being reviewed and called a two Bryan and then shury comes back with a three he says Ill make sure Ill leave no doubt Im far running up behind it knocks it down extend this lead to five what a game to open up the ACC League Play Moore has it again he scores again were talking about with r alry yesterday he talking about Elijah Moore has ice in his veins is not afraid of the moment comes up with two clutch buckets War who did not score in the first half again his previous shot was ruled a two from in front of his own bench so Syracuse still has not made a three shury with the left hand sh be gets down heill and couldnt finish it Syracuse is 0 for seven from Beyond The Arc again you have to go back to 2014 in the game against Holy Cross at home for a game in which they did not make a three Davis High for the board deflected into the corner he and rer go to the corner and a foul was called its on Roper and is fourth both teams in the Music bonus double bonus for the Irish 109 to go Davis is at the free throw line we known all afternoon long it was going to come down to maybe a one or two possession game Jer Davis goes to the line is what has been a huge afternoon for him on both ends so Davis with the Miss still with 20 points two shy of his season High nerd Dame you run
