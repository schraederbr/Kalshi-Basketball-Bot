its about the same hair H the same hair we got the same kind of curls Ian shefin as well too Hall on the way down Taps it back Chase Hunter controls for Clemson and the Tigers back on their home floor looking to snap a threegame losing streak against shorthanded Boston College without two starters Prince alue Bay and Quinton post both out in this game so youd think that we see a lot of this as Hall goes inside and misses his first shot you can just tell they want to go points in the pain right into high low from sheflin right the hall to try to take advantage of Boston Colleges front Court being out Boston College without their top score Quinton post at 17 points a game a league Bay also gave him 6 and A2 points so over 20 points a game missing from this starting lineup ludell Harris his first one his way off in order for Boston College to hang around theyre going to have to make a lot of Threes theyre just they theyre underman right now based on the guys being out with the flu so theyre going to have to make shots and guys like Harris can make those theyre hes a dynamic scorer and this Clemson starting lineup is very big as Hall gets up the first two but nothing down yet backto back possessions Connor they went right into the paint so good game plan by coach Bernell there to get it right inside great ball Movement by Boston College and it earns Harris a shot tight to the rim but it was contested youd think that Boston College is going to put the ball in the hands of Harris even more than they normally do without post well I think based on them needing to to score theyre going to need him to be a dynamic score and be have one of those type of career nights tonight and look Earl Grant whos whos done a tremendous job there at Boston College at this point knows that hes going to have to get those guards to find ways to score the ball well thatll help Jaden Zachary from the midrange Zacharys a good tough hardnosed player hes going to have to step up in a game like this to find other ways ways to really put the ball in the basket Gerards been struggling to shoot first one is off and we stay down in this end with Clemson with chefin down in the deck so Brad Brownell his goal and his message to his team this week was we got to get our mojo back after the loss against Virginia Tech yeah and and this is a great opportunity to do it theyve got a great stretch coming up they want to get back on the winning ways and look at him alltime wins leader in the school history anyone thats not happy with Brad reell hes one of the best coaches not only in this conference put in the country does an incredible job they should have been in the tournament last year wasnt right they should have got in they deserve to be in shefflin working through the double nice dish and that wont sit down either an O for start is finally followed up with johy Wiggins on the first m i i i cant say it enough you can see theyre not even looking at shooting a threepoint shot right now they are just saying get to the paint get to the paint whether thats through the pass or off the offensive glass weve got to smash him on the in in in the paint with Prince and post being out for this afternoon yeah Clemson has a look of a team that wants to score 60 in the paint today Madson is blocked Gerard got out there but now a five on four for the Eagles as Gerard gets back in late clock and Harris bags the three in order for Boston College they just need to hang around you know with them being short short man tonight they just need to hang around and making threes is whats going to have allow them to do that Gerard with backtoback misses to start his day Zachary downhill and leaves it off for aay and for strong Sports is so funny Connor sometimes you think a guy or two your starters are going to be out it gives other guys opportunities to step up and other guys to get actually more shot opportunities as well too got lucky they didnt get a push off there PJ Hall going to the free throw line Elijah strong is that guy that youre describing for Earl Grant who of course is back in a place where he coached for a while under Brad branell in 2010 through 2014 both both both Brad branell and Earl Grant are tremendous coaches obviously Earl was an assistant with Brad Bernell but both these guys are high level guys I you know obviously cant say enough about Brad and the job that hes done at Clemson and to be the winningest coach in a school history is very hard to do and then youre talking about Earl Grant whos building the program whos done a hes one and and and their teams are they defend they run great action theyve recruited at a high level both these coaches are high level coaches and I look people think well youre a coach youre always going to speak highly of coaches I understand the great job both these gentlemen have done at their schools you ever talk trash to other coaches I have not no I didnt think so Im a pro coach Im Pro for coaches right not youre youre not a Euro league coach not a Euro league not when I say Pro coach support youre an ally yeah Im an ally there you go its a better word thats why youre my point guard there you go it is very similar its more similar than it is different when you look at Earl Grants team and Brad brownells team because of that influence coaching together Harris Banks it in oh hes been feeling good lately maybe not in that way though well look theyre both execution based teams they rely on half court offense and precision of their cutting Music screening now there you go pounding it in the post PJ Hall with the hook yeah I just think thats going to be the whole deal of the game right now I mean Gerard OB youre got to give them some room to shoot those threes but theyre not doing anything without getting the ball inside to the paint right there and thats their whole deal to carry on Elijah strong well here at Clemson this is the first year of gymnastics well give you a little inside look on what was a historic night with a packed crowd a night ago ACC mens college basketball is this has been been a couple years in the making in June 2021 Clemson added gymnastics it all led into last nights inaugural meet the crew that were working with today televised it bringing it to the People Back Home congratulations to Rebecca Wells by the way well always go down in history first gymnast to compete here first allaround champion and did it in front of a packed crowd over 8000 fans at Little John last night to see the first one ever I tell you those gy gymnasts are in such incredible athletes Im just amaz when youre watching like the Olympics and stuff and what they can do its its its amazing with Josh pner Conor onion Clemson back on their home floor trying to snap a threegame losing streak today you can see coach Bernell was not happy with that shot by Wiggins he went right to chase Hunter and says get checked in the game right now Wiggins has gotten so much better they done a great job Clemson has is developing him but that is not the shot that coach Bernell wanted but in and out for Harris strong fighting for the offensive rebounds and this this will stay down here with him and Hall fighting for position you know sometimes what happens just by human nature Connor and just by human error you thinking okay well the two two of their best players are out can just by human nature you have a little bit of a let down you think we can have a let down a little bit you cant not in the not in sports anything can happen and I know thats probably right now thats what coach Bernell is thinking a physical back in for Harris side back board good defense from Dylan Hunter who picked up that first foul on that last play right you said a Chase Hunter rushing back to the scores Table after that sequence in hun and Hall is inside for two he coach Bernell last time that last sequence was upset on Wigan shot thought it was quick and early this time they made sure go inside the PJ Hall points in the paint dont let him off the hook Clemsons really good defensively as well too in the half court again execution is not just on the offensive end it also includes on the defense def end M Clemson in his stands for a while here late clock for Chaz Kelly who came in at the timeout at point guard down to three to go strong a three and 30 seconds a good defense there for the Tigers yeah really good defense and see thats where you not having post whod be able to come up who be able to come up and set a high ball screen in those late clock situations and be able to pick and pop and theyre just not able to do that without put with post out and be able to guard the this guy PJ hall now hes been outstanding you can see the seal there look at both elbows and Palms to the basketball getting great positioning forcing the angles so not only is he setting the tone into the paint right now Connor but theyre also putting Boston College making him foul and the as which allows them to inch their way to the bonus I mean PJ Hall is just a load down there as we saw in the opening graphic you know youre looking at PJ Hall Chase Hunter Gerard those older guys that veteran leadership makes a big deal well coach bner this is a great day of ACC Hoops coming up next Triple header on acc Network take you out to Cam Cameron indor 11th rang Duke against Georgia Tech Miami and Virginia Tech right after that in blackburg to cap the day right here on acc Network and Georgia Tech beat Duke earlier in the year on a big time win for Georgia Tech to do that that was that was a great win by coach Damon stmy and and their team so I know Dukes going to try to get want to get back to them and then you got the Virginia Tech Miami game Miami is going to want to get back on a winning ways after the tough game versus Louisville against Georgia Tech that was Boston Colleges win in the league fun highscoring game into the Upp 80s and 90s hook shot short from mlon and mton had a huge game at vers Georgia Tech on that win and theyre going to need mlon to be a have a big time game today if theyre going to want to win this game strong take but a little heavy for Godfrey can add to the 60 Clemson run and look it doesnt matter right now with Clemson whether its gotf freed or Hall theyre just going looking to go right inside and post both guys to establish inside presence whether it doesnt always have to be Hall thats a deep one for hands and one and done on the rebound for Hunter you said it Boston College is going to have to hit some threes today without their post presence yeah and you can see right now Zachary got on godfried and they went right inside on that matchup good recognition there by by Clemson and if you noticed on the transition coach Brunell actually asked him to slow it down for a second so they could get right into that matchup right there and and created the high low direct entry pass and Zachary whos tough and a hard knows point guards just a little too small against a guy like Godfrey but back to Boston College if theyre not able to to hit a bunch of Threes today based on who theyre missing its going to be hard for them yeah yeah Harris did hit one before that first timeout the second one by the way that he banked in memorably that was a two r a two at the timeout Hall will check out a game where we expected that you know he would be duking it out with Quinton post all day long if you just flipped us over the leading score at that five spot for Boston College out with illness yeah and you can see right now with Boston College like last year they were shooting 32 from three one of the worst teams in the country from threepoint range this year theyre one of the top better ones in the AC not only in the ACC but also in the country at 36 from three tonight this afternoon theyre going to need to shoot around the 40 Mark to have a chance just to hang around and or possibly win this game Clemsons got the clamps on right now over 3 minutes without a field goal for the Eagles into Godfrey has a big on him this time and strong clamps it but into the hands of shefflin skip pass three and it goes down Dylan hunter from Applause outside 5050 ball what sheflin does how he comes up with so many loose balls hes a winning player he just finds ways to get those loose balls look right now Boston College you can see offensively theyre trying to execute exactly what they need to do but when youre missing the type of scoring that theyre missing right now it you almost have to reinvent and change some things within the course of the game well hunter called for his second foul he had the three after the shefflin hustle yeah I mean I I cant tell you how many wins on 5050 or loose balls that shefflin has come up with that then finds a basket that leads to a basket and for why theyre a current nc2a tournament team is because of guys like sheflin coming up with those loose balls and winning them not only coming up with it but winning them and turning them to scores a first sign of foul trouble either way with the Dylan Hunter going to the bench with two fouls for the Tigers he was a guy that they lean on defensively quite a bit three on the clock and Kelly is fouled on his way to the rim you Connor as you can tell late clock Boston College has been put in a lot of positions on late clock situations one because of Clemsons the way theyre executing within their half court defense very sound theyre shrinking the floor theyre making sure that that theyre not overextending anywhere however for Boston College where late clock situations where theyve had guys like Prince but especially post who can set up a ball screen you can throw him at the Block you can throw him at the elbow he can bail you out missing that right now is really you can tell has affected BC well hey tomorrow afternoons womens basketball triple header pit squares off against Boston College at noon Eastern number 15 Louisville against Wake On the afternoon cap with Virginia number 20 North Carolina in Chapel Hill Womens oops every Sunday right here on acc Network and the appon so Boston College went to that first time out leading and Clemson led by their defense and PJ Hall out by four ahead of the under 12 really good transition defense there by shefflin Ian just kind of loading to the ball playing Five on four advantage Clemson in the transition while waiting for Boston Colleges Trail post to come down well strong has not been scared to get his shot up and the start today no and they need him to got to make some shots I mean theyre just going to need to find different ways to score oh there it is for Gerard going through a shooting slump he gets one to go screen and rescreen action they came out the hard hedge Gerard readd it rejected the other way how about that answer its a good answer Jaz Kelly right back at him oh you could see it though from Gerard he pumped his fist he knew that he needs to get his shot going that had to feel good yeah and when youre a shooter like Gerard who can really score just seeing the ball go through the hoop makes a big difference sha Flyn with the put back thats what he does Connor whether its offensive rebounds first to the floor loose balls he makes winning plays M Kelly on to take nice f strong through the back door really good Baseline Drive Clemson had good was in a good defensive possession but they cut they call it a 45 cut weak side slot as they call it a 45 cut and he Dove from the from that side got right to the rim hun three book that Conor if Clemsons making these threes they dont need to worry about points in the paint they sure dont three is better than two if you didnt know that good math there Chase Hunter he he was challenged by this coaching staff after that loss against Virginia Tech midweek coming out hidden shots and the followup goes down from mton off the Miss Chase Hunter is one of their big as we talked about the in the very beginning about the trio and they need Chase to be really good for them he was challenged both ends really challenged absolutely he was challenged by coach absolutely and hes resp this afternoon to this point one of the things Brad Brownell said is outside shots got to start going for him he was two of his last 14 before Chase Hunter knocked that one down to extend the lead for the Tigers you can see right here Gerard comes off that screen sees a guy show comes back hits a three then he finds Chase Hunter on the slot and nothing but the net thats why welcome back the Clemson Tigers relying on these two guys PJ Hall Joe Gerard to get going good to see Gerard hit a shot there before the timeout yeah look both guys are such keys to their team part of the reason they did not play well and lost the threegame losing streak was PJ Hall and Gerard didnt play well I mean you look at the way theyre shooting on their field goal percentage and theyre below their points per game and uh you know right now this afternoon is a little bit of a different story for them theyre thats why theyre winning but they Clemson needs those two to be really good and in and for this game right now as you and I were talking about only one turnover to this point combined for both teams its been a pretty clean game of not turned the ball over both teams dont extend pressure they play within the half court its not something they do where they force turnovers and have high pressure which if youre Boston College youre saying phew cuz that was ramped up pressure against Clemson as shefflin is there for the dunp that was a outstanding back door cut pass behind the back look like the Harlem glow Trotters back back in the day that was awesome Harris oh nice move off the shot fake you can see right there where where they got lifted Harris really came down sold with the shot fake and the pivot Clemson did not stay down it wasnt staying disciplined to stay on that shot fake got risen up and allowed for the straight layup PJ Hall brought it down kept it beetle in the game goes right back to him and Hall Falling Away Cash Money hes in contention for ACC Player of the Year obviously hes on the wooden award midseason list you know hes just hes had a great season to this point Virginia Tech heldon to 11 points the other night already at 10 little past the Midway point of this first half mton kick out Zachary buzzes it to hands who cant hit the three outstanding shot and ball Movement by Boston College if Im coach Grant no problem with that shot well sheflin wanted it had inside position on Madson back out for Applause Gerard shefflin bangs his way in and dances off the rim you know the the match up with Matson was on sheflin there and and sheflin just you can see the angle he got right to the rim he just missed a layup but really good pass there by by Gerard getting into the paint and just a dump down he had double duckins both by Hall and sheflin and Matson uses his speed past sheflin Clemson closed out on Matson cuz hes known as a threepoint shooter thats what he does so they closed out so hard to take away his three Matson made the decision to say Im not shooting this thing Im going right to the rim oh usually you dont get away going under on Gerard rare chance for you do very very fortunate on that that was a really good look for Gerard heres Madson threepoint shooting and an airball oh two two good Shooters on backto back trips yeah going I thought Gerard shot was a good shot Matson was probably a little bit of a force there thought it was actually good contest by PJ Hall you can see him going right back inside there looking high low Zachary theyve got him on the point guard basically on sheflin Zachary forced the give up out for a three and short from Beetle offensive rebound shevelin puts it back back and one Andrew Laff said hes too Smalling to use that mismatch with Boston College undiz first to his Harris but then the Harlem Globe Trotters look Beetle to shefflin for the jam its bow time hey sweetie turned up his scoring in ACC almost 4 and a half point points per game more this is the and one before the timeout well you can see there Zachary was on sheflin on the offensive glass there and instead of him really trying to box him out with his rear end on his thighs to immobilize him he was trying to keep him off with his hands and sheins just too big down there and and and right now hes had a lot of really duckins and great opportunities going against the smaller guards at Boston College well hes the only guy in the ACC that scores at that level combines that with the rebounding and the passing thats led to uh a quad of double doubles this year yeah and hes like I said earlier hes just hes win so many 5050 balls loose balls offensive rebounds winning plays that even sometimes that dont always show up in the Box Score he makes those plays that do show up well you figured this could be a day when uh we got the news that Quinton post top scorer top player down in the paint for Boston College was out well I would tell you right now this next three minutes right here segment and you can see l what Quinton post what they losing with him not playing today this segment right here over these next 3 minutes is going to make her break the game right here I really believe that just on the fact alone that Clemson excuse me Boston College has to keep it close but this segment right here can Clemson really extended and get into double digits thats a guy that was just on that drive for Earl Grant he tagged the foulon RJ Godfrey Devin mlon he has been a different human in ACC play since it restarted hes been like two different guys cuz as what hes done in ACC play the numbers that hes put up for Georgia Tech two games ago he had 30 30 plus points and I mean theyre going to need him to have a 20 plus point game today theyre going to have a chance to be Clemson especially without post you saw those numbers were post M Lockton with two points and well thatll work tough bucket for Jaden Zachary great curl cut by Zachary and got behind the defense and held his seal Zachary hes a big strong guard thats why hes able to do some things in the post trying to keep guys out of the post but down there he used his size to his advantage in posting up his defender on the base out of bounds well wiggin said never mind into the post and Gerard on the drive with Harris bodying him up you can see right here look at the tight curl by Zachary and he gets underneath there and is able to get inside hes lucky Clemsons lucky he wasnt an n one there should have been a foul called look Kelly hitting the deck little floorb burn with the steal for Boston College and Zachary stays in attack mode now hes got his hand one big time 5050 loose ball I cant express enough about special team situations base out of bounds you can see the bump here in the oldfashioned and opportunity for the N1 but think about it Boston College scored on the base out of bounds on their end and then they get a turnover against Clemsons base out of bounds and its up right now if he makes this free throw thats five points in a base out of bounds situation those are special team situations thats how you hang around and have a chance to win this game well thats where this game is interesting too coach bassner is neither team gets to the free throw line a lot so the whistle is fascinating yeah I dont know if either coach is happy with ever the officials unless youre on The Winning Side however trying to trying to buy their guys a few more trips there right thats exactly right but thats why Clems is going to want to continue to go inside to try to put the onus on the official back to back turnovers and Kelly right in the middle of both of them he keeps himself what a recovery Wiggins back into the play now the Tigers out and running and Gerard stripped Zachary steps on the Baseline two things here Zachary missed the free throw they got the advantage down here on this on the transition and they got a great block Gerard had a threeonone you can see a great block here by Wiggins got up but then great defense on the two on The threeonone Fast Break by Zachary by taking the ball out of Gerard back deep into the paint an easy two for Godfrey they called a slice screen a shuffle screen out of the base out of bounds they got Godfrey to the post theres a miscommunication on Boston College and he got right there too deep too strong basket for Clemson what do you have to say on that slice cut make sure you well depending on how they want to play if theyre going to want to switch it they got to communicate early loud and often if theyre just trying to show you got to War through there wasnt enough help on the weak side Godfrey just was untouched coming coming across the paint there you can see here about yeah you can see right here where watch Gody he comes untouched theres no theres no chesting no physicality no stopping his line of cutting and able to get to that right to that sweet spot by the rim strong lost it with six on the clock Madson ducking in and hes fouled so here you go Boston College not known for getting to the free throw line going on backtoback trips well think think where theyre scoring right now they theyre going to score again off the base out of bounds think about Clemson whether it was that turnover or that base out of bounds where they scored just on that shuffle cut by gotfried but this was again youre talking about base out of bounds a lot of it those are special team situations theyre little things but they make a big difference when youre talking about winning that was the second foul on RJ Godfrey by the way P our gymnastics coverage on acc Network continues tonight at 9 Eastern with the third of three quad meets four schools compete against each other were featuring the final one NC State BYU Cal Michigan State theyll be competing in four skills bars beam vaults and floor so two guys with two fouls now for Clemson early in this half Dylan Hunter picked up two quick ones now RJ Godfrey with two fouls on the bench for the Music Tigers PJ Hall has been a guy thats been in that situation the last several games theyve been able to keep him out of foul trouble Gerard off on the three Paul battling for the board rebound for Boston College with hands and Han going straight to the rim for two more Coast to Coast there by hand but listen Gerards thats a shot that you got to allow Gerard to shoot it hes too good of a shooter and he got open you know he was he was open and and thats just a shot but right now Boston College is hanging around you said this was a critical stretch for them without two starters and theyve responded well to Earl Grant back within two playing in Fast Break you can see right here Connor a reason why Boston College is hanging around which Clemson Prides itself on his transition defense defensive rebound by Boston College and you can see right now they werent back on numbers Clemson on off of a quick shot and then you can see from coast to coast and Gerard doesnt get over there to take the charge nobody stops the ball I know that is unacceptable for Coach Brunell he Prides himself on not only half court defense but transition defense but its a reason right now why Boston College is hanging around only down two so you wanted to see shein show to the ball there a little bit well he needed to stop the ball and then I would like to see Gerard as he pulled over maybe got there beat way before him and try to just take a charge if he was able to but somebody had to stop the ball that drives a coach up the wall to allows someone to go from 94 feet from rim to rim without anybody stopping the ball especially in transition defense no coach is happy with that well out of the timeout a foul on Madson on the threepoint shooter with Wiggins going to the line thats a second foul on Mason Madson Connor Clemsons front line as you mentioned is so tall and and Wiggins is like 69 and but hes really most comfortable shooting three hes a perimeter player they called a foul I mean I dont know how much there was a touch there but those things drive you up the wall as well as a coach if Im coach Grant more at the officials saying man were right there in Striking Distance but dont foul a jump shooter and it and it I dont know if there was really any contact but that ends up putting gives Clemson a little life with that this this question relates to Wiggins I promise are you the type of person thats exactly like your parents or did you stray away and do everything the opposite of them no Im probably a little more like my parents I was just like him thats thats not how Wiggins is as far as his basketball game cuz cuz his parents both played both big rebounders scoring came second hes the opposite scoring came first very very early in his life Chon wiggins parents are way better players than my parents and Chon is a way better player than me his development has been absolutely outstanding to watch some credit to Clemson and Coach Bernell and their staff oh sheflin thought he got got it clean on the Madson drive and back to the free throw line you know I like to credit to both coaches on both coach Bernell and Coach Grant the job theyve done in developing guys in their program they both theyve gotten guys better now let me just tell you this on Matson hes he gra people gravitate towards him when hes at the threepoint line he pulls the gravity towards him because of his shooting ability and because of that close out this is his second time where hes turned down that three to reack a close out because of the gravity that hes pulled and hes gotten to the rim the one was the reverse and now he gets the gets the foul and chance to make both free throws here and he doesnt miss these hes hes 16 to 16 on the year when he does get there if theres a technical foul you want him shooting it thats for certain oh yeah the guy that got Boston College awake again offensively before the half at Syracuse earlier this week before their comeback in the second half Gerard not kns into three misdirection and then the flare screen Gerard came off on the flare screen the penetration threw it over the top got a great look too good of a look for Gerard great action there by Clemson and that was his 342 three of his career is now tied for fourth in ACC history as the foul is going on the Tigers if thats on sheflin thats his second and they will get that on sheflin so here was the the fourth place tying three for Gerard number 342 thats a great pass great but well sheins screen sheins flare screen on the backside is what set it up and thats what Ive been talking about shefflin he makes winning plays loose balls screens him getting his second foul here is a big loss for Clemson he got Gerard that open shot weve seen PJ Hall in this spot three games in a a row for Clemson where he fought some first half foul trouble and Clemson went back to him this is a little bit later in the half though you think thats a Sit the rest of the way well I think theyre going to end up sitting sitting him the rest of the theyre going to sit shefflin the rest of the way but if Im Boston College you you cant afford to miss those free throws when youre just trying to cuz your margin of error is literally none I I got to keep it within five to seven going into halftime Paul had position and short on the hook so a chance to work right here toward that goal of inside five or seven but a Miss from hand you know Boston College pretty comfortable from playing from behind they have played some really entertaining games in the ACC seems like they are more comfortable coming back in some cases well you know look they dont they dont theyre they they are who they are theyre tough theyre a hardnosed basketball team theyre fundamentally sound theyre well coached thats a tough shot and it goes down for Wiggins you know look is actually pretty good defense there by Boston College they missed that 5050 ball that Zachary tried to get early kind of right in front of us which allowed Clemson to regain The Possession tough shot there by Wiggins just he he over elevated based on his size onto that Baseline was able to get a good look just on his size alone mton bangs his way in misses the bunny cant miss those if youre trying to hang around that and the free that that shot plus the earlier free throw just are back Breakers Madson gets the stop of the rebound good box out by Matson on Wiggins again Wiggins gave up the has so much more size on Matson but Madson attacked his legs right to his thigh so he couldnt Elevate on the jump Zachary split him kick out Harris with the rainbow Harris is a dynamic score but if you notice there Boston College ran the double drag high ball screen usually thats what they have Post in there and who can pick and pop its a different deal without post but great find by Zachary got Clemson sucked in and Harris made a big three he is a dynamic score Harris one of the best in the ACC from out there is PJ Hall in tight again 12 points six boards in this first half for Hall Got Deep posess positioning to too deep got the angle right over his left shoulder where hes most comfortable pretty shot off the glass now Harris loses the ball for a Boston College team that takes great care of the ball and a foul out and transition this ISS that look this is a tough cover Wiggins is 6 10 and some change yeah and you can see Matson was right there its just his size was able to elevate over Matson and one of the reasons when your Boston College is able to to when they are down or be able to come back or stay within games a lot of it has to do with not turning the ball over I dont care if its basketball football baseball I dont care what sport it is when you dont turn the ball over you give yourself a chance to hang around and possibly win the game I i never thought about that in baseball terms a baseball turn ER I think I was thinking more error you strike out you give give the other team a chance to B I was think more I I consider errors as turnover Maybe wrong on that Im a huge baseball fan though so get you on some ACC Baseball coverage three for Zachary swirls all the way around and out and the clock is dark so Clemson can hold for one last shot up by six in the first half theyre going to get it to Gerard here well see theyre just going to go straight high ball screen well could this be a historical three hes tied for four high ball screen Gerard looking for fourth all time hes fouled and almost banked it in to move up one spot in ACC history you know this guy can he just knows how to score again this is two or three times now when the screen has come up on the high set he has taken one dribble to his left and then right away gone right to his right and got taken the shot going that direction got Boston College up in the air they didnt stay down and he gets three free three free throws let me just say this this this young man scored 4700 points in high school yep theres just something about scoring you either know how to score or you dont its an innate ability to be able to find a way to put the ball in the basket and he can do that as well as anybody in the ACC the first couple shots that he put up sure if your Clemson fans sitting at hry thinking uhoh this is kind of a carbon copy of the last two games for for Gerard but he he wasnt going to have three bad games shooting in a row when youre a score like that with that scorers mentality you got to give some freedom and some room to take some of those maybe shots where you want to pull your hair out at times you know and so you got to have that ability to give him that because he has the ability to make those well as good as hitting a shot from outside with three free throws for Gerard for half to extend the Clemson lead to nine so one last look at it with 39 seconds for Boston College playing without two starters trying to hang with Clemson on the road in the hands of Kelly inside the ark and that is short where today and he looks like he can still play uhhuh so he looks good I know he might not be feeling good but he looks good well second half off and Rolland Boston College looking for their first ranked win of the Year Clemson trying to stop a threegame losing streak and mlon gets the second half started with a theyre going to need M glockton to find a way to score this half because again scoring is an issue to find guys who can make enough shots to hang around and thats a good start but theyre going to need to Glock them to really got to get going this half well hes got the assignment on PJ Hall and he bumps him on the first trip down on defense so Boston College with mton its really a big four as far as theyre scoring it becomes more of a big three with post out and then El League Bay is their fifth score thats usually in the start line but I cant put enough stress and emphasis on having post out just the things that he does offensively with the pick and pops and and then defensively his size to match up with Against The Bigs inside of Clemsons its a huge loss to lose post Hunter short and an offensive rebounds of course for sheflin hes been all over the glass again thats the size not having post there and just Ju Just you know Boston College Plays through post so much throwing the offensive end not having him they had to reinvent themselves really before game time those interchangeable bigs down in the post post without post for Clemson shefflin and Hall you can see where mcglockton is right now at the elbow thats where post has been at to play through him and its just a different feel when youve got post plane whos also a great passer more so than M glockton at that position give up a few inches that makes that pass a different angle a hands on it for Harris oh nice job getting on the deck look out in the court side seats Harris saves it for the Eagles another 5050 win there for Boston College see if they can take advantage on this offensive sequence that was over in the seat where our uh our lipsyncing friend the national anthem was sitting Zachary for three and he knocks it down another 5050 ball leads to a basket but youre right there was a fan there was lipsyncing the national anthem the entire time I he was a great backup singer if we needed him to to come in on that but he was right there in the first row and thats where they got the 5050 ball and led to a threepoint shot well shefflin had foul trouble in the first half thats his third foul getting called for the charge well you you can see there just he used his chest beat him to the spot the 5050 ball there diving in the loose ball right into the front row which and then Zachary you can see that on the drive got pulled out had had hul on him got separation and Zacharys a tough hard noosed guard hes a good player let me also say this its so hard to get charges called in this day and age based on the new emphasis by Chris ratat are the head of the officials so its to get a charge like they did right there for Boston College thats a big deal because its hard to get a call for the charge well and the importance of who it was on it was on shefflin the top rebounder and one of the top scorers for Clemson but but they turn it right back over something thats doesnt Boston College doesnt do a lot is turn it over its a big turnover right there you see they played off of RJ Godfrey trying to really sit on PJ Hall and Gerard off the shot fake and again because of the gravity just like were talking about Matson with Boston College the gravity that he pulls from shooting thre same thing with Gerard theyre trying to just blanking him and hes able to get by and without posst in there with his size theres really no shop Locker inside for Boston College at The Rim missing one of the top guys in the ACC protecting the rim Quinton post blate clock strong off the shot fake and flat in the midrange good defense by by Clemson and you got to give Earl Grant and his staff a lot of credit to have their team playing as well as they have right now and and godre in tight to make it a 10point lead for the Tigers but this is the this is this is where kind of gets dicey you start getting a double digits and does it just kind of get worn out guys who maybe even who are playing who they feel a little bit under the web and then all of a sudden the conditioning it hits into your legs and his Clemson are able to pull away right here big possession right here as we get close to the First Media timeout and Gerard was calling for the Clemson crowd to get involved and thatll silence him IO for Zachary I really like Zachary a lot Connor and hes tough hes hardnosed he wasnt highly recruited under the radar guy great job developing by coach Grant and staff whats the the oh heres Hall fighting for his second chance and hes fouled you know you looked at the stats at the start of the halftime everything was pretty even other than the offensive rebound a plus three advantage on the offensive glass for Clemson and just that size inside I mean theyve just taken advantage of not having post down there or even Prince yep not having them down there and and sheflin and Hall and Godfrey theyve just taken advantage of that size and Boston College is trying but theres some things that you just cant overcome based on genetics someone being 611 and someone being 64 well theyre going to have to take Matson out of the game now too that was his fourth foul so already shorthanded two starters plus a back out backup out and Madson on the bench for the foreseeable future and I think theyre checking to see if the foul was on Matson so thats going to the officials are checking to make sure it was called on him because thats a big deal having Matson out of the game that alleviates your best threepoint shooter on the floor basically for Boston College well theyll theyll actually change it to Zachary yeah so thats thats a thats a gift for Boston College Im well see if they get Matson back in well probably should have gone on mton right yeah it looked like it I dont think it was Zachary either I dont think Zachary tou I dont think Madson touched him either I dont think there was any Touch by anybody I think Clemson got a gift I think they need to review that after the game and Brian kiry whos the head of the officials of the ACC who does an outstanding job was one of the great officials in his in his time Im sure well be reaching out to those guys about that now I know how you coaches can be you said youre youre Pro coach youre always going to back your coaches what about are you are you Pro ref now well look I know the type of job those guys have and they and we and the ACC has outstanding officials its a very very hard job but they know what they signed up for theyre going to get youre going to get criticized by a lot of people especially the team that doesnt win or coaches so but these guys do a great job Brian kirys got a great group of officials and and its a high level its a high level group its a hard job it is not an easy job being an official and Godfree going to work tough finish just too strong down there too deep in the paint they got great position and if you notice Clemson is trying on the drive to the towards the center part of the lane on that duck in to try to take away any help from either side and just have this a duck in right there by the block dump down pass to give him a chance to get as close to the rim as possible the biggest lead of this game for Clemson and Harris little heavy on the three rebound for Dylan Hunter now Clemson with a little Tempo a three and it goes go down number four all time in the ACC and made threes

watch this replay folks da da da Ms What A Catch hey you got to watch this Im watching oh oh Im Applause watching now on Sports Center another wild Night Watch Me Conor Rion Josh pner at Clemson where Joseph Gerard just moved into fourth place by himself in ACC history alltime made threepointers he passed Tran langon who was the Alaskan assassin played for Duke went to the national title game of 99 first of all you can see their career points in high school 4700 the guy just knows how to score and when he hit that three it the crowd got electric Ive been so impressed by Little John theyve had a great home atmosphere here the crowd went berserk and uh its its a great accomplishment for Gerard to do that now look hes played his five years in in college so its a little different but bottom line is the ball still goes through the hoop the same way and the records count and hes fourth all time in ACC history and that is ACC history as good as you get Zachary off on the three mton tapped it away but into the hands of Wiggins this uh this fan base has a good memory too I was walking in today and somebody was reminding me of the shield that you brought in here during Co times was all crumpled up na to the refs a little bit in fact I got a technical foul hitting the scores table with the face shield Teddy Valentine I love teddy Valentine but he gave me a tech because I hit my face shield I wasnt mad at him I was mad at the guy my player not getting cross half cord in time somebody was asking me is is coach pner a nice guy I wasnt sure after that day here little John I think Im a nice guy I I thats I had your back dont you worry con Im Im pro passner thank you Kelly a deep three Chaz Kelly from outside yeah thats a big shot right there this was about to get Boston KS it was real in danger zone Connor so that three kept it a little bit within in distance enough because Boston College has got to find a way to keep it within single digits theres no 14point shot but theyve going to have to keep it within at that under eight timeout they want to be within eight or nine just to give themselves a chance this is a team Boston College they down 16 against Georgia Tech came back and won that game theyre down 19 against Syracuse and took a lead and mton air ball a second chance at it no shot clock reset though the difference in those games they had post and right and Prince both guys late in the clock strong falling away thatll help their come back if he starts hitting shots they got it look heres what your heres if Im coach Grant Im sure hes told his team this there is no 14 16 12o shot you just got to chip away and the only way you can chip away is you got to get stops the only way you can chip away is you have to stop Clemson from scoring and then from from there you can take advantage on the other side but you dont want to you want to defend without fouling as well too the hands fouls Gerard that sends us back to break the hook for RJ Godfrey that extended the lead to the biggest of the day but Kelly stabilize things the eagles they have it within Applause 12 at dominoes were on a mission to make sure our customers can always get hot pizza even

mens college basketball presented by Food Lion official grer of the ACC Conor onion Josh passner now this was obviously a huge part of the conversation last year late in the season for Clemson deserving of the NCAA tournament not getting in with their strength of schedule the tournament were today theyve left no doubt and with their N9 and0 start they had great nonconference wins at Alabama they played UAB had a great win UAB beat South Carolina I mean you look at their numbers right now theres no doubt theyre an nc2a tournament team they should have been a tournament team last year to finish third in the top four in the ACC anytime youre a top four team in the ACC ACC you should be in the tournament should have got in last year this year theyre leaving no doubt as long as theres no incredible collapse Clemson fans can know that theyre going back to the nc2a tournament and yes its a threegame losing streak all of those are quad one losses though and two on the road and one is against Carolina who right now is playing as well as any team in the country all AC and maybe the best team in the ACC this was called a block on mlon yeah theyre going right back inside theyre out of the timeout Brad Bernell just called up the play went right back into Hall youll see on the base out of bounds here that thats been a little bit of a difference in the game for both teams we call it special team situations you want to take advantage of opportunities on on the base out of bounds is a great way to get a set play to find a way to get a shooter or or or go back inside here that one time off of Clemson they ran that shuffle cut screen got Godfrey at The Rim well you know these guys know each others out of bound stuff so well in conference coaching with each other in conference and scouting everything gets elevated but yes they obviously know and one Chase Hunter going to the line to tag on base out of bounds the chase Hunter was the inbounder came and threw it in got the hand off turned the corner on the ball screen there off the dribble handoff went right to his left and got an oldfashioned opportunity for an an one here Chase Hunter is is so athletic hes a guy that hes one of those guys in the ACC that hes one of the most athletic guards but he can create his own shot he can play downhill hes so good playing off of two feet hes explosive and Coach Bernell as we talked in the first half really challenged him on both ends of the floor and for Clemson to be successful they need him to be a high high level player both offensively and defensively theyve asked him to be a little bit more confrontational too Zachary gets in to score again but thats what theyve asked for from Chase Hunter is you know challenge your teammates a little bit yes were challenging you but you can give that back to your guys and spread it around I they wanted to be a little more vocal to to to to kind of get a little they need him to do that but hey when you got a when you got a big time Center in PJ Hall one of the best players in America thats a pretty good weapon in itself right there hell confront you in the paint yeah he will confront you hell tell you like it is Applause y hes got Zachary here as Kelly goes inside and there was a whistle on the drive 15point game Clemson trying to snap a three game losing streak Zachary try trying to keep the Eagles close PJ Hall with

today at 5 on accn we have breaking news right now so we wait to to see how this plays out in all my years I never watched anything like this you have got to watch this replay folks Ms What A Catch hey you got to watch this Im watching oh oh Im Applause watching now on Sports Center another wild Music night a Boston College downfield 15 theyve been in some of these spots before four wins this season when theyve trailed by 10 or more like they are right now yeah right now though as I mentioned as we talked about you know they dont have post dont have prints that makes it tough for the comeback because youre especially with not having post or leading score re you know rebounder the way he does things offensively that being said Connor this media timeout towards the next media timeout which is basically a 4minute segment Boston College has to win this segment they have to have a plus advantage in this segment otherwise it what ends up happening is youre starting to get an under eight minutes based on the conditioning and you know who knows who else is under the weather in Boston College how theyre feeling and Clemsons not a team thats going to turn it over a lot it becomes really tough for Boston College to make a comeback then so this segment right here is going to be probably going to tell a lot about the game yeah its hit the entire travel party for Boston College with the bug going through the team three of those four comeback wins in that graphic we showed you were second half double digit comebacks and there was also the comeback that they had against Syracuse to take a lead late in that game right coming up more ACC mens basketball gets you out to Duke at Cameron indor Georgia Tech at Duke the number 11 team in the country at 5 Eastern Miami at Virginia Tech closes out coverage on acc Network as far as the games today Studio coverage after that to recap the entire day they got a great studio in there led by Kelsey rigs whos outstanding and awesome shes as good as you get everywhere this week hosting a little uh little Studio coverage from Houston college football national championship game youre in good hands back there today she is she is as high level as you get theres no doubt about that great again take there by PJ hall right to the rim whether its the dribble the pass the postup they want to get a 20 piece little Rim protection PJ Hall looking like PJ Hall Beetle off a shot fake slithers in there you can see right now its falling a little bit apart for Boston College just based on they just dont have enough scoring right now and there you go I say that thats why Im sitting here not on the sidelines I say that and all of a sudden they hit a nice three so You have told Elijah strong shoot that absolutely you would have pulled the right strings but they they they needed that to just kind of break the Rhythm from Clemson right there you you dont want to start getting past this point right here youre starting to get close to that 8minute Mark they got to get a stop here at Boston College if they want to have give themselves a chance just to hang working on 20 points PJ Hall with the off hand and how about the left hand Baseline hook the spin they Boston College looked they were going to double with Matson who came from the high side and PJ Hall just spun away from it had a beautiful Left Hand hook Kelly working in on Hall who had to block a couple of trips ago so they have to wheel it back out Madson on the take closed off Godfrey was right there not let Matson have any space to shoot the three and deep in the clock Kelly whirls that out of bounds go back to that that lefthanded shot for PJ hall for a second where do you see him ending up next level well look I mean he hes a really really good BAS bball player and you know everyone froze the word around Pro a lot yeah you can be a pro but it could be overseas sure and you can still be a professional basketball player to be an NBA guy its its almost its almost like winning the lottery you can be a great great college player you can be the ACC player of the year you can be first team AllAmerican and never get a sniff in the NBA its an offensive foul on beetle does he get a sniff I think hell get an opportunity to be in the summer league and and people will look at him but you know its not easy and you never know based on prior injuries and and and different things like that heres a charge here which is I dont think that was the right call either that look like a block based especially based on the new rule but however go look at a at a at a gleague game and look at the people that are playing that first team all Americans player of the years I I mean the accolades that those guys are in there that theyve never really even got a a cup of coffee in the NBA people dont fully understand its almost impossible to play in that League M blockton over the top this will stay down with the Eagles thats why its the best basketball league in the world is the NBA and thats why its so hard to make and if you make it its an incredible feat it really is so even with the range and the ability to use both hands no hes I mean hes a prospect y theres no doubt about it and I love PJ Hall I mean I think hes an outstanding and hes helped graell win a lot of college games but that thing in the NBA is just a different deal and sometimes it could it could be based on it has nothing to do with what you do in college it could be strictly just based on potential athleticism size all different things that is out of your wheelhouse that was a uh an NBA level balloon rope that the fans had going that we just showed you that was pretty good balloon hey this has been a great crowd by the way great energy in the building I want to give a shout out to Little John colise see them here the fans theyve been great theyve had a packed house deserv Le so Clemson deserves that being a top 25 team and they can know that their team is getting back to the tournament this year when it comes down to selection Applause Sunday trying to shut the water off on whats been a three game losing streak and theyre getting the ball back up 17 off of the turnover Clemsons we talked at the beginning in the pregame about execution execution is not only about halfcourt offense Clemson is outstanding in their execution of halfcourt Defense as well the way they plug the gaps how they guard the ball how they move over to to to help side and that was a great example there now you can see Boston College has gone into Zone to try to change the pace a little bit defensively never mind I was wrong on that now they switched back to manto man hul on the attack back to the left one more time it look like I it looked like from my vantage point they Maybe started in zone then switched to man well thats where the variance comes between Earl Grant and Brad branell you know the the rugged manto Man style is pretty similar but they do have some Nuance differences when they go Zone yeah they do and and it was hard to tell because Clemson coming down got a little stagnant so Boston College was able to be a little stagnant defensively thats what Matson does now is he can make those threes off that quick any room any space that he that he might have for the most part Clemson has held him and Harris down from outside Zachary ties this up and the arrow stays with Clemson PJ Hall its been all leftand these last couple of trips back into the post Don mton working on a 24point day wow this new Sharm an ultra soft smooth tear is so soft and so smooth Im starting to get carried away ah thank you Mr Smooth bear designed with smooth tear edges new charman ultrasoft smooth tear has wavy perforations that tear so much better for a smooth more enjoyable go mom you okay in there Im terrific enjoy the go with Charmy we have breaking news right now so we wait to see how this plays out in all my years I never watched anything like this you have got to watch this replay folks Ms a catch hey you got to watch this Im watching oh oh Im watching Applause be now on Sports Center another wild night watch me watch me do the competitions never been better this is just spectacular the stars have never been brighter thats our move womens college hoops on ESPN and Applause ABC she has it the competitions never been better have never let a one do that the stars have never been bright H par 3000 career points come on Cameron Frank Deja Kelly oh that was pretty ESPN and Music ABC Im here Courtside watch this you have got to watch this replay FKS watch this watch Applause this PJ Hall Joseph Gerard two guys we talked about Clemson needed to get a little bit more from today 38 combined points yeah no theyve been outstanding I mean these guys are just highle guys and look I would say right now I I I think PJ Hall Bott one of those two is if it if it was today ors going to be Player of the Year in the ACC is what I personally think and I think the year PJ has had hes been outstanding look hes had a little bit of a slump those last couple games on their losses but hes been about as efficient as effective as anybody in this league maybe even anyone in the country and then Gerard when you include his shooting thats where thats where Clemson becomes really dangerous it came in not shooting it well H three threes today cant add a fourth Zachary gets hands on it for Boston Applause College so you talked about winning that that last battle that fourminute War Boston College ended up coming out of their minus one the lead Drew to 16 points for Clemson a onehanded pass gets away from Kelly you can see right now I think for Boston College right now Connor their their energy stting to hit them right now that second third wind is is not kicking in in a sense and and uh you can see from Boston Colleges standpoint it almost feels a little bit like theyre kind of slip letting it slip away a little bit here if that were a grenade every Clon got to take full advantage if they just want to absolutely just put it away in these next couple possessions are going right back to PJ at the elbow number 24 with 24 points and he still has 24 but Balls kept alive into the hands of beetle theres RJ Godfrey crashing the offensive glass now Madson breaks out and lays it in off the steel great second effort by gfre on the offensive glass came flying in but good hands there by Matson created a turnover by Clemson and allow him to kind of get a just a little bit hanging around just hanging around just enough Beetle lost it but right in the lap of Godfrey Fernand one so youre thought of just enough hanging around then you get a good bounce Clemsons way yeah well can I now reverse that statement cuz that that negated the hanging around anymore just having a chance to get a threepoint play here the drive loose ball Godfrey picks it up right there and the N1 opportunity I mean I I dont think theres any question at this point Clemsons is going to be able to hold on to this game just the size alone inside and you know you got to imagine guys like Zachary whos fighting and and battling down there its going to take a toll on you on the offensive end because it gets into your leg same thing with Harris and hand and and you even like again the offensive rebound part has really been the difference in this game second third opportunities for Clemson Brad brell wanted more from Chase Hunter how about that effort youre youre up by 16 bangs a guy down to the ground sky over everybody to keep the possession alive hes an outstanding athlete a quick jumper off the floor and you can see coach Bernell right now drawing up a play for for a side base out of bounds right here no box out there by Boston College and just the the effort the the the quickness off the floor the elevation hes a guard hes not even a big that has been a big difference in in this afternoons game is the offensive rebound almost a second straight steal by Matson snuck in there for Fast Break layup before but Clemson keeps this time late clock Hunter and off the spring box with a little bit of tempo Donald Hans throws it off the back court just uncharacteristic of some turnovers by Boston College I do think that again just the your teammates just suck at passing and Gerard is fouled the best part about being close to the student section here is you hear the greatest of the insults behind us thats correct you hear their commentary too B Boston College was just accused of being uh stinky passers thats the Grated version of what was just behind us well here here in here again the turnover leads to Clemson get in transition offense not allowing Boston College to get their half court defense set up which which Earl Grant and his staff and BC is really good in in half court defense allowed gerardi to drive it and get to the free throw line well hey Sundays are for womens basketball in the ACC pit at Boston College at noon then that middle game presented by food line Wake Forest at number 15 Louisville and the ranked Tar Heels host Virginia at four Eastern Sunday womens basketball in the ACC on acc Network coming up Applause tomorrow Boston College early in this game held the lead first four minutes Clemsons LED from pretty much that point on as Matson hits a three you can see coach Bernell right there not happy about that he was I mean you cant give Matson any looks you got to smother him wiggins hand was below the ball allowed Matson to shoot the ball above wiggins hand gave him a little bit of air space Matt is too good of a shooter Gerard shot fake got him leaning and hes too good of a shooter as well too to give him any daylight hes kind of got back on track now and he keeps moving up the rank in ings in the ACC career threepoint leader he has been especially good as that bounces home for Harris Gerard has been especially good in his career against Boston College he is a 48 threepoint shooter lifetime against these guys its best of any team hes played the ACC a hunter going back to the free throw line so Madson hit one like you see wi see hands are down you see theyre below theyre giving too much air space and its too late to try to get up there to contest that too late and then you see Gerard gets Zachary up in the air and then thats just L like a a free you know horse shot that that youre allowing one of the best Shooters in the country to get from right from the top of the key M Lockton is fouled out by the way done for the rest of the day with Five Points five fouls and Hunter in and out in the first Boston College is going to be just fine when they get their team healthy and get back you know getting through the stomach bug here but let me just tell you this Connor to win games you got to you got to have some luck involved in staying healthy whether it is through like a flu a stomach bug another or an injury or whatever it may be staying healthy is part of being a good basketball team thats part of it especially in college basketball a big belief in what Earl Grant did last year a three win Improvement overall they won three more ACC games he got an extension through the 28 29 season just year three theyre going to get an all ACC level player back in Quinton post when hes feeling better and Harris plus the foul that counts and hell go to the line for one more really good curl they tight curled that on their motion offense right there and you can see here in a tight curl and Clemson was trailing on it and then shefflin was just too late and they were able to get the y one and heres Harris for chance for a threepoint play Harris is a real Dynamic scorer transfer from Charleston Southern hes been he he gives him a different look offensively he can do some things that maybe some other guards at Boston College can on be able to create his own shot and when him and post are on the game together they make a really great combination between those two yeah the the threepoint shooting really stands out for Harris right but his scoring is split right down the middle its half and half he he knows how toins he can find ways to score he can shoot he can he can he can do it off the bounce Gerard left open to the rim but you can see with Outpost in there and and and they just dont have the size the the the the the the Fear Factor of having that guy there in the middle to not allow you to have a straight line drive cuz thats not something that Gerard does is driv and untouched to the rim youre going to have big guys there thats the biggest Miss of not having post besides the offensive part just his ability to chop blck and create a presence in that paint and Gerard bags another three on a day where he moved into fourth place in the ACC he adds one more and he is back on the right track shooting it timeout Boston College by the way Im hung up on your Fear Factor reference

not playing on that matchup that was gross yeah that was a bad decision by Matson to try to go at Hall on that but they gave it right back Harris working the break Zachary 3 and he lines it up I really like Zachary man hes tough he was he was under recruited wasnt highly recruited great find by coach Grant and his staff really good basketball player knows how to play hes tough hes a winner hardnosed guy hes a competitor big fan of Zachary he just kept Boston College hot theyve made seven out of their last eight field goals they try to close the single digits before the two and 1 half minute Mark and Gerards not letting them get any closer with the midrange shot theyre just you can tell theyre just kind of down right now Boston College and Gerard again the pressure theyre counting on him from threepoint range is now allow him to get into that midrange game or to the rim and making some twos I I think he secured our player of the game interview oh theres no doubt about what you ask hes been outstanding I got some questions I got to come up with him I mean hes oh youre still coming up with Im Im formulating in my mind Im not Im not an expert like you at this yet Im still learning on this Conor Harris with the big stuff youre youre youre a pro now when youre asking about whos a pro youre a pro no the uh the balloon wand that we saw thats that was a pro pro move from
