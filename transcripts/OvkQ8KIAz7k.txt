Marcus Burton who is a freshman from just outside South Bend at Mishawaka Indiana Jeff Pond the one of the umpires with Anthony eats Doug Shas the referee and noted Ames got the ball first here the Irish have lost four their last five including a difficult overtime lost to Georgetown here in South Ben on Saturday afternoon 7268 citel not played since last Thursday night they lost at the College of Charleston by 15 points and Ed Conroy returned to Charleston theyre headed to their holiday break after the game tonight theres a drive and score for Tay Davis to get noted aim on the board and a quick look at the Bulldog lineup Madison dur is a sophomore to keep an eye on a 64 guard and a notre a transfer an interesting story tonight for our game with Elijah Morgans return to South B thats Morgan handling the ball for the buldog this is Winston Hill another grad transfer at Conroy starts three of them in this lineup and on call theres malora Brown that put the Bulldogs on the board cadel is the team West that really looks to push the ball inside much more so than Notre Dame excellent pass that time by Winston Hill Davis heres Burton the young freshman bouline jumper and slapped out by Kev ji and Notre Ds got a fresh 20 Music Applause manto Applause man kzne trying to get to the basket cant J the recovery and hes fouled on the play so Kevin Jai going to get a couple of free throws here and its on Winston Hill itll be his first and its number one on the Bulldogs of the Citadel and Kevin J played at Penn State a year ago as you get a look at Ed Conroy who has returned to Charleston as the Citadel head coach he was there from 0610 and has come back now as J misses the first free throw Conroy played for Les Robinson at the Citadel had a interesting coaching journey in the late 80s of course and Les Robinson of course is a familiar figure in the ACC at NC State in the Music 90s and Ja hit the back in so its an early 32 lead for the Irish not Dame starts in the manto man as well and theyve been really good defensively this year number five in the ACC and points allowed and Elijah Morgan had the ball and a whistle off the ball be on kesn Jr kesn his first and the first against Micah Shrewsberry who Dan you see where hes building his butter or building his team at least early here is what hes going to do defensively well they had they basically as we said they returned no offense so theyve got young players and you got to start somewhere and if you can guard people then thatll keep you in every game then you just got to punch in a couple of baskets AJ Smith handling the ball five to shoot for the Bulldogs heres Morgan into traffic with two one Smith has to launch and it is off the mark and a shot clock violation and thats a win for Shrewsberry team and thats exactly what he wants to see you know they he did a really nice job building at Penn State and at Penn State you know his teams emphasize shooting the three and running up and down and not quite so much here they have to have a much stronger defensive focus into the corner theres coach Shrewsberry son Braden touching it hes in the line of tonight because Julian rooper is sidelined with some foot soreness here for tonights contest against the CIT Burton and here is Braden Shrewsberry trying to get through on the Baseline off balance shot another shot clock violation weve had one in each of the last possessions by the respective schools thats a look at Logan IMS whos not going to play tonight either along with Roper theyre both out of the lineup IMS is got a bit of a shoulder injury there keeping an eye on a grad transfer a junior transfer from Northwestern and without those two guys Notre Dame becomes very very thin and a ballway basket for AJ Smith leading score for the Citadel at almost 17 a game is the 64 sophomore who puts them in front for the first time now Smith is a big physical guard who can really score hes going to be a very difficult match up and Burton went to the floor on the dribble got got held up by double team and alternating possessions going to send this to the Citadel and Burton has been a little bit turnover prone early in his college career and thats not a great surprise this is a guy who in high school pretty much could do whatever he wanted to do and hes still learning how to play at this level back toback turnovers by the Irish heres White or Smith rather on the drive and he will feed malora Brown and Quinton malora Browns got a couple of quick baskets and the Citadel doubled the number on Notre Dame here in the first three and a half minutes and down goes AJ Smith and were going to have an injury time out Music here Wes I did not see what happened he could have gotten tangled up with Shrewsberry in the lane there but boy he went down and you can hear him hes in some pain and the teams are going to go to their respective benches and were going to take a break theyre going to tend to AJ Smith cital with an early threepoint lead in South B with Duracell holiday mat ACC basketball is brought to you by Jersey Mike Subs be a sub above and a look at the career of Elijah Morgan who finished up here at Notre Dame and now has transferred to play the extra year for the Citadel and hes in the lineup tonight the grad transfer who had 28 career games in South B as a walkon the interesting story we found out the association with Morgan and Notre Dame is one thing but Ed Conroy kind of started the whole process for Elijah Morgans post Prep basketball career theres a block by malora Brown on the threepoint offer by 610 Carrie Booth whos come in the ball game during the timeout Citadel switches to a zone defense a one two2 zone and we talked about malora Brown he does an awful lot of things down on the interior for the bull and a foul called on the drive and looks like T Davis will keep the possession going from Notre Dame the foul is on dur Madison dur soft from Atlanta his first thats the second on the Bulldogs who lead by three here four minutes in who switch switch back to manto man and theres Marcus Burton in traffic and it just bounced out L Brown clears and and heres the Citadel on the run with dur skip pass across the floor and now Mal Brown tried to feed the cutter thats Keenan Davis in traffic forced it up and the rebound pulled away and thats Carri Bo Music fzn mismatch out front m brown trying to stop Burton and he did yep and kesn with Baseline lost the handle on it and another H ball Dan our second almost 5 minutes of play well go to Notre name here and West just before went to break AJ Smith the leading scorer for the SE sticks that left arm out to try to slow down Brandon Shrewsberry as he goes back door and he already had a some tape on that left shoulder they took him back in the back and they were working on that left shoulder and hes now out on the bench again you can see hes got more tape on that left shoulder see if hes able to come back three ball kesn good 11th triple of the year for the red shirt sophomore from South B were tied at six now on Jr kzns first basket of the ball game m brown for the call working on keev trying to help they feed the lane that got blocked on the drive and shot by dur good help defense by noted a here Dan yeah really Wes but you got to be careful when you double team Brown because he is a pass first guy he is looking to pass the ball that time though the rotation was really good he tried to pass it and he knocked it out of bound Davis have put it in play dur Winston Hill for three from kept it alive for Tay Davis and ahead boo had it knocked away from behind by Morgan turned over by the Irish thatll be noted As third turnover and a backourt foul on the freshman at 610 Carrie Booth from outside of Denver at Englewood Colorado its the second on noted aame in this first half all Morgan did was look behind him and Booth coming up and stopped and Booth ran right up his back thats the Wy old veteran catching the Freshman six all and noted a has turned it over three times already here Morgan lost the handle on it and Sona whos coming into the ball game goes to the deck against malora Brown another hell ball our thir like the five trips down the floor Dan W if this was the old days wed be having jump balls all the time yeah exactly right third weve had here early dur on the inbounds Morgan to three good right in front of the Notre Dame bench for Elijah Morgan is 28th of the year coming on off 16 at College of Charleston last Thursday night threepoint lead again for the bulld balls and hes one of the better percentage threo Shooters as well webs theyll get him as many of those as they can in traffic heres Sona cant finish they battle inside Matt will run it down in the corner Burt and a standing three got it Marcus Bert just his ninth three of the Year Dan he comes in shooting 20 from out there and thats a funny looking little shot but watching him on tape when he gets that much time and room hes not bad from out there on the Drive Madison dur pushes the Bulldogs back in front and dur is a guy who likes to take the ball to the basket and hes not a great threepoint shooter Notre Dame needs to work hard to keep him in front not let him into the lane Music Burton on the attack tried to bounce it down to Zona taking away Mal Brown another noted aim turnover be there Music fourth malora Brown cutting through scores hes got a half dozen thats just the Notre Dame defense wasnt ready and malora brown just goes straight to the Applause goal heres Burton pesnia hanger in the lane and the rebound pulled away and thats Cam Roberts a 66 freshman whos com in wearing number five for the Bulldog Davis is three bounds away Davis is only a 25 threepoint shooter dont know that thats the one you wanted in that situation Sona had a three Rim out three Subs table for the citel and one for Notre Dame Dan back and forth we go yeah Notre Dames problem at West is they just have had a tough time scoring this year Iris only have three field goals in the first8 minutes of the ball game and thats going to get us to a timeout fourpoint lead for the Citadel first half action from South B K at Conroy trying to join a list of Southern Conference schools to pull upsets on the road at Power five venues this season alone Dan CH ner beat Louisville obviously Western Carolina beat Notre Dame UNCG got Arkansas at Bud Walton that might be the Marquee of the three so far for the Music soan sohans a good good league and you know Chattanooga and UNCG in particular they will contend for the title in the socon and there is AJ Smith seems like hes okay easy for me to say from here but you know hes I we said hes their leading scorer hes a very Dynamic player really good for the Citadel to have him back yep Davis on the drive and well get a whistle and a foul and of course Smith returning hes their leading scorer sixth best in the Southern Conference coming into tonight at almost 17 a game and you see the threepoint number in particular but theres only 14 makes in 11 ball games so its not a volume as much as it is just quality for Smith back door cut and blocked out of there kzne on the layup attempt of Cam Roberts quickly inside the catch and score for Kev Jai hes got three thats just his seventh field goal of the Year Dan well kevi and Matt Zona are not really integral parts of the offense but if G will run the Court like that they can find him in transition they dont run any plays for him hes got to make his own opportunities long three out front bounds away Shrewsberry runs it down and the Irish trying to pick it up in transition heres a lead Jai again whip it around the perimeter and kesn down the lane drew the contact missed the shot CH the rebound and that rattles out pzn a third third try is there a fourth of the Irish it got pulled out of there and finally kesn dribbles out for a new shot clock Burton thought about the Applause three noted Ames got seven offensive rebounds Burton now with four to shoot heres pesn all the way down the lane hell draw the foul like the second third and fourth efforts on behalf of Notre Dame on that drive Music kesn does a really nice job coming over at 6 7 hes more athletic than you think and this is J just running the court we said they dont really look for him inside but if hes going to run and hes going to be ahead of the pack then Burtons smart enough to get him the ball cam Roberts the foul heres JR kesn whos 88 at the line and the free throw is good hes now got four dont forget we got a Friday night Ms double headers starts at 600 Eastern from Little John Coliseum PJ Hall and the Tigers hosting Queens out of the Aon at 600 Eastern and then Notre Dame welcomes Marist here at the purcel Pavilion at the joy Center solid double header for you Friday night on acc Network and always available on the esdn app couple of free throws for kesn give him five not to a makes a substitution off the conversion and you see Tay Davis back on the floor also Carri Booth is returned for Coach Shrewsberry clock thats Smith on the drive and the rebound pulled away by booth and thats what Notre Dame wants to get they want to force the Citadel into contested twopoint shots boo a three how about Carri Boos 123 of the year in his first points tonight Applause seven straight by the Irish in the last 90 seconds theyve gone from four down to three up in South B halfway through the Music first hey its me your skin some cleansers get us clean but take my moisture Im craving a balanced clean with cavey cavey cleansers developed with dermatologists help me maintain my moisture balance with hyaluronic acid known to attract moisture plus three essential ceramides to help restore my natural barrier with cavey cleansing can be about giving not just taking so we can be a healthy feeling clean cavey clean cavey cleansers from the number one dermatologist recommended skinc care Music brand well with Dan boner West Durham and Notre Dame on a 7 nothing run nice play here from Burton back to Booth Dan well and the thing is Notre Dame isnt really looking to throw the ball inside and what happened for the Citadel is Winston Hill went down inside the cover and that allowed Booth to drift outside and Booth hes a tall guy West but over 60 of his field goal attempts are threes thats what he wants to do he wants to step out and shoot the three you know the interesting part here um Notre Dames done this Dan hitting just five field goals in 18 tries and theyve made this 70 run while the cital hits their first field goal and their last five on the dunk by malora Brown who leads everybody with eight here in the first there a good response by Notre Dame they went more than four minutes without a field goal but a really good response knocking down to three and it really started with what did they get like six offensive rebounds in one possession that seemed to energize him heres Braden Shrewsberry young freshman son of the coach whos been quiet so far left that on the the front rim and here are the Bulldogs to within one Shrewsberry is looking to shoot the three so right at this point in his development you got to run him off that threepoint line and the Citadel did bounce pass back on the perimeter this is Winston Hill dur and now AJ Smith who is completely recovered from a little shoulder bump in the opening couple of minutes of our ball game tonight malora brown with three to shoot a triple away and good wow Quint malore Brown now with 11 just his third three of the year now hes got the reputation West that he can shoot it from out there and youre right its only his ninth attempt of the year he had a lot of time and a lot of space yep five straight double dips now for malora brown with tener more Booth to Burton Davis trying to get all the way to the basket and hes going to draw the foul so five straight from malora Brown has pushed the Bulldogs back in front Dan heres the first of the five well hes a guy thats looking to pass the ball West but hes done a nice job rolling into the lane and finding the open spot and then when you get off of him and thats what you know J just plays a little bit too far away gives him too much time and I think Im okay with that you know hes not a great threepoint shooter F was on Hill a moment ago his second here swth Bears three and the long rebound for dur sophomore from Atlanta runs it in the front court and a Trav is called by Doug sha so the Bulldogs turn it over for just the second time in this first Applause half and the SEL operating with a twopoint lead Music here Music kesn thought about an entry pass for ji who resets to the other side against Mur Brown an offensive foul called down on keevi here his first now not Dame has gone more to J in the low post for your traditional back to the basket uh theyve gone more to him in that situation and Ive seen in most of their games and you know this is just a situation where nobodys coming to double team and he just lowers that shoulder five turnovers now five field goals and for the Irish Ive got him with three team fouls or four Becky paron theres one on Burton one on kesn ji and boo a four turn so theyre going to step aside here we got a little bit of game management to 10 two twopoint lead for the C finds themselves down two and you see a moment ago the clock just stops there you go shot clock as well we played all the way through they were able to kind of do the math on this remember they didnt realize it until the J foul had been committed right there so they work through the stop watches yep they went over and did they went over West they looked at the replay they counted the Mississippi and they decided that it was Music 754 Im not sure Im not sure the schoolyard approach was the exact science that went into play here well West when the clock runs that long Im not sure there is an exact sign no I think youre right theres a driving score by Madison dur what crafty sophomore guard it was all freshman a year ago in the Southern Conference averaged seven points three rebound BS two assist play and theres kesn again getting the field goal and the foul Jr kesn who Red Shed a year ago and whated up bring Mike Brays final season has come back with a little bit of Vengeance and a interesting thing about about kesn W he drives the ball to the basket and last year cam Roberts whos underneath the basket would have tried to take in charge but with the rule change this year Roberts goes for the block shot and the result is a foul and five fouls on the Citadel and the First on AJ Smith kesn now has got eight in the ball game hes three for three from the line the Irish to within one as dur operates the offense for Coach Conroy and 3 seconds to call from Jeff Pon off the Baseline but was it 3 seconds or did they say dur ran out of bounds and came back in and got the ball might have been it yeah Applause Music Music Applause here is Davis on the drive strong take couldnt finish Tay got his own rebound but hes surrounded at the Baseline Burton a standing three and tapped around and finally m brown for the bull ball a lot of work for not on the part of Notre Dame on the offensive boards here is Morgan back out front and AJ Smith to work skip out Roberts tried to get Baseline nicely done by Shrewsberry four to shoot Elijah Morgan launches Miss pair of Threes for Morgan lead is four for the Bulldogs SC and scor kesi and we have seen K do that at least three times West yep hes got double figures Dan four times in the last six games for JR Applause KES but the Irish to within just two after the Morgan triple now malora brown and the rebound for Burke relatively quiet first half scoring wise for Marcus Burton who will go to the basket and score five Burton he averages almost 16 a game the long Miss on the three sometimes is like a turnover you get the rebound you get down the court its a good transition opportunity and Burton takes it all the way to the basket Morgan backs out into the corner hell fire again in Applause hit to the Notre bench sure Applause is senal back by three on Elijah Morgan second Music three of three in this first half hes got n 11 from the brown thats 20 of 26 and Davis left the layup Applause short and heres Durr with the Bulldogs got to be feeling pretty good theyve hit five of their last six on the Music floor Smith Morgan tees up another one and KES need the rebound MRE Dame has struggled to score Wes but theyve done a nice job keeping the Citadel out of the lane on defense kesn tried to slip Baseline fall away is good nice first half for JR kesn Dan and hes done it basically Wes off the dribble hes beaten people off the dribble gone all the way to the basket that time with a little pullup jump shot hes got a dozen the Irish are within one under four we go and this first Applause half Lora Brown shb tried to help momentarily with a double out front again a three and now the Irish can take the lead and Burton in Music charge Davis Tay Davis rounding into the lane and revers is up and it fell off the rim cant argue the look man no but hes missed a couple of those West if hes going to get it in there at 69 hes really got to convert and now with 308 to play here is dur trying to sneak into traffic that ball got deflected I think from Davis Jai is also in traffic now turned over and heres kesn down the lane scores and draws the foul terrific transition bucket for KES and the Irish what a half Jr kzns got really lifting noted aame that time off the Miss Irish in front when we come back the love that goes into a Subaru comes out when Subaru and our retailers share the love 116000 animals supported 3300 wishes granted 43 million meals provided and over 400 national parks protected be a part of something bigger get a new Subaru during the share the love event and Subaru and our retailers will donate 300 to Sons but here tonight in what you might call a homecoming game Dan hes trying to ruin run the flow competition shooting threes I guess won you said hes a graduate transfer there you get a look his career at Notre name and what hes done tonight you said a graduate transfer now the Citadel is a state military school but grad transfers get this now they dont have to participate in any of the military stuff they go to class at night so they dont even participate with the cadets activity they live in offcampus apartments and thats in Charleston South Carolina thats a pretty good deal if youre trying to get a graduate degree and you get a degree you know in NBA theres a lot of graduate degrees you sit C unlike a place like VMI who just has undergraduates they have graduate programs here is uh the drive at score and Madison dur has got six in this first half and the Citadel back in front after kesn missed the opportunity at the threepoint trip a moment ago fifth time the lead has changed Zona handling out on the perimeter pzn look to booth now back to Jr Zona trying to set things here with four to shoot KES thought about it long two and the rebound is pulled away and that is Levi burkholz whos come on the floor hes a 63 freshman from Lake Mills Wisconsin and I think this is uh theres a three ball from dur hes now got nine in this first half Ed Conroy knows hes got some Midwest guys on his roster heres a drive and score by Marcus Burton whos now got seven in the first half Conroy mentioned it to us in our visit today hes put Burk hols on the floor because the young man is playing for the eighth time as a freshman and hes from the state of Wisconsin hes got people at the game tonight thats a its a heck of a gesture by Ed Conroy Dan well that I I agree with you Wes but hes also trying to find somebody who can guard kesn and so bur Burk hols is going to get the opportunity to do it now and Ed Conroys got guys from Chicago Davis hes got pigram Marcus Pams also on this roster hes got uh mention Burk hols from Wisconsin and I think we may have had another clock snap West y so with 91 seconds left theyre going to go over and check on the clock and well remind you that tomorrow tomorrow night after the football Signing Day special stay with ACC Network our womens basketball game of the week features Kiki Jefferson number 19 Louisville hosting Washington at the KFC y center coverage starts at 7 Eastern right here on acc network streaming live on the ESPN app and Jeff Pon and Doug shz are over Music ah so its not a clock issue so we got the technology has got but it is technology youre right Wes that the officials they have a system thats battery powered where theyre B they have battery packs where when they blow the whistle that stops the clock and one of the battery packs fail so its a semi clock issue yep so 89 seconds to go in this first half twopoint lead Citadel and the basketball for Conroy Bulldogs here is Burk Holtz dur kick out and a three ball by Davis and the rebound pulled away by Tay Davis of Notre he tries to find a track kick for pesni booth launches and it bounds the way to the Applause Citadel Bulldogs have played BC and NC State already out of the ACC and help tough on the Drive Morgan is fouled and pesni will go to the the foul will be on kesn itll be his second and its the fifth by my count on the Irish here Dan with 42 seconds to go and that that was just a question of Morgan just forcing his way in that wasnt bad defense mhm cital really trying hard to get the ball into the lane and for the most part Notre Dame has kept him out of there Morgan knocks the free throw down hes got double figures for the eighth time in the last nine games and the Bulldogs who are 72 free throw shooting team going to the line for the first time Elijah Morgan Had 17 in the loss to Boston College hes had 16 in two other games through the first 11 for citel and missed the second there so hes got 10 here at the break malora Browns got 11 dur got nine the only other basket belongs to AJ Smith then thats it three balls Shrewsberry and Morgans got it with 26 seconds to go and the shot clock is off at the end of this first half so Bulldogs can play for the last shot of the frame the Bulldogs went to a zone defense on that last possession Wes and not Dame actually got a pretty good shot here is Durr and lost the handle on it saves it Davis a three long rebound Iona and theres the horn but the Citadel shoots 48 from the floor hit five threes and despite being outrebounded 224 rides the hot hand of Quinton malora Brown Elijah Morgan and Madison dur who have accounted for 30 of their 32 halftime coming up next full percentage they ranked 334th in the country in scoring and so this is at this point in time this is not a very good offensive Notre Dame team but theyve been tremendous on defense and michah Shrewsberry is just hoping that they they pass the ball a little better they get better shots original starters out there for Notre Dame as they are for the Citadel who leads by Applause three inside this is kevi with the right hand and Davis was fouled on the Play I Believe by Winston Hill Presbyterian transfer from outside Columbia South Carolina at hermo third foul on Hill is the first on the Bulldogs Music and Hill gets 17 seconds of action and now hell move out of the lineup and cam Roberts a 66 freshman from South Boston Virginia returns after playing 10 minutes in the first half heres brayen Shrewsberry a wide open three and that goes bounding away and thats one thing his dad was talking to us about earlier today the ability to hit the open shot the catch and shoot the 10 to 15 catch and shoot shots youre going to get in every Ball Game and his clubs not been able to cash in on many of those here Applause tonight kicked out by Roberts and turned over here is Burton at Full Tilt and the tap follow is good kesma of course 16 now for Jr that is offensive rebound number 11 in this game for Notre Dame and were going to get a whistle and foul off the ball on Marcus Burt Ed Conroy whos a good rebounding team but noted As been the Challenger tonight at that at that particular Music distance and a onepoint lead for his team but the foul on Burton gives the Citadel a new 20 and the faceline jump shot no good for Smith last Touch by the Bulldogs its interesting Wes each of these teams has a significant scorer who hasnt really done very much today its AJ Smith for the Citadel and its Braden Shrewsberry for not a those if either one of those two guys could get going it would really help their team yeah Shrewsberry averages eight inside Music kesn now back to ji on the post over m brown it rolls in for kevi and the Irish in front and again that is not something that Notre Dame does a lot of but ji he can be confident hes going to get a oneonone cuz theyre not coming to double team him six lead change of our ball game malora Brown heres Burk Holz whos back on the floor entry pass from dur to malora Brown and now turned over by the Bulldogs Shrewsberry ahead for Burton and the layup good and a timeout coming for Ed Conroy Notre Dame is doing it with defense Applause couple of well noted AES hit their last three shots and Dan that helps amplify the good job theyve done rebounding tonight because they came in 10th in the ACC in rebound margin but theyve been every bit the equal of the second best rebounding margin team in the Southern Conference thats the CIT and Ed conro said look were big we we should be a good rebounding team and Notre AES challenged every one of them tonight boy they sure have and Ed Conroy told us this morning that he felt like the their size was going to be an important positive factor but hadnt been so far out of the timeout following the Irish run to put him up three Elijah Morgan trying to find some help here Davis kicks it away dur trying to fight through Jos shot down the Baseline nicely and now four to shoot and thats a fallway that missed everything and dur got the rebound a quick stick back rattles Applause out he had to gun it up because the shot clock was winding down Dan be hard to find a better defensive possession than that I mean they were outstanding were the Irish they just kept them out of the lane Burton looking for help inside hell turn it over to Davis there just not a lot of room inside to pass the ball heres malora Brown to work against kevi and hell get the foul and shoot a pair of free throw second on ji the sophomore transfer from Penn State who is from Centerville Ohio its the first of the half on the Music IR and I think malora Brown needs to do more of that hes much too willing to pass the ball in there first first free throw is good a dozen now for brown dont forget tomorrows national Signing Day in college football we got you covered on acc Network and the ESPN app the annual special breaking down all the football recruiting takes you through each school with highlights and evaluation starts at 3 Eastern and continues with ACC pm at 4 right here on acc network streaming live on the ESPN app 13 for Quenton malora Brown 23yearold Brad transfer from Vanderbilt originally started his career at Rice heres Shrewsberry out front long three kesn battle for the loose ball out of there come the Bulldogs and AJ Smith trying to go to the rim follow wouldnt go and Davis a ripping Run for the Irish and Burton trying to lead the way and he was stepping out of bounds when the ball got knocked loose and he recovered and thatll send it to the Music city lot of activity very little result right at the moment the Citadel has not made a field goal in the last 5 minutes and 30 seconds and Notre Dame has missed their last six threepoint attempts and it leads you to a onepoint difference 340 into this second Music half Lura brown little ball screen here for K skip it over to the corner AJ Smith tried to get going and a whistling Music foul itll be on tay Davis itll be his first second on the Irish that still pretty good defense by Notre Dame The Citadel is looking to get the ball inside and when they do kick it out the Irish are there on the catch a foul that time but that was still pretty good scrambling around on Music defense into the corner heres Morgan hell get a screen for a three and now Elijah Morgan knocks another one down hes got four threes in the game for his 13 points and after missing their last seven the S goes back in front and Burton travels trying to get to the basket and thatll get us to a break on the Notre Dame turnover twopoint lead for The Bu transfer from Notre Dame former walkon for the Irish one of three transfers in the lineup tonight for Ed Conroy Winston Hill originally started Francis Maran he then went to Presbyterian now on to Charleston Quint malora Brown originally at rice and then Vanderbilt hes a three School guy too now finishing up at Citadel and uh Hill hasnt scored played a lot of minutes malora Brown and Morgan have been terrific for the citel whos got a twopoint lead as we rejoin you from South B theres an offensive foul on theora Brown for the screen be his first and two now on the Bulldogs in second Music half third turnover against the Citadel here in the second half Dan gives him seven in the ball game its sort of been a theme for each team West they seem to get roll a little bit then they turn it over and here is a breakaway on a steal by Elijah Morgan hes got 15 now on the ball game at 17 at Boston College and now hes pushed the Bulldogs advantage to Music four seven straight from the Military College of South Carolina B and move it around the top Davis squares front rim Miss kesn and hes fouled on the play by Elijah Morgan El its his first and the Third on citel and another offensive rebound that I think yeah turnover is probably going to be charged to Morgan but kesn just left the ball out there sh to Burton Burton will probably be charged with the turnover but just put it right in Morins hands d k and heres another one and a pull up three in transition in the front r Miss for Elijah Music Applause Mor Kevin ji working foul line area Burton against that zone look and a three by kesn and the rebound pulled away and AJ Smith trying to get transition chances here for the cinn dur bounces out and this is Davis for three too long and too strong in the rebound pulled away by Carri boo well Davis has now missed five of those West but he is undeterred heres Burton to pull up and KES get the Irish a second chance yep backing down and cant finish and M Brown the rebound and theres a foul from behind I think on Kevin Ji number 14 thatll be his third thats the third on the Irish and substitutions Around the Horn as Davis leaves the floor for the Irish and Par Shrewsberry has reported back see Kevin Jai has also checked out heres point back in the game two and I think thats because they need somebody to block out KES yep Elijah Morgans over on that bench now this is Robert or Marcus Pam has come on the floor wearing zero for the Bulldogs tough shot in traffic and thats AJ Smith largest lead of the night now for the Bulldogs on the second field goal to the night for the softball from Charlotte and weve said a couple times Smith is a big strong guard those are the kind of shots he can make kesn has just tied his career high Dan hes got 18 tonight for Notre Dame 18 37 no matter who Citadel has put in they have had no answer for KES he has used his quickness and his size to really good effect this evening on the drive Smith and a bucket four in a row for AJ Smith thats good news for the Bulldogs as their leading score is getting hot back to a sixpoint Advantage Zona onto the floor here is Burton and cant finish with the jump shot Zona tried to rip it away from dur and heres Madison dur trying to go rim to rim and will draw the Notre Dame foul sophomore from Atlanta trying to energize Conroy team whos built a lead of six here Dan and well theyve done it on the back of AJ Smith uh this is a guy who can really get to the basket he hurt the shoulder hes hurt his left shoulder early in the game dont know whether it has anything to do or not with his inability to be as effective offensively so far as he normally is but hes made a couple of baskets recently and thats does seem to have energized the C down so Burton committed his third foul and you saw Smith knocked down the free throw his first of the night hes the seventh best free throw shooter in the Southern Conference coming in and another one for dur and it is a 132 run Madison dur now with a 11 those are his first points of the second half Citadel with a very small lineup back in the game is dropped back into his Zone Sona inside Davis couldnt finish draws the foul foul is going to be on dur I believe and four now in the Citadel free throws when we come back to South Bend the Bulldogs with their largest lead of the Applause Music night with an eightpoint lead on the Irish this is their third game against the ACC this year losing early on opening night in Raleigh 7259 to NC State and then a pretty tight contest down a few days later at Chestnut Hill 7571 to Boston Music College and here tonight in South Den where theyve got an eightpoint lead the free throw by Tay Davis bounds away least they his first attempts of the night hes a 69 free throw shooter on the year and Ed Conroy playing around with his lineup here a little bit trying to get malora brown some rest so going with Hill in that five or Center position and surrounding him with guards Hill I said Chesnut Hill Dan that BC game was actually at mallister fieldhouse in Charleston so wow you ever been there yeah heck of a building yeah it is itd be a hard place for a visiting team to come in and play yep sure would inside here is Music dur eightpoint game Madison dur trying to find some space I think Davis got a piece of that and finally collects the Miss but Davis is 69 and dur is only 64 its hard to B its hard to post him up theres a foul on Shrewsberry off the ball oh no Tay Davis off the ball his second four on the Irish and you you see Alex Wade now on the floor for Notre Dame a sophomore who was awarded a scholarship in August had two points in the loss of Marquette hes coming on the floor now to see if he can provide a bit of a lift jump shot no good for the Bulldogs again we mentioned Notre Dame with two of their regulars out so theyre a little bit thin they need some help and Wade has only played 8 minutes all year prior to this game yep just his fourth Game of the Year booth on the bounce pass heres J step back and Miss pulled away on the back side side Smith and Roberts trying to get things Square pigram rather trying to get things Square offensively pigram Baseline back out front here is Morgan step back three off the window for Elijah morg Music wow West theres nothing you can theres nothing you can do about that if you nurre Dame that was really good defense they kept him out the lane and my Heavens you know what you do is you force a tough contested three that he banks in Music WoW Music Laughter well Elijah Morgans caught fire tonight he continues to bomb away from distance five for seven from behind the line Dan hes got 18 points and and the Bulldogs have their largest lead of the night at 11 now and again that last sequence was not a bad defensive sequence by Notre Dame I mean that shot banked in it was a contest to three the the problem the Irish have had tonight is here we three quars of the way through this game and they only have 37 points Yep theyre one of their last eight its a 162 run Shrewsberry trying to break it cannot rebound mour Brown of the citel West defense will keep you in the game but if youre going to win eventually you got to put the ball in the basket and Notre Dame just hasnt been able to do that with any frequency at all tonight the only six points in the first 10 and 1 half minutes of the second half for these Irish malora Brown working on Zona Davis on the drive blocked by Zona out of there Shrewsberry and noted a in transition and B cant finish the layup other way comes Smith and AJ Smith gets the n Music one boy that is a big turnaround right there Notre Dame misses one they should have had and then Smith we talked about his strength as a guard he takes the contact and still is able to bustle his way in you miss a layup on one end you give up a layup on the other thats can be a back breaker fifth foul on Notre Music Dame and here is or no eight foul on Notre Dame I should say and here is Smith to add the and one my goodness seven and the half nine in the ball game for AJ Smith they leading score at 16 and half a game four fouls on Marcus Burton and the lead has increased for the citel 192 run for Conroys team heres Burton three ball from the perimeter by Tony Sanders Jr pounds away Sanders Jr playing for just the third time this Applause year in his 29th career game tonight Dan Im not sure Notre Dame recognized the fact that the C all drop back into a Zone again got to be careful sometimes that Zone and they look like open shots but theyre just a couple of steps further than you want to be three ball from out on the left too strong rebound for Shrewsberry hes got Booth kesn Burton playing with four now brayen all the way to the basket will draw the Applause foul foul is on Quinton balora Brown thats a good job by Shrewsberry to drive the ball to the basket West he is 0 for seven from the field 0 for five from three so its a good idea to try to get to the line here is Braden at the line first point is good quick reminder to you ACC PM staple program with Mark Packer and Taylor tanon bomb comes up at 400 Eastern theyll continue talking college football the latest from around the conference terrific guest and conversation right here on ACC Network and the ESPN app two free throws for Shrewsberry those are his first points of the night and that equals 39 that equals his free throw total for the entire season West sh is a guy who likes to stand outside and snipe so he do get to the line much down low power move inside it was Hill that couldnt finish in last Touch by the Bulldogs Hill has yet to score tonight West yep came in the ball game by my notes Here 6 points four rebounds in their last two games that was his average and just six of his last 15 from the floor hes only taking three shots tonight Shrewsberry a deep three and looked like Boo couldnt quite flag it down and on the drive a and a bucket for AJ Smith boy that was some rebound and then he just took off and nobody stopped him yep Coast to Coast move for Smith 11 now in the ball game nine in this second half and here the Bulldogs again in transition and this is the layup for Madison dur and a timeout for Notre Dame 16point Advantage for the Citadel and the Bulldogs getting an overdrive first a terrific move by Smith and then a moment to go here is Madison dur at The Music Applause Rim well Ed Conroy knows what its like to coach in this league and assistant with Les Robinson at NC State those teams in the 90s hes got terrific performance tonight Madison dur is a terrific sophomore guard Elijah Morgan quote unquote homecoming game Dan after being a Notre Dame WalkOns got 18 thats a career high for him 13 for Durr malora Browns been terrific 11 for AJ Smith hes been electric here in the second Music half and well you dont need a lot of guys to score if four guys score enough yeah those four guys right there got more than noted aim him meanwhile Micah Shrewsberry has gone and gotten Raheem braen a uh walk on and there is Carrie Booth with a nice turn and score at the high post so thats just the second field goal in the last 10 and2 minutes for Notre Dame and Alex Wades on the floor thats one of the uh hes not technically one of the five WalkOns because he was awarded a scholarship last August the young sophomore from San Diego but hes on the floor with kesn Bron booth and Marcus Burton and down 14 now with seven minutes to go Dan well I think Michel shrewbury is just looking for some kind of a spark he said were building this thing through defense and they may need some of that and maybe be couple more Scoops along the way and we get a travel there or not a travel on Notre day or travel on the citel bringing the ball front Court turned over by Elijah Morgan the noted Ain pressure having an effect now now lets see if they can convert on this end booth for Burton launching away back rim Miss kesn trying to reach in and tie up m brown round instead its pulled away noted Ames missed their last 12 shots from behind the line and thats a situation Im not sure that thats a good shot that time by Burton he is not a good threepoint shooter and they they had something going they needed to take the ball to the basket Irish are just three of their last 17 from three three of 17 tonight in the ball game theres malora Brown the right hand move is good first field goal for quent malora brown in the second half hes got 15 the lead is 16 now for the Bulldogs as we approach 6 minutes to Applause play and one and done is not to a and thats turned over by citel heres Burton and LA with the score Morgan going to be called for the block and Marcus Burtons first highlight of the night Dan Marcus Burton thats pretty impressive but kesn knocks the ball away and then Burton picks it up and he just flying to the basket and he makes a really nice move just at the last minute because Morgan was trying to get position established but what quickness with the ball in transition did Marcus Burton just show us 14point lead for the Citadel you say they got 20 points off the Notre Dame turnovers and the Irish missed the free throw theres six of 11 tonight at the line after the Miss there but heres that pressure again right at the Timeline cross the pass for Smith see Hill is back out there inside and Smith had it ripped away but Wade stepped out of bounds good hustle play by Alex Wade iish youre flying around the court at the moment and if youre a citadel this is hard to play against guys who are really really this Music aggressive and what do we have now foul off the Music Applause ball its on Raheem great senior from South Ben his first its nine on not Music Dame so one and one for braon or beg your pardon for Hill after the braon foul Winston Hills just 10 of 19 at the line this year first trip tonight looking for his first point and the free throw good dont forget Friday night double header starts at 600 Eastern PJ Hall and Clemson welcome Queens to the Little John Coliseum and then Notre Dame host the red foxes of Marist at 800 Friday night double header of mens Hoops on acc network streaming live on the ESPN app Hill got one of the two 15o lead kesn whos tied his career high of 18 tonight he had 18 early in the year against Auburn on the Drive Burton skips for kesn three ball away and Zona had a shot at the rebound and got saved by the citel go right back to Matt Zona heres Burton for three back rim Miss and a hustle play with Wade and hes going to be called for the foul reaching in on Madison Music dir foul on Wade will be his first and thats the 10th oh no they just not called out of bounds now he called they said the Wade knocked the ball away knocked the ball out of bounds thanks Dan its really tough to maintain such intense energy on the defensive end for very long unless you have some success on the other end theres kzns third so thats 10 now on Notre Dame with 5 minutes even to go so two shots the rest of the way for Citadel team that is 722 on the year but tonight is just seven of nine thats pretty percentage not many attempts but that is likely to change the way Notre Dame is trying to Pace this down 15 and the free throw for dur is Applause Music good you see that Terry Booth spells Alex Wade for the Irish Notre Dame playing without Julian roer and Logan eyes tonight second free throw good 6 in the half 15 in the ball game now for dur whos also got five rebounds to his credit lead is 17 for the Citadel three ball by kesn no good weson The Citadel has stayed in this zone for most of the second half and the result has been that Notre Dames ability to penetrate and get inside has been greatly reduced they have settled for the great Y and a foul on the in line and theres Logan and Julian roer both on the on the bench Music tonight one and one on the eighth foul against the citel W were talking about that zone enticing Notre Dame to shoot threes and the Irish have missed their last 15 threepoint attempts so the fouls on AJ Smith you see Mata looks like he needs a corner man and here is Marcus Burton at the line free throw good on the one and one for Burke looks like Nixon dilion the Notre Dame basketball trainers has gotten him all patched up at least with a piece of gauze and zono right back up there and ready to go when coach needs him second of the free throws for Burton whos now two of three at the line 13 in the ball game for the Music Freshman the lead is 15 with four and change to go and get a foul in front of the Citadel bench I believe on Wade that will be the sophomore from San Diegos first a year ago Wade played in five games just two in the a against the ACC and you see Elijah Morgan whos getting ready to go to the free throw line Elijah Morgan tonight and Ed Conroy was telling us today his sons played AA ball with Elijah Morgan in New Orleans when Conroy was the head coach at two lane and he got on the phone with Mike Bray and told Mike Bray about this guy who was going to come to school at noted Dame and Morgan ended up being a walkon for Brays team and here Elijah Morgan who finished is obviously his work he graduated what he tell us three years three and a half years three years graduated from Notre Dame and three years yes yeah and so Morgan was looking for a place and the tie with Ed Conroy who was returning to the Citadel to be their head coach and the grad school Dan you were talking about earlier perfect fit for Elijah Morgan and look what hes doing tonight heres Burton on the drive he got caught in traffic back for bra and out front again heres Burton now tend to shoot out of the Corner Zona three spins out brayon wants a chance cant fill it up and thats Rahe braon is only his second field goal attempt of the year and were going to get a turnover by Durr and the Bulldogs noted Ds going to have the ball but down 16 under four to go at South Music Applause Music B well Ed Conroy is not only the coach at the citel hes also coaching Cadets Dan and being the father of a uh young man that went to the Naval Academy you know the uh rigorous schedule and this is the Military College of South Carolina and its up at 530 and its on right well it is Wes except if youre one of those grad transfer you dont have to do this you go to class at night you live off campus you have a nice apartment youre in South Carolina and youre getting a pretty good graduate degree thats a heck of a deal to me yeah course I couldnt live in I couldnt live in Charleston Id weigh 6000 lb in a week Keenan Davidson some of these guys look at Boco Baseline hell draw the foul yeah I would say though that AJ Smith hes a guy thats in the cadc curriculum at the citel youve got Madison dur Keenan Davis mark P you know you got plenty of guys who were all buying for time out outside of those graduate transfers everybody on the Citadel roster is a freshman or sophomore yep so theyre all involved in that very rigorous military style schedule now I think you at 530 in the morning for physical training yeah good luck with that mhm carry boo missed the first missed the second 16point game and a backourt turnover again heres kick out Burton Ks three rattled Out Boy The Irish are three of 22 from three tonight theyve missed 16 in a row Music wow so here is Durr and now the citel under three to go going to burn some clock heres Smith skipping in nice crosscourt pass and AJ Smith had a terrific second half Dan for Coach Conroy its very interesting he only scored a point in the first half but hes the leading score and he just kept plugging away and he has really produced here in the Applause second Booth launches back RI Miss and malora brown the rebound another three goes back pounding away now that was not a good one Wes that was a long one it was a contested one theyve missed some open ones but that wasnt a good shot 6345 and Winston Hill as we approach two minutes shot clock down to five Smith launches Hill the rebound on the backside scores on the stick back first field goal for Winston Hill the lead is 20 largest of the night for the Bulldogs and an offensive foul called on Notre Dame the senal Bulldogs have done this recently they beat Pittsburgh a little more than a year ago to open the season that was their last win against an ACC School Dan but according to our friends at ESPN stats and info tonight this is only going to be their second win against the ACC in their last 44 games and that dates back some 40 years for the citel so whats your trying to tell me as our friends at the stats outfit are saying this is an uncommon occurrence that were witnessing R rare be the term maybe uncommon or rare take your pick Mur Brown the rebound and a foul will be called on Notre Dame and you see Elijah Morgan looks like he might be cramping up here on the Baseline and teammates trying to help him stretch out here and at least get to his feet 10 rebounds tonight for Quinton malora Brown my goodness he came in with four straight double figure games averaging 14 Points 11 rebounds and 61 from the floor hes six of seven and misses the free throw 15 and 10 tonight for the young man from Lorton Virginia playing at his third School start at Rice then at Vanderbilt for three and now the grad year at the citel which is technically the co year and the rebound by Thomas Crow out of Macedonia Ohio gets some cheers from the crowd here at the purcel Pavilion Crow is a walk on playing for just the second time hes on the floor with Sanders JT Kelly is out there here is Wade at the foul line and itll go bounding away and malora brown had the rebound Sanders tried to strip it he saved it to Madison dur who comes front Court in the final minute and we get a timeout taken and Ed Conroy is going to empty his bench and Applause and theyre going to bring in Quinn neelon you see him at 30 wearing number 32 Tony Carpio is playing tonight hes a sophomore from Swani Georgia playing for the seventh time this is Marcus Pam The Freshman from Chicago whos going to get to go home for the holidays after tonight thats a jump shot by Bur its no good so a nice gesture by Ed Conroy to get his players in the final minute here and Micah Shrewsberry is going to empty his bench tonight and hope that hes able to get Julian rooper and maybe Logan Imes back on the floor for Friday nights game against Marist three ball from JT Kelly a sophomore out of pdra beach bounds away JT Kelly may be one of my favorite stories I want to investigate Dan as this season moves on young man at the end of the bench is a first year walkon who in high school had an NBA jersey business that he made 70000 off of I got I got to work on that one good thing were going to South Bend during the ACC travels to find out more about JT Kellys business but tonight is about Ed Conroy and the cital Bulldogs
