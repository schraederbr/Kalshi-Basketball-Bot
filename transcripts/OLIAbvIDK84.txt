of their last 16 the only Interruption is that road loss at Georgia teack yeah Georgia Tech had a great game and you know thats when you go on the road you always worry about the game because you never know in this league what can happen Virginia Tech is tough for that ball got knocked away and a turnover on Virginia Techs first possession and here is heurn the Wisconson transfer who has been just terrific for Pat Kelce and his first Louisville Squad Scott one of the three Charleston transfers to heon right back to Scott 13 to shoot for Louisville Virginia Tech manto man heres Javon Hadley the drive on Le and a tough shot for Hadley a really tough shot and a bad start for June 10th they dont want to get started like this heres pressure in the back court offered by Louisville Jim what are two or three things you think Mike Youngs team has to do tonight to be winning well you know theyve got to find a way to score theyve had a couple n scoring games they have to score and Louisville is just really hard to stop defensively I mean it its really hard to stop them they get so much balance theres different guys Smith can hit it h bur you know they get multiple scoring options Scott this is rain Smith back for Edwards and now Hadley with 14 to shoot against lewow Edwards up top against Johnson all the way into traffic threw it away turn over to Hammond out front heres shoot lewow trying to beat Hadley on the drive gets to the rim and will draw the foul on the Cardinals terrific crew tonight Roger SS Bill cumington Jr and Bren Hampton on the whistle for us three quality ref final four refs oh theyre going to call a travel not a foul wow so a turnover third for Virginia Tech in three possessions I have to see that again that was undetectable by the human eye except for one referee Scott heres Hadley the catch and shoot three and its good Javon Hadley five Virginia Tech nothing Virginia Tech was is so concerned about heurn and Smith that a guy like headleys going to get some looks Patrick wesler draws the start tonight malel poti injured at Miami on Saturday not available to go tonight they hope he is ready to play on Saturday when Adrien alry in the orange visit shoot with eight Hammond working on heper into traffic fallway over Chucky is short and the rebound pulled away by the cards Edwards for heurn now heres Scott against wesler Edwards lob Scott the catch and dunk louis ball movement is good their workout today their walkthroughs all their stuff that they do was really good what Virginia Tech did was good but theyre getting taken out of it defensive Louisville is just taking them right out of everything that they want to run 59th dunk of the year for James Scott hes fourth in the country theres a lob for lewow it got deflected and heres a look ahead for Edwards layup in transition Terrence Edwards on the board and Louisville leads N9 nothing in the first three minutes this is the way Louis thats the way theyve been playing the last winning streak they just get out on people and they run on their defense heres Johnson a hard dribble against Edwards heern took it from him Chucky heon with Tyler Johnson chasing a lay it up an in and thatll bring us to a timeout what he wants to do its just not about spending money its getting the right guys hes got the right guys and theyre playing very very well together Brandon Rex Steiner checked into the lineup for Youngs hokes Hammond has come out of the allall game Jaden young who had a career high on Saturday also on the floor along with Ben Burnham who played for Kelsey a year ago at the College of Charleston theres Young on the drive jumper bounds away heres Hadley and Louisville again running cards are playing with terrific energy here on the road and that got knocked away Burnham comes away with a turnover and and he threw it away trying to get it to Jaden Applause young now the hokes say this got deflected didnt see it ball awarded to Louisville on the turn roges didnt see it he was right there so were were going to give him the right call there Mike young sixth season in blackburg 104 wins over 400 in his career these are two coaches that work their way up really really good basketball coaches but right now Virginia Tech is being outgunned and out defended Rex Steiner working against heon heres Burnham for three good and the hookes are on the board 343 of the year for Burnham coach thats the first good shot theyve got and they made it heres rain Smith hell drive rare twopoint take in a basket he very s drives to the basket its mostly threes 133 10point lead for number 19 Louisville whos 82 on the road theyre 8 one in their last nine ACC Road games this year and this is their final Road game theyre at home for three starting on Saturday against pit theyve got a good shot to run the table theyre finished with 182 in the leag pretty good turnaround amazing when you think about it isnt it PE a three spins off young the rebound and the hokes back on the Applause attack Rex Steiner off the wesler screen Jaden shoot a three bounds out for Terrence Edwards or Hadley Music rather rain Smith catching shoot good you dont want to let him get that kind of look the 104th three of the year for the senior from Tasmania rign Smith and Louisville is just paying theyre just paying attention to what they need to do thats all theyre Applause doing Rex Steiner for Burnham against Hadley young was terrific on Saturday now Burnham another three got it boy Ben Burnham against his old coach has come out firing one man trying to get this thing going that was not an easy one Hein a kick out for Edwards Chucky heon young shuts him down at the Baseline 10 to shoot here for Louisville five to shoot quick look Scott the catch and dunk Louisvilles just playing efficient basketball theyre just not making mistakes theyre moving the ball they they do multiple things theyre not one attack one point theyll attack then theyll reverse attack the other side two field goals two dunks for Scott and here is Hadley and Burnham battling for it and it was last Touch by the hokes thatll get us to a timeout almost 7 minutes into this first half it has been all Castle its going to be interesting meanwhile Louisville I dont know that Pat Kelce could have scripted something better than this well nine points off seven turnovers in first six seven minutes yeah he couldnt script it better than that yep Kai Roose is coming to game abukar Kadir trayor and heres rain Smith for another three off the back rim Noah Waterman a shot at the rebound he stepped on the end line out of bounds so youve got Waterman trayor Roose rain Smith and Chucky Hein on the floor for Louisville Rex Steiner Burnham Tyler Johnson Toby lewow and Jaden young are out there for the orang shirted iies tonight and here is Young Rex Steiner for three and it spins in Brandon Rex Steiners 31st three of the year in his last five games he was four of 26 from behind the line coming right out of the turn right out of timeout good play set Play Good bucket trayor abubacar nice pass Waterman the catch and layup three threes from the hokes kind of keeping them at at least somewhere where they got to look at it Rex Steiner a three and Waterman the rebound of the miss ball got deflected by LW and the teams are going to go to their benches here two great coaches Mike young and P Kelsey great coaches and right now Louisville just got it going cards opened a 163 Advantage start of the game here goes Edwards slashing through the Baseline now trayor with seven to shoot back for heon at the front against Rex Steiner trying to dig in on defense heurn with two on a shot clock in a back R miss that Brandon Rex Steiner pulls round really good defensive stand right there yeah Reiner terrific there coach Chucky heer is hard to contain this is Jaden young left side for Burnham who is already knocked down a couple of Threes against his Old Coach Pat Kelsey and a turnover Again by the Hokies and Ruth The Freshman from Washington with the recovery really good double team eight for Virginia Tech in that category Kai Roose on the drive and had it bothered by Burnham and last touched by the cards oh no we get a foul call its on 25 Kadir trayor thats his first its his first the first foul of the ball game by the way Che Louisville number one Javon maybe a little contact there so Johnson will put it in play with Rex Steiner Music Applause Rex down head of Three Fires again and hits boy Brandon Rex Steiner and Ben Burnham have all the Hokey points and its taken a while but theyve got their offense going a little bit now better screening getting people open not turning the ball over turned over by Louisville eightpoint game and Rex Steiner again front Court Waterman on the switch heres Johnson and a reach in called on Chucky heper thatll be his first and the second on Louisville and another look at Brandon Reiners work really good F just turned down the ball screen went the other way got a wide open shot they made four threes thats whats making any kind of a game theyre four their first seven from behind the line burnam two and now Reiner air weslers come back on the floor look at pass inside Rex Steiner to Johnson and the one on the foul Tyler couldnt score at the first time rewarded for the second effort and draws the Louisville foul and this for Virginia Tech this is a great example theyre in this game and it looked for a while like they were going to be out of the game right from the beginning theyve just stuck with what theyre doing getting good shots and now Johnson makes a big time play inside gets his shot blocked and he still finishes it second foul on abubacar trayor free throw by Johnson no good that was the first paint point to the night for Virginia Tech everything else had been from behind the line and Louisville a turnover Edwards now we have the turnovers coming the other way yeah heres Rex Steiner lost it laal recovers heres young for three and its good Jaden Youngs 37 three of the Year all of a sudden its a threepoint game this this is college basketball eight nothing run by the hokes Smith the answer no wesler tried to clean it up recovers they pushed him but they didnt see it and Virginia Tech can tie with a Music three after it looked like in the first four minutes they were going to get run out of their own building Johnson Young heres Johnson on the drive layup bound it away all the way used the back court Edwards the other way recovered to Scott Edwards Fires for three back rim Miss Scot the long rebound and a foul on Tyler Johnson Virginia Tech first on Tyler Johnson first on Virginia Tech here coach good look J Youngs coming off a big game so youre not true surprised but its a great effort really smart well coached team they were out of the game now theyre right back in the game yeah after the foul on Johnson Hein and the cards are reset oh Big Move Hadley lob and a dunk for Scott and a block is called inside on Conor serin who had checked into the ball game hes playing tonight because of the injury to poti they need somebody of his size at 68 so the grad transfer from Eastern Michigan into the lineup heres heres a case where the foul call helps Virginia Tech theyve got a dont yep and its thats out the window so a new 20 and a baseline spot throw in for Terren Edwards heres heurn catch and shoot three and Servin gets the rebound on the box out out Louisville missed their last five shots from the floor still a threepoint game Rex Steiner trying to find some space against heern L wild at the foul Applause line or Louisville waste no time do they they trying to get it up the court and get a quick shot but they everything was going for him early and now nothing 0 for seven Rex Steiner Johnson for the tie nope rebound for Servin tried to hand it to shoot turned it over to Music Smith under eight to play in this first half heurn attacking from the wing and score second field goal for Chucky heer Chuck louiset missed their last seven before the layup there and they need one they try to get the ball to ch he he makes the hes been making the plays all year that they need Rex Applause Steiner and knocks down a twopoint shot eight for Brandon Rex Steiner 2219 back to a threepoint Louisville lead after the Rex Diner jumper heurn the drive attacks couldnt finish it Reiner cleans it up straight up and down hell L for Johnson and he ran out of Runway hokes are going to turn it over itll get us to break the whole year one year thats a lot oh I can believe that your teams absolutely believe that probably true yeah they had 53 points against Miami most in an ACC game since 2015 of course young had 27 of those Hadley goes to work he had a flurry to start the game thats his first bucket since hes got seven in the first half to lead the cards coming another timeout they get a good play good shot thats what you look for lead is back to five shoot out front Toby lewow for three and a back rim miss that Waterman recovers Edwards flying down the floor blocked by low he lined that one up what a play by the athletic junr from London Burnham to shoot back out front they skip it to Burnham three ball Hadley the rebound for the bill great ball movement get a wide open three thats what youre trying to do quick bounce pass to Smith almost knocked away Hadley back to heer 12 to shoot for the cars Runner by Hadley no good and Tyler Johnson the rebound royville has really struggled after that big start they just havent got anything to go down yep Baseline Burnham too strong there goes heer trying to measure the screen by Hadley kicks back to him Waterman tried to track down the rebound lost it over the in line and it will go to the hus Che back for2 so a Louisville team that started eight of 10 from the floor just three of its last 15 and Toby L the Music rejection they got them early shots on transition steals easy shots and they made a couple good moves made a couple good shots off their offense but now theyre pretty good shot but sometimes the ball doesnt go in you see Lew go out and he heads right to the end of the bench where theyre looking I think around his left foot left ankle here seran has come back in the game he wears number 22 for the hes played two minutes at Miami on Saturday heres a turnover and now Edwards the layup and one on the serving Foulk Count by Five Terence Edwards Terrence Edwards second basket Conor Servin commits the foul it is his second yeah he got him in the head on that play and that is the third on Virginia Tech in his first half sometimes they look at those but I think it was a good play on the ball but he didnt get a little contact on the head Id rather see that not be flavorant Terrence Edwards are transferred from up Interstate 81 at James Madison to Louisville after being the sun Bel Player of the Year a season too knocks down the free throw hes got five Virginia Techs got 11 turnovers and Louisvilles got 16 points off of it coach thats the story right now Virginia Techs got to stop beating itself Rex Steiner a spot up rebound inside there goes Servin back up couldnt finish Conor cin does not have a converted field goal this year that was just his second attempt Hein on the drive and the easy bucket Kentucky heon hes got six now theyve got back control of the game just like that two two bad possessions two two finishes at the other end 10point lead Rex Steiner back on the floor hes been an offensive spark Louisville on a seven nothing run burn him a three over the top of Roose is Applause short heres heurn through traffic and a kick out first in with Ryan Smith theyre not letting him get looks from the three out front Roose long three right around the line and recovered on the rebound by Jaden Music young three and a half to go Burnham Baseline and a dunk I didnt see that coming Ben Burnham with a right hand flush Louisville didnt either 2921 Louisville by Applause eight Roose behind the back here goes rain Smith into traffic five to shoot here goes Hadley on the drive and the score Hadley does a good job they get a good shot even when theyre at the end of shot clock situations by he bur heavy they both can put it on the floor Edward can put it on the floor and make a play what a feels like a really difficult team to defend Louisville Jim a lot of options yeah Rex Steiner a three got it re theyre not easy to defend either hes got 11 in the first half leads all the scores in the ball game sevenpoint lead and a reach foul on Rex Steiner his first itll be the fourth on the hes but Chucky heern whos going to be a contender for First Team all ACC has got three field goals and a half dozen points Louisvilles got a sevenpoint lead in blackburg on acc Music Network well theres a clear distinction there I mean lets look at it those five teams are different but North Carolinas coming on will not count them out theyre going win at least a couple more before they get to Duke probably Edwards the long Miss now for Scott 15 to shoot boy been a game really kind of a surges both ways Louisville from the start Virginia Tech battle back but feels like a pretty big couple minutes here for Mike Youngs team going to the locker room heurn a three on he can make something out of nothing that play was almost perfectly defended he had very little time in the sh and he gets a great shot and makes it Louisville is three for 10 from three Virginia Tech is six of 13 both these teams are high energy threepoint shooting team theres a foul on Terence Edwards out in the mid Court his first third on Louisville the cards by the way are ninth in the nation they average 33s a game and they hit right about 33 and average nearly 10 conversions a game we got five or six guys that can shoot threes yeah Virginia Tech also has made 10 or more in two of their last three including the win at Miami where they had 12 and re Steiner shaking up on the play Go 9 one of his rare drives and he got a little bit up in the air but got bailed out Waterman the foul his first fourth on Louisville and Brandon rein are still down he got got the wind knocked out of him a little bit this is a really good officiating crew these guys are veteran guys theyre going to miss a call here or there but theyre theyre going to get most of them right so Brandon Rex Steiner from aworth outside of Atlanta will go to the line here Music Applause those are those are tough calls to make some contact if he had gone a little bit Square he probably would have been on a little bit sideways into him Rex ster will go to the line hes 80 on the year to shoot a couple of free throws terrific half already with 11 and the first one drops in dont forget number two Duke highlights our triple header on Saturday will start at 300 or shortly thereafter from Atlanta NC State Georgia Tech and then out to the West Coast for smus visit to paloalto and then Florida State Leonard Hamiltons final campaign is in Durham at 700 all that on acc Network and a course available on the ESPN app Rex Steiner gets both the free throws hes got 13 in the first half thats 24 of 26 points Off the Bench I Ive never seen that before the only any game only starter with the score in this first half for Mike young is Tyler Johnson heres Scott inside and a foul before and its on the deck against Jaden young itll be his first J fifth on Virginia Tech and here comes Ben Hammond The Freshman from Fairfax Virginia back to replace Rex Stein he was the difference Rex he he got him back in the game and GL there still in kind of in Shing distance 190 to go in the first half R Smith The Catch and shoot three and out of there with it comes Applause Hammond off a l while screen wesler calling for it as he fronted Scott young couldnt turn the corner tend to shoot for Hammond Johnson will drive Scott is there Hammond cut to the basket and lost it on the way up knocked out of bounds by the cards Bill Covington Jr Awards it to Virginia Tech good defense again I mean Louisville just sticks with it heres Johnson three to shoot doesnt know hes got to shoot westler will fire and thats a shot clock violation Tyler Johnson you got to be aware whats going on Applause freshman Mike young thought his freshman was aware and was not 12th turnover on the hokes their season average is 13 heern back for Scott fouled by wesler on the tap first on Patrick wesler six on Virginia Tech in this first half they just had cut cut the turnovers in half theyre probably in a two or three point game theyre just too many points off turnovers we review a timing issue at this time so Roger airs to the monitor here here on acc Network for the womens event in Greensboro week after next how many teams they got got in the top 25 and I tell you what couple of the Louisville just outside and theyre really good yeah heres James Scott now for a couple of free throws first one no good and he is 46 at the line this year 25 of 56 after the Miss there and you see he had an mouth injury lost some teeth in the Miami game and hes wearing the Hannibal Lector mask tonight it does provide some padded protection around his m its never easy to wear one of those things always felt for those guys with broken noses eye injuries and theyre always hard certainly with Applause Scott after a oral injury against Miami 23 seconds to go about a 10second differential heres Jaden shoot working against Smith wesler tries to help three to shoot wesler to work on Scott rolls with a left hand Padley the rebound was seven front court with six tipped away heres Jaden young front Court three at the horn no off the iron and that will be that for the first 20 minutes L team cant let them jump right here get five or six unanswered points cuz then you got a long way to climb back in it Duke and Georgia Tech already winners tonight on the road in the ACC and Louisville with the lead as we start the second half and the cards in control original starters are out there for Mike young likewise for Pat Kelce and Louisville and a whistle and a foul I think this is going to be on Hammond yeah they get the switch there and you get the mismatch and they you know they Lille did a good job trying to get him the ball first on Ben Hammond The Freshman from Fairfax Virginia in the first on the hok thats a trou when you make that switch its a tough one PE right back from Edwards trying to take Hammond off the dribble that got knocked away I think L got a hand in there got a hands on everybody on PE pretty much theres shoot delivering the ball to Music Hammond skip pass to the corner heres Jaden shoot a little fallway in the lane hes just not good off the dribble hes got to get his three theyre theyre running him off the threepoint line Scott wrap around for R Smith lift it up with the right hand and in seven for Smith on his second twopoint field goal of the night and the lead is 10 here in the first minute of the Applause half a win tonight by Louisville would be six in a row in 16 of their last 17 my goodness shoot threw it away shoot is just cant get his shot off oh nice defensive play that was a bucket Hammond a terrific defensive pick low attacking on the dribble in traffic cant score wesler follows first points for 7 foot red shirt sophomore Patrick wesler first point from a nonstarter almost here is Edwards feeds Scott for the dunk I think James Scotts got three dunks on all of his field goals now got 60 hes third on the alltime single season list at Louisville remember in the early 80s that place was a house of dunk really nice run nice set good cross screen Easy Shot inside couple of buckets for wesler get their starters involved a little bit eightpoint lead again for Louisville heer beat Hammond on the drive layup fell off the rim he doesnt miss many of those nope Noah Waterman up off Pat gels bench as wesler controls the distance against Scott and James Scott going to be ticketed for the foul first of the half on the cards and the first in the 611 sophomore from E Smith High School in fille North Carolina so Scott goes out Watermans in wesler goes to the bench is Ben Burnham who had a really nice first half as well yeah I think hes going to get two guys that scored in there pretty quick here L wow who is scoreless Applause tonight shoot for three nope theyre right with him when he comes off that screen thats a tough look maybe feels like one of the more undervalued traits of this Louisville team their recovery on defense is excellent theyre really good defensively thats what they do turnovers and just good solid team defense they switch on things they they mix it up heres Hammond floater in the lane Will Roll in pen Hammonds first basket so the starters have accounted for six all six points here in the second half they gotten the game on the drive Hadley bothered Lew Pat Kelce wanted a go 10 I dont think so might have been a little contact but pretty good defensive play and now Hadley the steal ball got kicked around Hadley going to scoop it up and he will lay it in 11 for Javon Hadley too many turnovers too many easy baskets seventh straight double figure game for the fifth year transfer from St Paul Minnesota who comes in leading leading Louisville in rebounds both in regular season and ACC play Burnham quickly in traffic and he will feed Johnson for the layup Burnhams been good really really helpful three for Edwards and heres Applause Hammond Louisville theres Burnham the Applause fallway pull up three for Smith nope the cards are now three for 15 from behind the line and were going to get a timeout early second half Louisville leads Virginia Tech by players they appreciate that its probably a big factor in the success hes had here in year one to with Louisville 100 how about that he on a drive and just an easy pass for Scott hes got four dunks eight points and the lead is eight now with five minutes gone here in the second half Louis will was any better than three for 15 from three theyd be have the game in control by now Ryan Smith doesnt miss that Music what do you got here coach they just had a little screen they got confused on the switch and big guy rolls the basket wide open Conor seran has come back on the floor both teams run a lot of screen and rolls and drops and Dives and you get somebody open every once in a while like that no matter how good your defense is here is servant Who start his college through Illinois out of Prairie City Illinois now perum kick out young a deep three and Servin couldnt finish it offensive rebound chance he has to finish those padir trayor on the drive senior from the Ivory Coast his first bucket tonight Louisvilles got 34 points in the paint Rex Steiner off the servant screen Burnham against trayor Johnson against Waterman and the foul on Noah water his second big guys always do they put their hands up after they fou them then they put you got to put your hands up first I think somebody has to tell what Roger a just tell he just told him that you got to put your hands up now right yeah that after you hit him but thats what you want to get the mismatches where you can drive the big guy thats what youre trying to do the teams thats why why Malik Brown so valuable at Duke hes a five when he goes in he can switch everything which is what Duke when hes in the game and now he can guard yeah ones or twos thats thats hard for most teams because most teams have a big Center that cant do that second for Johnson is good four and a half six in the ball game for the Freshman from Orlando it looks like the hokes are out of the game game but theyre not out of the game they just got to make a couple plays heres Scott ball screen for hman Waterman a three got it thats why hes in the game he goes in the game3 of the year hes 7 foot he goes in the game to shoot threes just less than a thousand points in Noah Watermans career mostly from three yes heres Burnham 12 to shoot for Jaden young 11point lead for Louisville Burnham a three back rim miss heper battle for it Burnham got the rebound right back at Waterman now got caught Loops it back for Applause young over the top of Scott got it Jaden young with a pair of Threes in the ball game theyre hanging around eightpoint lead heurn on the drive and thats going to be on Rex Steiner itll be his second its the second against Virginia Tech another look at the work of Jade young tough three anytime you pull up like that and a guy step back thats not an easy shot so Edwards is going to put it in play you mentioned Noah Waterman 611 Savannah New York with 103 threepoint attempts how big Savannah New York is Savannah New York is next to Lions where Im from Lions is 5000 savan isnt even close to 5000 not even close couple of stop lights maybe not no they dont have one okay I dont think they have a stop sign in Savannah I love Savannah although Ill hear some somebody now Bren Hampton offering a coaching box warning for Pat Kelsey yeah I know why youre laughing heres trayor on the drive and one tough shot really tough AB bubacar trayor second field goal and Jaden young paced for it with his second foul its a third of the frame on Virginia Tech this some kind of Bounce by trayor on the hard dribble and the transfer from Long Beach State will go to the line all five of his points here in the second half 11point lead now 7 Minutes gone second Applause half Johnson and had it knocked away good play trayor and at the end on transition cant finish wesler the rebound thought there was going to be a foul and when it didnt happen he just threw the ball away threw it h Johnson for Rex Steiner ski into the corner Burnham got it boy Ben Burnham 11 tonight its his fourth double figure game in the last six when they can get a good look they make a pretty good percentage Edwards thought about the bounce for Scott takes it and wouldnt get the roll they need V Tech needs one or two good possessions and they can get back in this thing oh Rex Steiner leaves it for Johnson hell knock down the three nine now for Tyler Johnson and a timeout asked for by Pat dson the hokes are nine of 20 from three they need need to get into another profession because theyre not watching what Im watching yeah a record 11 ACC rookies of the week for Cooper flag is that all yeah closest the Hokies have been since it was 2219 and Burnham had a three spin out Johnson the recovery in the basket Tyler Johnson has come off Miss shots and all of a sudden theyre right in the game and it looked like they were not going to be close in the game and this Mike young is a very good coach hes kept his team in this game nine nothing run by Virginia Tech to draw to within two of number 19 Louisville and what a l from heper to Scott and the foul on wesler and another play coming out of the time second on wesler in the fourth of the half on the hokes and boy James Scotts value just keeps escalating does it its a great pass thats a tough pass but youve got to pressure the ball there you cant let Chucky heer make that pass you got to get up on him thats just too easy Scotts got six and a half hes in double figures now on his fifth field goal all five of his baskets are dunks tonight last year 52 of his 76 made field goals were dunked and he just dropped dead a free throw somehow it had back spin on it and it just reversed back into the B just heres a pull up thats J young Bo Young is kind of Jim hes kind of kept accelerating a little bit off his career high on Saturday it feels like well its all off bench bench production here threepoint game Hadley working against burnam out front heurn Tucky on the drive rejected recovered to re Steiner had young ahead didnt see him Brandon can tie it with a three Burnham has had a hot hand heres young for three locked up all of a sudden the whole game has changed Hokies have never L tonight and we tied at 53 look at the defense pick up too heres Edwards basine against wesler tend to shoot for Hadley on the drive lost it Rex Steiners got it here come the hokes a little contact but no call into the corner young for the lead no line drive that was rebounded by Scott look at hurn and a hell ball will go to Virginia Tech Rex Diner reached right in and locked up Chucky Applause heer Bo Jaden young big shots here coach he just took his time got a good release the last one in the corner he just rushed it a little bit so Rex Steiner goes out Johnson goes out you see Jaden young just three points in the first half eight here in the second Virginia Techs now got nine games with 10 or more threes this is their sixth against the ACC and its the third and the last four all bench production down the stretch here too just like in the first hit shoots returned lewow is on the floor he is still scoreless tonight Kobe had it knocked away

anything going made a couple nice blocks but n and a half to go heres heurn oh couldnt control it Hammond on the D Drive recovered young he cant score they fight inside and it is last Touch by Louisville itll stay with the hokis well theyre going to let the players decide this game cuz there was a multiple contact there they beenin both ends theyre going to go to the monitor here and well wait and see what Bren Hampton tells tells us what are they going theyre reviewing here Applause and they kind of stopped making the turnovers and their bench has been unbelievable young three for the lead wow spun out terrific look great look heres Chucky ke again on the drive and hell draw the foul on Ben Hammond on Virginia number 11 Ben H thats his you had great guards in your career Chucky heon has got a sense of Leverage on the dribble doesnt he he hes the Difference Maker for them when they when they get into this situation hes the guy that makes a play in bounds for Hadley right back to heer heres Smith for three back rim Miss Hammond runs it down Smith does not miss these shots hes missing them tonight Hammond LA for laow got deflected out of there Padley out for Waterman right corner for rain Smith Lille trying to recapture some of their offensive momentum great defense from Virginia Tech theyre not giving them anything easy 8 and 1 half to go in a tie game come on and knocked Away by lewow four to shoot heres Smith hell gun for three back rim no good here are the hokes middle of the floor young in traffic offensive foul third on Jaden young its the sixth on Virginia Tech just had such an advantage there you just dont run over the guy there thats 17th turnover of the night hes got guys with him hes got a threepoint shooter right here and hes just running out of control you got to see that play So Young is out Tyler Johnsons returned Rex Steiners gone to the bench so its Hammond shoot Johnson Burnham and wesler Toby lewow out of the lineup now for Virginia Tech as well Applause heres heurn on the drive against wesler and Louisville back in front 11 now for Chucky heer hes the guy thats going to make plays for him when it comes down the stretch

blackburg the castle 165 run by Virginia Tech wesler with Burnham Rex Steiner Johnson young heres wesler now Jaden young again hard drive to the basket put it up got swatted by Scott trayor back on the floor heres heurn and Louisville turned it over in transition I think it was an over and back at half court but we could barely see it 10th turnover tonight on Pat Kels team earlier today we were talking to him about the final turn of the regular season he said the most important thing for our team is stay day to day y thats all he talked about Rex Steiner against Hadley heres Johnson now 12 to shoot he picked up on the dribble young against Edwards and then thrown away to heper heon on the drive young going to commit the foul heon will go down its the fourth on Jaden young it is the seventh on Virginia Tech and the fifth best free throw shooter in the AC ses going to the line here in Chucky heon at the 609 Mark in a 55 all game and little bit of uh extracurricular between Javon Hadley and Patrick wesler and Mike young came out to pick up the basketball at midcourt I didnt see much I mean theres the foul right there looked like he and young got wrapped up and locked up a little bit thats no that was 17 half I dont see anything there but PR play so Roger SS and they will go ahead and have a look here with Bill comington Jr I do get along with him now right thats cuz theyre not costing me G heres heurn now this is one and one fifth best free throw shooter in the ACC and its good he is seventh in conference play at 88 as he knocks down the first Applause one that gives him 12 on the night make it 13 boy they were schoolyard clean werent they hes the guy you want Applause shooting Rex Steiner twopoint lead for Louisville now number 19 in the country five game winning streak 15 of their last 16 Baseline shoot got in trouble travel hes just had a nightmare game tonight I dont know Jaden shoot thought he got fouled its the 20th turnover tonight for Virginia Tech check Lis here is rain Smith back in the game abubakar trayor will sit down and shoot went Baseline took a was Hadley went to defend that one across the the head nothing there yep here is heurn trying to use the Hadley screen into the corner Edwards against Johnson wesler there Edwards throws it up and in third field goal Terrence Edwards has only got seven tonight Virginia Tech has done a great job defensively thats a hard shot yeah fourpoint lead now for Louisville 520 to play at the Applause castle Johnson for shoot now wesler Patrick rolling against Scott stays with the left hand scores eight for westler he didnt go down in double team and he made him pay twopoint game again we go inside a five to play Jim hurn is fouled by rexer thatll be his third another one in one for Chucky heer you just dont want to keep putting him on the foul line thats what hes going to do hes going to try to get his angle Tred to drive and hes hard for re Steiner to guard he has trouble guarding tror going to come out R Smith to the bench as aard this is the most ineffective Ive Seen Rain Smith in all the games Ive seen them this year they just arent letting him they talked about the SC report today yeah were not going to let him get anything and theyre not pepp has hit three in a row at the line quick reminder to you that terrific onew lacrosse match on Saturday 100 number two Maryland at number one Notre Dame in South Ben youll get all the action on acc Network just ahead of our triple header of basketball that starts at three right here on acc Network and the ESPN app both fre throws for heer and hes going to have the ball most of the time if not every second of the time the rest of the way so its a fourpoint game now Tyler Johnson against trayor and now Burnham whos got 11 tonight wesler on the Applause Block dig down from tayori nice bounce past Johnson and that got knocked away nine to shoot for the hokes they want a deflection but its not going to happen first shot or Best Shot here you got to get a good shot right away you dont 9 seconds isnt much theyre going to do a handoff here he didnt get it he bring somebody else Rex stoner with four to shoot hands to Tyler Johnson hell spin on hebburn left it on the front rim good defense not much you could do 9 seconds fourpoint lead for Louisville 418 to Applause play CS trying to stay in the race with Clemson behind Duke who won earlier tonight at Miami Tigers host Notre Dame tomorrow night at Little John Edwards a three ball got it thats the first one in about uh two days thats their first second three of the second half Waterman had the other one Edwards has now got double figures for an eight straight game and by rexin hes had a big game hes been really key to keeping them in this game a second double figure game coach in the last 10 for Brandon Reiner Virginia tea within four with 346 to go Edwards at one in for the cards and then Virginia Tech answers with Brandon rexin watch out for tshirts making their way thats a lot but the paint points in the paint Louisvilles got 42 thats and the turnover points those thats really the story its almost surprising its that close its only close because of all the threes here is Hadley with 11 to shoot fourpoint game and to work against perum into the corner Edward another three and its good his shot doesnt look good but it goes in so I guess were going to count those 13 for teren Edwards and a couple of big threes here in the last couple trips kind of a knuckle ball but hey if it goes in it goes in lead is seven ahead of three minutes to play wesler Skip for Burnham hell take off past Hadley Lay It Up in air hes played well too 13 for Burnham tonight back to a fivepoint louisv a lead there goes Hadley on the drive against wesler fell off the iron burn him the rebound wesler took a shot to the face and immediately Patrick wesler is going to get some attention he took an elbow it looks like right around the eye and the big fella is up and working his way toward the OK bench Che Music for fire Burnham got him I guess you cant call that no that been the other way it would have been flagrant the first year they had the hit to the Head thing if you ever touched a guy in the head was a flagrant even if you did it with a normal basket bu was a terrible rule they finally corrected that one after a couple years so Toby Lew who is scoreless tonight and only has two rebounds and a block shot has come back on the floor heres re Steiner tried to bounce it back inside Scott kicked it 13 to shoot and itll stay with Mike Youngs team there is lwow and Mike Youngs trying to get his best player back in there and get something out of him these last three minutes hes keeping the guys that have scored Burnham Rex Center theyre in the game you know young theyre in the game so young just just yes yeah boy youd take a l dunk here or something would you I think its going to be a three from one of these guys thats going to be the difference heres Young on the drive to the basket fell off the iron L the rebound and there he go first point to the n thats why hes with 218 to play thats why hes such a good coach he puts him in he gets a rebound puts it back going to have the ball the rest of the way and hes going to be the one thats going to try to make plays Hadley now heres Scott heurn on the drive into traffic lost it over the inline out of bounds anytime you try to split they will not give you that call if if you try to split Defenders theyre not going to call it even though theres contact in there I never like that play So Rex Steiner will run the offense here the turnover by Louisville and a threepoint lead theyre 11th of the game Rex steer a two got it Im Chucky heord to 18 for Brandon rexin six nothing run by Virginia Tech Edwards who hit the big threes a moment ago spinning against Rex Steiner now in trouble pushes it up short and Bren Hampton says last Touch by Louisville Im not sure previous play is under review so theyre going to check to see the ruling on the floor was it was last Touch by Louisville see the ball release you know hard to tell a burn and touch I think he touched it he had a little push help from behind but they cant go back and the ball clearly touches Virginia Tech number 13s pinky finger so it is going to be Louisville ball on the Baseline with 127 on the game CL it wasnt that clear so I dont know the last one the blow up we saw at the end was pretty convincing so now lets go 11 11 seconds on the shot clock 11 seconds on the shot clock that was the back end of the deal yeah and its a onepoint Applause game so PE will put it in play laow is locked up with Scott Burnhams got Hadley right there in front of Chucky heer who could very well get the ball back too they go Smith for three Off the Mark Hadley the rebound now Edwards will think about it 15 to shoot on a 20 second reset Smith has just not been a able to hit anything tonight only the sixth offensive rebound of the ball game for Louisville here is heon on the drive three to shoot High arcing shot no and Scott the dunk follow six dunks for tonight a minute to go its a threepoint Applause game Rex Steiner off the L screen oh no and he threw it away lost the handle on it sailed it out of bounds turnover on Virginia Tech is their 21st tonight Chucky hecks going to have the ball for 30 seconds were going to foul and here goes Hadley back for Edwards Hes a 78 free throw shooter its a threepoint game and a timeout taken by Louisville thats a to me I dont like that timeout because you got the ball and you know what you can wait to wind the shot clock down here cant you you can but then you got to either really get a quick two and then you got to foul Chucky he probably but thats the way most people would play it thats the way I think theyre going to play it Scott is by far in a way the worst free throw shooter on the floor for Pat Kelsey here is he driving Rex Steiner into traffic spins back lost it out of bounds how about that nothing so now with 261 to go Mike Youngs got one timeout left as does Pat Kelce Virginia Tech play for the one shot here coach no theyre going for two points right now unless they get a wide open look at three theyre going to try to get a twopointer probably if they get a two well hes going to take his time out no I dont think he shouldnt and bounc to re Steiner theyre going to go well theyre going to take it well thats an interesting one you know now you got to go for two Rex Steiner young Burnham and lewow are on the floor Smith heern Edwards Hadley and Scott now they could use a foul here this would not be a bad Play heres low now young tried to go to Rex Steiner now back to Rex Steiner lost it and stolen by Hadley and theres a foul on rain Smith with 77 to go Javon Hadley knocked the ball loose from Rex Steiner in front of the Virginia Tech bench to force yet another turnover tonight against the hokes theyre 22nd they didnt try to foul they played straight up defense and they made a defensive play so heres rain Smith who is 94 at the line only missed three times in 48 tries well I called it early because this guy is not going to miss a free throw and the lead is four with 77 left at the end of the day Louisville made a stop at the end thats it they got the two Edwards 3es the Scott dun and then got two stops defensively and to Virginia Techs credit they made him do it make the plays they didnt give him anything heres re Steiner into the front Court hell fire for three its no good and that will be that Louisville now has a 14 game win improvement from a year ago it is the largest turn around
