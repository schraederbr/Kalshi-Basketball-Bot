Davis on the other side what a career its been for this young man I dont even know where to begin the Horizon player preseason player of the year for the third time the Horizon player player of the year last year fourtime first team all Horizon league and play for his dad Mike Davis and this is grad here should be fun to watch score 28 points in the season opener for Detroit emergency a victory over Rochester College in Michigan by a final of 9365 Titans and Eagles and should be fun here on this Friday afternoon first chance boy Prince Elite Bay out first add to the transfer from Cincinnati and eight to shoot early for Boston College but Kai Ashton Langford a little bit stronger than three and first rebound belongs to the easy Anderson the Gratitude from South Bend Indiana a ton of transfers on this Detroit Mercy roster yeah eight in total Six coming in this past year but two from previous years three true freshmen so in total 11 newcomers Marie ball Jayden stone is good the Junior from Perth Australia so Captain is a transfer from Grand Canyon University where he spent the last couple of years and set a career high with 15 points in the opener against Rochester thats what theyre going to need some outside shooting some presidents to get the load off of Antoine Davis zacharians it is a block whats the Boston College you cant get into the threepoint shooting contest so good job by Zachary to just go attack the hoop draw the foul almost a threepoint player there but good Vision there for the point guard foul goes against AJ Oliver lets talk more about Antoine Davis comes in 21st all time in NCAA history and career points next on the list is JJ Redick hes seven points away from tying JJ for 20th on the alltime scoring list he gets to 3000 this year which should be continues at that pace would be just the 11th player ever to reach 3 000 career points chasing down Pistol Pete Pete green two free throws for Boston College Eagles who struggle to Tad at the line on Monday just 54 from the strike and a little bit of early pressure defense from the sophomore point guard but a nice job getting all the way to the rim and home boy Jordan Phillips senior from Fort Worth Texas who comes to Detroit started his career at Arkansas before playing the last few years at UT Arlington and he had battled an injury last year Eric where he played the first three games of the year but he didnt play the rest thats how to play but just a good play there by Phillips take it to the hoop and finished his play even with the contact he beats Jaden Zachary and then the help side defense is there a little too late Phillips at six foot seven fight just three games last year before his seasonending injury so hes a big piece to have back for Detroit Mercy three ball Anderson off front rim and out of bounds over towards the Boston College bench there is Earl Grant in his second season Earl the trend and going back to the suits which is definitely in the minority of what weve seen from college basketball coaches but I like how about thats higher you and I were talking about our ties before today I gotta go get his dresser Bakers stop what a game it was in the opener got the second Tap maybe even a third and a fourth and bustling his way up it could not finish blocked at The Rim by demisi Anderson yeah he wanted to foul there and didnt get it but good job just staying with the play the music Anderson stays alive and keeps this Play Alive in Detroit now the other way Langford close defense against Davis this is Jayden Stone a threepointer knock down already seven to shoot Detroit Mercy Oliver got rid of it Anderson back for Oliver three to shoot and the three is long rebound to Zachary Music you would have to think this game is going to be played at a slower Tempo than what we saw in Boston Colleges first game against Cornell theres Madison straight to the ten Mason his first two like that as Rochester Minnesota and he transfers over from Boston College from Cincinnati and hes trying to see some early action here to develop some time in the lineup first shot Davis is good Antoine Davis he has scored in double figures in every game of his college career 112 in a row at records 115 I rank in two more games three more games actually he could tie that record at 115 theres Earl Grant once more in his second season we talked a lot about this in the opener and with Earl before that game and the fact that one week last year in the ACC tournament totally changes the feel and the perception of the program going forward and then even a win on Monday night in a game that theres definitely some things to clean up especially on the defensive end and Earl Grant talked about how that game was really competed a pace that doesnt fit his team felt more like at Cornells Pace but you still feel the positive momentum even after that win well yeah you talked about the run in the ACC tournament falling to Miami a one point loss that just one point away from the ACC semifinals and you know a lot of the kids coming back 70 of the scoring for BC they knew what they had and they knew what the program was looking forward to so Earl Grants trying to build and establish the Boston College program Victor stop inside and was old and if thats all thats Oliver thats already three fouls on AJ Oliver he just picked up his second was not subbed out they had brought someone to the scoring table to bring in and the fallendidas against Oliver and that is three fouls less than four minutes into the game and perhaps more importantly though Prince alipe for Boston College is a little bit slow to come off on the other end yeah it looks Eric like just some contact below the hoop youre gonna see the drive Alibi goes up looks like he might land on an ankle there he does actually lands on his own teammates ankle coming down so hope its nothing too serious hell be attended to in the locker room as they head through the tunnel I certainly hope Prince Elite Bay is okay able to walk off under his own powers the free throw from pickers stab he is good so youre gonna talk about Eric AJ Oliver you know getting in foul trouble they need AJ all around on the floor one of those guards thats at six five to help support Antoine Davis in scoring and finding and spacing out the floor maker staff one of two at the felon so its 75 Detroit Mercy Lee on possession Stone guarded by Bickerstaff size Advantage there for BC but Stone step back three ball a little bit short but the followup by TJ Moss was blocked to the rim I see Jake Pena what a debut it was on Monday for Pena 15 points I believe Madison also got a piece of that one Eric so a little support a guy Ashton Langford steps into the three no offensive rebound though Bickerstaff around thats it again and short again of the three but got a long rebound now its secretarys turn from behind the arc and that one off the mic put another offensive board Music how about that English Eric a nice little move good aggressive rebounding by Bickerstaff so far hes been hungry for those rebounds Eagles already with five offensive rebounds in the game and Ty once again seven a piece and that is an offensive foul screen on Anderson was whistled what effort underneath by the eighth ranked rebounder in the ACC last year TJ Bickerstaff right where he left off in the game on Monday against Cornell yeah you saw that beautiful cut there to finish whose eyes wide open throughout that game against the big red great steel there hes gonna have a great finish to the hoop here with the great offensive rebound last year a careerhigh 17 with offensive rebounds in a couple of games this block he sends it back to Ithaca as you said Eric and I think theyre still trying to track that ball down great start for TJ pickerstaff bicker staff who returned as the fifth beating rebounder in the ACC from last year his third career doubledouble on Monday night and weve mentioned especially in the offensive boards at four of them on Monday already four of them so far today and he is a big impact player its six foot nine but especially without quick pose to Boston colleges again without today due to a leg injuries could be really important its gonna fill that void inside hes done it so far here he picks up the foul away from the ball but I think last year learning about what Earl Grant really wants in the program and buying into that as you see the Mike Davis resume here Mike Dave is such a great coach here in this league in the Horizon hes had a couple of stops in his career at Indiana UAB and Texas Southern yeah folks will remember Mike Davis took over for Bobby Knight back in the early 2000s at Indiana ended up bringing the Hoosiers to a National Championship Game appearance in 2002 where they lost to Maryland and Mikes son Antoine knocks down the three another game with this threepointer for Antoine Davis thats 434 in his career and seven lead boys Detroit Mercy Chaz Kelly in the game for the first time heres Pena straight on Triple bounces around and down nice friendly bounce there for Benya as he gets that open look not afraid to shoot it and thats the thing with his Boston College team is everybody out on that court is not afraid to take a three and if its open theyll shoot it Factory ended up on the ground jousting with Davis 12 to shoot Detroit Mercy Anderson tried to throw a pick got rid of it three ball Phillips is a little too strong Music each team matching threes in the last two possessions Madsen on the drive sends it out Kelly three ball is strong another offensive board Victors death and then he lost it trying to go up I take a little second there to see whos around you a lot of red jerseys Davis walks into one yeah he is officials have not noticed it yet so we play on vickersdap inside got around almost a surprise but it ends up with Madison whos off the mark from Three Eagles are just one of seven from behind the arc to start Titans on the other hand just two of seven thats now they I think they notice and well get the whistle out for Davis Music he goes back because were a TJ big Davis ended up hitting the floor and thats where that cut came from Music see here Kellys gonna swing it back down low towards bicker staff big staff cuts through the D ude its actually a play just before that one where 50 staff has it in the paint he kind of makes a hop step move to back down the defender Davis hit the ground and then thats kind of where that cut comes from on that right eye Antoine Davis now 47 consecutive schemes with a threepointer made looking for zero and maybe right there on the rebound right here might have probably gotten a piece of them on the back down there for assistant coach Mike Davis Jr was trying to tell the officials hey it was on that back down the elbow went up some tough cookies out here and get attended too so many different accolades for Antoine Davis in his career he is fifth all time in terms of threepointers made per game coming into this year anytime youre on a list with Steph Curry thats pretty good he actually broke Steph Currys freshman record or threepointers made in a season a couple of years ago and hes been setting records left and right ever since arriving in Detroit dad said he was spending this offseason working with Steph Currys trainer learning kind of how to develop his game a little bit more and what he can add to his repertoire Anderson got a round Pena three ball was short though both teams struggling a bit from the floor to start this game here is hand out of control and out of bounds thats good defense there by TJ Moss putting a hand there on the drive to force that ball alter that ball and force it out of bounds and off of the Eagles gonna see here TJ Moss gonna put that right hand in to alter that drive and hitting the floor was Donald hand Jr and now Donald hand Jr a little bit slow to get up and actually now will go to the hardwood and a scary situation there for the Boston College freshman from Virginia Beach well step aside while they check on hand 1010 game here 1209 remaining in the first from Conti forum Junior on that drive take a look here scary sight here is his knee kind of gave out so Donald hand was helped off to the locker room so Boston College is down two right now with Prince Ali Bay and Donald Dan Jr in the locker room right now I certainly hope both of those exciting freshmen are okay as they take the 1010 game under 12 minutes remaining hear from Conti forum and that is a foul that will go against Madison as you take a look at The Talented freshman the two prizes of Earl Grants class Prince salip Bay and Donald and Junior its positionally elite Bay is likely to be the one to get a little bit more time this year and certainly impressed as weve talked about in that opener a lot of new recruits coming in for it oh Brad trying to put them in three balls stone is good second three for Jayden stone that ends the scoring drought both ways of over two minutes and gives Detroit Mercy a threepoint lead again Kelly on the drive gave it up Pena double team Music come a great play by playing if I open up that threepoint line and Madisons been feeling it today thats a smooth shot The Far Side Madison who is brought in kind of fill that Brevin Galloway roll from last year threepoint shooter 35 for his career at Cincinnati to the bucket Phillips no followup yes that is why coca the grad student who came in as a transfer from Tulane originally from South Sudan who went to high school with the fame the Patrick School in New Jersey and Detroit Mercy back up too late long three balls Music with his first career points well two freshmen go down one freshman Rises thats Chaz Kelly a big three there for the Eagles to stay this one in stay in this battle with Detroit Mercy Earl Grant was really impressed with Kelly in the preseason runup to the year and how he has the ability to come in and kind of spell Zachary at the point guard position a little bit foreign Music the old double bounce pass kick to Moss passed on the three instead on the drive its out of bounds good defense by Kelly Madison had 30 career games played at Cincinnati 39 points per game right now up to six points for BC on two backtoback green pointers eight points now for Madison with that following through that last three so many six nothing run here for Boston College and theyve knocked down five of their last seven from the floor after starting just one of nine Anson off the mark this time and Kyle looked Greener into the game the first time the Junior from Detroit has the rebound Music Davis is going to work against Zachary pull up elbow in and out theres Davis to afford his strike but heres some turnover dummiese Anderson got in the way and Davis kept the handle after running harder to Madison but then lost it but Ty Ashton Lankford on the seal and on the run but couldnt hit the layup and then Makai Ashton Langford tried to take it back and commits the foul good pays here defensively for the Eagles as Boston College keeps the hands active everybody knows Antoine Dave is going to try to get his looks they keep those hands active in the paint they cause the turnover for Antoine Davis weve been talking about finding more support its a good a good idea to not take those long threes anymore right you gotta go try to find different looks so it gets inside those inside the arc but just couldnt find that shot and take a look at our mighty mighty another freshman who did not play against Cornell but getting some action here today first career appearance there is so much potential in that young man well Grant said its gonna take a little bit of time its gonna have to continue to play hes only played basketball since 2017 in terms of organized Ball but as a 73 wingspan so youll take that see if you can figure it out its a bell emphatic tap on the sideline there by Earl Grant to Zachary thats beautiful there this is what Earl Brown wants he wants defensive minded basketball create turnovers frustrates your opponents if you see there Antoine Davis has been trying to find a spot here on the court in the last couple of sequences Boston cause not giving him any room so at least in the early going Boston College has kept Detroit Mercys best player a little bit out of sorts and with that kind of score its kind of those little wins thats all youre kind of looking for because you know hes going to get his points Zachary but 10 to shoot and a foul that is Jayden Stone reaching around picks up his first personal and sends us to a Timeout on the floor that Eagles run still holding up despite the spike committing to valve on one end its four it took a while to get up to Boston College that was Prince Elite Bay going down weve been told by Boston College athletic Communications Department he will not return Donald and on the other hand this one you see him going down he has returned to the bench area and is available to continue so a league Bay is not going to return today hand remains available for Earl Grant tough break for Prince Elite Bay let himself right the game in that opener against Cornell but oh Grant built this roster so that he can have some players come off the bench in response and well see who Rises through the occasion here today in game two of the season for the Eagles so under eight minutes remaining 1915 is the lead for Boston College Detroit Mercy has not scored in nearly three minutes Ashton Langford no bigger stuff yes and he is absolutely bleeding up on the offensive boards that is six offensive rebounds for TJ bickerstown now a lot of them have come following shots or getting set up in that paint area good vision of the court and a good job boxing out to get those rebounds Davis somehow held his feet in and knocks down the three up to eight points for Davis that was a catch in the NFL and college he kept both in Tempo definitely at a much slower pace for Boston College which they arent content with heres Bickerstaff inside know that Mighty at the rim and he was affected by Coca Music other end stone is fouled well Antoine Davis you said it Eric nice catch here on the attempt to steal by Zach has plenty of space and then lines up that three and hits it also Jaden Stone on the far side drawing the foul Stones been one of those players too for Mike Davis this year and in years past to kind of help alleviate some of that pressure off of Antoine Davis James Stone as we said a career I15 in the game against Rochester played 30 Games over the last two seasons since at Grand Canyon University in stone averaged about three and a half points a game but a former McDonalds AllAmerican nominee and thats kind of a theme when you look at this roster a lot of guys that started their career and high major programs that were pretty highly touted out of high school like Davids kind of saying look theres a reason for that on a lot of these guys so theyre trying to find lightning striking in a bottle here on one or two of them there with Davis and he got a chance three nice take you know we mentioned all the grand Brad transfers six this year eight in total and tough to build a culture and a program with so much of that he alluded to that say Hey the first couple years were a little hard and then you got hit with the probationary period where it couldnt really do much so this this team is finally becoming the Mike Davis team that he wants and is trying to establish their Detroit Mercy heres some of the players coming in for the portal on this Detroit Mercy team and again for some of these players that might have been their second School something like Jordan Phillips who started in Arkansas before going to UT Arlington or TJ Moss who started his career in South Carolina and a year at McNeese State before coming for a grad year here at Detroit Mercy Zachary in the paint on no and Davis the rebound oh continuing that point four players returning from last year you got your three new freshmen its its a building progress Mike Davis Dave is shooting over Zachary and was affected at The Rim Kelly back the other way for Boston College with a threepoint lead under six remaining Kelly couldnt finish at The Rim and then this is out of bounds and in fact a foul was called College theyre going to get the foul on Kelly for reaching over the map yeah I think exactly that right here Kellys gonna try to make a play to keep this ball but puts it oh Im right there you see that arm wrap around the body of TJ Moss kind of drags them back and thats what the official calls so Detroit Mercy ball from under the bucket second foul on Chaz Kelly Armani Mighty also out of the game for Boston College Kenya and Metson back in for old Grant Music a couple of times here from the Eagles Davis Around the screen and what a flying rebound attempt that was by arrested Parts into the game for the first time and then Bill Covington Jr one of our referees went crashing into the cheerleaders but looks to be okay and even has a smile as well rashma Parks just comes in you see Pena was going into that Far Side along with Anderson this was just trying to get out of the way there nowhere to go on that one good hustle play there by Pena to try to keep that ball stepped on yeah it was okay so Pena stepped on Covington shoe lets give a little thank you to the cheerleaders from this building the first two games of the season they had the bigger stab block on the other end which got knocked into one of the cheerleaders on the other side Smiles down certainly have a story Adam so I think theyve theyve had difficult Falls more difficult Falls in that one that foul by the way on Anderson his second in the seventh on Detroit Mercy which sends Boston College to the line for the final 5 22 of this first half but Pena cant hit those 101 is so important you got to make them count appointments free throws for the Eagles today as well a few percent at the line Davis trying to get around bigger staff kicks Anderson three ball is strong and that rebound will stay here a rashma Parks was once again in there with bickerstown yeah it looked like it hit off the hand of thickerstaff went out of play recent Detroit Mercy do a better job protecting that paint and not giving up so many defensive and offensive rebounds on either side of the floor speakers down may have lost a contact its like hes got it back in and its okay to carry on its always hard with sweaty eyes getting that contact lens in let alone the pressure of having thousands of people staring in here battle on Pena on the drive by George Phillips its a good job to just utilize the space Davis Kind of floating around the top of the key opens up that middle in a good drive there by Jordan Phillips weve seen him kind of Drive strong to the rack as well if I get some points on the board for Detroit Mercy foreign stocks down the free throw Arkansas is a freshman played in seven games and in the last two years at UT Arlington where he averaged seven and a half points a game for last year as we said just three games before the injury here at Detroit Mercy I had an efficient day against Rochester five for six from the field two for three from the threepoint line second career DoubleDouble adds it locked three oh good and erasma Parks has made an impact on the glass since coming into the game for Mike Davis surpass the Greer lost it on the drive and that is out of bounds stepped on the timeline Music yeah this is a good rotation of the ball by the Titans that one just bounces off on the tip and looks like it is off the hand right back to Boston College it goes to Langford back in for BC a foul called underneath arm was starting to extend for bickers staff but it appeared he held up enough to draw the defensive foul yeah you saw a rascal Parts just get there a little bit too late try to reposition himself when bicker staff caught the ball inside the paint just a little too late there on that adjustment so thats what leads to a block and foul more than a charge if he stayed straight that first time and didnt move thats definitely a charge going the other way so picker staff back to the line the first one DJ bickers dab was just two of five at the foul line in the opener against Cornell last years 66 percent remember HA Oliver who picked up 3 000 the first four minutes of this game and he has been out ever since that point for Detroit Mercy Music shorten the bench there for Mike Davis and trying to get some more players and thats why we see Parks out there now taquerias have the task against Davis most of the time boss thought about it eight to shoot on the drive off the window yes and the foul TJ Moss with an impressive take ends a three and a half minute drought without a field goal or of Donald hand Jr trying to have his own like Mike Bowmans at Boston College and we will get to know him and more of the Boston College basketball team coming up at halftime as well as conversations with both coaches highlight stats and how many more that is our halftime report coming up here on acc Network extra you like my guy I do I mean you know at the end of the movie not to play spoiler he doesnt really need the shoes its been 15 years sucks some people forget to watch these great movies you know I think a lot of great basketball movies glories thats what makes it easier to watch too right you can just be on a road trip and watching a movie so like Mike is a great movie though its a one point lead now for Detroit Mercy after the free throw from TJ Moss foreign trying to go one on three for the rebound but TJ boss was there again for the Titans Stone in transition got the three that is 11 points here in the first half for Jaden Stone who scored 15 in the opener yeah he was a spark against Rochester anytime it felt like Detroit Mercy was falling into a little bit of a lapse offensively Stonewood hit a big bucket and get them going hes doing that right now fourpoint lead for the Titans double team comes and a foul is called on the reach in on a rashma Parks another great move and a good feed on the near side from TJ Moss had eyes up Court the entire time another big three you can see a three white jerseys all in the area of the fall and stone just slips a little bit and ends up wide open for the threepointer great start today for Jayden Stone and Detroit Mercy who has answered Boston Colleges run whipping six nothing run of Their Own streaky game weve seen Boston College 57 from the floor now one for their last seven for the floor for nine yeah another rebound Zachary is good Music big rebound massive three these Eagles back within one CBC kind of upping the temple defensively now getting the players as soon as they come out and this is turned over and well go back to Boston College youre just joining us prince alipayo its such an impressive opener on this play earlier kind of came down awkwardly Prince Philippe will not return is the word from the Boston College athletic Communications Department Donald hands Jr who was also injured earlier in the game he has returned he has not yet appeared in the game but is on the Boston College bench and is available now some precipitation on the floor so they will get that sorted out here with 248 to go in the first youve seen CJ Pena step up and you see McLaughlin to check in just now in the last couple of minutes so DC trying to find that replacement for elite Bay but theyve done a good job just trying to keep the tempo and keep this one closed Detroit Mercy is under an even better job just kind of not letting the the crowd and the atmosphere kind of get to them and and come to this game against Boston College ready to play not phased by the ACC opponent in front of him a lot of folks maybe have the day off today for Veterans Day have come out some families as well great to see salute all the veterans who may be watching out there and thank everyone for their service to our nation and allow us to enjoy basketball games also worth noting theres Demar Langford who was in the layup line pregame and warmed up was expected to be a game time decision for Boston College today we have not seen him yet there is Kelly on the jumper so at some point here speakers dab going for the rebound out of bounds itll go to Detroit Mercy BC is down quick pose down tomorrow Langford we have not seen to end we wont say down Donald hand Jr yet but we have not seen him return to the floor and at some point it just becomes a numbers crunch of a lot of different bodies missing for Earl Grant yeah and thats when you kind of put the people out there in a position where theyre playing a lot of minutes and you you worry about kind of putting a lot of knowledge into unconference player right especially with this season the basketball season being so long extending from now up until March so you want to be smart about the rotation youre using and and the bench the bodys on the bench tank youre taking off Music thats why Im a little surprised Grant is going with the full court kind of man to man picking up a little bit beyond half court as weve seen Music so one point lead Detroit Mercy Music and theyve done it despite just eight points from Davis a lot of its been stoned is off the mark of the two that was nearly turned over but kept alive and now its bigger Scout 20 to shoot for Boston College picked up the dribble needs help from Zachary Kelly inside for Victors death making his move against Parks goes up right hand Music its a really great job just not rushing the play by TJ Bickerstaff a couple times he gets the insert doesnt have any options doesnt kick it out this time he decides hey hold on let me create the space nothing there nothing there let me just put it up gets the contact gets the N1 thats a big play by TJ Bickerstaff and that by the way is the third foul on a rash of parks so three fouls on AJ Oliver three fouls on our rashma parks for Detroit Mercy a lot of their size foul trouble as we get close to halftime here we saw Oliver head to the bench early on with those three fouls youll see Parks head to the bench now Music and one good for Bakers Jeff nine points for TJ pickerstaff and now here are the Eagles putting on the full court and hes up and missed in the rim great effort from Matson creating the turnover and then couldnt finish at The Rim and its a twopoint lead Boston College with 94 seconds remaining first half Davis got around Zachary floater is good another double bigger game for Antoine Davis 113 consecutive games with at least 10 and Davis whos actually grimacing a little bit for Detroit Mercy on defense here Zachary cant hit the runner Davis chopping it out right now for the Titans Phillips caught it in stride got rid of it Moss for three no good rebound on the ground and kept Alive by Kelly with under a minute remaining first half thats in for three Austin College 5 of 14 from behind the yard quickly the other way in transition short and Phillips has six points and Mike Davis will use the timeout four in a row for Detroit Mercy and a twopoint lead again for the Titans thats what makes Davis so dangerous give him a little bit of space and hell cash in Zacharys done a great job defensively one of the best scorers in NCAA basketball and he just moves to the left gets a little bit of space Fades away and hits that shot hes headed 113 chasing Chris Clemens and Lionel Simmons for the alltime record hes now third alone passing Danny age for consecutive games with double figures scoring and that is as you see there the alltime NCAA record blow that away you see Davis there at a follow through right there its kind of in between Zacharys but I dont know if you can see with the yellow shoes in between but steps right on the rest foot so Grimace is on the way up the court thats kind of what you were alluding to is just shaking it off on that last play dangerous game today got the foot stepped on Phil Covington Jr had a footstep Don earlier everybodys got to be on high alert today 436 seconds to go first half twopoint lead Detroit Mercy out of the UTM timeout Zachary on the drive gave it up thats it three ball destroyed Mason Nets in with 11 points here in the first half and Boston College takes the lead back by one shot clock is off here at the end of the first half and that was nearly thrown away by over here and tracked it down six to shoot in Daviss hand step back three way short rebound underneath and the follow is good and thats how the first half comes to an end so the rebound inside after the Miss and Detroit Mercy will take a onepoint lead to the halftime break yeah Jayden Stones gonna follow the shot great defense by Madsen to fall out Donald hand Jr who we saw was injured earlier in the game went to the locker room came back he is on the right now were told he is available to come back though we have not seen him on the floor since the Eagles a little bit shorthanded down a point Detroit Mercy has tucked it out to this point and we begin second half from Conti forum and appreciate you joining us here on this Friday afternoon and that is an offensive foul and Detroit Mercys going to start to have some battle issues here because that is a moving kick against demisi Anderson and that is his third fouls the Detroit Mercy has three players with three fouls Lewis Oliver Anderson and Parks all with three Ashton Langford pull up jumpers and the Eagles back on top yeah youre talking about size out on the court right now for Detroit Mercy you see Parks Oliver Anderson all bigger players here for the Titans that are going to be sitting on the bench sporadically here during the second half to try to limit their fouls and hope that they dont get you know fouled out basically that was the first point game for Makai Ashton Langford for Boston College Stone was inside the ark cant make the two but an offensive rebound belongs to Anderson and now Andersons got it back and hes got a three demisei Anderson his first points of the game are three big ones thats the Detroit Mercy team that last year was seventh in the nation and first in the Horizon league and threepoint field goals made and 24th and 30 percentage Ashton Langford to answered and a quick five to begin the second half her response you said hey first couple points now hes starting off the second half with a little bit of a streak here foreign there defensively against Phillips Davis just grabbed it over Zachary dont look past Anderson straight on and no good offensive rebound though AJ Oliver Anderson trying again and hes got it demisi Anderson with backtoback triples now he hit five against Rochester had 17 points he can shoot the three bow he told you even though these guys are big theyre good at shooting Zachary spinning in the lane at his fouled I said it tops in the nation last year in threepoint shooting Thats Mike Davis thats kind of the game plan this year thats Anderson for three and then Ashton Langford a beautiful shot that last foul went against Jaden Stone that is his second and sends Jaden Zachary to the line seven first half points for the Boston College sophomore CNBC take it to the rack a couple of times and try to adjust which arm theyre finishing with I like to see Zachary just go up with the left on that one no dont need to adjust it on the way up or mid mid jump nine for Zachary we are tied 40 apiece two minutes in second half Zachary picks off clean to the bucket lost it momentarily as Anderson got a piece but its around for Ashton Lankford who couldnt control it and its out of bounds Music and a good defense by Zach we we talked about kind of Earl Grant utilizing the full court press or the mantoman press and its benefited him defensively on multiple occasions weve seen BC pick up at half court weve seen Boston College pick up full court here they try to guard the inbound and then Retreat a few steps and Detroit Mercy and a tie game here each team want to know to start the year Davis waited then on the second half effort is off the mic from three Phillips grabs the rebound though or offensive board here for Detroit Mercy in the second half and that three is good Jaden Stone for the second game in a row has their career high thats six team points for the Grand Canyon University transfer huge just huge good good eye position there to see that he was still inside that coin with plenty of room lines up the three quick shot by Stone paint me up for three thats too strong threepoint lead Detroit Mercy Music Davis against Ashton Langford yeah Langford caught flatfooted there defensively commits the foul you see here right there just a little bit of a drive and then Stone you talked about it just having a great start to his career with Detroit Mercy good look there to make sure he was inbound and then the quick release the team that likes to shoot the three ball they were really good at it when they fall down Louis thats the third foul a Makai Ashton Langford Earl Grant is going to leave him out there and he may well have to because at this point Boston College meets his scoring long two Oliver gnome and here comes Ashton Langford another run right down the lane seven in the second half for Makai just part of the Seas there and found the lane took it to the rack other end Phillips gives it up to a wide open three its Oliver points of the game for AJ Oliver if youre playing just four minutes and then after the fact there was a foul call I believe looks like a technical foul is being assisted AJ Oliver so oh flop on AJ Oliver so what they do indeed call the foul this is one of the new rules in college basketball this year there is no more warning for a flop it is an immediate technical so one free throw and its made by madsic but yeah the official came over and said it was one free throw for the flop Music looks like he had some words to say there after the shot went down so the administrative technical which again does not count as a personal foul which is important because remember Oliver is playing with three so he does get his first points to the game but then Matson makes the free throw at the other end threepoint lead Detroit Mercy Ashton Langford got up in the air and tried to throw the pass with his left hand and then a foul here and that was McLachlan who picks up the fountain another good hustle play there by Stone as well to get involved in that play the extra effort to try to create the turnover is gonna go back to Detroit Mercy Music or liquid on the floor so well get it cleaned up and add some precipitation on the floor today it is a scorcher for this time of year in the Boston area outside over 60 degrees in the second day in a row 4643 Music Detroit Mercy four for eight from the Florida strike this second half PC three for four Davis gave it up Anderson three ball is good demisi Anderson with three second half triples thats why Davis just kind of look at him said shoot it and he shot it and he put his arms up Davis did knowing immediately he was going in largest lead of the game for the Titans at six and then a ballot the other end on the drive from Jaden Zachary and Anderson is down on the floor right now well check on him when we come back hes been huge in the second half for Detroit Mercy Music Applause start to use his passing ability to help out Anderson and then on the other end they understand commits his fourth foul and then right there oh awkwardly down onto the floor yeah just tangled up with Zachary there but you talked about Davis and just his vision today right Im not gonna lie a lot of people think hes gonna go into a game going from 25 plus 30 plus but today especially has been unselfish play finding the open player trying to guide his teammates into the right position you know a lot of players a lot of people think that Davis might be a second round maybe a late round pick in the second round or might get signed to a g League contract he continues to work on his game hell go up those rankings and maybe on somebodys board one thing that Mike Davis talked about in our call this week was one of the things that Davis was focused on in the off season was bulking up a little bit being 10 pounds said he probably still is even 10 more pounds to go heres McLaughlin nice slip and instantly crude remember Makai is playing this second half on three fouls for Boston College Detroit Mercy and their own foul trouble with three with three including Henderson to his fourth house this is one of those with three waited for McLaughlin and tries the foul great job here for Ashley Langford on the drop pass and a McLaughlin on the Finish thats kind of what BC wants especially from the point guard draw the defender and the help side e open up the lane for your forward or your Center to get through hi rainbow free throw is Good from erasma Hearts you see Anderson trying to test out that leg see if he is okay to try to make a return he probably was going to come out anyway on four fouls but thats an important piece three threepointers in this second half Detroit Mercy is five for seven from three in the second half 10 of 22 for the game and two free throws for parts his first two points right Mercys done really well is just force BC is into some tough shots BC has not shot over 40 at all in this game yet theyre stuck at 39 right now Chaz Kelly back into the game for Boston College Ashton Langford well was short trying on the pullup Runner boss train transition got rid of it to Oliver into the paint double team comes has to get rid of it around from us spinning in the lane nice job by Ashton Langford to stay with the play here despite all the histrionics yeah smart move not to buy into all that stay with the ball a little contact there at the end of the play by parts Detroit Mercy up 5145 that will stay here 56 to shoot for the Titans okay you got to be impressed with Zacharys defense on Davis plays up into double digits but Zachary has forced that ball out of his hands a lot of the time Davis two to shoot got it off with short Eagles if LDS one Davis without a point in the second half Music 11 points for Boston College got to get him going use him in the post to try to get some balls on the outside open up some shots hes been big defensively and on the offensive boards its already a doubledouble again for Bickerstaff nearly has a doubledouble of just offensive rebounds that is a health ball and that is going to Boston College Music well Tatum Zachary his defense gonna lead to some offense here good job staying in position in front of Davis and then bickerstaffs gonna feed him feed Zachary in transition and then bicker staff with the follow its a great job and then on that last play its Chaz Kelly with the active hands to create the turnover eight of the ten rebounds for TJ bickers down on the offensive glass Zachary lost it out of bounds going to Detroit Mercy foreign just kind of confusing the offense coming down the court Detroit Mercy and Boston College weve seen a lot of kind of sloppy play where balls just kind of hit off the hands when they go out of out of Play Its credited to that defense it makes you think twice about what pass Youre Gonna Make Or if you even have that open shot selection oh teams have shot the ball relatively well here in this second half just not a whole lot of attempts Detroit Mercy 511 all five of those from downtown Austin College five for eight Anderson playing with four fouls and he has 11 points all of them in the second half thats a good job by Detroit Mercy exploring exposing the Zone there for the Eagles finding that open soft spot with a nice little touch shot by Anderson Zachary into the corner thats in three Phillips on the rebound and a foul will go against Boston College foreign looks like it was going to pop out of the hands there so he tried to reach in for it unfortunately just got too much hand contact and all for a follow there that your partner actually the third foul on McLaughlin for Boston College Music Phillips backing down Victor South Phillips short and McLaughlin a powerful rebound Ellies run the point quite a bit again we have not seen Donald hands since the injury in the first half he is on the Boston College bench but has not yet appeared back in the game next in for three that is good Music with a BC high 15 including four threepointers biggerstaff getting a hand on that drawing the defense in opening up that shot from Madison a little fake from La Greer Stone on the drive oh what a move Jaden Stone up to 18 points quickly down the other NBC three ball Kelly is Tucson Music Stone to answer on the other end was short on the long two offensive rebound though Phillips Stone on the drive and hes got it Jayden Stone 20 points to lead Detroit Mercy and this is the lightest lead of the game for the Titans Zachary handoff but clocked in goes up strong but cant hit it and then its lost out of balance by Stone so Boston College will keep possession Detroit Mercy without a point from their leading scorer in the second half led by 20 from Jayden Stone hes Stone James dont play two years at Grand Canyon before transferring over to Detroit Mercy at a unexpected loss in his family last year wants to be a little closer to home and hes found a good place here at Detroit Mercy under Mike Davis right now fighting his role in this offense the leading scorer for boutiques set a career high with 15 points in the opener against Rochester has exceeded it already today with 20 and the fact that Detroit Mercy is holding up without points from Davis in this second half is perhaps the biggest surprise of the afternoon but even in saying that credit Davis with three assists in this second half doesnt get talked about as much as his scoring but Daviss sixth alltime in assists theyre still Instagram history as well sorry Eric but still missing Gerald Liddell trying to figure out when theyre gonna get him back into the lineup Ashton Langford to the pocket that one went through and got stuck on top of the rim but count the bucket for Ashton Lankford who has all nine of his points in the second half for Boston College and Eagles are whipping by Anderson there just goes up to fix the net instead of waiting for them to come fix it trying to get the play going keep that momentum going forward remember Andersons playing with four fouls parks at Oliver with three for Detroit Mercy Ashton Langford and McLaughlin playing with three fouls for Boston College its 40 remaining five point lead for the visitors Music Swan Davis with his first points of the second half and Detroit Mercy with its largest lead of the game now at eight this is what Mike Davis wants you want to be able to space the ball around get different looks to your offense Pena on the drive got it off the window CJ Pena with five following up his 15 points in his Boston College debut on Monday Donnie Mars assistant coach for Detroit Mercy is working these guys out before the game its an intense workout cocoa blocks but glockton was there and this one is saved by Zachary Music Music and thats the fifth foul if its indeed on Anderson which it is Music thats a big guard theyre big boy that youre missing now for Davis its huge defense here by McLaughlin to come in Block that ball onto the shot and then stay with it on that followup attempt there by Phillips foreign this is huge for Boston College to get Anderson out of the game at 67 thats a big presence down low and his threepoint shooting ability is also one of the best on this team for the Titans so you take out two two big components on your offensive your defense what a second half for Anderson at 11 of udms 26 points in the second half but now is out with five belts Zachary on the drive and the Eagles are back within four well in that time he goes straight up he absorbs the contact goes straight up with the right hand he didnt try to adjust to the left or try to spin away his body just go straight up to the rack put that ball in the hoop Zachary matching his output on Monday with 11 points so far this afternoon Davis launching that was well short and that one out of bounds off the shot and the Eagles have possession its not a rhythm shot that you see Mike Davis on the Detroit Mercy bench you want to find set up your offense its been whats working for you so far here in the second half establish the set play and find the open player you dont gotta rush anything you still have a lead here once again a nice environment inside Conte foreign oh baby eleven in the second half for PCs leading scorer wow Detroit Music thank you Eagles have scored the last six theyve needed their big time scorers for the second half foreign here for the Eagles today Zachary with a great finished Strong finish and then Aston Langford rocket Connie forum sometimes you eat your stars to step up in games like this and even if it isnt a perfect performance all the way through Langford a little bit about trouble the first half did not score in the opening stem Zone but has 11 points on five of 11 shooting all in the second half and remember doing it all with three pounds a distribution of wealth as well Madison up on points as well for Boston College hes had some big threes up to 15 points leading the team allaround effort for the Eagles thats what theyre going to need to finish this one off remember Detroit Mercy is without demisei Anderson who fouled out of this game after 11 points here in the second half twopoint lead Detroit Mercy you see on a sixnothing run seven to shoot Stone leading the Titans and scoring three ball not there and it sits home Kyle legrrier called it its his first two of the game yeah played in eight minutes against Rochester they didnt see a lot of action in that game but was impactful when he was out on the floor Zachary on the drive got it 13 for Chase attack range is playing with a whole lot of confidence to start this season foreign elbow jumper no all things considered Boston College has done a nice job on Davis and a foul here with Ashton Langford charging down the floor now on Antoine Davis twopoint lead Detroit Mercy 7 42 to go Music see this week and one of the things he said was the reason he wanted to schedule this game he started trying to schedule it a couple of years ago was because he was good friends with Boston College assistant coach Chris cheeks who was on the previous staff with Jim Christian Chris cheeks who passed away earlier this year so Mike Davis said this was going to be an emotional trip in for him last year his team played at Northeastern he had Chris in to talk to his team and means a lot for Mike Davis to be here they didnt get this game set up while Chris cheeks was on the staff but it means a lot for him to be here and he said its going to be a heavy couple of days for him absolutely an honor to to come back here to Boston and play where Chris cheeks was able to coach and just two long time friends he was really emotional in our conversation this week and was able to kind of sit around the arena today on the BC bench by the locker rooms in the tunnel and just kind of take it all in and got to ask him about it he said its just its just good to be here whistle hearing a foul called on the Boston College and after the Zachary Miss from three so 6260 Detroit Mercy and that foul goes against Makai Ashton Lankford and that is his fourth so 717 to go Ashton Lankford was on three fouls for a while and played well but now has to come out with four and that will be something for Earl Grant to manage the rest of the way Eagles remember are already down three starters today Jamar Langford and Quint post did not play and Elite Bay it was out per game with injury earlier that was blocked at the ring and Zachary On The Run Chaz Kelly on the drive the loader is too strong foreign parts has the rebound twopoint lead Detroit Mercy looking for a first win over an ACC score since 1993 and were starting to make this point on Davis hes going to get his points this is someone who has been a first team all Horizon League player four years in a row he averaged 24 points last year its basically his career average so the fact that hes at 13 on 515 shooting in just three threes while double digit points doesnt necessarily feel like a winning kind of hits absolutely you talked about the defense Zacharys done a great job its the first time since 2000 since 2020 December 20th of 2020 and hes stuck at this at this level hasnt scored Zachary on the drive it stays out thank you back on the Run but careers stopped Phillips the drive its an offensive foul Music yeah it looked like the feet werent set there another great job by Pena getting into the big setting his body up stops his move and right there you see him kind of just set up stays still and draws the contact outside that Circle another great job and Zachary as well kind of staying on that side riding the side not pulling off and peeling off to to play Help side defense somewhere else just stays there to create some habit six 15 to go its been a twopoint game for a while DC has yet to tie it Zachary gives it off vickerstaff caught it tried to get rid of it out to Kelly after he was off balance it was taken away TJ Moss stripped to the other end and it is BC ball Music this is Zachary just coming back on the recovery its a great move here to cut to the right but and then Zachary just stays with it active hands again causes the turnover to go out of bounds you want to see BCU set something up offensively try to get this game tied or take the lead neither team has scored in more than two minutes foreign Antoine Davis with an excellent read of the pass his first points in quite a while its up to 15 for the game four point lead Detroit Mercy Kenya open three another rebound to rest the fights his seventh Music all right Davis pass was tipped but ends up right with TJ Moss seven to shoot moss on the drive finger roll no rebound and a foul with Parks going for the rebound and TJ fickerstaff is called he said Antoine Davis reads the play and this ones a good feed Inside by TJ Moss thats a foul on bigger staff but this is the Antoine Davis steal Jazz Kelly just doesnt see him kind of reading the lane there to get back on Madsen and thats one of those its a learning moment as a freshman trying to get that pass through to Madison with a lot of traffic in the way but the last two sequences for BC its been kind of sloppy passes theyre trying to get out of trouble and really passion to no one so we want to keep that up by the way both teams now are at six fouls so itll be free throws the rest of the way Music no good from three foreign Music Eagles have cut it to two but Detroit Mercy has yet to give it up I like this Earl Grant setting up a play calling a play for the sideline getting them settled up and set in rotation Zachary five to shoot lost the handle Davis on the run and the foul is on the floor against Metson who is not set yeah looks like Madison really wanted to get set before his feet wanted him to get set so Zachary on that end just losing it going into traffic but then here Madison wants to get set just continues to go backwards and that draws him to the floor Music first time to the foul line for Antoine Davis another note on his remarkable career we havent talked about yet he is an 89 career free throw shooter which is in the top 25 alltime college basketball history but he missed they call that the announcer James up to 486 on assist as well this year or last game against Rochester at nine assists so try to distribute the ball more foreign looking for 399 here on the road against Boston College to see some free throws from his Empire Antoine Davis wont help though amazing Hayden Stone back in the game for Detroit Mercy by the way its been out for a bit Zachary 10 to shoot Falling Away putting it the Eagles are all of their last five from the floor three turnovers for the Eagles in the last 406 its a very similar spot to where Cornell built its largest lead of the game on Monday night and they LED 7165 three ball Phillips was too strong the rebound is down to Matson out but its too far on the pass Madison trying to throw a home run and just let him a bit too far Detroit Mercy ball with the lead when we come back Applause our camera guy Joey just getting out of the way some good moves here you see right here how about panga as well what kind of sidestepping make sure nobody gets out hes good hes all right I think make sure that cameras dead Joeys been involved in some actions these first couple of games thats why you got the rolling chair 3 30 to 30 youre gonna have 6460 both teams all of a sudden have gone quiet we have not had a point in two minutes and 11 seconds Boston College has not scored in almost 5 5 minutes its still a fourpoint game Detroit Mercy has basically LED wire to wire here in the second half Music seven to shoot Davis got it but immediately had to get rid of it the parts just two to shoot Davis for three is off the mic excellent defensive sequence by BC and now Zachary on the run and an offensive foul by the way with Greer set himself up right outside that Circle and got his body in position right in front of Zachary as Zachary moves to see Greer just might have gotten there a second soon baby was still sliding a little Zachary with the head of steam does not get the benefit of the doubt on the call so its still at four and were at three minutes without a point either way with 240 to go this is seven to shoot Phillips against Zachary kept it alive a flying shot is off Detroit and out of bounds been some uh sequences the last couple of possessions and this one you can see kind of a wrap around right there grabbing Zachary was Phillips just trying to get that angle on the inside ball balances out so fortunately for the Eagles ball still goes for them but Detroit Mercy theyre so quick that sometimes they dont even need to put the arm out just get around the defender and get across so avoid getting called for a foul by just going straight to the hoop Detroit Mercy is one of its last nine from the floor BC over its last five five turnovers over the last six minutes come off her old Grant is ready he means business Ashton langfords out there with four fouls for BC Bakers death spinning inside off the window no but its out of bounds off Detroit Music marasma Parks up to a career high eight rebounds thats exactly what they need from him getting on the boards cleaning up any secondary chances on the defensive end six to shoot for BC so Earl Grant is going to use a timeout and draws something up back in 30 seconds with Detroit Mercy up by four to go we have not had a point in three minutes and 39 seconds Boston College does not have a point for more than six minutes but all can be forgiven on one Toronto play six seconds remaining on the timer both teams in foul trouble Anderson is fouled out for Detroit Mercy Makaya should light for the big one for BC is back in there with four fouls BC without Prince Ali bayu that large loss early on in this game Donald Penn Jr is available but has been used and then youre in foul trouble so you should kind of stick with the guys you got so this is how BC is going to finish the game with 202 left by the way it was a reset of the shot clock here reset to 20 so 20 seconds remaining on the timer 202 to goal in regulation Detroit Mercy 64 Boston College 60 Zachary off the handoff from Bickerstaff into the lane and he is fouling they are continuing to ride James Zachary it has not worked necessarily for field goals but he is clawing his way at the line where he is four for four this afternoon we had a great year last year 57 steals as a freshman was tied with Dana barrows the most IBC freshman in a barrel is doing a great job here in the local area building up Au programs with the new James and a miss at the room Boston Colleges last basket was Jaden Zachary hitting a jumper at 806 remaining Detroit Mercys only Basket in that sequence was at 5 41 remaining on the layup from Davis one of two at the line Phillips could not get it in and did not call for time when I think the frustration on Detroit Mercys side sideline is there wasnt no account there wasnt a visible count that they could see or when the start was counting oh when the start had started Counting yeah five motions with the arm so the Eagles great chance down by three Ashton Langford thought about it on the drive Akai dips It Off and the Eagles back on the Press its a smart move go give the ball to Jayden Stone put it in his hand allow Davis to move around and get free 90 seconds left Daviss hands with 10 Davis got his man of the air three ball belts is high not the balance bikes Music fourth foul on Parks this is good elevation there by Matson I dont think it should be on Parks actually should be on Phillips but this is Langford Ashley Langford a great cut and Bickerstaff a great adjustment there at the hoop with the defender coming at him to go right to left and put it off the glass and then down to the wire again that sin remember is at the line Mike Davis is going to use the timeout 118 to go Mason Metson is at the line Boston College down a point back in 30 seconds Music heres the thing about the good times the Eagles call that their freshman Prince Ali who hit the game winner with nine tenths of a second remaining the prayer from Nana did not go gave Boston College a 10 start to the season and it has been a dog bite once again to the finish in game number two 118 to go the Eagles have not LED this game since the 1849 Mark of the second half of 3837 its been a great game for the Eagles and Detroit Mercy going back and forth from the start each team Gorman runs weve got to see ant swamp Davis whos one of the best scorers in college but you also see the foul trouble that Detroit Mercy has found themselves in losing the means the Anderson in the second half arashva parks and AJ Oliver at four and three respectively they need to finish strong with 118 remaining here in this game Mason Madsen Music Boston Colleges leading scorer today with 15 points is at the lung DC is down by one in and out on the front end of a one and one and Detroit Mercy Music remains up 105 left Stone to the basket get it on 22 points its a threepoint lead and now Bill Covington Jr has called for time has TJ picker staff he is killed over in pain that looked like cramping up there for Baker staff get some assistance over to the BC sideline big presence in the paint that Im gonna head over to the BC bench see right there just goes up and immediately grabs at that left leg kind of locked up on him you certainly hope that bigger staff is okay if he is out and cannot return Boston College would be down four starters Plus one of their key bench pieces hand to while we were told is available we have not seen so we have to assume is not at the moment Indigo Eagles are down three each team just one of its last seven from the floor Music Austin Lankford on the drive to the bucket no but a foul plenty of time left for the Eagles to take the play and you see Ash Langford kind of take his time wait for the play to develop certainly did not need the three yet that Val was on Kyle look Greer the Junior it was by the way the ninth team foul on Detroit Mercy you see nine through 15 at the freethrow line its a big difference in this game which is decided by three points right now Music I think one for Ashton Langford matching his total of 12 points from the opener all of it in the second half remember playing with four fouls Music down to a onepoint game again with under 40 seconds remaining this is where if your PC you get a big stop you have plenty of time left to make a chance even if they draw down if Detroit Mercy draws down the shot clock you have about a good 10 seconds left in difference do you make the stop or you give up a shot unless its a three then it puts you in a difficult stop in a difficult spot but if youre able to stop them Ill hold them to a two its a one possession game and you have plenty of time to respond a couple of timeouts as well one timeout left for the Eagles to reset this has been as even as it gets Detroit Mercy LED Boston College by one at the half each team has scored 32 times in the second half the foul situation again Ashton Lankford playing with four for Boston College Detroit Mercy has been without demisei Anderson since Midway through the second half Parks was just called for his fourth bout it has not been an offensive Clinic to the end but it has remained close BC has gotten with it two has gotten within one but has yet to tie or get the lead back since the 1849 Mark of the second half and Antoine Davis 15 points hes grinded for each one of those points remember on this last sequence where BC was able to full court trap Detroit Mercy was called for five seconds into stone and a foul was called away from the ball against Manson third foul space in Madison free throws coming up that was the ninth team foul on Boston College good thing 6 seconds came off the clock there miss Balls gonna move into the front court at the freethrow line so it actually benefits BC that time isnt wasted here on this on this inbound play from Detroit Mercy so perhaps you trade a couple of points for time well see here Jordan Phillips for six and eight at the foul line in the opener on Tuesday missed crucial misses on both ends today Music about 11 second difference between a game and the shot clock Zachary on the drive pullup jumper he missed rebound Mark Clarkson with a huge board fixed it for three second half Music Music incredible offensive rebound by McLaughlin who finds a kayash Jim Lankford and Madison with his biggest shot as an eagle during that last time out Corey McRae was talking to McLaughlin about hey lets go we got this right hey giving him some confidence in the motivation thats a huge rebound on the offensive ends to keep that play alive and how about Mason Madsen he had a careerhigh 19 points against Eastern Carolina in his time in Cincinnati hes the leading scorer tonight for Boston College fifth threepointer of the game for Mason Matson and he is now one shy of a career high unselfish play for Boston College there so many leaders could take that chance McLaughlin could go for the putback master lane from Cole for the for the three they shoot unselfish basketball to find the junior new player to the program into the into the culture and you give it to Madison whos had the hot hand all day long this crowd gonna get lit for the last 153 twopoint lead Detroit Mercy has a timeout as does Boston College Music look Greer go in balance BC leads by two your BC you got to guard the threepoint line youre okay with the two not a three ten seconds remaining the premiere calling out signals five seconds remaining on the drive and the bucket its off Music foreign defense is a staple of Earl Grant and Pena moving into position draws the foul and gets the ball back for Boston College Boston College takes Davis away takes Stone away and Boston College will take a timeout I mean you have to think that that was not the design Detroit Mercy but credit Boston College for taking away the top few options for the Titans lets look one more time at this last sequence starting by the Boston College end from the offensive rebound to the Madison Bridge again just Madson finds himself in a spot that hes been so successful in his career hits that threepointer and they know the defensive side of the ball its CJ Pena or Boston College coming over on the help side d as beat draws the blocking foul shooting gets the charging call and AJ Oliver was out of position there on that last play so Mike Davis giving him an earful in that last timeout one to make sure that coming out of this timeout to get the right play 31 you gotta foul immediately make sure that ball doesnt Dig Down court or buy your last line of defense lets take a look at this one more time Davis coming around to scream there after the career was already on the drive so you credit Zachary for taking Detroit Mercys top option out of the play so now 31 to go Eagles are up by two and Eric on that play you actually saw where Phillips was supposed to go he drew the attention of CJ Pena to the left and opened up the Lane right there for Phillips but he went opposite to the threepoint line Pena will inbound Detroit Mercy will not guard the ball to foul immediately Ashton Langford they get it in and the foul from legrier Music and matthiased in Langford is two free throws away from punch again how about that after he dishes off the pass the game winner against Cornell by the way second yeah second game in a row its just beautiful basketball two for two at the line today Music all right foreign bite to The End by Boston College survives again Music Music Boston College did not
