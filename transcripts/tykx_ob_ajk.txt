and Georgia Techs coming in with a lot of guys being sick guys being hurt and you know you just dont know whats going to happen no Lance Terry tonight for the jackets hes their leading scor at almost 16 a game hes down with the flu but the sophomore Nate George gets the jackets started in their half court offense by Dongo of course on that lineup Duncan Powell as well and heres a quick look inside Ibrahim Suare and Mum a three to open the scoring and hes really been different since hes gotten the starting lineup and and so many guys out sometimes helps a guy like that he knows hes going to be in The Game and his confidence level is is way way up J shoot back on the floor for Virginia Tech to start the game tonight coach I know for me it was much different as a starter than it was coming off the bench as a play as a coach did you often times recognize that with guys that if they got going as a starter you keep them in the lineup yeah absolutely I think guys especially Shooters need to be out there the jackets who only average about s and a half threes a game and 34 from the behind the line a little less than that in conference play hit their first two threes but theyre glad to be back home after three out on the road an opportunity to play back in front of their home fans some comfort level theyve shown it here Damon stmy happy about the start that hes had here with his team backto back freeze on their first two offensive possessions and you didnt see that in the shoot around this morning they were clanging a lot of them up there and youre thinking jez they are theyre not going to make many and then here it is the game time comes and bang the first two threes go down it just changes your whole outlook and life really when you make a couple of those threes WD we got a guy that didnt do shootarounds for 47 years and now all of a sudden hes going to make that half input into a game exactly I should I really should be getting extra pay for coming to come to these shoot rounds I never did that thatll be up to you and the administration well that wont go well second for malija potit is good foul was on Dongo though and we got to keep an eye on foul trouble as it relates to Georgia Tech bigs tonight Ibrahim Suare and by Dongo start tonight we will not see Luke OBrien hes still on the Shelf with an injury heres Powell going to fire another one in hit so Duncan Powell out of Dallas the transfer from Sacramento state has got threepoint goals 17 and 18 to start for the jackets and I watched dunan po pal in high school he could not do that back then so major props to him putting in the work developing that threepoint shot and potit on a nice catch of the shoot delivery and meijel potit got all four hook points here in the first nearly two minutes and you know the coach that did The Scouting Report and said this isnt a good shooting team is hiding on the bench someplace Baseline sare goodness but no is down Ibrahim went down after the dunk yeah looks as though he may have tried to brace himself after the dunk didnt hold on to the rim holding that left wrist you hate to see that especially for a team thats already dealing with so many injuries yep is damus aomar comes out to check on and this is you know they either have a guy sick or a guy hurt almost every game yeah its hard to develop continuity with your team the longtime Georgia Tech basketball trainer is Richard Stewart out to check on Ibrahim Suare well as the only person here that may have any experience with this dunking when you jump off of one foot youve got to find a way to hang on the rim Suare unable to hang on the rim of course unable to get his balance Cory Im was a shooter WD but he was never Above the Rim that was his partner Dave B Im going to get need to get some footage of you dunking I just I find it hard to believe heres the thing coach you know I got a whole whole video display in my phone I show it to you whatever you need Im sure you do you see the details of Georgia Techs injury line almost 50 games missed combined with injury and were guys in the rotation yeah were just getting halfway through the season yeah were not even in the you know the latter third lwow misses the short jump hook early sevenpoint lead for Georgia Tech whos lost four straight five of their last eight and the colum lost it on the dribble against Jaden shot and a turnover for the jackets and Mike young is sitting on 399 a chance at 400 tonight and Jim you said this in our preview this is one of college basketballs best coaches hes an unbelievable coach there are not many coaches better than Mike young he knows what hes doing hes won at all levels and they just play hard they do the right things they get good movement all the things you need to do to be a good basketball team Hammond working against McCollum now poti Ryan Matumbo the son of the late great Hall of Famer D kimbe Matumbo has come on the floor defensively for Georgia Tech and a couple of misses by poque but you see the importance of getting the basketball inside for Virginia Tech theyre the only team in the ACC where their top two scores are in the front Court normally its the guards putting on the show as dapal continues to stay hot here from the start heres a guy that wasnt starting wasnt doing much and now all of a sudden here hes got eight right off the bat had 20 on Saturday in the loss of Florida State four double figure games in the last six for Powell theres a three by lewow and thats the play they talked about today they run that play and that guy is always open cuz hes screening and then hes stepping out coach thats one of the old school rules right the guy thats always going to be open is the screener 100 15th three of the year for Toby lewow and at the other end of the floor Hammond the foul but you see Toby B setting the screen and then immediately popping back Mike young talked to his team about that knowing that Toby the would be open and hes continued to improve on his perimeter shot this guy came in to VCU with a unbelievable athlete 48 in vertical leap one of the highest jumpers ever recorded in the game especially before it got a 69 heres the other thing he also came in VCU having only played two years of organized basketball out of the corner thats Johnson Tyler Johnson who had nine against Wade Forest had 11 and 12 rebounds at Cal knocks down the three and Tyler Johnson normally gets the majority of his work done on the defensive end trying to defend Duncan pal whos gotten off to a great start but he normally gets the most difficult assignment 12 to shooting a lot of movement off the ball as McCollum stands and holds it at the left fires a bounce pass at the tumbo Ryan working for position inside heres George two to shoot McCollum from the Georgia Tech logo back rim pow rebounds in a second chance heres Dongo hits Matumbo with the pass Ryan Matumbo hit first points of the game nice high low right there by Dongo recognizing and he had a look but didnt take it got a great shot instead of a good shot inside lewow against Dongo rebound by Johnson in the stick back boy good tough basketball from Tyler Johnson and that is a strength of this Virginia Tech Team the offensive rebounding theyre one of the best in the AC of getting Second Chance opportunities Georgia Tech and an early lead trim down to three jack pets have assisted on all six of their field goals so far 5 minutes gone heres Dongo the catch inside between potit and shoot and Bongo gets his first basket hes kind of struggled a little bit coach he strugg hes a guy that needs to strug you know needs to step it up he had a great freshman year hes been up and down this year and hes capable I think of much more lead back to five for Georgia Tech Rex Steiner playing near his hometown of a for Georgia hell lost for three and hit hes feeling comfortable right now WD yep home hes got about 70 family and friends here tonight yeah when you take that off the dribble three ball from that far away and still with a lot of time on the shot clock youre feeling good about things yep 70 family and friends is about half the crowd here as it snowed here yesterday and they dont know what to do now Nate George dumps in a three and all of a sudden neither team Miss from behind the line and I wasnt sure coming in we were going to see this type of offensive explosion from these two teams theyre not regarded as the better offensive teams in the ACC right now but they absolutely have been in the first six minutes Rex Steiner front rim Miss we havent had a break yet outside of the Fall by Suare heres Powell who started off hot backing down Johnson Fall Away by Duncan Powell off the back rim and shoot saves it for Brandon rexin somebody needs to move it down the gearbox a little bit not up in the gearbox way too fast maybe for both well wow another three got slapped out the Hoke the second shot potit around Matumbo out front another Rex Steiner three and that will finally be claimed by George but you can see the emphasis by the hokes to attack the offensive glass what a pass mum to Dono both these teams are playing pretty good offense for teams that have struggled offensively sevenpoint lead 7 Minutes gone in the first Music frame the two teams are seven of 13 from three Cory Johnson wants to add to it cannot recovered Jo Applause G Nate George is standing three air ball might have graze the rim sorry say give Nate a little bit of credit the the front of the rim notot not a lot heres Rex Steiner and now potit will H for Johnson laow another one back rim Miss and and re Steiner Scoops up Second Chance 8 minutes gone for Virginia Tech here Virginia Tech continues to P the offensive glass getting multiple opportunities again offensive rebound for laow unable to get it to go three opportunities alone on that possession for the hokes still coming away scoreless the colum walks it into the midcourt area here these guys have expended a lot of energy havent they Music now George tend to shoot back for Powell cutting into traffic with the right hand hell draw the Reiner foul and that will get us to the break well get a look at the jackets in transition here Cory McCollum delivers to Dongo Georgia Tech by seven when we come back to Music Atlanta when you just go Off the Bench you got to miss a couple shots all of a sudden youre back out so I think its just easier for these guys and hes very comfortable tonight and you know nothing but net yeah pal going to go to the line here for a couple of free throws the game started off so fast maybe even too fast Jim no I I mean you when youre not when youre coming home and you havent played well you get off to a good start you dont want to struggle early and if they hadnt been ready I think Virginia Tech would have jumped out on them yeah Duncan Powell already passes season average oh yeah in the first eight plus minutes of this game and now an opportunity to be able to have a big one here you mentioned 20 last time out in his first start of the season now in his second start off to an even better Rodney Browns checked in for the hokes thats him in the corner transfer from Cal heres Jadon young who was starting the last couple of ball games out front hell fire away and hit Jaden Youngs 22nd three of the year he was one of four from the floor in Saturdays lost to Wake Forest but knocks down a triple keep the hes Within Reach coach for both these teams when your teams start out shooting the three so well do you concern yourself with them falling in love with it a little bit you can but I you know you just you got to go with what youre doing well and thats what theyre doing well that time Virginia take a great movement down there and they got a great shot thats what they need to do brown leaves it for Rex Stein here is Ben Burnham he was driving inside wesler collects the big fell working against Matumbo and Suare finally kicked out in a third trck here for the hoks offensive rebounding has been a plus for the hokes throughout this game but multiple times theyve gotten a second chance opportunity just unable to take advantage of Applause them going to make layups they just missed two easy ones how about to look away there Mumbo lost it on the way up three and0 for for three in layups the last three Applause shots under 10 to go in the first half heres Rodney Brown Jr all the way to the basket and hell draw the foul on Georgia Tech and theyre only up six and they made a lot of shots and they had great movement and Virginia Tech is not shot as well as theyre capable so that is Darion Sutton by the way coming into the ball game hes not played since late December against Alabama AM so the last six games Cory this is a guy that was part of overtime Elite there was some expectation about what he might be as a rookie just playing for the sixth time here tonight in this first half but weve also talked about the you know the fact that there are so many different guys already injured and out of the rotation for Damon stomy unavailable to play so hes got to find healthy bodies that can come in and give him energy Sutton hopefully can do that yep that overtime Elite program is based here in Midtown and ATA yeah Atlantic Station right right about 5 minutes from up if youre lucky yeah well traffic depending on how beim want to talk about back way here you I know the back way I can get you over there uh Jaden mustaf who we wont see tonight hes missing a second straight game with injury Jack is trying to find some position here and Dongo fired a ball in between mustaf and Sut or between uh oh and theres the boot Club this is not what you want at any time and point in season is it been there done that and I can tell you right now nothing worse than sitting and having to watch your team and nothing you can do to help them yeah thats mustaf Luke OBrien and kaasi Reeves whos been out since uh early in the season and then youve got to of course consider the leading score Lance Terry out Music tonight yeah Terry under the weather after having a big ball game the other day at 23 at Florida State two to shooting Rodney Brown launches and hits 11th three of the year for brown hes got five off Mike Youngs bench and the hes to within one if youre Mike young youve got to really be happy where you guys are right now especially when youre considering the way Georgia teeken shot the basketball Sutton at 17 ft and here the other way goes the rookie Hammond Burnham and brown boy quick move to Young tried to get it to wesler turned it over and heres Su Darion sut trying to make a transition chance Sutton feeds he got it to Powell who then feeds Dongo good play I needed it nice ball movement on The Fast Break Sutton giving it up early enough to allow pow to make a play as dangos able to get the layup and Im with Coach I was expecting a much bigger jump from Dongo this year especially after such a strong freshman campaign a year ago he was really really good Brown another three Rodney Browns got eight which is his season High had in terms of the ACC had eight against Duke on New Years Eve but he watched guys knocking down threes while he was waiting to check into the game so therefore he knew once he got in it was going to be his turn to let it fly Nate George a three by Dongo gives Georgia Tech another chance almost Applause not out of the corner Sutton clutches spinning move on Burnham puts up the jumper WD I tell you what Su had played in a while but hes been aggressive once hes gotten on the court yep Im not sure that coach star like that but I can tell you what he did like he like when they got out in transition sharing the basketball Sutton finds Duncan pal who finds Dango for the beautiful threeonone opportunity and on the other end of the floor Rodney Brown getting his time and making the best of it here two threes for him early added the shooting that they didnt have the year before when Caitlyn Clark took down the game c two really exceptional coaches different styles but exceptional coaches yep no question two of the top five teams in the country obviously by ranking two of the real brand names in womens basketball coming up Friday afternoon at 5 were tied at 26 in Atlanta McCollum George Dongo Suare all on the floor Nate Jorge a foul onine jump shot got the friendly bounce and hes got five and that is the first unassisted Mayfield goal by Georgia Tech in this game so they went 13 minutes and everything was done off the pass that time n George getting into his bag and getting the bucket Jaden shoot back out there with lewow potit on the catch Suare and Dongo Dig Down defensively Rex Steiner into the corner there goes Johnson a three Tyler Johnson has hit thre six and seven on the year he had only had 19 attempts in five makes in the first 18 games but hes able to benefit from the double team from Georgia Tech going down to try to get the basketball out of the hands of poti coach Im s at times you had to come up with a decision as to whether you want to double guys did you often not fear the shooters on the outside to make that decision I didnt like the double team at all because every time you do against a good team a good passer somebodys getting a wide open three and so you try not to double team the NBA used to double team a lot and theyve stopped because theres so many good Shooters up there you rarely see the double team in the NBA you know heres the other thought about Virginia Tech real quick they are such a I mean its taking 18 games for Mike young to a kind of maybe get a chemistry gy well you got a whole new team and its its thats a problem with the the whole transfer portal system especially if youre getting guys that are just good players maybe not great players takes a little bit longer well you see 10 underclassman nine for BC nine for Florida State nine for Stanford Cory you saw a little bit last night Wake Forest is kind of in that area right just kind of finding out Omaha Baloo now back in the lineup that kind of thing Omaha Baloo was back in the lineup against Virginia Tech and then turned his ankle so he did not play last night and thats one of the areas that Steve Forbes has had to deal with the injury similar to what were seeing with damire here is uh Dongo going to work fell off the iron and Le gave Chase Dongo saved it huh but I love the Hustle by Dongo not conceding that going out of bounds trying to make a play tied to 29 you wouldnt have believed the flurry this game started with potit digging in and a travel on Elijah potit theres more double team pressure from Georgia Tech again heres the hustle yeah and thats one of course Dongo could have absolutely allowed that to go out of bounds but I respect the hustle from The Young F going over even though they did not come away with the basketball his teammates also can appreciate him going after such the double teams really potit really hurt him in the first game and they just come out and double team every time and I think its been a really good strategy George heres mum long three at the front and Lew the rebound re Steiner saw Suare way out there trying to help under five now to go potit and Johnson a three boy bad Miss there missed everything over the inline out of bounds quick reminder to you coming up at 900 Eastern tonight over on ESPN 2 another good one in the Southeastern Conference number 16 Old Miss host Wade Taylor I fourth and number 13 Texas AM tonight in Oxford on ESPN two 29 all here in Atlanta and thats a travel on Nate George and just that simple pressure hedging the screen and roll action 35 ft away from the basket forces the turn over but give the hokes a lot of credit theyve been jumping out blitzing those screens Nate George anticipating it and now an opportunity for the hokes to be able to add to their points off turnover tag M young swap some guys in and out here Jimmys got 14 bench points 15 points from his starters for his 29 and its a pretty clean game just a couple turnovers with each team so they theyve really been pretty solid heres Rodney Brown on back door lob and What A Catch and flush by Toby low you remember me saying this is why hes low he has the ability to climed I mean this guy may have and Coach youve only seen this from very few people he may have top of the backboard hops he gets up heres pal tried to shoot Georgia Tech back in front and d and then it turns around has a little something to say to the bench knocked up but Im sure they had something to say to him first yeah before he lined it up coach no doubt about it heres a steal ball got knocked away and that was Dongo again with a hustle play and then he forces the turnover and Rex line upset with theow because he didnt go for another lob on that possession Duncan pow whos got now 13 in this first half McCollum working around Rodney Brown Runner with a right hand bounced out brown and the hokes trailing one laow a three nope its a little better when hes closer to the basket George catch and layup for Dongo eight for by Dongo in the first half and you see Nate George continuing to drop dime drop down to second in the ACC and assist per game but already has four here tonight trying to get back in the number one spot yeah Tucky heurn passed him last night I mean they did the pretty much anything they wanted to do last night correct Louisville did at SMU heres the drive and the Miss Brown cant find the follow third third time three yep there Virginia Tech is in double digit offensive rebounds but they only have two second chance points thats been a struggle theyve gotten opportuni just havent been able to convert them got to finish those George attacked by three George heres Dongo the catch against lewow Powell on the drive layup good big game what a half for Duncan pal Cory he has been the offense for the Ramin wreck in this first Danza continues to add to the reason why Damar should keep him in the starting lineup Georgia attacked by five potit lost the handle on it last touched by the jackets so we the ACC at 62 per game looking to get back to that number one spot throughout this one but how about this w theyre only a plus 8 in ACC play on the season so a plus 10 already in the first half of this game coach you like those numbers right those are good numbers anytime you can do that turnovers kill you assist help you Hammond back on the floor with vernham and Jaden young and they whip it inside potit a quick bucket right out of the timeout great play set up coach young got him ready and gets a layout but heres the thing about that one coach the way they did it no opportunity need a double team oh quick too quick Dongo caught in a double team now five bounces inside what a catch in traffic and ibraim Suare who averages just 19 points per game has four in the first half and the third assist for Dongo dropping the dime right there in tight coverage James Forest the great former G Tech player whos with the team I know youre not going to say James forz pass the basketball coach was talking about forz no James put the ball in the back what he did as good as most Hs with a Miss heres Hammond right corner Burham thought about it out of traffic hoks trying to square it up with a minute to go in this first half back to potit with Ibrahim Suare defending and were going to get a whistle and a foul I believe on Suare 69 sophomore red shirt from kakri and guinea its his first its the third and of course Guinea is where mamadi diakite was from same area by the way as where Ibrahim sware hails from couple of free throws for poti coming up coach you were talking about James for talking about schare is that been kind of his project to work with throughout the season you know hes Im sure hes talked to him and you know hes hanging around giving advice and Special Assistant but uh you know you always look theres always one guy you want to pick say like this guys got to do more for us let me ask you this the guy on the left is BJ Elder Star of the 04 final four team at Georgia Tech James fars in the middle and bonsy Wells on the right Cory and I tell you what thats a big three right there and you throw that guy standing up at the top with him the point guard you got a squad right there Im going tell you that right now I dealt with all those guys hey and each and every one of them is a problem so so tell my metf we have a staff that could score absolutely Abby kremens B some pretty good players in here here we go wait a minute okay okay okay got you were just saying BR them I said brought them well brought we didnt hear the r well you you know youre not youre not paying attention George in the L for Dongo I think its going to get waved off really good play too yeah and the foul is going to be on Ben Burnham but the elusiveness in the assist game of Nate George I think is whats undervalued a little bit WD you wanted me tell you who Nate George got to work with this summer dont tell me you it would be me oh gosh well then why is he passing had opportunity to work with Nate well I mean again coach n think about this did I pass more or Dam stach uh yeah its close howwell inside for Dongo with a right hand and Burnham commits another foul then Burnham with two oh theyre not going to call that on Burnham beg your pardon theyre going to get Jaden shoot with his first itll be the fifth on the Hoke but I love the way the yellow jackets are looking for each other it started from the beginning we talked about it but now its almost as though everybodys looking to share giving up a good shot to get a great shot and that time turning down an open jumper to get an inside Tango he have two free throws when we return all right were going to have a 30 second break Jack out coach we talked about James Forest how much time did you spend in Atlanta trying to get him to come to Upstate New York too much another one of my loss is we got in the were close with him he visited had a great visit but I Ill tell you this when you recruiting him he was recruiting me I was on my way down here to play with him at Georgia Tech yeah then what happened and then Travis best committed while I was at Virginia on my visit Bobby KMS actually wrote about it in his book James Faris kind of let some shed some light on all that today he said I dont know who Travis best was and he turned he turned to C what did he say Jim Cory he looked he said I thought Cory was committed yeah I was thats the craziest part WD I was committed he said it was a soft commitment said it was soft I I will admit it was a soft commitment okay well talk about that in the second half Travis best went for 81 and Bobby said W I might want to get Travis best let me tell you what that did happen okay all right Kerens and go will text all of us here tonight oh yeah Jaden young final possession of the half the drive no whistle and with 26 left Virginia Tech down four is going to get the last crack here now malijah potit is quickly summoned from the hokei batch and the yellow jacket switched it up went to a Zone on that last possession trying to throw the Hokey out of rhythm still got a good shot you get potit back in to run this out of bounds play Georgia Tech CED with Ryan Matumbo trying to get it in bounds heres potit with one all away at the horn air ball short and they go to the half Georgia Tech got off to a blazing start Cory and they protect a fourpoint lead at the break they started out knocking down threes and sharing the basket of the Season interesting to see what hell be able to do with the adjustments of Mike young in the second half here goes potit back door off a shoot delivery perfect play and missed the layup yep mallum the other way the jackets trying to go for Tempo again here early and a back rim miss it got tapped out and heres Virginia you Tech the other way look at Ben Hamm and the Freshman dump it inside L while again seven for Toby lewow two starts two layups to start the second half thats a good sign for Virginia Tech thats the reason why Ben Hammond his is at the point guard position because he gives him a playmaker a guy that can find his teammates much more of an assist guy than Rex Steiner at the point of course hes another one of those guys that played that Powerhouse Paul v 6 program in Virginia last year and another one of those guys that won a BCM Championship alongside Donnie Freeman Darren Harris P gangba all coached by my God Jill Jones at Team Takeover a really tough shot there y but tell you what mum has a way to get to the basket doesnt he we showed him in our open WD hes a three LEL scorer a guy that can get to the rim of course he can shoot the three but put so much pressure on defenses getting to the free throw line as well yeah Jack gets by four again here in the opening stands of the half Nate George on the drive and had it knocked away as Hammond hit the Music deck geia Tech averaging 694 in League Play Virginia Tech right around that number both allowing toward 75 as you might suspect with their respective conference records theres McCollum and the Hoke he playing at hard manto man but we sit in the building we have our shot at Mike young in the defensive stance coach can you still get in the defensive stance not in that stance hes right down in there hes ready to go and it forced a turnover so it must work yeah its having a six defender on the floor yeah heres shoot doing that for three do what you do of course do what you were named to do when a last name shoot you dont have any other options Hoke to within one Jaden shot knocks down his first bucket of the ball game and a timeout taken one point lead now for Georgia te but Jaden shoot off the pass from Hammond draws it up for Virginia te so we talked to 3D at halftime of course Denniss Jersey was retired earlier this year by George attack joining The Luminaries here in the rafters at uh at mam Pavilion and uh Bobby kerans has also chimed in after hearing the uh story that was told in the first half about Cory Alexander and Travis best theres Nate George missing the three from the perimeter and Suare fell to the deck thatll be a travel that will send it back to the hokes now Bobby Kerman says Cory you were supposed to sign early and then changed your mind to sign late Travis was supposed to signed late changed his mind and one to signed early uhhuh kerans also sent three laugh emojis behind there is truth to that okay however the reason why I was recruited by Georgia Tech in the beginning is Dennis Scott thats right he actually we played pickup together when I was at Flint Hill at the end of my sophomore year he was the one that made the call to Bobby kerans that you need to come recruit this guy and the rest was history but this is where I wanted to come theres no question about it I wanted to be here but I had to make sure Kenny Anderson was leaving cuz I was not going to take that guy out of his starting spot you dont think no no Im pretty sure that one was locked up there three Ball Deep Jaden shoot off the back rim and what a rebound and put back from Tyler Johnson but a lot of we what we saw in the first half coach offensive rebounding but this time theyre able to convert it into Second Chance points yeah you got to make those and now theyre making it and the lead for the hokes at 4241 Powell trying to get Baseline George into the corner Suare not his area for offensive production and now heres George on the drive and draws the foul but one more return here Jim to the work of Tyler Johnson after the Miss yeah I mean hes just a physical kid almost gets away with a little one there but hes a physical young player that can shoot shooting a little bit today hes getting better their young players have a chance to be good they just got to keep positive during this season where obviously they struggle a little bit how about those numbers 12 offensive rebound only six second chance points but when you consider you have to love the effort from the hes going to the offensive class they average close to 11 per game so already over their per game average and I think its something that Mike young will continue to implore his young players to go to offensive glass heate George missed the first one this is the part where I tell you Georgia Tech is dead last in ACC play it free throws 649 and as Great Hall of Fame coaches will tell you theres three way ways you lose basketball games giving up offensive rebounds turnovers and missing free throw y all three Georgia Tech is five of their first eight theres the turnover were tied at 42 and Im not at Hall of Fame coach I just hang out with one all the time sophomore George gets it to Powell into traffic goes Duncan Powell too hard off the glass were going to get a foul on I believe Tyler Johnson for a push on by Dongo and we are going to get the break in the action first theyll discuss the foul just under four minutes or 16 minutes to play in this ball game tied at 42 in Atlanta last four tied at 42 and free throws coming up here for Duncan poell and of course the SEC with 21 nonconference wins against the AP Top 25 five teams in the top 10 you were in the uh in the SC a couple of weeks ago the depth in the league is impressive Cory for this particular campaign of basketball it absolutely is and Ill be in the SEC in another week in a half going to all Miss to watch Auburn who takes on Tennessee Saturday night and we had to call that the isnt that the Bruce Pearl Bowl I mean well meanwhile the SEC just figured out the nil early and got in heavily and its its all the difference in the world and thats what the ACC has to understand we got to get into this nil is the only way you can win yeah and the SEC did it and everybody in that league did it and they got good players and good teams period Lee Cassell and Matt Potter have come here to the uh monitor to our left were all tucked in here nicely along the scores table and I think the I think question hold on Im the one tucked in look whos in the middle like I mean you know getting in thats like getting in the back I got to be the guy riding in the middle theyre double checking here on the free throws and to double check the shooter and were going to give you a look at this so Powell is the guy who shot the free throws now the foul was on Tyler Johnson against Bayan Dongo so instead of pal who shot one of the free throws or mistakingly yeah so Mike young and his team being brought up to speed here after further review we had the wrong shooter 11 on the line for Two Shots okay so Powell will so so heres my question okay all right can we see that replay again sure um because was Bay and Dongo shooting no so again how do you have the wrong free throw shooter because Duncan pow took a shot right but Bay Dongo wasnt shooting and youre not in the bonus thats right okay so heres going up that should not be a shooting foul yeah youre right I mean I mean if if thats what if thats what were looking at because if the foul wasnt on Duncan pow I mean there was no possession of the basketball right there to make that a shot attempt for corre Bango so by rule that should have been just taking the ball out on the side thats correct too one of two for Don its a onepoint game everything you just saids accurate Rex Steiner on the floor Rodney Brown Jr has come out on the floor as well and a twopointer for Brandon Rex Steiner hes got five and theres Scott Steiner the Pro Wrestling Hall of Famer so I tapped Mr Reiner on the shoulder and said excuse me as I was trying to walk down the stairs earlier had I know it was him I would have just walked around I wouldnt have bothered and apologized yes and apologized for walking around him cuz I want zero problems with him big fella the column the Miss its a onepoint lead for the hokus 4443 Rex Steiner put him ahead heres wesler to work the Big Fellas come off the bench again Brown have them had seven really nice minutes in the first half missed the floater there Jack ISS trying to convert to three on two George thought about the catch and shoot three smart decision not to take that three though try to get a better shot thats what Georgia Tech has done throughout this game giving up good shots for great Shots part of the reason they were able to build a lead early and lost on the reach end heres a look at the rexer jump shot gets to the midrange and makes the right decision instead of trying to force a pass oh yeah thats why I want no problems yeah big p Im good yeah I want to apologize Mr Rex honor for being in your way while I was coming down the stairs threepointer no good wesler rebound I wish wed have had that mic Jim Cory apologizing I know thats hard to believe well take make sure we got an instant replay on that yeah heres Jaden young who had three in the first half this is where Virginia Tech started to kind of get back in after the floor very early wesler had it raped out of there thatll be a foul on Nate George Patrick wesler will go to the line but nice F by Rex Steiner also throwing that with the left hand off hand and recognizing the slip from wesler as he comes out slipping away from that screen that nice left hand finish George comes over knocks it away but thats a difficult pass to make through traffic and wesler is just part of the depth that Mike young employs Off the Bench and heres one of the differences tonight between the two teams theres no question about that the other thing is Virginia Tech done a great job on Powell you know you havent heard you havent seen Powell this first five six minutes of this half theyve just done a great job keeping him away from the ball Georgia Tech only got four points here in the second half one of five from the floor in three turnovers by the way a Miss free throw WD what we got going on here nothing I dont know doesnt matter nothing but the crowd got up got excited for a reason shooting right into the band theres got to be some something on two Miss free throws in the second half heres George in a twopoint Hoke lead feeds it inside and Suare is fouled so Ibrahim Suare whos four of 16 at the free throw line will go to the stripe here I would call that a good fou in yeah Patrick wesler first third on the h and Damon stmy team back to the strike where they are six of 10 tonight and here is Suare who did not play last year 73 wingspan he played with Nate George at Canyon International out in Arizona and the first one my bad looking stroke for a guy now five of 17 yeah and again you speak speak about Arizona of course Damon admire with heavy ties in Arizona not only one of the alltime greats for Coach Olsson at Ariz Iona but also on the coaching staff yeah for years there that rattled out and a line violation lane violation called on wesler oh give him another one so were going to have the old NBA 3 to make two for you beim nothing like it I tell you what I dont even know if I was alive when that was happening but coach baham absolutely was part of that you guys yeah we know yeah yeah well three to make two was around for a while into the 70s and such well once again I was born in 73 so and one of the three for but the offens of rebound by Duncan how about that and a foul and immediately Mike young going to his bench yep to get Lew back into the game Burnham commits his second its the fourth on Virginia Tech and now Duncan Pals going to go back to the line and this time hes going to be there for real free throw the opportunity to put two more points on the board but coach it was almost an automatic for Coach young right there uh Miss box out on a free throw not getting a rebound he didnt even have to see the rest of the play it was immediately get him out oh get him out Cory Georgia Texas now seven of 13 at the free throw line three of seven in this second half that is one of those three keys Ive learned from the Hall of Famer that cost you games not taking advantage your opportunities at the free throw line as well as turnovers and giving up offensive rebound how is four for six so hes got four of the now eight conversions tied at 45 lewow three ball from the left side young too strong they scramble inside Here Comes George attch Powell ahead against Rex Steiner throws it up on the glass and in but I love the recognition by pal seeing Rex Steiner back a much smaller guard able to attack using his size and strength to finish through the contact 19 now for Powell Brown thought about it or Suare really chases doesnt he Brown trying to take him into traffic turned over to Powell does not have numbers and made the right decision once again he saw too many jerseys of the opposite color back tries does not try to push it gives this team opportunity to set up offense Jen McCollum and the rebound for brown got to make those Ro Brown the floater and it bounces in wow 10 for brown hes been a positive Off the Bench for Coach young the bench points have been heavily in the favor of the jackets throughout the forgive me of the Hoke throughout this sure have and a hard move to the basket Dongo and the foul 192 advantage and bench points for the hokes but Nate George getting it done on the offensive end of the floor driving getting into the painted area and dropping another dime as he continues to chase back the number one spot in the ACC assist second foul of the half on lewow Georgia Tech goes back in front at 4947 and Georgia Tech picked up the defense too thats a big factor they get those turnovers off good defense not letting them execute and get the open shots and the and one no good for Dongo and young finally gathers Applause it and Rex Steiner almost saw it deflected into the back court heres Brown whos having his best game in the ACCC so far turned over on the stretch and down the floor George cant finish but draws the foul that was a great possession on both ends of the floor by Nate George getting his hands on the basketball knocking it away from Rex Steiner and then once again the deflection allows them to get out in the transition Nate George now has the opportunity to get to the free throw line to make it a two possession game one for two is Nate George at the line and hell shoot one free throw and then Mike Youngs got a line change uh Mike young did not like what he was seeing from that group turn over is not blocking out fouls yep hes changing everybody so here is George the sophomore from Toronto who was second in the ACC and assist last year and it looks like like still about 5 weeks 6 weeks left to go in the regular season looks like he and Chucky he are going to run this thing to the wire this year yeah and again thats a thats a battle coach that of force you love for your players want to have to fight out who can get the most assist thats not a selfish part of the game at all correct well hes a thats what he does I mean hes good at getting in the lane and P when he tries to score hes not there yet to score that will come but hes getting the ball to people and thats what you thats what a point guard does eight for George the lead is four almost 8 minutes in to half number two in Atlanta so his Zone defensively by Georgia Tech now switching it up on this possession Virginia Tech not really understanding whats going on kick out three ball for shoot and long rebound MLL defense picked up thats the difference heres jav and McCollum all the way to the basket and it goes time out rim run by the jackets and the lead is six Mike Youngs not happy with the defensive transition among other things here absolutely when you give up an opportunity to a guy thats averaging close to 17 points over his last seven games you know hes at the top of the Scouting Report cant allow him to get downhill and get a so right now Virginia Techs got to come out and get something going on offense theyre just not getting good shots right now and of course its a game of runs we thought that Virginia Tech was going to come out and the way they started this second half we thought they were going to put some separation between the two teams but give Georgia Tech a lot of credit with the way they responded now picking up four Court adding some pressure jackets have lost four straight five of their last eight Virginia Tech won two of their last three three of their last five I love what dam star is doing switching up his defenses not allowing the hokes to have any type of comfort level on the offensive end and look at it right now youre already down to 10 seconds havent even gotten organized on offense Hammond heres lewow potit with three Johnson got to get rid of it Hammond guns at the horn and a front rim Miss and Johnson gives the hokes another crack at it a great defensive possession that you did not finish with the defensive board shoot one of the quick catch here goes Hammond on the drive all the way through Johnson again digging in on the drive and hes going to draw the foul I believe Dongo it is on by Dongo its his second well damire knows that he did everything right they switched the defense perfectly his guys did a great job for us a tough shot at the end of the shot clock but then you give up the offensive rebound he looked a little bit like coach beim with that reaction right there WD he was pretty calm he was a little bit calm he was a little calm its because he doesnt have one a Blazer thats exactly what see the qu the reason the quarter zip is much more difficult to take off WD and you got this Blaze on heeling out this easy move easy move Tyler Johnson to free throw youre not wearing the lion Blazer tonight Ive noticed by the way join us last year this is my dresser this the one youre really serious about Johnson hits the free throws my goodness Tyler Johnsons got a dozen here now Cory and stepping up as coach talked about not only his ability to be able to score but hes the guy thats going out look guarding Duncan pal trying to make things difficult on pal he gets close here mikee young playing defense here too for the hokes I want to see coach beam getting his no chance not like that oh here goes ma oh what a stop and it bounced out on the jump shot you got to make that make it a million dollar move 10 cent shot you got to get that one to go not to make it heres Hammond knifing through traffic in the scoop and it rolled out for him and last Touch by the jackets well the landscape of where these two teams are this one is it might not be pretty at times but you cannot question the effort tonight guys either School big effort and not only the big effort is showing the level of importance of this game in our open we talked about there are three teams that dont make the ACC tournament were not talking about the NCAA tournament so everyone wants to be in Charlotte but there are three that will miss out how about that Stripped Away by the jackets McCollum through traffic he lost it lwow with Johnson and Tyler Johnson will lay it in he made the right play I just wanted to see Lo go to the top of the back world again you cant make those turnovers trying to go in traffic there you dont need to go there and you give up a bucket 14 for Johnson he had 11 and a dozen rebounds at Cal and a reach in foul on the hokes thats going to be on Music Johnson you see the turnover coach was talking about Toby Lew gives it up looking to get it back but Johnson does the right thing recognizing that theyre looking for the lob takes the easy layup and makes it a twopoint game and one and one now because thats the seventh foul on Virginia Tech look at coach young and Matt Potter hes hugging him but hes not hugging him like I really like you its not that coach did you ever no no no dont even ask throw official during the game dont ask yeah dont ask that question Im not going to lie threepoint lead for George attack thats why I asked it because I knew you wouldnt lie its like youre not hugging the referees in the media theyre not your friends now the media thing I can really believe 100 the referees I thought there might have been a chance the media no shot which makes all of this even more the more remarkable now hes the media exactly there you go Im just talking Im not the medium here goes Hammond Runner rattled out again and the rebound pulled away by but more importantly finishing the defensive possession for the ramlin wck and giving themselves the opportunity to build on the lead skipped all the way across heres George inside catch Dono and it fell out oh good everything good and the miss the l fourpoint lead for the jackets coming up on nine to go tonight in Midtown Jaden shoot thats an offensive foul and its going to be on Tyler Johnson Off the Ball so a fourpoint lead the turnover by Virginia Tech on The Possession heres a look at the bottom nine and Cory to your point three team the bottom three in the ACC are going to miss the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament at Spectrum Center in Charlotte so thats where the stakes are because nobody wants to miss the tournament its a coach killer a player killer when you dont make that tournament somehow they have to find a way that everybody goes whatever it is whatever you have to do cuz when youre left out of the tournament its just too big too big of a punishment yeah coach Ive already got an option play four games on Tuesday four games on Wednesday I mean again it it works perfectly its no you just dont have the 89 game the eight you know plays in the quarterfinals yeah its easy but man they sometimes things are too complicated too simple heres Sutton in traffic and scores and thats Powell tying his career Hot Correct W yep 21 now for Powell seventh career game of 20 or more including two in a row now he had 21 on New Years Eve against Notre Dame and hes got 21 tonight at 20 Saturday against the the seminal and hes back at it again tonight Georgia Tech may need them all and then some wesler threw it away lead pass McCollum the catch and the layup Georgia Techs defense they just turned up their defense but coach on that possession they double team wesler wesler not much of a threat but do you often double team just to get a turnover get a guy to make it give it up if you get a guy thats not a good ball handler and make a bad pass but its unusual six nothing run by the jackets and another foul I think this is on wesler for the block offensively yep dun offensive foul Duncan pal getting it going scan the QR code on the screen now theyre trying their very best to help folks affected by the California wild fires and weve all seen the video and it is just heartbreaking what has happened to those folks as we roll into 2025 in Southern California I cant even describe it its unbelievable long visit with Andy infield last week in Miami of course he was at Southern California for better than a decade and just talking about kind of the area itself and the way the communities have to support one another and how many different communities we all know Southern California is chopped up into so many different municipalities but to to see the damage after there has just been stacked coach ban mentioned a a name and a gentleman that of course is so dearly beloved in the game of basketball in Sunny B Caro last week as we see James forest and I were both under Sunnys care when we were in high school and sunny who the course lived in the Pacific Palace for so long just moved he just moved and hes coming out with a book in February wow early February and I think its uh something something in Souls I think but itll be an interesting book yeah how about Toby lewow huh yeah knocks down another three we saw him knock down one in the first half and just like that gets Virginia Tech back within Striking Distance but back to Sunny M Carol coach I was supposed to actually call him and talk about the book my last trip down to North Carolina to meet you but you distracted me somehow or another and I didnt get a chance to call Great okay thats where were going to leave that seven to shoot fivepoint lead for Georgia Tech Nate Georgia deep three itll Rim off and malel Pos been pretty quiet tonight by the way guys and theyve done a good job double teaming him making it hard for him down low averages almost 11 had eight in the first half scoreless here in half two L wow a fire again this improv he didnt do this a year ago at BCU so you got to give a young man a lot of credit but put work but when the guy hits one you got to guard him the next time and they just didnt guard him that time hoki to within two Toby Lew doing a lot of the damage Suare theyll fall off of him from that distance yeah Im not sure whys in that corner he would be a be much more effective in the dunker spot down low and thats an offensive foul theyre going to call the foul at the Block on Dongo for the shove and weve seen a lot of energy from the Virginia Tech bench which is right beside us but none more than getting the defensive stop picking up the offensive foul on Dango and again just a few few short plays ago they were looking to be out of the game and now theyre right back in the game possession the tie you see the left arm push off to be able to try to get position right there but gives the basketball back to the Hokies with the opportunity to tie or even take a lead 60 run and heres potit out of a double team right back to malija spinning Baseline kicks for Rex Steiner in the lead and the rebound pulled away by Dongo perfect possession ruined by a Miss inside five and a half to Applause go theres Suare they give him plenty of room now George lwow trying to defend he kicks it to Powell fouled on a three by Jaden young so Jaden young draws the foul his second that is 10 Cory on Virginia Tech with 512 to play and a momentum breaker because you have youre on a run you had opportunity to tie or take a lead on the last possession offensively got a great shot just didnt go down but then you foul a guy who has been the hottest player on the floor for for Georgia Tech throughout the night giving him an opportunity for three at the free throw line and of course to Eclipse his career high free throw is good for pal he started his career at North Carolina t then went to Sacramento State where a year ago he averaged a dozen points hes hit two quick ones here this guy done wait around on the free throw by the way the operation here is Swift and efficient yes it is no need hanging on to it make sure we get the shot up two of three y maybe should have took a little more time on that lead back to four spoke too soon perhaps took too much time career high for pal 23 tonight lewow another one in the holster no here goes George skips for pal catch and shoot too strong and the hokes recover the rebound as a great job by Jaden young getting a hand on the basketball couldnt get the rebound but tipped it to a teammate skip to the corner Jaden shoot a three hes got six both are triples here in half two love the attack by Rex Steiner to get to the Baseline Baseline Drive Baseline drift shoot getting into the right spot they able to knock down the three both these teams are playing hard theyre doing everything they can they know how important it is to win these games and get out of the basement area George out front 11 to shoot Nate attacks little pushup shot rolled out Dongo had it they scramble on the end line and Bill Covington that was touched by lewow out of bounds his foot was on the Baseline so itll stay with Georgia teack and still down on the floor is bongo but lewow actually reached his hand up until he realized it was mull to give he was like wait a minute youre not supposed to be the guy helping me up but you see the battle underneath going for the loose ball two of the better athletes not just in this game but also in the ACC a little mixed up down there but also taken the time to rest look at that the while recognizing that youre not my teammate dont help me up SP throw in and a new shot clock 20 to go George off the three side oh what a time to hit your second three remember when I was telling you who he worked with and then Coach beam said why is he passing we worked on the shot WD okay nice job letd to go coach no doubt fourpoint lead under four to go Rex Steiner quickly lewow hard drive in traffic head it stri three and 1 half to go hoki a 12 on the ACC Road Georgia Tech is two two in home games against the conference so far this year and happy to be back home and you can see the difference in their production on their home floor in comparison to the three straight games they lost out on the road three ball McCollum back rim Miss heres loow fourpoint game all the way through George tried to make the save could not thatll get us to the under four so coach take us through the triple shot of one or two plays and it goes the other way and it can go either way and both teams are doing everything they can to try to win this game they want to win this game because they dont want to be out of that playoff at the end of the year yeah what do you think CA I Im more impressed with the reverse fade that my man Duncan pow was rocking the 23 points for him career high tonight but the reverse fade haircut yeah again thats almost not even almost thats the real deal thats a shag WD thats the Shag we new this new addition used to rock back in the 80s I dont even know what that is they dont know that no they dont know about that coach a new edition I know you know about it I but I dont know what his haircut is and I cant compare it to anything Ive ever seen the wild Baseline had it blocked and and the jackets recovered big defensive play there now just take your time and get a good shot George working against Rex Steiner whos on the floor George heard you coach he was in attack mode but bring it back out run your offense make sure you get a quality look on this possession 12 to shoot for George ACH whos up four George on the drive left it short not a good look just didnt go down and you Ked a lot of clock that possession heres Brandon Reiner pull up at the foul line good Rex Steiners now got seven thats his third field goal 6462 just ahead of two minutes to go rexon is showing that hes comfortable off the bounce especially once he gets into the mid R yep its a big stop right here they need mum against shot tend to shoot now Kyle trying to help with the screen now the switch for Johnson there goes mcum into the lane now hes trapped and did he turn it over did turned over by George atch coach bam a lot of dribbling on the last two possession for Geor Tech right didnt really get a good shot either time now Rex Steiner back out near the timeline hoks going to wind and Doo with the Steel by will run the floor and stuff it down I tell you what you cant beat that effort we talked about by and Dango going for the play in the first half the effort only to be toght by that one to come up with a steal in the bucket Rex Steiner tries to take the Hoke back and dribbled it out of Mound thats a gamechanging gamewinning play he made over there with that steal with this time left in the game by Dongo getting out in the passing Lane but more importantly tipping it to himself on the other side of Rex Steiner and then the quickness the speed to be able to chase it down and a little Carmelo Anthony type flip it through dont bother with the rim get Alice is on your hand mess up your manicure just flip it through there real quick backourt pressure on George Poes may have to foul remember theyre already into the two shots on every common foul George midcourt now into the front to McCollum ahead of a minute to go just use the clock now play defense right use the whole clock now and then you get down into the 40 area and youre in really good position 7 to shoot for mallum maybe just going to have to take it and will on the drive against Hammond got the roll McCollum now with 13 Georgia Tech got four in double figures the lead is six hokes need a basket and quick here is shoot hell drive all the way through got block by suor big block and a backourt foul on shoot will send McCollum to the line Georgia Tech Georgia Tech just turned it over with their defense they turned this whole last two minutes over with their defense absolutely did it starts with Bango with the steel in the Finish McCullum with the bucket and then Sor coming up with a huge block and more importantly indongo finishing it with a defensive rebound and now an opportunity for Georgia check to make it a threepossession game with 31 seconds remaining all defense just turned it around on with their defense couple of free throws from McCollum the jackets are just 10 of 16 from the line here in the second half and the first one rattles around Georgia Tech wins this game theyre going to do it only hitting 13 in the second half its mostly been their defense and and and just their effort and if they make some free throws the game would have been over five minutes ago well WD think about it they SC 39 first half points so you look at with the only 32 half points but their def brands in womens basketball two of the best coaches in basketball period here in Atlanta Georgia Tech by 7 half minute to go and the hes the ball and they need points in a hurry here is Hammond trying to get it to Rex Steiner George out front time winding out of here they got to get a shot if they can and the jack its switching everything and finally Dongo whos made all the hustle plays for Georgia Tech comes up with another one and theres a foul on potit with 98 left to go you you cant say anything more about the effort of B Dongo we talked about him saving a loose ball from going out of bounds in the first half they did not get possession however that type of effort Dam star has to absolutely love that hes gotten for buy Dongo we all expected him to make a big jump offensively this year which we havent seen but it has not been a lack of effort on his part but Georgia Techs got two turnovers two a block shot two steals in five plays in the last two or three minutes I mean thats tremendous defense Javen mccollums got a dozen now in the half 15 in the ball game stto Myers team who now has a full week off by the way for Notre Dame visits here next Tuesday night and they need it when you consider everybody on the sideline in the boot youve got guys sick Five Guys out of their rotation right now that you give him a week an opportunity to get him back in the lineup 7162 heres Hammond all the way in on the layup the hokes by the way will host Clemson on Saturday at the castle in blackburg hows got to get it inbounds hell fire it for Dongo who will catch it with three seconds to go hell feed George and the jackets will dribble it out the final in Atlanta Georgia Tech 71 and Virginia Tech 64 coach
