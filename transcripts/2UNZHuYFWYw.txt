thats whats outstanding and this is Florida State team you know they dont have the numbers that theyve had in the past but they still have long quick guys they switch everything out on the perimeter and they can really be disruptive when theyre playing well and they played well in Pittsburgh Cameron Corin and Federico Federico get us started Roger airs with Matt Potter and Tony chiazza and away we go from the Tucker Center and the Knowles who fell by nine here Wednesday night to Syracuse and the sophomore warley will handle it first here back door live and Jalen Worley on the board nicely done by Caleb Bill nice screen but again Worley is a tall guy Wes he is and hes going up against Nellie Cummins Worley is 66 Cummins is six feet tall so thats a really good screen but they take advantage of a mismatch inside no change for Jeff capels team Cummings Elliott Burton Federico and there is Blake Henson pulling his way into the lane to tie it up and Bullock is exactly what he did West and he did it against Darren Green Jr green really hurt him on offense the last time maybe thats the way to stop him attack him when hes on the defensive end Florida State back to their normal lineup after making a change the other night and Leonard Hamilton going with his veteran unit a veteran in terms of starting experience on this particular campaign Cleveland against Elliott a little spot up and Federico pulls away the loose ball on the back side I think Elliott tipped that ball on the way up here is Burton hes the guy that flips the switch now for pick at both ends of the floor and heres that switch we were talking about theres an Elliott three oh and thats a great sign for Pitt when Elliott gets rolling yeah RJ bars the first year assistant for Florida State green trying to match with the triple heres Cummings and pit off and running trying to create a three on two Henson and well get a foul on Worley along the Baseline itll be the first on Florida State in the first of a sophomore from Mount Airy PA Jalen Worley RJ bars told us this morning when Elliott gets going it seems to lift everything Pitt does at the offensive end so the early three by Elliott and now heres Burton trying to throw another one on and thats well short and thats not the strongest part of Burtons game he can make a three West he shoots the percentage pretty well but he doesnt shoot very many of them Billows in traffic and finally it got batted around Applause and Pitt were in the steel city black I love these jerseys by the way they broke them out a couple of years ago and it honors the city of Pittsburgh well its uniforms after the heart of ninjas everywhere yeah that got blocked heres Florida State flipping the floor Worley whos got their only bucket going for another in Federico will draw the foul Federico Federico so that first is last and Wesson first and last hes made himself a pretty good player in this conference season a real force on the inside blocking shots he got called for the foul right there but people are starting to talk about him as we start thinking about end of the season awards is maybe being a member of the alldefensive team hes so good inside first of the free throws good for General orley Florida State 74 percent in conference play they were 1115 in the win at Pittsburgh a couple of weeks ago Jalen only played 15 minutes on Wednesday night in the loss to Syracuse had the three points came off the bench a decision made by Leonard Hamilton earlier that day Applause theres the nose with some pressure hes got all four Florida State points Applause see the double screen principle there Dan right now they just switched yep and what Pitt has to do to beat this is they got to move the ball effectively you cant just run the first thing attack off the screen heres Burton trying to beat Corin on the drive too strong Federico the collection in school and West thats one way you can take advantage of the switch Federico rolls to the basket but basically he follows Burton down the lane hes got a smaller guy matched up against him and so hes in position for an offensive rebound nice play about Federico bills Worley with some early initiative now Corey must step in off a shock Bank Cameron Corin the 610 freshman from Allen Texas who was scoreless the other night against Syracuse is on the board to draw the nulls to within a point theres a kick out three Cummings knocks down a triple and one of the things that youre through the Seminoles youve got to run the Panthers off the threepoint line in conference play West they score almost 40 percent of their points but beyond the off averaging 12 and a half threes a game theres a step back three by Mills and Henson rips it away and theyre shooting 43 from three and 12 and a half a game in the last four you win a lot of games like that and theyve won the last four Cummings tried for a second Mills the rebound we played four minutes here in Tallahassee and Pitt with an early fourpoint advantage Cleveland a little change of Direction and fouling jumper and a foul will be ticketed to Cameron Court so its his first its the second on Florida State and the Panthers have gotten a couple of early threes the second of the two from Nelly Cummings good leads by four in Tallahassee early Music needed what four straight since a nine or seven point loss to Florida State at home and you see some of the details of the ball game and you know what Florida States bench got 17 points stand and once again the starters played a maximum number of minutes seemingly for Leonard Hamilton whos usually been typically very liberal about his bench well we talked about the fact that Pitt shoots the three very well they only made Seven shot 25 and youre right about Leonard hes a guy that plays his bench a lot but those bench players for Florida Stadium 38 minutes of game action West they had 17 points and if you cant play your bench guys a lot at least when youre playing you get lots of production heres some backcourt pressure offered by the knolls out of the timeout into the first time for the first time today comes nahim McLeod and Baba Miller for Florida State and Nike savandi has also checked in for Pitt hes got the ball out here in the midport area with Nelly Cummings now Savannah is really an important player for the Panthers hell take McLeod on the drive had it picked by Mills turned over by the Packers Caleb Mills the Lefty scoop and a foul and its going to be on sebandi it will be his first well Wesson thats one thing that the pit Panthers cannot endure in this game and that is turnovers that lead to baskets for Florida state does the Florida State team that sometimes struggles on offense but not when they get the opportunity to get out and run Caleb Mills I dont know what that shot was but he almost made it it was the it was Im gonna get fouled Ill see if I can get three out of it and the 85 free throw shooter misses hes fifth best in the ACC and theres a look at Chandler Jackson 65 freshman from Memphis who averages about 12 minutes a ball game in conference play he had a great game yep played very well started the ball game Mills on the board with the free throws he had nine assists yep seven points nine assistant by the way just two turnovers against the orange Zone youve seen how the Morton that the Seminoles jumping out on these screens and switch it has really affected the Panthers offensive Rhythm and thats a fourpoint shot my goodness Blake Henson theyll only give him three seems like a bit of a short Change doesnt it from how far that was well the closest guy to him was Florida State assistant San Jones and hes sitting next to the scores table largest lead of the first half its six here for Pittsburgh Jackson bothered by a preseason thumb injury trying to get through on the Baseline here is green against Elliott with seven to shoot Darren Green a foul line and Federico pulls it away thats really good defense theres a skip for Elliott on the drive got caught in traffic and a hell ball well send it to Pitt Applause another look at the Henson deep three here I mean this is a situation where you want to run them off the threepoint line but good heavens look how far away he is that that hash mark out there Wess is what they call the 28th football yeah usually the referee stand there thats 28 from the Baseline right yes yeah well he was standing right around 28 feet like I said it feels like a short Change to just give him three and should have shot that one from 282 because that was too strong and the foul will be on McLeod on the loose ball with Federica the clouds first itll be the third on Florida State here well Federico is battling for the ball you can see very clearly there but Cloud reaches and grabs him by the offer so Bandy off a dribble and then turned over heres Cleveland open Florida picked up I think Matthew Cleveland might have left from just inside the ACC logo that was impressive yep but again this is the Florida State team they can guard you despite any struggles that theyve had this year they can really defend right side Elliott three boy Nice Shot fake Dan and Elliott knocks down a triple the key there West was the ball move to get the ball from side to side you get the Florida state Defenders reacting reacting to ball fakes in particular something get Ellie in a wide open shot and Elliot can shoot it now if he gets time and distance cloud and here is Miller playing in just his ninth game and theres a turnover so Bandy tries to move through the backcourt Henson back for Nike sabandi in an open three Federico tried to keep it alive in state Cleveland tucks it away for Florida State Applause Miller terrific ball handler for his size yes really is it can really very effectively theres Cleveland a kick for Darren Green he thought about it sure did he clutched alley was trying to stay right on top of him step back three cool Darren Green has got all the tools 783 for Green Third best threepoint shooter in the ACC coming in at 40 percent Wesson that was my bad defense either Elliott was about as close as you can be without following it Burton trying to size up McLeod leaves it for Henson one dribble up strong shot fake against Miller and Blake Hensons got seven Dan well the interesting thing is Burton hasnt scored yet well theyre really paying a lot of attention here when he gets into Lane there collapse on him and that has opened things up for some other guy heres green also to the right corner Miller sets his feet one dribble and too strong foreign by the way but you want to throw the ball of the guys in the white shirts six point lead and Burtons three see again Burton is not a high percentage threepoint shooter and I think Burton shooting that so early in the shot clock its not a good play Applause Music Applause leave a little long wandering dribble to set up a drive and a foul coming on a Matt Potter whistle here and the foul will be on Elliott itll be his first its the third Ill hit but the Matthew Cleveland dunk oh he left right in front of the middle C what a dunk by Cleveland Pittsburgh by six however in Tallahassee in the conference lead the conference in three point percent threepointers made and jamaris Burton has been at the center as the defense shifts toward him here they go again now that is now Florida state is chasing and so Bert creates three of those threepoint opportunities theyve made four three point threepointers have the Panthers and you can see theyre the top threepoint shooting team in terms of average field goals made per game in the conference after being 14th a year ago four of their first eight today Music 51 of 109 in the fourgame win streak we talked about it coming in I mean averaging 12 and a half in the last four games I tell you what they seem to be getting a lot of mileage out of a shot fake too today well Wes the other thing is that we said they rely heavily on it theyve got 14 field goal attempts and eight of them are from Beyond The Arc Matthew Cleveland will go the line 67 sophomore from Atlanta the Sixth Man in the ACC a season ago gets his third point with and with all that being said with the Panthers shooting from three very effectively just a fivepoint game yep Cleveland second rebounded by Savannah Applause Music Applause Cardinal worker gets Chandler Jackson powerfully built freshman from Memphis is Jets by the way Guillermo Diaz Graham has checked into the ball game wearing number 25 for Pitt heres Cummings through the contacts on foul on Mills and I think that will be three free throws and it will for Nelly Cummings Caleb Mills first that is four now on the nose thats a pretty good play by Cummings right that Mills ran over there and instead of just going right around him he waited for Mills to get close their hump fake given then jumped right into it first ones good dont forget uh ACC Big 12 Monday night double header coming up starts at seven Eastern in Chapel Hill Miami and North Carolina Dan Schulman Corey Alexander Andrea Carter will be there for you at Smith Center and then number five Texas is in Lubbock and you know what happens in Lubbock Dan weird thanks well weird things the wind blows in Luke shot Big Friend for sure have it for you on ESPN Monday night starting at seven and always available for you on the ESPN app biggest lead of this first half is it eight nothings knocked all three down hes got six so thats not gonna count as a threepoint shots but it may as well right theres a nice beat corn a shot fake on Henson slides underneath and Cameron Corey its got his second field goal Tom house wearing 12 for Florida State on the floor as well for the first time in this last Exchange also young freshman from Dayton Ohio playing less than 10 minutes a game in conference heres Cummings for Cleveland handled it nicely to the challenge theres a skip for Henson three ball away Applause Cummings tries to offer the three so Bandy gives Pitt a third try skip for Cummings left wing Burton on the drive now 13 to shoot house nice recovery defensively for Florida State and he kept his feet didnt go for the fake Cummings trying to take house skip out heres hits and shot fake on Cleveland and the step in is good twopointer for Blake Henson of course they got a couple of extra opportunities there did the Panthers but that was great ball and players movement I dont care how good a defensive team you are if you got a Chase for that long its really difficult to convince your opponent from getting a good look back to an eightpoint advantage Mills on the drive the stupid score Caleb Mills first field goal and Mills West is the guy he can really get into the lane and he can score a lot of points really quickly Music Applause jamarius all the way through some Andy the catch and shoot three back for a Miss for Nike and heres Mills again in transition and thats what Mills likes to play and threw it in the back court Cleveland gonna let it roll all the way back there so Bandy gonna go and it will roll out of bounds and stay at that end of the floor it looked like sabandi could have run that ball down and had an opportunity for at least a oneonone with Cleveland borleys come back for I think the state has has Bobby Miller and if youre Cleveland yes West that would be an over and back violation but you got to run back and pick up that ball I dont know well heres the thing if Cleveland challenges it they might have the ball in the midcourt area as opposed to and theres a foul on Elliott contesting a long throw in from Cummings to Elliott and Greg Elliott is going to be the first Panther with two and thats his second foul thats a big foul Wes because he has started very well hes hit a couple of threes and now hes going to have to go to the bench for the last nine minutes of the half Nate Santos Checks In as you see Elliot clearly frustrated with the foul and the circumstance hes been dealt but you gotta credit that to the Florida State Defense I mean it made it hard to throw the ball in bounds Darren Green on the floor foreign Mills Worley and Bob Miller also back out there for Coach Hamilton Applause you know really trying to knock down Nellie Cummings now Mills on the drive hurry to shoot heres Corin hell have to launch and a back rim Miss Miller had a shot at it Santos grabbed his jersey Applause commits his first five on Pitt thats a tough matchup for Santos hes given up a few inches and hes got it blocked out but its a long rebound I got something for you tomorrow night Nana in Arizona thats past insurance too by the way that was a rebound Applause thank you so a new 20 for Florida State Music Bills just burrowing in Savannah foul didnt get it and then sabandi tried to give it away Roy recovered and draws the foul so Mandy thought he had help and cummings did not an unforter on pit so Bandy pays for it with his second foul so if youre looking at Pitts bench here two of their more prolific threepoint scores so Bandy and Elliott have two fouls each of the pitch six and here is Worley at the line to shoot a couple well Wes thats just a mental error right there you got to hang on to the ball but do you have somebody you can actually throw it to and Jayla misses the free throw Greg Elliott reports back Applause and Savannah will sit down Elliott the grad student transferred from Marquette from Detroit turn 24 in Lake James is good on the back end for them so now Elliott Elliott is back in the game Wes playing with the two fouls and hes been matched up defensively against Green Lets see how that works Cummings squaring up corn into the corner Elliott of three bounces away Miller the rebound a freshman from Mallorca in Spain Federico and Cameron gore thats pretty good match up here now foreign Federico the sophomore from Finland is third in the ACC and rejections and as Dan told you a candidate for all defensive team step aside fivepoint lead for the Panthers in tally well West and its interesting the way hes done it now this is a crazy long threepoint shot but hes only taken and made one three his other couple of baskets have come on the inside here he fakes the three and gets in and shoots the short jump shot the Panthers West have attempted 19 field goals 12 of them from three here you get a look at Henson the only place in the ACC with those numbers but I think the Panthers right at the moment they made those four threepoint baskets early theyve missed their last five threepoint attempts if you dont want to get so reliant on the three that you forget taking the ball into the lane and thats where the Panthers are very strong Jeff Capel who is looking for an early birthday present he will turn 48 tomorrow wow Music and his team is up five here with under eight to go Mills back on the floor to run the offense with Worley Darren Green Coran and of course Boba Miller spelling Matthew Cleveland another trying to post up inside against Burke from the logo green graze the front rim berting the rebound what a great block out by part yeah jamarius is scoreless and on the drive against Miller that got slapped off the glass score at Corin gives Burton his first field goal Burton is the guy who takes tough shots and hes a tough shot maker but I thought that was coming off Wes uh Corin I thought a little over on enthusiastic there that was going to be a Miss yep Applause there is no question hes emotional heartbeat of what they do though absolutely I dont want to do anything to help him get gold Mills with another stupid score hes got five again thats what Mills could do hes got a history of death pot and he can put 15 points up on you in a blink of an eye five point lead for Pitt under seven to go in this first half ball got deflected Away by Mills Burton got it Music oh hes left open another three for jamarius this time the Bell Rings his fifth point of the ball game on his 16th three of the year yeah Wes again he can make the threepoint shot but in conference play so far this year thats only his eighth through hes only a 28 shooter for that and what a three here today back to their largest lead of the ball game for Pitt Mills trying to drive on Cummings and will be a foul called and its on Burke and it will be his first seventh on Pitt with 618 to play in this first half and again Mills can really put pressure on you from an offensive perspective just driving it down into the lane there he got that past Federico who I think was surprised and never even jumped so we got a one and one for Caleb Mills average 13 points a year ago against the conference he has six here in this first half has averaged five assists in the last three games with just four turnovers thats 15 assists four turnovers in the last three ball games in addition to what hes doing with the ball in his hand saw nahim McLeod at 74 has come back so well see McLeod and Baba Miller and now Matthew Cleveland for Mills so Florida State really elevates here from a size perspective thats six minutes to go Burton against Worley at 66 lets get Federico to try and help with the stream right corner for coming in the Cleveland challenging step away three and we get a foul called now I think he came down on his ankle well Cummings did yeah I dont think thats a five oh boy Roger Ayers stopping when Nelly coming to get back Wes I dont think that was a good shot by Nelly Cummings he was very well defended and youre talking about Florida States size Cummings is only six feet tall Applause at that time it was Green at 65 he was right on top of it have to keep an eye on coming Applause Cleveland look quickly for McLeod theres green against Elliott number now Elliott playing with the two fouls soft jumper Jalen Worley overcoming seven for Worley in this first half Florida state two within four Applause its headed to eight on three separate occasions here in this first half cant crack any more than that Florida State battling back Cummings tried to go to Elliott did they make the save he did deflected away and heres green a deep three he was almost over here in our lap yes he was he could have gotten a little closer Wes he had plenty of opportunity in time hes out on I10 Applause heres Burton rerouting in traffic against Worley scores thats Warriors Burton a tough shot thats what Burke does best gets the ball into the lane and to be honest with you its very difficult against the length of Florida State on the inside the way Florida State plays its a tough matchup for Pitt Bob Miller the jump shot McLeod try for the tap got it back put it up slapped around Worley recovers got the roll Taylor Worleys run into a couple here hes got nine and weve got a stoppage of play as Nelly Cummings lost his left shoe Wes one of the problems that the Panthers have had in ACC play is that theyve given up theyve had some games where theyve given up a lot of offensive rebounds and this this is now Burton hes taken it in and he gets that stop and Worleys not too big for him he takes one more dribble West and then hes up against the seven footer McLeod so a really smart play by Burt several interesting matchups on the floor McLeod to Federico Cleveland Elliott and this one here so on the screen McLeod is now going to switch heres Cummings left open spins out on the three but again Federico runs down the rebound finds Hinson hes fouled on the drive and its going to be on I believe its on Darren Green itll be his first and the fifth on Florida State thats just really a nice job by Federico and green reaches in from the other side the foul was not on whirl it was on Green Applause Blake Hensons free throw rattles out hes got nine here in the first half and you see Guillermo Diaz Graham replacing Nellie Cummings clearly the long and the short of it for Jeff Capel and Henson is not a great freethrow shooter only about 63 percent in conference play second one good hes got double figures averaged almost 15 in his last five games hes had four double figure efforts he said five now in the last seven oh this is his first half Diaz Graham matching up against Cleveland yep theres a short jumper Jalen Worleys feeling at the first half Dandys now got 11 hes Florida States leading scorer hes playing with a lot of confidence and that is almost a shot put up there yeah held out of the lineup the other night from Leonard Hamilton for some disciplinary issues and hes responded here today in a start again Elliott fires away when again West its been a while since theyve made a three hits and turns and scores but thats where theyre getting some help from Hinson he has been a power inside the threepoint line hes got a dozen the lead back to five with 319 to play Cleveland Works around tries to take t as Graham into traffic now a kick out three quarterly failing it Jalen Worley now with 14 in this first half and Florida State to within two Applause Burton heres Henson down the lane blocked from behind and a foul pole Roger Ayers hits the whistle and the foul I believe is on Cleveland thatll get us to a break 247 to go in this first half Blake Henson leading pit but just a narrow margin on Florida State in the ACC Music urate but the Florida state story is the fourth double figure game in conference play for the sophomore Jalen Worley Dan Weston he has made all of his field goal attempts five for five across the field and hes in his only threepoint attempt only shot hes missed is a free throw today and hes turned in a really nice defensive effort against Nelly Cummings thats 17 points at the at Notre Dame earlier this year had 14 against Louisville hes had 11 also so a double figure first half here and with all his ball handling responsibilities Wes he doesnt have any turnovers in this game so Blake Henson will be at the line after the foul on nahim McLeod was his second as we went to the break with 247 to go its been as big as eight on three occasions for Pitt Pinson at the line and by the way he is the star for Jeff capels team hes got now 13 here in this first half to leave Pittsburgh the Panthers started out really hot from threepoint range but theyve made only one of their last Nine West and again theyre not going to stop shooting them they rely heavily on the three but if that three is not going Florida state has done a nice job taking advantage of that Cleveland in traffic against Diaz Graham and Federico against Cleveland I hope that the size bottles after complete there is green into a double team Roger air is almost banged our table into us turned over on the process by Florida State hit with a nice use of the half court trap there well theyre trying to bounce it off a pit player instead threw it Burton a tough shot missed the place its a bounce it off though Papa Miller one dribble to pick up Cleveland Music and thatll be the first on the transfer from Colgate from Midland PA which is what a Pittsburgh suburb well thats a little bit removed from Pittsburgh but yeah its in the Greater Pittsburgh areas thats how we describe it all right I gotta ask I mean you wouldnt put Evan wood right have it worse right corn ER to you on all Western PA for an 81 at the line first trip Cummings is an interesting guy too because hes one of these guys that transferred into the program but he was a little bit more of a known commodity yes yes than uh because he was in the recruiting scope of Jeff cable early Music here is Cameron Cora whose dad was a member of Georgias 83 final four team at Albuquerque dance Applause prior to going to Jordan and all the delightful men in our industry absolutely here is Diaz Graham tough shot rebounded Federico put it right back up and it fell off the back iron Florida State can tie in the final 90 seconds Worley a scoop pour it inside bounces out to Jalen thats a new 20 that is great Hustle by corn to get down there and get that rebound and give Florida State another chance Cleveland for Worley 70 seconds to play in this first half green has had a quiet opening 20 he put it on the deckhand out of there itll be a hell ball and itll go to Florida state with three on the shot clock and Leonard Hamilton I think might want to burn a timeout here and Coach Hamilton is going to take the time out they use it or lose it with 102 to go in the opening half Richard and business on your own make it easier on yourself with Shopify you have everything you need to sell online and in person you can have your inventory payments and customers in sync across all places you sell it doesnt have to be Lonely at the Top join the millions defining success on their own terms start your journey with a free trial today Music so a twopoint lead for Pitt and Leonard Hamiltons user to lose it timeout his team three seconds to shoot 102 to go in this first half out of all the things that have kind of occurred here at both ends of the floor goals again as they did the other night against Syracuse right in the thick of it theyre doing a great job scrapping in this game and if youre pit you got better make sure you find green theyre going to try to run him off the screen and get a three as soon as we get the guy off the floor Ill tell you what we had a guy it was like a third and one play at the top of the circle heres Worley hes got to find the entry point here and it is Cleveland a three and its a two and its short ball got deflected gets the long rebound and a third try on this end of the floor now for Florida State thats now six offensive rebounds for Florida State but they throw it away yep and all the 74 year old native of Gastonia North Carolina could do is look at the other end High into the ceiling and go come on good Bert against Corinth hard drives jamarius in traffic and Federico is fouled by Corinth so Cameron Corin his second thats the seventh on Florida State and what the Florida State Defense has been able to do West is to force the Panthers into some tough tough shots and that was another one Federico did a nice job getting the rebound but thats a tough shot two shots for Federico transfer from Northern Oklahoma College and thats the first of two unless he hadnt been to the line much in conference play dont forget coming up at two Eastern over on ESPN Brandon Miller in number three Alabama and Auburn Dan Schulman Jay Villas are there and then Virginia and Duke from the jpj at four oclock all on ESPN streaming live on the ESPN app how about Federico a 54 free throw shooter and just Smooths two of them home man yeah that didnt look like a 54 free throw shooter now conference play Wes he is now six of nine wow so again he doesnt get to the line that much and to be perfectly honest the way the Panthers play they dont throw him the ball much they dont try to post him up they dont really run plays for him so most of what he gets is just hustling tipins Dan this is one of the were looking at Federico but you could say this about the collective Bunch Jeff capels got this is one of the really good stories in the ACC it may be one of the better stories in college basketball about the patience to build this program back well theres any question about it when he took over you know you cant say the pit program was down you had to dig down right to try to find where it was that he has done a marvelous job think of it like this today Jeff Capel tries to win his sixth Rope game in the ACC this year hes only got 10 hes already won half his total on the road this year and rebuilding the panther Fortune the pit comes out with pressure to get him to run some time off the clock now Worley with Cummings waiting Eight Second differential as we wrap up this first half in Tallahassee well hes been really good getting into the lane and using his six inch height advantage against Cummins six to shoot Applause that was Cloud to help now heres green with Henson following now over Federico off the back rim scooped up Worley with five hell skip it back for green another one no hits of the rebound and that will end the first half in Tallahassee Applause it got hot to start from behind the line Dan and theyve just kind of locked it down and was willing to get dirty in the rest of the 20s well Wes really impressive by Florida State their defense kept him in it and they made some shots well Pittsburgh rides Blake Henson from a scoring perspective Florida State Jalen Worleys their scoring star but its the Panthers trying to win it green got a hand on it knocked it over the inline out of bounds it will stay with Pitt and thats a nice job by Pitt to try to take advantage of the fact that Federicos got a size mismatch in there with all the switching that Florida state does Burton against Mills into the corner Hensons three Federico the offensive rebound back up against Corin cant finish they knock it around Federicos got another chance at it Burton spinning on Mills into traffic and scores nine for Burton and its very quiet nine at that band push the lead to six it is a quiet night but what an effort by Federico West yep so youd like it to be strong enough to finish that first basket but he really held his own and was able to get the ball to Burton who makes another tough shot Jeff Capel talked a lot about the intangibles of Federicos first year in Pitt theres Matthew Cleveland dialing in his 19th three of the Year gives him six and Florida state cuts it right back to three and again with Matthew Cleveland was not a good threepoint shooter last year Burton to Federico for the easy dump six for Federico Federico right again theyre taking advantage of that switching the screens of course not much of a switch there nobody cared in Federico the big fella helped out a little bit almost calls Worley to lose the handle Applause its a fivepoint game Worley takes off Baseline and one hell draw the foul on Cummings Dan you mentioned that matchup a lot in the first half and that time the sophomore wins it but again hes got a six inch height Advantage West and he has played so intelligently today he hasnt tried to force anything but he has been dominant when hes been able to get close to the basket because theres nothing Cummings can do chance to tie his career high here from midJanuary at Notre Dame he does four of five at the line of Worley Leonard Hamilton talks in the preseason about his need to be more consistent so hes got five got four single figure games in the last five coming in hes answered with a double figure performance here today and tied his careerhigh with 17 Applause three ball Elliott answers at the other end through the Panthers all three of Greg Elliotts baskets are from behind the line here today Music fivepoint advantage Florida State helped a little bit too much that time you dont need to help McLeod against Cummins close to the basket poorly on the drive kick out for Cleveland breaks down on Henson heres McLeod in traffic hit it up under the basket and finally pits out of there with it and he was surrounded Music Jensen a kick out three from the right nobody home underneath easy rebound for Mills Applause Caleb Mills another drop into traffic and McLeod will follow on the dump first points for the junior nahim McLeod thats a bit uh excuse me Federico is really having to help out and that creates opportunities Burton fouled on the drive Applause and it is on nahim McLeod thats his third its the first on Florida State itll send jamarius Burton to the line for a couple but down on the other end if Federico left McLeod to help out Federico blocked the shot but McLeod lays it in that time jamarius Burke just did a great job pushing the ball up to court so here is Big Shot Burton if you will free throw good for the fourth best freethrow shooter in the ACC now 10 in the game for Burton sabandi limited to a uh seven minute first half unless he picked up those two fouls but I think maybe part of picking up the fouls was you know he missed his first two shots and then I thought he hung his head a little bit which is a surprise because hes a veteran guy you know these are veteran guys you know if you miss a shot just keep playing four point games Applause Cleveland center of the floor Mills green and fouled by Henson and Blake Henson will get his first second team foul on the Panthers Darren Green Jr has but a single three to his credit plays one for six from out there West but the Panthers have done a great job contesting everything that hes trying to do theres Elliott trying to find him Green from a cloud put it up in traffic and a foul will be ticketed and thats on Federico itll be his second third on Pitt two Big Fellas 611 Federico Federico and the 74 McLeod here Federico again Wes he goes to help out and then he has a hard time getting back to his own man in time Hinson was trying to help out but Macau just too big McLeods free throw is good that makes him 12 of 28 at the line this year average 12 minutes a game a season to go playing at about a 13minute clip in ACC play this year and how about that Nadines got all four of his points here and Florida states to within two behind his efforts Burton trying to elude a double team with a quick dribble I thought we really had a chance to set a double team and just didnt do it now its going to be Mills off the ball against Federico mert dribbled the ball right to us West and he was looking right at us and if Worley props him there Burtons in trouble because hes got his back to the court long inbounds for Elliott look at this sets three balls spins out heres green pitching ahead from a cloud and off his fingertips and recovered Cervantes look at how big your guy is thats a long way to make that kind of pass Henson tap follow wouldnt go whirly the rebound Panthers have had a couple of chances West yep been on the doorstep as we played four minutes of the second half Worley forced it up rebounded Federico and Elliott I think lost his shoe in the backcourt hes the second Panther to lose his shoe today Cummings lost a food as well didnt it heres Elliott catching shoot three front rim Miss hits two of their last 17 from behind the line Mills for Florida State and it spins out still a twopoint Panther lead they just go back and forth off the misses here dont they theyre letting Florida State hang around West and theres an offensive foul and remember when you got guys like Caleb Mills and green and Matthew Cleveland who can score in punches its very dangerous to leave a team around like that the pit Panthers West theyre theyre hanging in there its Federico whos playing very well right at the moment for Pitt but its just a twopoint lead weve seen this app order sandwiches that did such a great job mentoring young coaches yep and of course big Jeff or Jeff the second as hes known was really inspired by the likes of John McClendon and others in that state dunk off the Baseline we got ourselves a top 45 all Burton for Henson and Pittsburgh continuing to struggle behind the line and a foul on the deck after the dunk by Darren Green was just his second field goal of the game well Wes and again the pit Panthers in conference plays scored 39 percent of their points from behind the line and so if theyre going to struggle from three that means theyre going to struggle offensively foul was on green they try to get it to Diaz Graham they got knocked around Guillermo got it back and then its turned over Jackson running the break and hell wheel it back out Applause see if Florida State can take the lead out of the corner Jackson a three rebound for Bert Chandler Jacksons just seven of 18 from behind the line this year when he kept that one loose its been a while since the Panthers have scored Applause two and a half minutes in fact Applause Henson on the drive draws the foul and its on Chandler Jackson itll be the fourth of the Knowles if youre gonna drive in there you better be strong with the basketball and Hinson was that time Burton thought about it and the traffic beats Diaz Graham and he will score on the stick back his own Miss and then recovered for the basket Guillermos first points well you like his skill West but he just needs to get stronger he very nearly missed out theres Cleveland inside the catch and score Corin has tied the game Cameron corin will have a chance to put Florida State in front after the Guillermo Diaz Graham foul well this is really good scrap by Jackson and then Cleveland what a nice job finding his teammate under the basket corens got eight he had 16 points in their win at Louisville and the freshmans free throw is good hes three for three at the line hes got nine first time Florida States LED since it was two to nothing whats their defense has been the key Applause Cummings Diaz the catch up strong and scores backtoback buckets for the Freshman from the Canary Islands and thats a nice job taking advantage of that size mismatch that the switch creates green against Burton Applause Jackson back for Cora in the layup in a row now for Cameron Corin hes got 11 Florida State back in front again thats screen and roll and Diaz Graham just didnt handle it very well there is Cummings on the Drive Jackson did a good job defending for the nose that was a force Cummings again hes only six feet tall green a deep three a background missed that Cleveland runs down Cleveland and Hensons worth your money isnt it wow Henson has been really aggressive on the defensive end whether hes guarding Cleveland or somebody else theres Jackson spinning on Cummings and lost it out of bounds to pit so a turnover by The Freshman Chandler Jackson Wesson youre talking about a screen and roll Diaz Graham just goes too far you dont need to go jump out like that on the screen against Jackson and then sabandis too far in the corner cant get over to help but wouldnt have done any good anyways so bad hes a little guy hes nothing hes going to do against Corey Baba Miller the game McLeod into the lineup for Florida State Seminoles sure dude Burton over McLeod five for jamarius first as well for the Ball Game Chris its hard to describe how impressive that shot is over Music Mills with some Bandy there Diaz Graham trying to help and almost turned over by Mills they roll around finally Miller saves it yes weve had a lot of rolling around here Jackson left open again that three rolls out Pittsburgh a onepoint lead almost nine minutes gone second hand Burton has Jackson defending him gonna race against McLeod couldnt get all the way through a step back hes cool another big twopoint shot for jamarius Burton theres a lob from the cloud and he deflected it off his own hand out of bounds it will go to the Panthers when we continue but jamarius Burton the grad student from Charlotte has hit backtoback buckets to give Pitt a threepoint lead hey dark Rose drinkers its Duncan always ends up in number 11s hand fan well it really shouldnt Wes hes made all three of his field goal attempts in the second half and theyve been this midrange kind of thing that he does so successfully drives the defender back and green tries to switch out to him thats not an easy shot fairly well defended but this guy is a shot maker and this is what he has done in ACC play this year today you see at six to 12 and again hes made his last three field goals I think it also begs a little bit of a bigger question too here who said at the top I think hes almost a lock for all ACC Dan but is he in the player of the year conversation not a basketball left to be played West and hell help answer that question himself Diaz Graham follows the Miss bumper hes got six in the second half and thats you know he talked about how Pitt needs points off the bench were thinking but theyll take him from Diaz Graham too yep those are the only pinch points for the Panthers heres green launching a deep three that misses off the front rim and Burton the rebound but green hasnt really had opened threes West that was hotly contested part now fought against Cleveland skip for Henson three balls air ball is the result Hanson needed to put that one in his pocket it was a bad pass it took him too long to get set up yep Miller against Henson Leonard Hamilton wants a foul and theres a hand check on Henson thatll be his second that is six now on Pitt and another look at the handiwork of Guillermo Diaz Graham well Wes look hes following the ball and he has his eye on the ball the whole time nobodys looking at him to block out everybody was chasing Bert and he just did a nice job following the ball Cleveland tried to put it in play and it got deflected by Elliott on a bailout toward Greene but Burton was not only guarding the ball he was counting so hes got I mean hes multitasking hes helping the referee absolutely here is green as we get to the halfway point of the second frame Deonte Greene knocks down a three his second of the year right off the bench The Freshman from Asheville hes trying to recover from a torn ACL comes in and just right away writes his name down in the book thats thats very interesting he had not played the last two games heres Burton off the window Diaz Graham gave it a shot and saved it for Burton Elliott left open bottle well again Diaz gram is in the middle of that West because that was a tough shot by Burton maybe a bad shot by Burton but Diaz Graham kept it alive and so they get a three there is green to Deontay green no relation between the two fellows theres Deontay back to the basket and hes found the foul will be on Guillermo Diaz Graham my grandma you know hes going hes got himself in great position for a rebound right there but thats if you give Elliott that much time hes rarely going to miss Wes well the story of 610 freshman Deontay green he tore an ACL last January so really just over a year ago in the recruiting process he selected Florida State over Carolina Clemson Wake Forest in Tennessee he had six points in 12 minutes in their blowout loss in Raleigh to NC State and these are really his first meaningful minutes since for the Knowles and he got one of two at the line so hes got four points off Leonard Hamiltons bench outstanding Prospect but stand one of the walking wounded thats Afflicted this seminal team throughout the course of the year Applause is Burton and thatll be an offensive foul he hooked it on the dribble and he didnt need two West he was by him in fact Miller was falling down but when the officials see that hook thats going to be an offensive foul every time see hes by him and then he swips slips that arm around him and thats very clear to the officials and Roger Ayers Matt Potter Tony chiazza weve got an outstanding crew here today in Tallahassee three guys dont know what theyre doing fourpoint lead heres Miller with Henson defending the young freshman Obama trying to create some space Henson doing a good job heres green and thats an offensive foul he knocks down Blake Henson we have a smart game Blake Hensons played today how about that do you talk about smart how about that series we just saw Wes he moves his feet uses his body doesnt use his hands to prevent Miller from getting by him and then steps in and draws the charge Blakes got 14 points all of it in the first half but Dan Im thinking along the lines of the shot fakes we saw in the first half and now some good footwork defensively well hes played very well defensively West hes spent a lot of the game matched up against Matthew Cleveland whos been relatively quiet fourpoint lead for Pitt three weeks ago the goals came from 10 down to win in Pittsburgh so Bandy on the drive kick for Elliott to catch his shoes Elliott didnt get his feet set that time Wesley hop he hurried that one a little seller quickly front Court heres Cleveland trying to get back in rhythm long rebound Diaz Graham Elliott on the attack live and Guillermo couldnt finish just not strong enough to make that play yet Wes Cleveland under eight down four Music so you missed you missed two that you had to have Wes and now you have to get your defense to bail you out through the Panthers tend to shoot for Deontay green now Darren Green out of a double team and a foul and thats going to be on Blake Henson thatll be his third that is nine on pit with seven and a half to go in Tallahassee its a fourpoint lead for the Panthers thats where the dirt is and the details for Jeff Cagle well they have played themselves into great position according to our Joe lunardi that 52 record against quadmonth teams that is outstanding the problem for the Panthers is they already have one loss to Florida State this year and even though theyre in pretty solid situation right now Im not sure they can afford another one yep so you see the 177 mark trying to get to 11 League wins today and the free throw by Green off the Henson foul as we come back to live action here at the Tucker Center in Tallahassee six points now for Darren Green Jr as he scores now he gets 17 on uh Wednesday night played five threes and hell come out of the lineup theres Mills reports back Wesson this is pretty typical of a pit pass to play and they play close ones boy havent they some Andrew sets up at the top three is good boy thats a huge basket for Pitt and a huge basket for sebandi hes a guy who can make three or four in a row if he got if hes feeling it yep Worley picks up on the dribble back to a fivepoint advantage Mills trying to find a spot against Elliott now Baba Miller of three air ball recovered inside and scored by Cameron Corinth 13th for Corin his second double figure game in the last seven for Coach Hamilton when Pitt has really done a job on the you know on their own offensive board just Second Chance points as were talking about so Bandy suddenly feeling it Nike sabandi a couple of threes you and Ive been in the building when hes ripped off four in a row Wes hes made almost in fact I think now hes made 233s of his career here is Worley Baseline the scoop and score nicely done by the sophomore now hes got 19 in the ball game and thats a career high thats too easy Florida state with that offensive rebounding basket and that one thats too easy now corn switches off on Savannah step out three from the right bounces away Federico put it up Miller blocked it and last Touch by Florida state says Tony chiazza Applause so itll belong to pit on the Baseline here theres Federico inside again Wes again hes feeling hes made the last two knocks that one down missed the previous one hits in a three Applause and the rebound for Cleveland Applause Florida State Trails four Mills a three first triple of the day Applause today Florida State answers right back Burton looked at Federico Warren tried to wrap it up heres a give and go and Burton back to the basket for the score boy what a smart play by Burton theyre all over him and he just makes that pass and cuts to the basket thats old school isnt it yep sure is Mills Music it was a tough matchup for Henson Baseline on the drop threw it away tried to dig it out I think for Worley here is Savannah on Cleveland and scores how about Nike sabandi has now got eight off of capels bench and a fivepoint lead for the Panthers under five to go so well step aside at the Tucker Center Music so sweet so crispy well just steps away from Five Points tomorrow in Columbia Dan two oclock start Aaliyah Boston undefeated number one South Carolina Angel Reese undefeated number three LSU Courtney Lyle Carolyn Peck Holly row have coverage for you Super Bowl Sunday two Eastern on ESPN and always available on the app how much they didnt kill Mulkey by the way too if you need a little more how much fun is that two undefeated teams in mid February yep and what should be a terrific game on ESPN fivepoint contest here 316 percent of ACC games have been five or less with three overtime this year and we are five with under five to go Worley who had a great first half Applause and has a career high and there is a check on Henson thatll be his fourth theyve all been here in the second half Dan with 439 to go and relatively quickly in the second half weve talked about the aggressiveness with which Henson has been playing most of the game but maybe hes getting tired I dont know not quite as disciplined as hes been earlier Two Shots from Mills on the 10th foul Caleb Mills is 88 percent or 85 percent he is uh now four out of five with the make theres the fifth best freethrow shooter in the ACC thats what he does best is he drives the ball he attacks he gets in the lane we saw him make a three and he can make one of those but thats not the best part of his game and particularly with the Panthers and a little bit of foul trouble you can expect to see more Caleb Mills on the attack hit by three Mills has got a dozen expert Pauls got a move for pick yep so Mandy 12 to shoot trying to drive on Cleveland and uh what a impact Nike sebandi has had 10 points here in just the blink of an eye in the second half thats the kind of thing he can do best and thats why we said it really was a negative that he didnt score it the first half and a bounce pass that is thrown away and Henson with the Florida state turnover hell shoot a pass to Burke and now under four to go Applause do you like it was Samantha here I do against Corinth beats him on the dribble all the way in forced it up Federico trying to keep it alive thats the problem last year you get in there and draw all those guys you cant force it up you got to find the open man Mills caught it under the basket lines up a three and Federico the rebound well he just went and got that one Wes and might have traveled to Florida State bench erupted 319 to go heres Burton driving it on Corin and will draw the fact Applause the foul will be on the Freshman Corin his third it is but in the sixth on Florida State he gets us to the under four time out at the Tucker Center Applause School the Nike sebantis head for Pitt now he has been so valuable for Pitt Off the Bench we mentioned he didnt score in the first half but he really helped lift the Panthers he hit those backtoback threes and then hes been able to drive to the club to the bass the ball to the basket and convert as well so sabandi 10 points all in the second half remember he only played about seven minutes in the first half because of foul trouble well Weston keep this in mind hes got those 10 points in the second half Blake Henson who had 14 points in the first half has missed all seven of his shots in the second half hes over five from three and hasnt scored so sabandi and Diaz Graham coming off the bench with six points has those two guys have been extremely valuable for Pitt here in the second half 16 points for Burton who is at the line for a pair here Damarius knocks the first one down unless he was discussing with himself that he missed one earlier as he was as you mentioned that was only his fifth Miss earlier in conference play coming in shoots 92 percent in ACC this guy does not hide it very well no Im going with emotional standpoint you always know what hes thinking and the second one bounced away wait thats thats big I think in this at this stage of the game West you need every point you can get and thats a surprise that hes just two today especially one that changes possession three minutes to play Cleveland working on Henson with the four the turnaround rolled out so Bandy kept it alive and Henson finally grabs it Elliott took a spill thats really good defense with four fouls because Matthew Cleveland is the guy who hit the ball in the basket and put some pressure on Burton winding the clock down 15 to shoot into traffic heres Henson firing away and hitting like I said hadnt made a shot in the second half West thats what you call confidence hes old for seven in the second half oh for five from three but raises up that time and hits maybe the biggest shot of the game so far nine point game 7465 green thats a two and its good what a tough shot for death green Junior hes got now six and a half nine in the ball game and Florida State takes a timeout well step aside as well seven point lead for Pitt Music February hop on the left seven point game with Dan botter West Durham we welcome you to the Tucker Center in Tallahassee if youre looking ahead weve seen a terrific game today its been a bit of weird at times though the fish shots and empty possessions rolling around on the floor guys diving on top of them but now youre in a situation if youre the Panthers you got to get the ball in bounds thats the first thing that Elliott can run along the Baseline theres remember Florida States only got 16 fousts so their next will move quick fifth hit at the line for 11 meanwhile Pittsburghs already sent Florida State to the double bonus and hit so about a couple minutes ago did you expect Burton to dominate the ball tend to shoot and the traffic foul and thats the seventh on Florida State Music and lets see if they rule he was shooting or passing West I think its going to be 11 it is it is the foul is on Mills his third that is seven on Florida State with 156 to go well normally West you would say Burton is the guy if youre in Florida State you dont want to put him on the line but hes only two or four of the day see the details of his 17point afternoon and the free throw good 18 now for jamarius Burton you know Pitts gonna give him the ball here at the end of the game hes so big and strong its almost impossible to take it from it if hes going to make his free throws so that really puts the pressure on the Seminoles and made them both biggest lead of nine again under two to go heres green off a screen on the ball screen and misses the three Burton the rebound thats about the most open green has been today yep and here is Burton now with Mills I want to consider double teaming here just making us get off the ball make somebody else because hell just dribble the ten and go on the bass and hes going to the basket theres Federico to set the screen Burton tried to skip it to Elliott got deflected he still got it there and then Federico the rebound and hes fouled but that was a dangerous pass but Burke hes trying to throw that through long arms a bit lucky to keep that one four on Cameron Corinth and boy Federico has been really impressive West with his offensive rebounding in particular hes got what 13 rebounds in the game seven of them are offensive Applause season High had 14 against Sacred Heart and the free throw stroke pretty true Applause shots and rebounded the ball very effectively hes had a really solid game second one good Dan these guys stared it right in the face here today they sure did and didnt flinch Worley on the drive and the basket well West remember when Florida State took the lead it was jamarius Burton who took over and made three straight baskets to put the pit back up and then its its been close you know they made it close but Pitt never gave up that lead again followed Florida state will get us to the freethrow live on Cameron core and its his fifth so he will be disqualified with 13 points and 57 seconds to go in the game and thatll put Blake Henson to the freethrow line unless its hard to win on the road and here the Panthers are going to do it again yep theyre going to win for the sixth time on the road in the ACC and to give you an example Jeff capels going to have six ACC Road wins this year and 11 in five years and Dan their ability to close yes Wes is impressive well theyve got you know youve got Burton and Savannah showed you that he can help close heres Mills Applause and Mills will get the basket and Florida State will take the time out Applause by bills I know he talked about his ability to attack the basket but probably a little too late here Music so the timeout Florida state will have one to go and Pittsburgh will look ahead to Tuesday night in a single game with Boston College Dan who was beaten at home today and convincingly by NC State by 30 points 9262 the reason I bring that up is NC State Kevin Keats now have 10 wins Pittsburghs getting ready to go to 11 Clemson and North Carolina are starting at the top of the hour likewise the story for Virginia Tech and Notre Dame you still got Duke and Virginia later today and then tonight in the seven oclock hour Miami with 10 wins will host Louisville at the watsco center here is Henson driving missed it rebounded by green with 38 seconds left heres Cleveland to scoop he left it short so Bandy the rebound and a backcourt foul will be called on Mills and thatll be his fourth and thats 10 on Florida State now with 307 to go well Wes youve got to say that the Panthers really adjusted well after that first game Green Derrick Green had 24 points the first time and so theyve done they really were all over him yeah and Matthew Cleveland I think hes only got six points West and he scored in double figures the first time too so even though Florida state has scored 71 points the Panthers have been very aggressive defensively its a Bandy makes it a 10point these are his first free throws how about his second half shot at the floor but yep Applause just goes to show you right takes everybody but I think thats the key with this 15th well so it does take everybody and the shot by Bill foul is called Music you know and its it for pip for Pittsburgh West it tends to be different guys every time you know Nelly Cummings really didnt have a very good game today but Nellie Cummings they dont beat North Carolina without Nelly Cummings and so the Panthers have a lot of guys who can contribute and when theyre rolling everybodys contributing there you get a look at Nellie Cummings again at six feet tall the Florida state size I think bothered him but other guys stepped up for the Panthers today you know Elliott started out really well making threes hes got 12 points Henson had a very solid first half and maybe made the biggest shot of the game foul on green big three that really put the Panthers in the drivers seat after being cold for the most of the second half and Burton Burton did what bird does yeah I mean and thats the reason I think it was I think its appropriate to think about jamarius Burton as a Player of the Year candidate in the ACC Dan well its its very appropriate to talk about it Wes and I think that you know if uh the pit Panthers end up being the regular season Champion then that conversation has to be even more intense Elliotts first freethrow attempt of the day hes 90 thats just his fifth Miss of the year foreign is good seven and a half 13 in the game for Elliott Florida state will go to Clemson on Wednesday night remember they lost on that chase Hunter buzzer beater here three weeks ago roughly two weeks ago they foul on Pittsburgh I know I should say ball got knocked out of bounds so Federico blocked it again yeah well how about Federico hes had at least three block shots and now seven ACC games unless hes a factor yep and getting better seemingly by the day and Mills had it stripped out of bounds Music there is Federico Federico same blast is first born in Egypt grew up in Finland and has been a integral part of what its hit success is going to be theres Worley the dunk hes going to finish with a career high but Pittsburgh is going to win in Tallahassee for the fifth time in eight games at the Tucker Center Dan West was not easy but a very impressive closing performance by the pit Panthers 8375 is the final Pittsburgh moves to 113 and still tied to top of the ACC and 187 overall
